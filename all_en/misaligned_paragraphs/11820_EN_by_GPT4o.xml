    <p xml:id="regest1">He wants to precede his explanation of the Gospel of John with a simple and concise elucidation of the true justification of the Christian and the role of good works based on the testimonies of God's Word, because firstly, this is the main theme of the Gospel of John, secondly, because justification is extremely significant for the Christian faith, and thirdly, because in our times, many conflicting views circulate about this essentially simple and clear matter. The word "justify" can mean various things in the Holy Scripture, such as confessing that God alone is righteous, presenting oneself as righteous, or - which is significant in the context discussed here - acquitting an accused person and recognizing them as righteous; the word "justification" is derived from "justify," which means nothing other than the acquittal of an accused person by a judge and in this sense redemption, salvation, and restoration to life, which is why Paul interprets justification multiple times as redemption and remission of sins; justification is consequently the forgiveness of sins by God, the redemption from damnation, and the acceptance of the sinner into the grace of God. However, the question arises about the reason and nature of this divine justification: The reason for our justification, according to countless testimonies of Scripture, is Jesus Christ, his incarnation, and his death on the cross, with which he reconciled and redeemed guilty humanity with God; people partake in this justification through faith in and trust in Christ; discussions about the relationship between God's grace, Christ, and faith are subtle, the clear testimony of the apostles suffices, according to which we are justified by grace, through Christ, and through faith. Scripture also testifies that we are justified by faith and Christ alone and not because of our works, for faith grasps grace, and both are not human works but a gift from God. Faith does not rely on human works but on the merits of Christ and the divine promise of the election of people in Christ. Human works, on the other hand, can contribute nothing to justification: this applies initially to works of the law, but also to works of faith, which do not precede justification but follow it, as they can only be performed by those already justified; the irrelevance of works can also be concluded from the nature of justification, which calms the human conscience troubled by impending damnation, which good works in their imperfection cannot achieve. The righteousness of faith and works do not stand equally side by side, according to the statements of Paul: "By works of the law, no flesh will be justified before God" [Rom 3:30] and "All who believe will be justified" [Rom 3:22]. This conviction of justification by faith alone should not lead to a disregard for good works - about which much is indeed discussed in Scripture - rather, they hold an important position in Christian life, though not for justification, because there is no faith without works. Good works, in contrast to works of darkness, are performed by reborn people from the Spirit, through faith, and according to God's Word for the glory of God and the benefit of the neighbor; the author of these good works is God, who works all good in people; nevertheless, they are also our good works because God, on the one hand, uses people and, on the other hand, through faith, they become children of God and heirs of Christ; thus, faith and works are closely connected and correspond to the aspects of reconciliation and obedience in faith, so that one can almost speak of a twofold righteousness, a justifying and an obedient one; the position of works is also clear from a consideration of sanctification as a consequence of faith, which works daily in Christians, which is the aim of a large part of the apostles' exhortations, which opposed both the notion of works righteousness and a disregard for good works. Regarding the merits or reward of good works, which is often mentioned in Scripture - as with Paul: "Each will receive their reward according to their labor" [1 Cor 3:8] -, it should be noted that this supposedly deserved reward is nothing other than a gift from God. Works can only be good - as already mentioned - if they come from God through faith and consequently align with God's Word; when Jesus was asked about the true virtues, he referred to the law [Luke 10:26]; the Ten Commandments are a perfect summary of the good works, which Jesus himself summarizes in his Gospel with the commandment of love for God and neighbor [Matt 22:37-39]. Bullinger wants to be brief about the manner of his commentary on the Gospel of John, as he has already dealt with it in the introduction to his commentary on Matthew [HBBW XII, No. 1646]; he has carefully studied older and new commentaries and incorporated their insights at appropriate places, always striving to demonstrate the agreement of the [Reformed faith] with the old teachings and to illuminate the context of John's presentation, and in view of today's dogmatic disputes, he has endeavored to maintain a moderate tone; he divided his commentary, written in nine months, into ten books and prefaced each with an overview and a summary for the benefit of the reader. Dedication of the work to [Hans Rudolf] Lavater as thanks for his long-standing efforts for the true religion, which date back to the early beginnings of the Reformation under Zwingli; Lavater was able to form his own picture of the conditions in the Roman Church as an envoy in Rome [1524] and has since not been dissuaded from the true faith, which malicious accusations following the Second Kappel War could not change; he should continue for the benefit of the Kingdom of Christ.</p>

      <p>On the true justification of a Christian man, and also on the true and just nature of good works, addressed to the most honorable man, Mr. Hans Rudolf Lavater, senator and most faithful treasurer of the city of Zurich, a preface by Heinrich Bullinger to his commentaries on the Gospel according to John.</p>
      <p>I will speak in a simple and brief summary about the true justification of a Christian man and the true and just nature of good works; however, I will not speak about what men have disputed, but about what God, who cannot lie, has declared about these matters in His Word. I thought this topic was appropriate for this place because our writer, the Apostle and Evangelist John, almost entirely revolves around this subject, to which I believed much light would be added if I prefixed a brief summary of justification and good works from the entire Scripture; furthermore, because our faith and religion have nothing that is more damaging to ignore, nor more fruitful to know and understand, than the nature of justification and good works. For justification is the foundation and most stable basis of our life and salvation. Additionally, what is otherwise a simple and clear matter is today shrouded in various cloudy and contentious mists. For there are various opinions about justification. Some assert that believers are justified by faith alone in the Lord Jesus. Others denounce, condemn, and reject this opinion as heretical, daring to attribute justification to human works. Some divide justification equally between faith and works. You will find those who attribute the beginning of justification to faith and its completion to works, and I have not yet reviewed all opinions. Amidst these intellectual battles, consciences are severely afflicted and tempted.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to assert the truth of Christianity and to introduce this most divine Gospel of John on the justification of a Christian man and good works, I will weave a brief summary. I will not bring anything here that I will not show and approve with clear and illustrious testimonies of divine Scripture, indeed, I will confer nothing here but the clearer testimonies of Scripture on justification and good works, so that after a simple and unadorned arrangement and expression, nothing will be mine, nor will I acknowledge anything as my own. Indeed, it is fitting to act in this way in the greatest matters of our religion.</p>
      <p>Above all, it seems to us that the certain meaning of the word must be established. The term "justify" is used in various ways in the Scriptures. It means to give praise to God, to yield, to freely and openly confess that He alone is righteous, and we are sinners and unjust. Thus, in Luke 7: "And all the people who heard, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John" [Lk 7:29].</p>
      <p>It also means to defend oneself, to purge, and to present oneself as righteous, which in German we say "sich selbs schönen und für grächt dargeben". Thus, the Lord rebuking the Pharisees in Luke 17: "You are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts" [Lk 16(!), 15]. In our present case, however, to justify is a forensic term, taken from the forum, and it means to pronounce the accused as righteous, that is, to free from punishment and declare absolved.</p>
      <p>The sacred letters oppose this with what they call impiety, that is, to pronounce someone impious and liable to punishment, and thus to hand them over to punishment. We express both in our language as: "für guͦt und böß, für grächt oder ungrächt geben, ledig und straaffwirdig sprächen, erlösen oder pynigen". For in Deut. 25: "If there is a controversy between men, they shall go to judgment, that the judges may judge them, and they shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked." What else is this than if he had said: "They shall absolve and free the righteous, and condemn the wicked to punishment"? Isaiah in chapter 5 says a little more clearly: "Woe to those who justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from them" [Isa 5:23]. This is what he said: They do not pronounce the righteous to be righteous nor free them from the calumny of the unjust and oppressor, but having received a bribe, they allow the oppressors' lust. This pertains to that from Proverbs 17: "He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous, both are an abomination to the Lord" [Prov 17:15]. Also, from Matthew 12: "By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned" [Mt 12:37]. From the word "justify" is derived the term "justification", and the term itself is forensic in the Scriptures. Justification is the declaration of a judge pronouncing the accused to be righteous, that is, absolved or freed from the accusation and condemnation, and thus justification is redemption itself, assertion, and translation from death to life. Therefore, justification is called the absolution and remission of sins. And the righteous are those whose sins are forgiven and who are freed from death and made heirs of eternal life. Therefore, the Apostle Paul interprets justification in several places as redemption and remission of sins, connecting both so that one is inferred from the other. For in Acts 13: "Be it known to you, men and brethren, that through Jesus is preached to you the forgiveness of sins, and by Him everyone who believes is justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses" [Acts 13:38f]. The same in Romans 4 says: "David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works: 'Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered'" [Rom 4:6f] etc. See how he connects justification, blessedness, and the remission of sins. To this, Isaiah in chapter 53 says almost more clearly: "By His knowledge, My righteous servant will justify many, and He will bear their iniquities" [Isa 53:11]. For this last: "and He will bear their iniquities", explains the former: "by His knowledge, He will justify many", showing that justification is nothing other than the remission of sins. For by taking away iniquities, the Lord justifies; therefore, to justify and to bear sins or to absolve from sins or to remit sins fall into the same. Now, therefore, what remains but to say that justification is the absolution from sins and liberation from condemnation, redemption, I say, and remission of sins, and thus the adoption of the sinner into the grace of God and the inheritance of life?</p>
      <p>Therefore, when the question is about the true justification of man, it is undoubtedly asked what it is for which sinners are freed from the intended, and add, deserved death, or for what reason sins are remitted to us, or in what the world is reconciled to God. And in these, the entire knowledge of our justification consists, so that with the knowledge of the intercessor and redeemer and the manner of liberation, add also the reason by which it is applied to us, the justification of a Christian man is fully understood. I, lest anything obscure or doubtful remains in anyone's mind, will first present the manner of the intercessor and the quality of justification as if in a picture for all to contemplate, that is, that Christ Jesus is He for whom the Father is reconciled to us, not imputing our sins to us, but considering us righteous. For Christ took upon Himself our sins and expiated them by His innocent death and communicated His righteousness to us.</p>
      <p>Then I will show how we become partakers of that justification. For these two things are singularly to be considered in this matter: who interceded and liberated the condemned and how He liberated, hence, whom He liberated, that is, how we become partakers of liberation and righteousness and how liberation benefits us. First, I will speak of the first. Imagine, therefore, God, the most just judge of all, sitting on the tribunal. Before the judge stand all men, and they are gravely accused of impiety, perfidy, and all wickedness, and add, they are convicted, and therefore the sentence of condemnation is demanded. But men have nothing to say for themselves, and nothing remains now but that all together are taken to punishment and eternal death. However, in this extreme danger, a great hope shone for the most wretched human race, namely, the eternal Son of God Himself, who, to place Himself as a mediator between God and men and to free those condemned to death from destruction, was incarnated and made man, so that He might truly be afflicted, suffer, and die, take upon Himself our sins, abolish the death we deserved by His undeserved death, and wash us from sins with His blood, making us heirs of eternal life. With this paradigm, I think I have sufficiently clearly explained the manner of the intercessor and the quality of justification; I also think that no one does not understand that Christ is the intercessor, and that the incarnation and cross of the Lord Jesus are that for which we are justified.</p>
      <p>But here an unfair listener shouts at me and says: "The agreements should have been adhered to and the Scriptures produced, not paradigms or images. For you promised a sincere collation of the Scriptures, but now you distract the minds of the simple with your imaginations as if you have forgotten yourself." However, I am not ashamed to imitate the eloquence of the eternal majesty. For the sacred Scripture proposes such an imagination to us. For it presents God as a judge, from whose face the mountains melt, from whose face a devouring fire flashes, in whose sight the guilty does not become innocent. This pertains to that of David: "You are a God who does not delight in wickedness, nor will evil dwell with you. The foolish shall not stand in your sight; you hate all workers of iniquity. You shall destroy those who speak falsehood; the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man" [Ps 5:5-7]. David, mentioning accusation and accusers, says: "The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any who understood, who sought God. They have all turned aside, they have together become corrupt; there is none who does good, no, not one" [Ps 14 (Vulg. 13):2f; 53 (Vulg. 52):3f]. And this testimony of the prophet is repeated by Paul in Romans 3 [12]. The same prophet David, mentioning the judge, judgment, and condemnation, says at the same time: "Do not enter into judgment with your servant, for no one living is righteous before you" [Ps 143 (Vulg. 142):2]. Also: "If you, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?" [Ps 130 (Vulg. 129):3]. But also Job in chapter 9: "How can a man be righteous before God? If one wished to contend with Him, he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand. If I justify myself, my own mouth will condemn me; if I say I am perfect, it will also prove me perverse" [Job 9:1f, 20] etc. Thus far, therefore, I have brought nothing alien from the Scriptures in that my image.</p>
      <p>As for the intercessor and liberator, Jesus Christ, our Lord, and the manner of intercession or liberation, everything I have brought about Him is so manifestly and fully reported by Scripture that anyone who denies it seems never to have read the Scriptures. However, since the pivot of our justification revolves around what I have professed from the Scriptures, that Jesus Christ our Lord interceded and took upon Himself the sins of the condemned, paid for them in His body on the tree, and washed them with His blood, that is, justified or absolved and liberated those destined for death, and that God has received us into grace because of Him and acknowledges us as righteous because of Him, I will now confirm this by demonstrating it with strong and evident testimonies of Scripture. The first of the most holy witnesses, Isaiah in chapter 53, provides us with eightfold testimony.</p>
      <p>The first is: "He has borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows. He was wounded for our transgressions, and crushed for our iniquities" [Isa 53:4f]. This is as if he had said that because of our sins, we deserved stripes, wounds, and infirmities, but the Lord took all these upon Himself to relieve us of these troubles.</p>
      <p>The second: "The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes, we are healed" [Isa 53:5]. Behold, the punishment that was due to us was laid upon Him, and by His stripes, we are healed. The third: "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his own way; and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all" [Isa 53:6]. That is, while no mortal could be saved by his own righteousness, which was none, the Lord, having compassion on human misery, gave His own Son, who took upon Himself the sins of all, expiated them, and conferred His righteousness upon us. The fourth: "He was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of My people, He was stricken" [Isa 53:8]. The Lord was innocent; therefore, He suffered for our sins to take them away and expiate them. The fifth: "It pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief. When You make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days" [Isa 53:10]. He called it an offering for sin, a full expiation and propitiation for all sins. The sixth: "He shall bear their iniquities" [Isa 53:11]. From which, no doubt, the Baptist is believed to have borrowed his excellent saying: "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" [John 1:29].</p>
      <p>Indeed, St. Peter, from this place in Isaiah, said in his epistle: "He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree" [1 Pet 2:24]. The seventh agrees with the sixth: "He bore the sin of many, that is, of the whole multitude, namely, of all the faithful" [Isa 53:12]. And the eighth concludes the present matter: "And He made intercession for the transgressors" [Isa 53:12], that is, He placed Himself as a mediator between God and men, taking upon Himself our sins and satisfying divine justice for them, and conferring His righteousness upon us.</p>
      <p>The second witness, the chosen vessel Paul, most manifestly says in Romans 8: "Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies; who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us" [Rom 8:33f].</p>
      <p>You hear that we are justified by the intercession of the Lord Jesus. The same in 2 Corinthians 5: "God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them. For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him" [2 Cor 5:19, 21], namely, that the righteousness of God, just and true, might be communicated to us through Him, and we might all be accounted righteous before God. To this also agrees what he said in Romans 3: "Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith" [Rom 3:24f]. Also, that in Galatians 3: "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, our Lord" [Gal 3:13f].</p>
      <p>Let the third witness now come forth, John, the son of thunder and the beloved disciple of the Lord. He, in his epistle, says in clear words: "And the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin" [1 John 1:7]. And soon after: "If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, and He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world" [1 John 2:1f].</p>
      <p>But if every truth is established in the mouth of two or three witnesses, I think no one will deny further that Jesus Christ is our righteousness, that we are justified by the blood of Jesus Christ, that the death of the Lord Jesus is that for which sinners are freed from death, that for Christ's sake our sins are forgiven, and that in Christ our Lord we are reconciled to God the Father, who considers us unjust as righteous because of the righteousness of His Christ, which He Himself gives to us. To these evident testimonies is added that oracle from heaven, delivered from magnificent glory upon the Lord Jesus ascending from baptism, in these words: "This is My beloved Son, in whom My soul is well pleased" [Mt 3:17]. For Paul also says to the Colossians: "In the Son, it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell, and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven" [Col 1:19f].</p>
      <p>This agrees with what the same apostle said in the first chapter to the Ephesians: "The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace" [Eph 1:5-7] and so on. From all these, we gather that a Christian man is justified through Christ and reconciled to God the Father through Him, who washed us from our sins with His blood, delivered us from the power of the devil and darkness, restored life to us by His death, and made us co-heirs of eternal life. However, the Scripture does not contradict itself when it teaches that a Christian man is justified by the grace of God. For Christ is the gift of God and the fullness of all grace, as John says: "Of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace, for the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ, who is full of grace and truth" [John 1:16f].</p>
      <p>We have thus far spoken in general about the manner of justification, that is, about how the sentence of condemnation divinely pronounced upon the entire human race is impeded, and the condemned are liberated and reconciled to God through Christ.</p>
      <p>However, we have not yet spoken about how that righteousness of Christ becomes ours or how we become partakers of this redemption. For many understand that Christ is the intercessor, but because they do not believe that He is their intercessor with the Father, the virtue of intercession does not benefit them, so that it is clear that the manner of justification is not fully resolved by that kind of knowledge or awareness of the intercessor unless we also truly believe that Christ is our intercessor, and thus entirely ours, and that all His gifts or goods are ours. Therefore, we will now specifically address how the reconciliation or justification of Jesus Christ is applied to us and what it is that makes us partakers of the redemption or righteousness of Christ, so that the Lord Jesus is now not only dead but dead for us, that He has purged our sins with His blood and justified us, and so justified us that, being absolved from sins and liberated from condemnation, we are now certainly made heirs of all the goods of Christ, righteousness, and eternal life. Here we openly, candidly, and simply say that we become partakers of Christ by faith alone, that is, by trust in the Lord Jesus. Therefore, the prophets and apostles have expressly said that men are justified by faith or through faith, and likewise, that Christ justifies through faith. For these expressions mean the same thing, namely, that Christ communicates His righteousness to us, that is, remits our sins, liberates us from condemnation, and makes us partakers of eternal life, not because of our works or any merits of ours, but by grace and His own merit because of the faith by which we believe that we are pleasing to God the Father, not because of ourselves or our works, but because of Christ, whom the Father has given us as a pledge of grace and mercy, that we may live through His name. However, I do not want to be believed here unless I prove what I have proposed with the clearest testimonies of Scripture. I said that Christ justifies us through faith, that is, that the righteousness of Christ is communicated to us through faith. But this very thing the prophet Isaiah asserted in the clearest words, saying: "By His knowledge, My righteous servant (namely, the Lord Christ) will justify many" [Isa 53:11]. Behold, He says, My righteous servant will justify the church, and He will justify by His knowledge. It is clear that the knowledge of Him is the knowledge of Christ, indeed, faith; therefore, Isaiah's or rather God's doctrine is that Christ justifies His own by faith. Following Isaiah's example, Habakkuk said: "The just shall live by faith" [Hab 2:4], which Paul has used more than once, proving with that testimony, as the clearest, that believers are justified and made alive by faith. And John, in his Gospel, speaking of the Lord, says: "He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believed in His name" [John 1:11f]. Behold, what could be said more plainly? Those who receive Christ become children of God. But those who believe receive Christ; therefore, by faith, we become children of God, righteous, happy, and blessed. In the same John, our Lord Jesus Christ says: "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life" [John 5:24]. Again: "This is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day" [John 6:40]. Hence, the same apostle in his canonical epistle most manifestly says: "If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God which He has testified of His Son. He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself. He who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God has given of His Son. And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life" [1 John 5:9-12]. We see clearly that by faith we have the Son of God, and in the Son, indeed, righteousness, all good, and eternal life, from which it is necessary that we are justified by faith.</p>
      <p>Now, the Apostle Paul most clearly in Romans 3: "The righteousness of God is revealed, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all who believe" [Rom 3:21f]. And in chapter 10, he says: "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes" [Rom 10:4]. Finally, Paul and Silas, detained for the name of Christ in the Philippian prison, and to the jailer who asked: "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" they answered: "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household" [Acts 16:30f]. With these, I think we have shown clearly that we are justified by faith, that is, that the righteousness and merits of Christ are communicated to us through faith.</p>
      <p>However, I do not think that anyone even slightly accustomed to the Scriptures is offended by these forms of expression: "we are justified by the grace of God", "we are justified through Jesus Christ or by the merit of Christ", "we are justified by faith in the Lord Jesus", as if they were different or attributed justification to different things. For they are all of the same kind and ascribe the justification of man to the one merciful God, to whom the prophets and apostles have uniquely directed their minds, who, when they considered the source and origin of justification, said that men are justified by the grace of God. But when they considered the pledge of grace and Him by whom and by whose merit we are justified, they said that we are justified through Christ, and when they considered that by which we become partakers of grace and Christ, they said that we are justified by faith. Meanwhile, they were not concerned with how well their expressions agreed with the place of causes, as some very curious people dispute very acutely, whether faith is righteousness, or an instrument of participating in righteousness, whether it is a receptacle or a funnel of righteousness, or righteousness itself, etc. Thus, indeed, minds are exercised; but what do these things contribute to piety? The apostles, striving for simplicity, indiscriminately taught that God, the grace of God, Christ, and faith justify, and that we are justified by grace, through Christ, and by faith; following this simplicity in the present, I leave the subtleties to others to bring forth and discuss.</p>
      <p>Now, as we have added that we are justified by faith alone because of Christ and not because of our works, we have not taken this from ourselves, but have borrowed it from the very Scriptures themselves. For the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the Gospel of John, chapter 6: "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, you have no life in you" [John 6:54 (Vulg. 55)]. Behold, only the eating of the flesh of Christ gives life, and nothing else in the world gives life but the eating of the Lord's flesh. But what it is to eat the flesh of Christ, He soon explains in the same chapter and says: "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has everlasting life" [John 6:47]. Also: "He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst" [John 6:35]. Here He would have said: "He who drinks Me shall never thirst", but instead of "drink", He put "believe". Therefore, to eat and drink is nothing other than to believe. Therefore, unless we believe that the Son of God was delivered to death for us, we will never live; but we will live if we believe that, therefore faith gives life. This agrees with the Gospel and Paul to the Galatians, saying: "We know that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, and we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by faith in Christ" [Gal 2:16]. For when he says that a man cannot be justified except by faith in Christ, what else does he imply by this form of expression than that a man is justified by faith alone in Christ? For in Genesis, Joseph said to his brothers: "You shall not see my face unless your youngest brother is with you" [Gen 43:3]. And in Numbers, the murmuring people complain: "Our eyes see nothing else but manna" [Num 11:6]. In the same book, Balaam says: "Can I say anything else than what the Lord commands?" [Num 23:12].</p>
      <p>In Deuteronomy, Moses also says: "And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to love Him?" [Deut 10:12]. And Paul himself, using the same form of expression, says: "There is no authority except from God" [Rom 13:1]. Also: "No one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God" [1 Cor 2:11]. Again: "I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified" [1 Cor 2:2].</p>
      <p>These and similar expressions, which are infinite, mean nothing else in the Scriptures than if you say: This alone will open the way for you to return to me if you bring your youngest brother with you. Our eyes see only manna and nothing else. I can only speak what the Lord commands. This alone the Lord requires of you, to love Him. All authority is from God alone. Only the Spirit knows the things of God. I determined to know only Christ crucified. Since these things are so and no one can deny them, and it has been most manifestly said by Christ and Paul that no one is given life or justified except by faith, it is strange why today men of great name, who wish to appear most learned in letters, rage so much against us for saying that we are justified by faith alone. For Christ and Paul spoke first in this way; let them accuse those, if they think anything is wrong here. For it is childish what they object, that the word "alone" is not used by them. For that is as if a child thinks he is denied permission to leave by his teacher because when he asked: "Teacher, do you give me permission to leave?", he answered: "I do", and did not simply and vulgarly say: "yes". Both forms of expression produce one and the same meaning. Thus, whether you say: "We know that no one is justified except by faith" or "We know that a man is justified by faith alone", the expressions fall into the same and retain the same meaning. But I am pleased to bring forth other no less clear testimonies of Scripture, which most manifestly assert that a man is justified by faith, not by works, which is the same as if they testified that a man is justified by faith alone. In Romans 3, the apostle says: "Being justified freely by His grace" [Rom 3:24]. But is it truly free if it is done for a reward or work? Certainly, if we are justified by the grace of Christ, we are not justified by works. For in the eleventh chapter, the same apostle says: "And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace" [Rom 11:6]. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace. Therefore, we most wisely and truly confess and contend that a Christian man is justified by the benefit of faith alone, because faith itself relies on divine grace and attributes nothing to human strength, but everything to God, as we will soon say more copiously. In the same third chapter, the apostle, summing up the matter of justification, says: "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law" [Rom 3:28]. And in the fourth chapter, he most manifestly shows that righteousness is imputed to us from faith, not from works (not only understanding works of the law, but works of every kind), as he also says in Ephesians 2: "By grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them" [Eph 2:8-10]. "By grace", he says, "you have been saved", namely justified through faith. For faith apprehends grace. And lest anyone attribute anything here to human strength, he adds "and that not of yourselves". For neither grace nor faith is from us. What then? He adds "it is the gift of God", certainly that we are justified and that we believe. Indeed, he adds "not of works" and gives the reason "lest anyone should boast". For in Jeremiah 9, the Lord does not want anyone to boast in anything except in His mercy. Here follows another reason: "we are His workmanship" etc. Why then should clay exalt itself against the potter, from whom it has whatever it is and whatever it has?</p>
      <p>This place most manifestly attributes justification to faith, takes it away from works. But these things thus far about the fact that we are justified by faith alone through Christ.</p>
      <p>This will become even clearer and more fully known if I show that justifying faith believes that we are pleasing to the Lord not because of ourselves or our works, but because of Christ, that is, that faith does not rely on our works or merits, but on the divine promise and the merits of Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Paul, writing to the Romans, says that Christ our Lord was set forth by God as a reconciler to the world through faith in His blood, clearly teaching that faith relies on the blood, that is, the death, merit, and redemption of Christ.</p>
      <p>And treating this very argument somewhat more fully in the fourth chapter, he writes: "Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered up because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification" [Rom 4:23-25]. For he has delivered two things to us in these words. First, that faith is imputed to us for righteousness; second, that that faith relies on Christ the Lord, who died for us and was raised, that is, that the faithful believe themselves to be justified because they understand by faith that Christ died for them, to expiate their sins, and was raised to give life to the expiated. Indeed, in the tenth chapter of the same epistle, comparing or contrasting the righteousness of the law and the righteousness of faith, he clearly indicates that the righteousness of the law relies on works, but the Christian or righteousness of faith relies on Christ. For it pronounces thus: "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart" [Rom 10:8]. Then he adds: "This is the word of faith which we preach, that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the Scripture says, 'Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame'" [Rom 10:8-11]. Therefore, it is no wonder that the same apostle wrote to the Philippians that he considers all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Jesus Christ, indeed, counts them as rubbish, and desires to be found in Christ, not having his own righteousness from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, which he soon declares to consist in the true knowledge of the death and resurrection of Christ. I think that evident argumentation of the same apostle fits here: "If the inheritance is of the law, it is no longer of promise" [Gal 3:18]. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.</p>
      <p>But the word of promise is this: "In your seed all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed." "In your seed", I say, "He said, as in one constituting salvation, and not 'in seeds', as in many. But the inheritance and blessing would be constituted in many if it were given because of works. But now in one, and through one, we are all blessed. For as through one man's offense, evil or curse was propagated to all men to condemnation, so through one man's justification, good or blessing is propagated to all men to justification of life. Therefore, since blessing, righteousness, and redemption are attributed to Christ alone in the word of truth, and our faith rightly tends to Christ, the faithful understand that they are accepted by God because of Christ and not because of themselves or their works. For God 'predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself', as the word of truth expressly has it, 'according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved, through whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.' This pertains to that of the apostle in Romans 10: 'Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God' [Rom 10:17], which is the preaching of the Gospel about Christ. For the apostle adds that from the Psalm: 'Their sound has gone out to all the earth' [Rom 10:18] etc. With these most valid testimonies of Scripture, I have undoubtedly proven that justifying faith believes that we are reconciled and accepted by God not because of ourselves or our works, but because of Christ and His merits. For faith relies on the promised truth of God, on Christ the Lord Himself, not on any of our works, and therefore justification is attributed to faith because faith attributes all things of salvation and righteousness entirely to divine grace in Christ.</p>
      <p>I have demonstrated from the nature of justifying faith that faith alone justifies, and I will demonstrate that human works do not justify, and that from their nature.</p>
      <p>Therefore, all human works are either born of the nature of nature or are called works of the law or are works of faith and divine grace. However, what kind of works are those of human nature, that is, those done by the unregenerate, the Lord Himself explains in the Gospel and says: "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" [John 3:6].</p>
      <p>But the apostle pronounces further about the flesh and says: The mind of the flesh is death and enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. For we are all by nature children of wrath. But cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law. Therefore, the works of nature are so far from justifying that they rather condemn. Furthermore, concerning the works of the law, the chosen vessel Paul pronounced in these words: "We know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God; therefore, by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight" [Rom 3:19f]. And elsewhere the same: "I do not set aside the grace of God," he says, "for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain" [Gal 2:21]. And even more clearly: "If there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe" [Gal 3:21f]. The works of faith or grace remain, which are called good works and works of righteousness: These, they say, justify. However, if they are good and works of righteousness, they must be done by the good and righteous, from which it follows that works of righteousness follow, not precede justification. For they are done by the righteous or justified, therefore, since they follow, they do not make them righteous. But faith makes them righteous, the righteous do righteousness or works of righteousness. For it is written: "The just shall live by his faith" [Hab 2:4 and elsewhere]. And again: "He who practices righteousness is righteous" [1 John 3:7]. Therefore, faith is the foundation and very cause of righteousness and precedes the works of righteousness or faith and grace, it is not made by them. But if these do not yet satisfy, come, let us establish this consideration not according to things, but according to persons. Imagine, therefore, those who work to be either impious and hypocrites or pious and holy men of God. But I think no one will attribute justification to the works of the impious and hypocrites, since it is written: "The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord" [Prov 15:8]. And again: "The hypocrite leans on his house, and it will not stand; he will support it, and it will not rise. Nor will any hypocrite come into the presence of the Lord" [Job 8:15; 13:16]. Therefore, the pious and holy men of God remain. But since it is written: "You were washed, you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God" [1 Cor 6:11], they ascribe that sanctification to God and the divine Spirit, by whom they know they have been sanctified, so that they now do holy works. Moreover, they feel such weakness remains and acts in the sanctified flesh, that is, in themselves, throughout their lives, that they do not dare to ascribe righteousness even to the works done by faith in sanctification. And although I could produce many more most holy witnesses here, I will bring only two into the midst. And first, let the most faithful servant of God, Job, whom the divine word commended to us with these words: "There is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil" [Job 1:8]. But such a man, commended to us with such a great title of righteousness: "If I justify myself," he says, "my own mouth will condemn me; if I say I am perfect, it will also prove me perverse" [Job 9:20]. And again: "If I have acted wickedly, woe to me; if I have acted justly, I will not lift up my head" [Job 10:15]. It is clear, therefore, that the most holy and blameless man did not attribute justification to the fruits of his righteousness, but only hoped in the mercy of God. Let the second witness now come forth, the apostle Paul, who in clear words says: "I delight in the law of God according to the inward man, but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members" [Rom 7:23]. But the apostle speaks of himself and testifies concerning all the regenerate that remnants of the flesh remain in them, by whose nature and power throughout a man's life it happens that they do what they do not want, and therefore they never come to full perfection while they live in these lands and this flesh. Since these things are so, no one can see that the works of faith or the regenerate cannot or should not be ascribed justification, since what renders God propitious to us must be most pure and absolutely perfect. What, that the Scripture openly testifies that not even Abraham, the father of all believers, was justified by the works of faith? He lived before the law for four hundred and thirty years, believed God, and performed most holy works of faith, but he was not justified by those works of faith. Hence, we do not doubt to conclude that we are not justified by any works of faith. For Paul most manifestly argues thus: "If Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.' Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt. But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness" [Rom 4:2-5]. Now, what we conclude from Abraham's example, that we will be justified in the same way, we do not pronounce from our own judgment, but from the words of the same apostle, saying: "Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, but also for us, to whom it shall be imputed if we believe in Christ" [Rom 4:23f].</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as we have shown from the nature of faith and works that faith and not works justify, so we will prove this from the nature of justification. The proper work and genuine virtue of justification is to calm and render peaceful the conscience troubled and agitated by the remembrance of sins and condemnation.</p>
      <p>For Paul says: "Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" [Rom 5:1]. But the works of men can never console and pacify such afflicted consciences.</p>
      <p>For who has ever persuaded himself that he has satisfied the divine law with his works, is absolved from sins, and liberated from condemnation, is holy and immaculate?</p>
      <p>Especially since the wisest of mortals, Solomon, said: "Who can say, 'I have made my heart clean'? 'I am pure from my sin'?" [Prov 20:9].</p>
      <p>Since our works do not tranquilize the conscience, they do not justify anyone. But faith pacifies most perfectly, therefore faith justifies.</p>
      <p>For the Lord said in the Gospel: "Whoever drinks of this water" (meaning external and all mortal aids), "will thirst again. But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst, but the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life" [John 4:13f]. And again: "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst" [John 6:35]. Behold, faith, which rightly tends to the Lord Jesus, satisfies us. For it understands that Christ Himself is the cornucopia of heavenly goods and that He has entirely given Himself for us and made Himself ours in all things, so that now the afflicted conscience can rest in this.</p>
      <p>For there is nothing in Christ, the Son of God, full of grace and truth, of defect and weakness. But in the works of even the most holy men, weakness and imperfection are always found.</p>
      <p>Now, if we also consider the nature of Him whose judgment we are to be judged by and before whom we are to be justified, we will clearly see that we are justified not by works, but by faith. For that highest and most just judge regards the humble and contrite in heart. And He justifies these, but He turns away from and condemns those who exult and glory in their merits.</p>
      <p>For this pertains to the parable of the two in the Gospel who went up to the temple to pray, one of whom boasted of his good works and relied on them and presented himself as righteous; the other, however, entirely trusted in divine mercy, not at all in his merits, and cried: "God, be merciful to me, a sinner" [Luke 18:13]. For this one went down justified from the temple, but the other, wrapped in his sins, fell from his hope. Therefore, the Lord rightly advises in Jeremiah: "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor the mighty man in his might, nor the rich man in his riches, but let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the Lord, exercising lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness" [Jer 9:23f]. Obeying this divine counsel, the apostle cries: "But God forbid that I should glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world" [Gal 6:14]. For in the Gospel, the Lord also said: "When you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, 'We are unprofitable servants; we have done what was our duty to do'" [Luke 17:10]. Therefore, the pious praise divine grace, boast nothing of their merits, and trust in nothing but the mercy of God.</p>
      <p>Finally, if we compare the righteousness of faith and works with each other, we will easily understand that they are so different that they cannot stand together. For concerning the righteousness of works, the apostle pronounced: "By the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight" [Rom 3:20]. But concerning the righteousness of faith, the same: "But all who believe are justified." The same elsewhere says: "The righteousness of faith is imputed according to grace, but the righteousness of works is not imputed according to grace, but according to debt." Again, in Romans 9: "Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness, but the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have attained to righteousness, the righteousness of faith." And giving the reason for the former member, he immediately adds: "Why? Because they did not seek it by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone." It is clear, therefore, that one subverts the other, and thus we, who teach that men are justified by faith in the Lord Jesus, not by works, do not subvert the Christian faith, as our adversaries slander, but rather those who in every way diminish faith and contend that the church is absolved from sins, liberated from condemnation, and obtains the inheritance of eternal life by works and merits of men.</p>
      <p>In this discourse of mine about Christ the Lord justifying us by faith, not by works, or about faith justifying without works, I do not doubt that I have gravely offended many, perhaps thinking that I have no regard for good works or leave them no honorable place in the church. For if good works of man, they say, contribute nothing to preparing righteousness, there is indeed no use for them in the church. Therefore, the mention of good works in the sacred Scriptures is in vain. In vain do the apostles of Christ urge with the prophets that we prove our faith by good works and glorify the Father who is in heaven. Why does the divine apostle James contend that a man is justified and not by faith only? But if faith alone suffices to prepare salvation, what remains but that we eat and drink, and then say to the judge God: "I believed your Gospel, therefore save your servant!" Thus, all discipline, all piety, all pursuit of innocence and virtues will be abolished.</p>
      <p>However, those who complain in this way neither understand the power of faith nor the true nature of good works. Nor do we believe that faith is without good works, when we say with the apostle that faith justifies without works, but we confess that faith justifies by its own power, not by the aid of works. For Christ is sufficiently effective by Himself and by His own power to justify believers, nor does He need any supplement of our works. Nor is faith without good works. Nor are the works of Christians empty because they do not justify.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, they hold a most honorable place in the church. And when they are said in the Scriptures, which often happens, to justify, it is said of them in a singular way. To understand this more correctly, we will go back a little deeper and deduce good works from their sources and circumscribe them with certain limits, so that their nature and whole nature may be fully known.</p>
      <p>I am not so concerned about the term. For there are, as no one is ignorant, evil works and works of iniquity. Hence, they are called workers of iniquity, and these are also called works of the Canaanites, works of the flesh, and works of darkness. Again, there are good works opposed to these, which Paul somewhere calls works worthy of repentance, also fruits of the Spirit and of light, such as acts of humanity and charity. Such are praised in that Tabitha in Acts 9, who is said to have been full of good works. Describing these, we say that good works are those done by the regenerate from the good Spirit of God through faith and according to the Word of God, for the glory of God and the ornament and honesty of life, and finally for the benefit of the neighbor. These are indeed brief and concise, and perhaps for this reason obscure to some, but they will become much clearer through the subsequent exposition, with the grace of God enlightening us.</p>
      <p>We indicate no other source of good works than God Himself, the author of all good. For the prophet says: "Every man is a liar, only God is true" [Rom 3:4; cf. Ps 116 (Vulg. 115):11]. And the Lord in the Gospel: "No one is good but One, that is, God" [Luke 18:19]. Hence, good works must not originate from man, who is a liar and corrupt, but from God Himself, from whom all that is good proceeds. He regenerates men through His Spirit and through faith in the Lord Jesus, so that those who are reborn through Him no longer work their own works, that is, works of the flesh, but the works of God. For the works of the regenerate are born from the indwelling good Spirit of God, who, like vital sap, invigorates the plants to bear fruit, so He germinates various virtues from man, the Lord Himself testifying and saying: "I am the vine, you are the branches. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in Me. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing" [John 15:4f]. To the same cause, we refer when we say that a good work is done through faith. For faith is the gift of God, by this we receive Christ, through this we are justified and made alive, as the Scripture says: "The just shall live by his faith" [Hab 2:4 and elsewhere]. And elsewhere: "That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith" [Eph 3:17]. And again: "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me" [Gal 2:20]. But the living one undoubtedly does living works through Him by whom he was made alive, and the justified one does works of righteousness through Him by whom he was justified, that is, the righteous does righteousness through Christ, righteousness comprehends the whole choir of virtues. Therefore, God alone remains the source and origin of good works. To which is added that the holy Scripture most manifestly attributes the works of the regenerate to God working in them through His Spirit in faith. This I will now demonstrate clearly with evident testimonies taken from the law of God, from the holy prophets, from the most sacred Gospel, and from the chosen apostles of Jesus Christ. For Moses in Deuteronomy 30 says: "The Lord your God will bless you, and the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live" [Deut 30:6]. But the prophet Isaiah says: "Lord, You will ordain peace for us, for You have also done all our works in us" [Isa 26:12]. In the Gospel according to John, the Savior says: "He who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God" [John 3:21]. And again: "He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing" [John 15:5].</p>
      <p>The apostle Paul also to the Philippians: "For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake" [Phil 1:29]. And even more clearly: "For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure" [Phil 2:13]. So also, the apostle James: "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights" [James 1:17]. But the apostle Peter, ascribing all parts of the work to God, says: "The God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you" [1 Pet 5:10]. For we are not sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God, as the apostle says again. Therefore, God alone remains the only source of good works, the same one working all good in all.</p>
      <p>From these things which we have brought from the Scriptures about the true cause of good works, it will also be easy to understand how the Scripture attributes righteousness to works. For righteousness is attributed to divine grace when it is attributed to faith. But the same grace is ascribed when it is ascribed to works. For the grace of God, and therefore God Himself, works good works in us, so that now justification is attributed to the grace of God and to Christ Himself working through us. Augustine also observed this, who in his book On Grace and Free Will, chapter 8, writes: "If eternal life is rendered to good works, as the Scripture most openly says: 'For God will render to each one according to his deeds' [Mt 16:27], how is eternal life grace, when grace is not rendered to works, but is given freely, as the apostle says: 'To him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt' [Rom 4:4]? And again: 'The remnant according to the election of grace is saved' [Rom 11:5]. And he immediately adds: 'And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace' [Rom 11:6]. How then is eternal life grace, which is taken from works? Or perhaps the apostle did not call eternal life grace? Indeed, he said so, so that it cannot be denied at all, nor does it require an acute interpreter, but only an attentive listener. For when he said: 'The wages of sin is death', he immediately adds 'but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord' [Rom 6:23]. Therefore, this question seems to me to be resolved in no way unless we understand that even our good works, for which eternal life is rendered, pertain to the grace of God, because of what the Lord Jesus said: 'Without Me you can do nothing' [John 15:5]. And the apostle himself, when he said: 'By grace you have been saved through faith', adds: 'And that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God. Not of works, lest anyone should boast' [Eph 2:8f]." These are Augustine's words. However, it should be added here that even though good works are truly God's and properly the fruits of faith and the Spirit, they are nevertheless also said to be and are our works, that is, the works of faithful men, partly because God works through us and uses our ministry in performing them, partly because through faith we have become children of God and therefore brothers of Christ and co-heirs with Christ. For from this right of inheritance, all the works and gifts of God begin to be ours - not as alien, but as most proper. But the Scripture attributes them to us as sons and freeborn when the Savior says in the Gospel: "A slave does not abide in the house forever, but a son abides forever" [John 8:35]. Just as all things in the paternal house come to the son by right of inheritance and property, although he did not acquire them by his own industry, but received them by the liberality of his parents, so the works of God, which the Father works in us and through us, are said to be and are ours, because we are heirs and sons of God. But it would be most shameful and a sign of the most ungrateful mind if a son, forgetful of paternal liberality and munificence, boasted that all those faculties received by inheritance were acquired by his own study and vigilance. Therefore, the holy Paul most religiously says: "What do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?" [1 Cor 4:7]. The holy martyr Cyprian also thought most religiously, who used to say: "There is nothing to boast about, since nothing is ours." This seems to pertain to what is read in Isaiah: "Shall the ax boast against him who chops with it? Shall the saw boast against him who moves it?" [Isa 10:15]. Hence, according to the sentence of Scripture and according to God, Augustine pronounced in these words in the book On Grace and Free Will, chapter 6: "When grace is given, our good merits also begin to be, yet through grace. For if it withdraws itself, man falls, not raised, but precipitated by free will. Therefore, when a man begins to have good merits, he should not attribute them to himself, but to God, to whom it is said in the Psalm: 'Be my helper, do not forsake me' [Ps 27 (Vulg. 26):9]. By saying 'do not forsake me', he shows that if he is forsaken, he is worth nothing good by himself." Thus far, Augustine has clearly shown that good works are ours in such a way that all meanwhile are due to grace. Hence, when righteousness is attributed to our works, it is certainly attributed to grace, from which good works are.</p>
      <p>Others cut this knot by saying that the faithful please God because of Christ, who reconciled them to God, and because they please God, who work, therefore the works that are done by the reconciled also please, not because of themselves or because they are done by them, but because they are done by the members of Christ. Others think this way: Faith and works are joined. For the just shall live by faith, and the just works righteousness, and neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love; therefore, because of this inseparable conjunction, what is truly the other's is attributed to one.</p>
      <p>This matter could also be explained in this way: In faith, two things are to be considered, reconciliation and obedience. Reconciliation, indeed, because by faith we understand that God is reconciled to us because of Christ, through whom we have been made pleasing and beloved to God. Obedience, however, because the reconciled dedicate themselves entirely to Him to whom they are reconciled, desiring to do His will. Here, therefore, it may be said that there is a twofold righteousness, justifying and obedient. Paul mentions the justifying one when he says: "Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have been reconciled" [Rom 5:1f]. He mentions the obedient one when he says: "Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one's slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?" [Rom 6:16]. But properly, justification is attributed to the justifying one, improperly to the obedient one. For this arises from that and without it would not be called righteousness.</p>
      <p>This knot can also be dissolved in this way. The most proper work of faith is purification or sanctification. For the apostle Peter expressly says that hearts are purified by faith. However, in the cause of sanctification, the sacred letters show two main things. First, that we are sanctified freely by the blood of Jesus Christ, as many as believe. For St. Peter says that we are chosen through the sanctification of the Spirit for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. And even more clearly: "Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot" [1 Pet 1:18f]. The apostle Paul also says: "By the will of God, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified" [Heb 10:10, 14]. But the apostle John, testifying the same, says: "The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin" [1 John 1:7]. Therefore, faith in the blood of Jesus Christ truly and properly sanctifies because of Him who said: "I sanctify Myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by the truth" [John 17:19]. The latter, which the sacred letters teach concerning sanctification, is that those sanctified by the blood of Christ through faith daily sanctify themselves and strive for holiness, to which indeed a large part of the apostolic exhortations seem to pertain. Certainly, St. Peter says: "As He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, because it is written: 'Be holy, for I am holy'" [1 Pet 1:15f].</p>
      <p>And the apostle Paul says: "This is the will of God, your sanctification, that you should abstain from sexual immorality, and that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, not in passion of lust, and that no one should take advantage of and defraud his brother in this matter" [1 Thess 4:4-6]. So also, the apostle John taught, saying: "Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be. But we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure" [1 John 3:2f].</p>
      <p>Therefore, this purification of ours, which is done by our care and diligence, is also called true sanctification, not because of itself, but because of that first one made by the blood of Christ, which unless it precedes, there is no sanctification of ours; again, if it precedes, this must follow. For St. James the apostle most rightly pronounced: "If faith does not have works, it is dead by itself" [James 2:17]. By itself, I say, that is, alone and not fruitful in any good works.</p>
      <p>For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead. The living body indeed performs and provides services to many; so it is necessary that faith through the offices of charity benefits many. But if it benefits no one with the offices of piety, it is a fictitious and empty name, just as the sanctification of a man, unless it is exercised in holy words and deeds, is undoubtedly to be considered insincere and hypocritical. Meanwhile, whatever true holiness is in that sanctification of ours, which shines forth in our works, it must all be referred to that sanctification made by the blood of Christ, to which the glory of justification most properly belongs; improperly, that is, by imputation and gratuitous concession, to our efforts, righteousness, and holiness. Therefore, whenever you see righteousness attributed to our good works in the sacred writings, you will think it is done for these reasons which I have explained so far. For the apostolic spirit cannot be contrary to itself.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is clear that the apostles of the Lord had a contest with two kinds of men. Some attributed righteousness and salvation to their good works done according to the norm of the divine law and therefore despised Christ. For wanting to establish their own righteousness, they were not subject to the righteousness of God.</p>
      <p>Against the impious opinion of these, the apostles, especially Paul, taught that righteousness and life are prepared by faith in the Lord Jesus and not by our works. Indeed, the same to the Galatians: "I do not set aside the grace of God. For if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain" [Gal 2:21]. And again: "Christ has become of no effect to you, whoever of you are justified by the law; you have fallen from grace" [Gal 5:4]. Against those same ones, the Jerusalem council was celebrated, of which mention is made by Luke in Acts chapter 15. There were again some light and irreligious men who, abusing this apostolic doctrine for the license of the flesh, believed it was enough for salvation if they said they had faith, even if no good works were found in them. Against these, therefore, as pests of true religion, the same apostles fought and taught that the Christian faith is not a vain opinion and sterile knowledge, but vivifying and effective and most fruitful in good works. For Paul, acting against these, says to Titus: "They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work" [Titus 1:16].</p>
      <p>The apostle Peter also, more covertly rebuking those same hypocrites, says: "For this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love. For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For he who lacks these things is shortsighted, even to blindness, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins" [2 Pet 1:5-9].</p>
      <p>And those things which the apostles of Christ John and James wrote about this matter are well known, of whom the latter contends that Abraham was not justified by faith only, that is, by that vain opinion, but by works, namely, true faith. Meanwhile, the most faithful apostles of Christ did not want by these and similar exhortations to nullify the grace and merit of Christ, to exalt the merits of men, but rather to oppose the impurity of those who boasted of the faith of Christ with great offense to the weak, which they had never known. For if they had truly known it, they would undoubtedly have lived more temperately. Therefore, when the apostles urge good works, they urge true faith in Christ and effective through love, and nevertheless attribute all or even those works which they require from the faithful to the grace of God. Those who have even greeted the apostolic letters from the threshold will say that I teach true and orthodox things, but Augustine, the catholic doctor of the church, will testify that I have invented nothing new here. For in the book On Grace and Free Will, chapter 7, he writes: "Men not understanding what the apostle says: 'We conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law' [Rom 3:28], thought he said that faith suffices for a man, even if he lives wickedly and has no works. Which God forbid that the chosen vessel should think, who, when he said in one place: 'In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything', immediately adds: 'but faith working through love' [Gal 5:6]. That very faith is what separates the faithful of God from unclean demons. For they also, as the apostle James says, 'believe and tremble' [James 2:19], but do not do good works. Therefore, they do not have that faith from which the just lives, that is, which works through love, that God may render eternal life to him according to his works. But because even those good works are from God to us, from whom we have both faith and love, therefore the same doctor of the Gentiles also called eternal life grace." These things I have recounted from Augustine and have thus far explained how the Scripture attributes righteousness to good works, and that this doctrine does not conflict with the apostolic doctrine which attributes righteousness to faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Since the question of the merits of good works is related to this discussion of the righteousness of works, I will add a few things about the reward and merit of good works, especially so that no one rashly and irreligiously judging and thinking about the merits of good works may not now have good, but rather evil merits. Merit, as the scholastics discuss it, is found nowhere in the sacred letters. But there is much mention of reward in them. In this, the Scripture imitates our way of speaking, and because we give rewards to friends and well-deserving people as a reward for their labor, therefore, in the same imitation, it is said that God renders a reward to His friends for their excellent deeds and merits, eternal life. For thus we read in Isaiah: "Say to the righteous that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Woe to the wicked, it shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given him" [Isa 3:10f]. Also, we read in Jeremiah: "Refrain your voice from weeping, for your work shall be rewarded" [Jer 31:16]. And in the Gospel, the Lord says: "Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven" [Mt 5:11f; Luke 6:22f]. The apostle Paul also says: "Each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor" [1 Cor 3:8]. However, in these, the word 'reward' should not be pressed too morosely, as if there is anything here of ours. For our merits themselves are nothing other than the gifts of God.</p>
      <p>It would be most ungrateful if someone were to enjoy the generosity of another by using the fruits of a field, while at the same time usurping the ownership of it entirely for themselves. Therefore, just as in other doctrines of our faith, Augustine consistently held and taught the catholic truth of the canonical and holy church's opinion everywhere, and he not only reviewed the orthodox opinion on the merits of good works but also fortified it with the most diligent comparison of scriptures. In his work "On Grace and Free Will," chapter 7, he says: "John, the precursor of our Lord, says: 'A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from heaven' [John 3:27]. Therefore, if your good merits are gifts of God, God does not crown your merits as your merits, but as His gifts. Let us consider the merits of the Apostle Paul, that is, those acquired by him, whether they are gifts of God. 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith' [2 Tim 4:7]. First, these good works would not exist if good thoughts had not preceded them. Therefore, pay attention to what he says about these thoughts: 'Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God' [2 Cor 3:5].</p>
      <p>Next, let us examine each one: 'I have fought the good fight.' I ask, by what virtue did he fight: whether it was from himself or given from above? But far be it that such a great teacher of the Gentiles was ignorant of the law of God, whose voice is in Deuteronomy: 'Do not say in your heart: My strength and the power of my hand have made this great virtue, but remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you strength to do virtue' [Deut 8:17f]. But what does the good fight profit unless victory follows? And who gives victory, except He of whom he says: 'Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ' [1 Cor 15:57]. And elsewhere, when he had recalled the testimony from the Psalm: 'For your sake we are killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter,' he added and said: 'But in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us' [Rom 8:36f; cf. Ps 44:23 (Vulg. 43:22)]. Therefore, we conquer not through ourselves, but through Him who loved us. Then he said, 'I have finished the race,' but he said this, who elsewhere says: 'It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy' [Rom 9:16]. This statement cannot be turned in any way to say: It is not of God's mercy, but of man's will and running.</p>
      <p>For whoever dares to say this openly shows himself to contradict the apostle. Finally, he said, 'I have kept the faith,' but the same one who said this also said elsewhere: 'I obtained mercy to be faithful' [1 Cor 7:25]. However, he did not say: I obtained mercy because I was faithful, but 'to be faithful,' thus showing that even faith itself cannot be had unless God is merciful, and it is a gift of God, which he teaches most clearly by saying: 'By grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God' [Eph 2:8]. For they might say: We received grace because we believed, as if attributing faith to themselves and grace to God; for this reason, the apostle, when he had said 'through faith,' added, 'and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.' Again, lest they should say they had earned such a gift by their works, he immediately added: 'Not of works, lest anyone should boast' [Eph 2:9]. Not because he denied or nullified good works, since he says God will render to each one according to his works, but because works are from faith, not faith from works, and therefore the works of righteousness are from Him to us, from whom is the faith itself, of which it is said: 'The just shall live by faith' [Hab 2:4 and elsewhere]." I have thus far reviewed all these things verbatim from Augustine, which indeed encompass all that can be said about the merit of good works so fully and propose them so solidly fortified by scriptures that I think nothing more needs to be added to them. For what can be said more briefly and sincerely, and also more fully, than that a reward is prepared for good works, but that it is nothing other than grace, and that the merits of the saints are gifts of God, which when God crowns, He crowns His own gifts? Therefore, in all these things, the perpetual and infallible catholic doctrine remains that believers are justified and saved by faith alone or by the grace of God alone.</p>
      <p>We return, therefore, to good works, which cannot be called good unless they are born of God through faith. If, however, they arise from God through faith, they are also formed according to the rule of the word of God; therefore, I added in the description of good works that they are done by those reborn from the good Spirit of God through faith and according to the word of God. For God does not approve of works that we contrive from ourselves.</p>
      <p>For He approves obedience, but disapproves of good intentions born in us. This we demonstrate with these testimonies of the scriptures. In Deuteronomy, the Lord expressly commands in these words: "You shall not do as we are doing here today, every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes. Whatever I command you, be careful to observe it; you shall not add to it nor take away from it" [Deut 12:8, 32]. Furthermore, in the history of Samuel, a memorable example of this matter is set forth. For the king of the Israelites, Saul, receives the command to strike the Amalekites and all the possessions of the Amalekites with a ban. However, through good intention and chosen religion, he reserves the fatter cattle for a sacrifice to God, but hears from the prophet: "Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry" [1 Sam 15:22f].</p>
      <p>In these few words, you have an excellent encomium of chosen religion and works born from our good intention. Those who neglect the commandments of God and follow their good intentions are called magicians, apostates, and idolaters from the truth. They indeed seem to themselves to be excellent worshippers of God and zealous followers of the observances of the holy fathers, bishops, kings, and princes, but God, who cannot lie, expressly declares that their works are no different from magic, apostasy, and idolatry, than which nothing can be imagined more atrocious. Therefore, in the gospel, the Lord, from the prophecy of Isaiah the prophet, once condemns, rejects, and tramples underfoot all those chosen works born from our good intentions, when He says: "In vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men. Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind" [Matt 15:9, 13f]. Hence, it is that St. Paul with such confidence declared that the commandments of men are contrary to the truth and are lies. Elsewhere, the same one says: "Whatever is not from faith is sin" [Rom 14:23]. And again: "Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God" [Rom 10:17]. From which it can be gathered that works not formed from the word of God through faith are not only not good but are also called sins. To the Colossians, he most clearly condemns ἐθελοθρησκείαν, which the interpreter translates as "superstition," when it should have been translated as "voluntary and self-imposed religion." It is therefore evident from all these things that we do not condemn or oppose truly good works when we condemn and oppose the works of monks and priests, born of human choice and good intention outside the word of God. For it is now evident that those are not truly good works which we contrive from ourselves, but only those which God has commanded us. This will become even clearer from these words of St. Paul: "We are created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them" [Eph 2:10]. He places two marks of truly good works. The first: "We are created in Christ Jesus for good works." Therefore, a good work must be done by one who is grafted into Christ Jesus. For unless the branch remains in the vine, it cannot bear fruit. We are grafted into the vine, Christ, by faith. The second: The works are not just any works or of any kind, but those which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. But what those are, He has expressed in His law, which is the will of God. Hence, when asked about eternal life and true virtues in the gospel, the Lord refers to the law and says: "What is written in the law?" [Luke 10:26]. And: "If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments" [Matt 19:17]. Therefore, the Decalogue is the most certain and absolute formula of good works; to understand this more fully, I will demonstrate this whole thing as if on a tablet with a brief enumeration. To the first commandment, you will refer the fear of God, trust and love, and finally, the most certain hope in adversity, patience, and unbroken constancy. To the second pertains true and sincere worship, which pleases God, and the denial of all superstition and perverse divine worship. To the third, reverence for the divine name, confession, invocation, and sanctification of the same. In the fourth, there will be a place for the moderate preservation of ecclesiastical ceremonies, the preaching of the word of God, public prayers, and whatever pertains to external worship. To the fifth, you will refer piety towards parents, country, and relatives, just obedience owed to the magistrate, and the duties of civil life. You will add to the sixth justice and judgment, the defense of widows and oppressed orphans, beneficence, and innocence. To the seventh, you will count marital fidelity and the duties of marriage, the liberal and pious education of children, and the pursuit of chastity, temperance, and sobriety. To the eighth, you will refer justice in contracts, liberality, munificence, hospitality. To the ninth, the pursuit of truth throughout life, faith in words and deeds, composed, honest, and useful speech. In the tenth place, you will recount good affections and holy vows, and finally, all holy and honest thoughts. This, indeed, is the concise formula of good works. But if you desire something more succinct, listen to the Lord in the gospel saying: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself. And whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them" [Matt 22:37-39; 7:12].</p>
      <p>Let all the faithful who desire to do good works direct their eyes and minds to these commandments of the Lord, and the more diligently and constantly, the more certainly they see and understand that God requires nothing else and no other works from His own in the law and the prophets. I can prove this with the most manifest testimonies of the greatest prophets. Moses in Deuteronomy says: "And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, to love Him, and to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, to keep the commandments of the Lord and His statutes which I command you today" [Deut 10:12f]. King David also asks in Psalm 15: "Lord, who may dwell in Your tabernacle?" [Ps 15 (Vulg. 14), 1] and immediately answers: "He who walks uprightly and works righteousness" [Ps 15 (Vulg. 14), 2] and the rest, which are contained in the Decalogue. The prophet Isaiah, asking the same question, says: "Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?" [Isa 33:14] and answers: "He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly" [Isa 33:15] and the rest, which are found in the Decalogue. Jeremiah in chapter 22 urges and presses these things: "Thus says the Lord: 'Execute judgment and righteousness, and deliver the plundered out of the hand of the oppressor. Do no wrong and do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place'" [Jer 22:3]. Nor does Ezekiel in chapter 18 list other good works in a long catalog. In Hosea, the Lord says: "I desire mercy and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings" [Hos 6:6]. Micah also asks what he should do or with what works he should merit the Lord, and from the revelation of God, he answers: "He has shown you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?" [Mic 6:8]. Similarly, the prophet Zechariah, when asked about virtue and works that please God, answers: "Thus says the Lord of hosts: 'Execute true justice, show mercy and compassion everyone to his brother. Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the alien or the poor. Let none of you plan evil in his heart against his brother, and do not love a false oath, for all these are things that I hate,' says the Lord" [Zech 7:9f; 8:17]. The prophetic doctrine does not differ from the evangelical and apostolic doctrine, which everywhere teaches charity, justice, and innocence, the goal and sum of all good works. I have proposed these things so copiously and with so many testimonies of the scriptures, lest anyone should henceforth either doubt or be ignorant that those alone are good works which are done from the good Spirit of God through faith and according to the scripture or the word of God.</p>
      <p>It remains that we strengthen and explain with the comparison of scriptures what we have appended to the end of the description of good works. I have said that truly good works are done by the reborn for the glory of God, the adornment of life, and the benefit of the neighbor.</p>
      <p>For the Lord, prescribing this end to our good works in Matthew, says: "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven" [Matt 5:16].</p>
      <p>The Apostle Paul also, not once, in exhorting to good works, appends that which can most move, that in all things they may adorn the doctrine of our Savior with their works of piety. Now, just as a decent and honest garment adorns a man, so truly good works commend the life of men.</p>
      <p>Hence, the apostles of Christ have so often advised to put off the old man and put on the new, who is created according to God. From this, glory and honor come to us. We are called and are servants, indeed children of our God, whose nature and virtue shine in us to the glory and praise of His name.</p>
      <p>Moreover, He increases His gifts to us who do well more and more, since He said: "To everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance. But from him who does not have, even what he does not have will be taken away and given to him who has" [Matt 25:29]. Added to this is that God is favorable to those who do right and enriches them with many temporal gifts, and finally grants them eternal life. For the Apostle Paul expressly says: "God will render to each one according to his deeds, to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality, eternal life" [Rom 2:6f]. And again: "Glory, honor, and peace to everyone who works what is good" [Rom 2:10]. Although in all good works the pious have not set a private gain as their goal, but the glory and will of God, and finally the benefit of the neighbor. For Paul says: "Do all to the glory of God" [1 Cor 10:31]. And: "Let no one seek his own, but each one the other's well-being, just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved" [1 Cor 10:24, 33]. Therefore, all the pious direct all their efforts and works to this end, that they may benefit many. For in this, they express the nature of God, whose children they are. For He desires to do good to all creatures, hence His children are beneficent and have beneficence as the sole goal of their life and efforts before their eyes.</p>
      <p>This is what I have at present concerning the nature, character, cause, end, and effect, that is, the true and just reason of good works, from which I hope it can be especially understood how the name of righteousness and justification is attributed to the good works of the saints, and how the Lord is said to render a reward in the holy scriptures, and that the orthodox and primary doctrine of our religion remains immovable and firm: that we are justified by the grace of God for Christ's sake through faith, not by works. Now, therefore, nothing remains but that we pray to the Lord with constant vows for true faith in the Lord Jesus, by which we may be truly justified, and through the most fervent invocation of His name, we may put into practice the discussion held thus far about good works, that is, that we may express and adorn the faith we profess to have in our Lord Jesus Christ with truly good works, mindful of the words of Christ the Lord in His gospel saying: "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!' Therefore, whoever hears these sayings of Mine and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock, and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock. But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand, and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell, and great was its fall" [Matt 7:21-27]. Let us therefore strive with holy and constant prayers and true diligence of mind and piety, that we may be built upon the living stone, Christ Himself, as living stones, a living and enduring structure in all the assaults of various temptations, a spiritual house, a holy temple, and a sacred priesthood, offering to our Redeemer and Justifier, Jesus Christ our Lord, spiritual and most acceptable sacrifices, praises, alms, and our own bodies, and indeed ourselves and all that is ours.</p>
      <p>Moreover, concerning faith and works, it will be discussed here and there and more extensively throughout this entire evangelical work of ours, which, in order that they may be more correctly and fully understood, I have wished to preface and thus far preface this as a compendium of justification and good works.</p>
      <p>For as far as the manner of writing and my intention, which I have followed in this work of my commentaries, I will not deal with it at length. For I have explained most of it in the preface to Matthew, since I have aimed at the same things in this work as there. I have diligently read the expositions of both ancient and recent writers on the gospel according to John and have used them in their places, as I have candidly noted in my own work what I have borrowed or transcribed from whom. For I never wanted to imitate those, nor did I ever like the minds of those who, when they could use the pious and prudent writings of the ancients, prefer nevertheless to invent new things rashly without consulting or considering them and to bring forth into the light things little weighed. Moreover, it seemed to be a far more approved method to use the testimonies of the ancients and the strength of scripture in explaining the scriptures, especially in such a great dissension of doctrines, moderately, indeed, and almost continuously, so that even our adversaries may see openly that we do not establish our faith with our own or new doctrines brought in by new faith, but with the more ancient and confirmed opinions and expositions of the most holy churches, and thus to confirm our faith, which is the oldest of all, and indeed the only one, pure and simple and first. However, I have taken care, above all, that from our commentaries the context of the apostle's speech may be understood as clearly as possible, since there does not seem to be any method of exposition more evident and clearer than the diligent observation of the context of the speech; if this is neglected, I do not see how the mind of the writer and the genuine sense can be held.</p>
      <p>I have divided the whole work into 10 books, prefixed arguments to each, in which I have outlined the sum and context of the matters, so that in the subsequent treatment everything would be clearer and the reader would have the goal constantly before his eyes, at which he should aim. I have asserted the orthodox opinion and exposition against distorted and corrupt interpretations throughout. I have also frequently refuted and opposed various errors. In all these my labors, I have wished to benefit the church of Christ and serve those who are zealous for the truth of the gospel. Meanwhile, I prejudge no one, I despise and belittle no one's labors. If anyone gives better things, I will not only not envy but will rather give thanks. But I also propose mine to be weighed according to the apostle's saying: "Test all things; hold fast what is good" [1 Thess 5:21].</p>
      <p>These my lucubrations, written and published within 9 months, I have therefore decided to inscribe to you, Lavater, most esteemed lord and most faithful godfather, because there are many and great benefits from you to me and to all the ministers of Christ, and to stimulate your diligence more. You have hitherto loved and helped the Christian religion and the republic not in a common way.</p>
      <p>When you were acting as prefect or proconsul in that very large county of Kyburg, in the name of the council, senate, and people of Zurich, you promoted the affairs of religion and the republic with such faith for many years that even today the best people do not cease to praise your virtue. You favored the evangelical doctrine from the very beginning, when its first foundations were laid by Zwingli of blessed memory, the faithful pastor of our church. You had seen in Rome, sent as a legate by the most illustrious council and senate of Zurich together with the most distinguished Jacob Werdmüller, a man who greatly favored piety, how great the corruption of the priests and the whole papal religion was, and therefore you more easily joined the cause of Christ, the evangelical doctrine, I say. And in its confession and faith, you have hitherto persevered most steadfastly, even in that severe temptation of ours and in your greatest danger, when under your leadership and command, the battle was fought unfavorably at Kappel. Certainly, as the gracious Lord was never absent from you, so here especially He did not forsake you, who first indeed snatched you from that bloody and fierce battle and from the hands of the most fierce enemy while you were fighting bravely, and then defended you from the calumnies of certain envious people, while immediately after the war, the most holy senate of ours diligently inquired into the faith of your administration and conduct of the war because of the calumnies of some, and having thoroughly known all things, gave illustrious testimony to your virtue and innocence that nothing was neglected in that war through your fault, but that all things were administered by you with the best faith.</p>
      <p>To which was added that later it increased and adorned you with public honors and dignities as well-deserved. Therefore, continue to be faithful to the liberal and munificent Lord, your liberator. Continue with all good people to help the evangelical cause and to propagate the kingdom of Christ as widely as possible, so that finally Christ, our King and Lord, may transfer you into His eternal kingdom to Himself and to the fellowship of all the blessed, when you are released from this mortal harbor. May the grace of the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in the month of August, in the year of our Lord 1543.</p>
