      <p>Greetings. Your letters have been delivered to me, dearest father in Christ, from which I have received not only pleasure but also the greatest consolation. For when I was deeply grieved and troubled in spirit due to the conditions of peace being so unfair to us, when our people could have negotiated for better and fairer terms, behold, your letters, which alleviated my sorrow, refreshed my spirit, and led me to a higher philosophy; for I see that the Lord, in His mercy and patience, invites and waits for His adversaries and ours to repent (unless they change their ways), until they have filled the measure of their fathers' iniquity, whose footsteps they follow, so that He may finally execute His just judgments upon them. Meanwhile, I do not doubt that He also wishes to avenge the contempt of His word and to punish the vices in which many of our people were indulging and to which they were beginning to give free rein, so that henceforth His word may be held in greater esteem by us and that we may walk before Him with greater fear and reverence for His name. Therefore, I hope these judgments of the Lord will turn out for our good.</p>
      <p>As for the state of France, it is more miserable and disturbed than before, especially with Cardinal Lorraine, a most vile and foul man and a monstrous beast, managing everything according to his lust and presiding over the royal council. The condition of our people is far more unjust than when the swords were drawn and arms resounded everywhere; for then they could repel swords with swords, arms with arms, and force with force; but now they are attacked and slaughtered everywhere unarmed; garrisons are placed in those places and cities which our people have occupied, to their disgrace, and these are composed of the most depraved men, who seem to have been born for this purpose, to weary, plunder, and slaughter our people, as happened at Orl√©ans and Auxerre, where about 30 of our people were recently slaughtered, not to mention what happened at Amiens, Rouen, Bourges, Yvetot, and in many other places.</p>
      <p>We understand nothing but the plundering and slaughter of our people: this is the promise and royal faith. In short, I can truly say this: this time of peace (which we cannot call peace, but betrayal and the most treacherous war) has consumed more of our people than the time of war; in Lyon, they rage more than before, our people are not allowed access there, and there is little hope of restoring that most flourishing church. And although it was decreed in this last edict that all interpretations and restrictions are abolished and that none shall be made in the future, the king has not kept his promises; for he has sent letters to the governors of Auvergne and Bourbonnais, in which he commands that he did not understand that those regions, like the others, which belong to the queen mother, and also to his brothers, to the cardinal, and to the Duke of Montpensier, should enjoy the benefit of the edict concerning the sermons and exercise of the reformed religion, and in this way, a good part of the kingdom of France will be deprived of the exercise of religion, which is directly contrary to the edict of pacification, by which all things are restored to their former state. To put it briefly, as the matter stands: I do not see this so-called peace lasting long, and I greatly fear for our leaders. But the Lord will take care of them and will complete the work He has undertaken, despite Satan's opposition and all his minions resisting, and when it seems almost over for His people, He will find a way. You see, my father, what the state of the kingdom of France and the miserable faithful is. May the Lord protect His own against the violence and cruelty of the enemies and restore the French churches!</p>
      <p>Here we live quite peacefully; the plague has begun to spread somewhat; many are terrified by it; but I hope the Lord will have mercy on this church and school and will set limits to this disease so that it does not spread further and will restore us to our former health. By God's grace, Master Beza is well; on the past Pentecost, he began to preach again. May the Lord keep you and him safe and sound with us for a long time! May the Lord Jesus be with you and always guide you with His spirit! Please convey my warmest greetings to your venerable colleagues in my name, if you please. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 8th of June.</p>
      <p>Your most observant D[...] Chaillet.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful servant of Christ and most vigilant pastor, Master Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
