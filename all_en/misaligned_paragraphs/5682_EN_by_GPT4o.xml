      <p>Greetings. When I had thoroughly read your letter, most illustrious man, I did not immediately understand what you meant, as you thanked me for transcribing Mr. Calvin's dictations and sending them to you. And indeed, I was greatly wondering what you were aiming at.</p>
      <p>But when shortly after I received a letter from our friend in Troyes, in which he made no mention of the writing I had sent, it finally occurred to me that I had made a mistake due to excessive haste in wrapping the package.</p>
      <p>For when our friend in Troyes had earnestly requested in his letter that if Mr. Calvin had discussed anything in the first chapter of Ezekiel concerning the divine persons that could be of use to the Poles, I should send it to him, I took care to transcribe what we had noted from his lecture on that matter, to satisfy our friend's desire.</p>
      <p>However, since I had many letters and writings at hand when I hastily wrapped the package, I suspect that I attached that writing to your letters, which I intended to enclose with the letters to our friend in Troyes.</p>
      <p>Geneva, April 9, 1563.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, to be greatly respected by me.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
