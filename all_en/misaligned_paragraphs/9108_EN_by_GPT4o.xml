      <p>Greetings, dear Sir. I cannot restrain myself from briefly, yet with a sense of grievance, almost lamenting, to inform you, venerable father, about the troubles we face from the most turbulent and pernicious minds, particularly from Johannes Moer, but more so from Johannes Gantner. This threat looms over us now more than ever, although I have no doubt that my dearest brother, Mr. Tobias, will write to you more thoroughly and significantly about everything. We do this to consult you on this matter or to urge you (whose advice we always highly value) to indicate what you think we should do here. When Johannes Gantner, whom I will now discuss in particular (for Johannes Moer, although he accuses us everywhere and never ceases to rage against us like an unbridled beast through all kinds of slander, has not yet achieved much nor obtained anything publicly as the other has), publicly taught Anabaptist and manifestly heretical errors and tried to defend and advocate them with all his might before our entire synod, especially concerning the magistrate's duty in restraining heretics, and did so openly against your Zurich Confession, published even under our name, although he did not want to appear so, indeed, with brazen audacity, dared to deny that he was saying anything against it (behold the man's cunning and impudence), he was so effectively convicted of error there and condemned by the synod's judgment, to which he had voluntarily submitted, that he himself voluntarily and promptly subscribed to the synod's judgment with his own hand, indeed, a year and a half ago, and thus approved it once, as we had once perfunctorily recorded it on a sheet. Therefore, as a punishment, he was removed from the office of preaching for a time or deprived of it, to be reinstated or further excluded, depending on his conduct; this judgment was approved not only by the Chur synod but also by the entire Rhaetian or Three Leagues senate and was finally duly recorded and confirmed with appended seals.</p>
      <p>But what did he do? Later, forgetting his subscription and opposing both the synod and the lords, he continued to preach in a certain village against everyone's wishes, complaining everywhere that a great injustice had been done to him by the synod, which had treated him, an innocent man, so unjustly and with the utmost injury, like the Jews did to Christ. Furthermore, he refused to subscribe to the judgment, which had been duly recorded and sealed, although he had initially agreed to do so in the synod. Therefore, having often complained gravely and sharply, as was fitting, before the most honorable senate of this city and the entire Three Rhaetian Leagues, we obtained not once that the synod's judgment be confirmed and increasingly ratified, and furthermore, a senate decree was also issued, decreeing that he should either subscribe to the judgment or, if he refused to do so, be deprived of citizenship and move elsewhere, with his residence transferred outside the territory of Chur, etc. - while we thus, after many such good and just decrees, but at the same time (because those who negligently and languidly execute what they have well decreed and thus hold it in contempt, ultimately to their own undoubted ruin) weak and ineffective, in vain awaited that the turbulent and perverse man be brought into order and thus the offense and harm he caused the church be removed: behold, we observe him, relying on some hidden support, becoming more insolent and obstinate every day, while those who were long ago exiled for heresy have returned to the city and live there openly and freely throughout the entire summer or even longer. Moved by this, we appeared before the entire, so-called greater senate (as we did once before) in recent days, also to obtain and enforce a somewhat stricter discipline in these perilous times, and were compelled to renew and reiterate the old complaint, which we had long since grown weary of, as severely and sharply as we could. Why do I delay with many words? After we left, the three who had been sent by the senate to him long ago, revealed and disclosed his response, which had undoubtedly been deliberately delayed until that time: namely, that he absolutely refused to subscribe to the written judgment, citing two particular points contained in the judgment's letters, by which he claimed he was ready to promptly subscribe to the synod's confession of faith and even the Zurich Confession, which was also published in the name of our synod and to which he himself had also subscribed, and even to swear, if necessary, that he would never contradict such a confession or hold anything that opposed it and conflicted with it; only that he be allowed to live and remain not as a preacher, but as a private citizen and with his wife and children within the private walls of the city. This he says and does with this cunning plan, so that, having always claimed that he never taught anything against the Zurich Confession (which he was manifestly convicted of doing), he might persuade the public that this is indeed the case, who know no more about what the Zurich Confession contains than a donkey knows how to play the lyre, and thus, as long as he is not forced to publicly retract his manifest errors, everyone might believe that we, driven by base feelings of hatred and envy (as he now slanders us everywhere with his insults), have unjustly wronged him, and in this way, those who have been led astray by him in error might be more confirmed, and those who doubted might also doubt more, so that what he does is no different than if a thief caught and manifestly convicted of theft and thus condemned to death by the magistrate were so audacious as to promise most solemnly that he would never steal again in the future and dare to demand to be released, who, however, when asked whether he admits to having stolen, refuses to confess it, indeed even denies it, so that he might thus accuse the magistrate of injustice and everyone might believe that he, an innocent man, is being wronged by him. Would such a person be worthy of pardon, or do you think that a prudent and just magistrate would release such a man?</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, our magistrate or senate, (with some in it acting in all things according to a prior arrangement with him, while most, indeed, erring out of simplicity and not understanding the matter) having heard Gantner's response from the three appointed, deemed it, along with the attached petition, to be good and satisfactory to them, to be admitted and approved, not caring or considering how much it conflicted with the synod's judgment, which they had also approved with the seal of their city, etc. Where, even though the consuls had been admonished and requested by us not to give him such a response without first hearing us, those who favor him in the senate were able to achieve so much that, with Mr. Willio, the consul, absent, as he was necessarily presiding over the assembly of all the Rhaetians at the fair, the city's senate was convened under some pretext, and the response once decreed was given to Gantner there, with the other consul, however much he protested, present. Where, when we, with some preachers, happened to intervene by chance and were completely unaware of this matter, and when we learned what had been done and complained that it had been done without hearing us, Gantner, to make it clear to everyone what his intentions were or with what plan he was acting, shouted loudly in the ensuing verbal altercation, with the whole crowd of people standing around in the very court or market house listening, that the synod had condemned him, an innocent man, without cause and against law and justice, etc. See if this does not injure us; but what pains us most of all is that those whom we relied on as if on the strength and faith of a most fortified citadel, they, above all, as it appears, fail us. But I am foolish to speak with so many words to one so intelligent. Therefore, we pray, consult in the light of your integrity and prudence, and greet the brothers and our most illustrious lords, especially Gwalther and Simler, and farewell together with them.</p>
      <p>Chur, November 24, 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours always most observantly, Ulrich Campell.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and singularly esteemed elder today, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Zurich church and my most venerable father in Christ, always to be honored with every respect.</p>
      <p>Gantner's new disturbances, November 1572. Campell's.</p>
