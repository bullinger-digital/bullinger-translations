    <p xml:id="regest1">Has been reading Bullinger's commentaries on the Pauline epistles for almost ten years and appreciates them greatly, but takes the liberty, as admitted by the author himself, to judge differently on some issues - such as the doctrine of the Lord's Supper. After Bullinger has completed this work, Crodel and his friends want to encourage him to take on a new task that no one in Germany can accomplish better than [Bullinger and Pellikan]. The conversion of a part of the Jews, as predicted by Paul, presupposes that the messianic prophecies are revealed to them, specifically through the older rabbinic literature - not yet misinterpreted by David [ben Josef Kimchi], Solomon [ben Isaac known as Rashi], and others. Others have already attempted this, such as Paul of Burgos, Johannes Baptista [Gratia Dei], the author of the "Star of the Messiah" [Petrus Nigri], and [Salvagus] Porchetus [de Salvaticis], the latter relying on Raimundus [Martini] and the aforementioned; however, most of these works were printed without Hebrew letters. Based on such writings, it would be easy for Bullinger to create a work that could benefit the Church and also lead many Jews to faith. With Pellikan, he has an excellent assistant at his side; could it not be that the conversion of the Jews is assigned to both of them in a similar way as the rebirth of Christianity in Germany was to Luther? It is important that the scriptures are quoted in Hebrew, translated into Latin, and explained in German, and that there is a thorough engagement with those rabbinic writings that enjoy the highest authority among the Jews. Urbanus Rhegius refrained from using rabbinic evidence in his dialogue about the Emmaus disciples, but [Bullinger and Pellikan] have the necessary language skills and literature. Reuchlin rightly opposed Pfefferkorn, arguing that the Talmudic writings should be made accessible to scholars and not burned. What is still missing to convert the rest of Israel is a trilingual interpretation of the prophecies. Bullinger and Pellikan can count on the help of Christ, the true Messiah, in this work.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ, our Lord, we pray for you, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>For almost a decade, I have been a diligent reader of your works on the epistles of Saint Paul, most learned Bullinger, and I have found, in my judgment, that in these works, almost everything and nearly every single thing has been explained by you not only skillfully and learnedly but also piously for us. For this labor, the candidates of Pauline theology owe you no small gratitude. For where you differ from us, as in the Eucharist, I think it should be referred to your own words, in which you leave the judgment free to the pious and Christian reader, so that if you have written in accordance with the sacred scriptures and the divine spirit, it may indeed be accepted, but if something different and discordant, they should remember that you too are human. With your candor, I do not know if I have ever read anything more candid.</p>
      <p>Now, with that labor completed, since you seem to have put the finishing touch on this work and it is clear from your labors that you cannot be idle in the Lord's vineyard, it seemed fitting to many good men to encourage and urge you, now almost at leisure, to undertake a certain holy and very necessary work. No one among the Germans can be easily found who can more skillfully undertake and more rightly carry out this task, partly because you seem to be equipped with a singular industry and diligence, not to mention your remarkable learning, above all others, and partly because you are so skilled in the monuments of the Hebrews and the holy language that you easily surpass all others.</p>
      <p>The matter is briefly as follows: Saint Paul, among other things, in Romans 11:25f, prophesies about the Jews still to be converted to Christ: "I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery," etc., "that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, and so all Israel will be saved," etc.</p>
      <p>For this prophecy to be fulfilled, as it undoubtedly will be before the last day, it is necessary for the Jews to recognize Christ. Now, they cannot recognize him except from the holy scriptures and the oracles of the prophets that clearly testify about the Son of God, Jesus Christ. They will undoubtedly recognize him when the veil is removed from these divine oracles about the Messiah, that is, when the glosses of the more recent rabbis, Rabbi David, Solomon, and others of this kind, are removed, and the words and sentences that clearly testify about the Messiah are seen in their own clarity and genuine force, just as their rabbis understood and interpreted the same about Christ several centuries ago, those ancient rabbis whose authority is sacred among the wise Jews and to whom they give no less faith than to the sacred scriptures themselves, whose names you, my Bullinger, know far better than I do, along with Pellican, our venerable elder.</p>
      <p>Indeed, in previous centuries, some learned men, even from the revived lineage, have also applied themselves to this task, such as Paul of Burgos in his "Scrutiny of the Scriptures," and likewise Johannes Baptista, an Italian Jew once, in his book "On the Refutation of the Hebrew Sect." This learned book, printed in Strasbourg by Martin Flach in 1500, discusses the twofold advent of the Messiah wisely, while simultaneously refuting the contrary arguments of the Jews from the very storehouse of the scriptures. He indeed cites the Hebrew truth in its Hebraism, but due to the lack of Hebrew characters, only in Latin letters. There is also the "Star of the Messiah," published in German by a certain Dominican more than 70 years ago, which I hear our Capnion, a man of holy and venerable memory, held in great delight, but, as I judge, not as well equipped with stronger arguments as the former two, Burgos and Baptista, I think. The last of all, Porchetus, appeared with "On the Victory of the Jews," who seems to have compiled his entire work from the "Pugio" of Raymond of Peñafort and from these three already mentioned, dense, copious, and unbroken with arguments against the Jews, corroborating each sentence from their own rabbis (whom they consider it a great sin to contradict or deviate from their opinion by a hair's breadth) so much that they do not dare to even whisper against it. In the same way, Burgos and Baptista do, except that they also refer to the rabbinic citations only in Latin characters. Although some old delirious tales from the books of the sophistical theologians are not infrequently found mixed in there. But a learned and ingenious reader will easily either separate or completely disregard them as if they were of no moment.</p>
      <p>With these authors already cited, who are at hand, thus instructed and aided, my Bullinger, when you add your learning and that marvelous and ardent zeal of yours in the sacred scriptures, you could, with almost no effort, happily produce for us a certain excellent work to the praise of God the best and greatest and our Savior Jesus Christ, the true Messiah, and for the sole benefit and consolation of his church, which could be of great use and utmost benefit not only to all of us who have given our name to Christ but also to the perfidious and blinded, yet pitiable Jews, so that they too, finally, having dispelled the clouds of darkness, recognizing our Lord Jesus Christ together with us, might embrace and glorify him.</p>
      <p>Has there ever been heard, I ask, a greater pious work in this world? You have, lest you claim any difficulty or obstacle, as a Theseus and a certain auxiliary, the venerable father Conrad Pellican, who will never be lacking to you with his faithful service for such a sacred undertaking; I have known his piety, that of this most learned man, for more than twenty years. Furthermore, my Bullinger, what if this labor were left to both of you as if by some fate for the conversion of the Jews, just as the rebirth of Christianity in Germany was to Luther?</p>
      <p>Moreover, here, excellent men, you come to remind us that the sentences and sayings of the sacred scriptures about the Messiah must first be placed in their language, that is, Hebrew, and in Hebrew characters, then the genuine Latin interpretation word for word, as Burgos and Baptista did, and finally the German interpretation should also be added for the German Jews, whom the Latin language does not admit as readers. The same must be done diligently with the glosses and sentences of the rabbis, which assert the aforementioned scriptures and oracles of the prophets about the Messiah, meanwhile being especially careful with those rabbis whom they hold as classical and trustworthy writers and whom they consider it a great sin to have less faith in or to contradict.</p>
      <p>Urbanus Rhegius also collected last year in his Dialogue about the two disciples going to Emmaus the prophecies of the prophets about Christ; but since he did not include the interpretations and assertions of the rabbis, by which the Jews are captured and as if slaughtered by their own sword, a very wide field is open for them to evade. But it will be much easier for you, as you are excellently learned in the holy language and are most thoroughly equipped with the Talmudic books of the Hebrews and the rabbinic commentaries in the libraries among your people.</p>
      <p>And here conveniently comes to mind that counsel which the great man Capnion, the glory of Germany, gave to Emperor Maximilian in his "Ocular Mirror" almost 30 years ago about compelling the Jews to lend us their Talmudic books; for from them, they would be more quickly overcome, namely by their own arms, than if all their books, as Pfefferkorn wrongly advised, were to be burned.</p>
      <p>You see now, I hope, excellent men, from the work I have outlined for you, how much benefit will come to us Christians and to the Jews themselves in the future.</p>
      <p>For nothing seems to remain more to save the remnants of Israel than a clear explanation of the divine oracles and their presentation before the eyes in three languages, so that through the holy word of God, all may be converted to the faith of Christ.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most learned Bullinger, you will render this service first to Christ the Savior, then to his holy church, by allowing yourself to be encouraged and urged to such a noble task together with our Pellican. The Lord Jesus, the true Messiah, will not only assist and aid you with grace but will also undoubtedly respond most abundantly to your holy labors both now and in the future.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most learned man, and interpret this our endeavor, since it is pious, in the best part according to your Christian modesty, I pray.</p>
      <p>In Torgau, on the 10th day before the calends of April in the year 1541 from the redemption of the world. Marcus Crödel, a teacher of the literary school in Torgau, and some others who love the Lord Jesus, devoted to your learning and piety.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy professor of sacred literature among the noble Swiss in Zurich, my esteemed lord.</p>
