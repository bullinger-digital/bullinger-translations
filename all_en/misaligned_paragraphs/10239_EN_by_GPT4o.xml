    <p xml:id="regest1">Concerned about Zurich's unilateral action in the mandate dispute, Haller sends a trustworthy messenger to Bullinger on behalf of Bernhard Tillmann. Through this messenger, he is to inform the people of Bern about everything he can find out regarding Zurich's motives, the proceedings of the meeting in Einsiedeln, and the composition and disposition of the Zurich council. Bern intends to send a message to the Five Places. There are war rumors from Lucerne; Zurich and Bern are equally at risk, unity is necessary. In Bern, there is a fear that Zurich might be tempted into a separate agreement with the Five Places. Haller again requests Bullinger's commentary notes on the Gospel of John. Popularity of Bullinger's commentaries. Relaxation in the relationship between Haller and Megander. Haller wants to respond to Pellikan's letter, which he received through a Frenchman, on another occasion.</p>

      <p>Greetings. So that you can see how our local lords do not want to be absent from the matter, we are sending this messenger to you (at the command and expense of the treasury, which I want you alone to know), by which we remind you to very certainly inquire from your people what has been done at the Diet of Einsiedeln, and by what means, and with what hope your people are being deceived. Once you have found this out, as you certainly can, describe it to me in our language through this messenger. Press on, act, do not neglect this. Here you have a messenger, whom we do not send unless there is a need for utmost fidelity and silence. You may trust him with everything. Provide him with a small gift, so that he is not harassed here and there, which I will do for your people most willingly.</p>
      <p>Today it was decreed by the diocese that messengers should be sent to the Antronians. It will be openly indicated to them what the attitude of the Bear (Bern) is. They will be asked what they themselves are striving for. And all these things will be communicated to all parts of the Swiss on the same day, unless I am mistaken. For we are warned by so many and so often and in such various ways that we have nothing more certain - except for our own fault - than war.</p>
      <p>We have written in recent days through Eckstein about what has been discovered by Jacob Wagner. Other and greater things are reported to us daily. If you hope for peace at our inconvenience, as we do not trust, nothing less will happen to you. We know they are more hostile to us than to you, because, as they say, they have washed their hands in your blood. They thirst for ours. When they have partly drunk it, then they promise peace. This was reported to me by a refugee from Lucerne from WÃ¤gge. Therefore, act so that our plans are common. The whole field has agreed on this with very few exceptions, that they are ready to expose not only their lives for us but also for the brothers and confederates who are companions in our religion. Ensure that through this messenger we perceive everything that has been done and is still being done at the Diet. We demand this from you, whom we recognize as a brother in Christ and no less a Bernese than a Zurich citizen, even if Bern does not benefit you, yet you wish to do good. He will not return but will wait with you until you can report back to me most fully what I ask. Furthermore, also describe how your senate is doing, both the minor and the diocesan. For we fear, and thus the rumor has it with us, that both are very divided, that faith is safe nowhere, and that many practices are at hand. Therefore, indicate what is to be trusted or thought in this part.</p>
      <p>We regret very much the poor writing of your people to us, from which we can infer nothing else than that you want to make your own arrangements, and if you make peace, you might sow our discord all the better; for it is to be feared that they want to appease you for this, and it would have happened long ago if Bern had not taken it upon itself.</p>
      <p>Dear brother Heinrich, if you have ever written to me, now write. Oh, how I wish you would send your commentaries on John with this messenger. I am eager. I would return it in a month. I know you have collected them again. And if only you could see how eagerly the parish priests buy your explanation on the Romans! You would not regret any of your labor. Today I had someone from the Seven Valleys who bought everything that has been published so far and will buy whatever you will ever publish. I beg you to respond and satisfy everything at once.</p>
      <p>My man has become milder again. If only sincerely! For I desire nothing more than sincerity.</p>
      <p>Indicate who the assessors are, who the judge is, who the arbitrators are.</p>
      <p>Yesterday we received a certain Frenchman recommended by you. Since he brought letters from Pellican, I will respond to him on another occasion.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Take care of the matter, not words. Ah, my brother, if only you knew with what spirit and from whose spirits I write to you.</p>
      <p>April 2nd, 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know inside and out.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his brother as if by blood, always most beloved.</p>
