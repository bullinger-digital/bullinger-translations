    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks God that he [Ottheinrich I. von der Pfalz] has been led to the [Gospel] and prays for his steadfastness against opponents; these have circulated writings against the evangelical truth - which they label as heretical; among them Johannes Cochläus, who attacked Ottheinrich's efforts, the [Zürich] church, Bullinger, and his writing "De scripturae sanctae authoritate"; Bullinger defended himself with a "Responsio"; in response, Cochläus published a "Replica" on May 15 [1544], which Bullinger received from friends in October; against this, Bullinger now writes the [present] second response, which he [from line 61] introduces with the treatise "De sancta Christi catholica ecclesia", as the opponent does not consider the churches inclined to the Gospel and opposed to the Pope and his clergy as churches of Christ; however, preachers in Switzerland and Germany agree with [the Zürichers], so Bullinger also defends himself against the accusation of apostasy; he asks [Ottheinrich] for favorable reception. The word "church", borrowed from Greek, originally meant nothing other than a political "assembly" and was adopted into the sacred language, where it denotes the community of saints or the community of those who believe in the Gospel of Christ. For practical reasons, various designations are used to distinguish different parts of the general church of all believers (including those who are only so in appearance): the specific churches of a certain place; the Old Church of believers living before the arrival of Christ; the Church of the New People since Christ's incarnation, which is no longer designated by the unsuitable word "synagogue"; the "ecclesia militans" of all living believers; the "ecclesia triumphans" of all deceased believers already reigning with Christ in heaven; the visible church of all people, recognizable by confession and participation in the sacraments; the invisible church of truly redeemed people known only to God; the true and holy church of all good and holy people mentioned in the [Apostolic] Creed; and the false and malicious church, warned against by David (Ps. 25, 4). After explaining these designations, the already mentioned "sancta ecclesia catholica" is to be examined more closely; for some, this means all the righteous who truly believe in Christ and are sanctified by his Spirit; others summarize this as the "communion of saints"; Bullinger defines this church as follows: the community of all believers and saints living on earth, united by the Spirit - united by their faith in the sanctifying head Christ and mutually by brotherly love. Statements of Paul prove that the "sancta ecclesia catholica" encompasses the gathering or community of all believers living on earth, sanctified by the Holy Spirit, God's will, and Christ's blood, who believe in Christ and call upon him; what the Apostolic Creed summarizes as the "communion of saints" - a formula not found in Cyprian [actually Rufinus] nor in Augustine; [Paul] symbolizes the community with the image of a body, whose members one becomes through baptism. This community of the church exists on the one hand through the connection between church and Christ, on the other hand through the connection of the church members with each other. The first is abundantly shown by the prophetic and apostolic writings, especially the wedding parable, in which Christ is depicted as the bridegroom, the church as the bride. With the words: "we believe the church holy and catholic" the creed emphasizes the close connection between church and Christ, noting that it does not say: "We believe in the holy catholic church"; the use of the preposition "in" is explicitly rejected or correctly explained by Cyprianus [actually Rufinus], Augustine (quoted from the Decretum [Gratiani]), Paschasius [Radbertus] honored by Gregory [the Great] [actually Faustus of Riez], and Thomas Aquinas; the latter also applies to the understanding of the [Nicene] Creed; belief is in God, not in the church. Also, the designations of Christ as the head of the church body, as the foundation or cornerstone, as well as the parable of the vine (Christ) and the branches (the believers) indicate the close relationship between church and Christ. Consequently, it is blasphemous when the Roman chair, the man of sin (2Thess 2, 3), declares itself as the head of the whole church on earth; similarly delusional is the presumption of the sinful cardinals, bishops, and prelates of the Roman church, who claim the primacy in the church in the name of Christ; what do they make of Peter's admonition (1Pet 5, 1-3), whose successors they claim to be? The cohesion among believers [the other reference of the formula "communion of saints"] results from the close cohesion effected by the Spirit and love of the members of the church connected with the head Christ. The church is called holy, unique, and catholic - universal - because there is only one, as Cyprian and the Holy Scripture show. Even if different parts of the church are distinguished for didactic reasons, there is only one true universal church (also encompassing fallen hypocrites), the sum of different local churches, consisting of the Old and the New Church (both characterized by a common faith), as well as the "triumphans" and "militans", the visible and invisible church - each testified by biblical passages. The perception that there is only one church is comforting because it follows that all believers since the beginning of the world are co-heirs, friends, and household members with each other and with Christ. This church is also not - contrary to the opinion of the Donatists and the Roman church - to be restricted to one place, for the canonical truth makes all churches of Christ around the world equal; all have the same power, dignity, and honor, as the Lord (Mk 10, 43f) and Jerome's letter to Evagrios [actually Evangelos] prove; and even if Jerome says that the presbyters should appoint one of them to a higher rank as a remedy against schisms, this does not justify the chair revered by so many today; Bullinger has explained this in chapters 27 and 29 of his first response [to Cochläus]. From the foregoing, it is evident how the church, created by the Spirit and the Word, is preserved and cannot err (not in terms of its way of life, but in its doctrine); for the church is not any human society, but Christ's church, which knows the voice of its shepherd and follows it and does not follow another; which is founded on the foundation of the prophets and apostles and has Christ as the cornerstone; as an inner characteristic, it has the sanctification given by Christ's blood and maintained by faith; as external characteristics, the proclamation of the Word and the mediation of the sacraments; this is evident from New Testament passages; from Lactantius, Cyprian, Augustine, and Tertullian it is also evident that true worship is found only in the church, that those who separate from the mother church do not have God as their father, that there is no church without visible sacraments; sacraments, of which Augustine and Tertullian know only two - baptism and the Lord's Supper - and not seven (as the Papists do). It should also be noted that many only pretend to listen to the Word of God and participate in the sacraments; that there are again people who lack the external signs of the church and are nevertheless members of the holy church, as the example of Daniel and his companions shows and as is the case today for the believers oppressed by Mohammedan tyranny in Turkey, Greece, Asia, Ethiopia, and Africa; therefore it is certain that the church is neither bound to a place nor to external signs. In the use and adaptation of rites, there was great freedom in the church from the beginning; and as the rites became more numerous, pious men (like Augustine) were found who, to grant this freedom, kept away from all quarrels - but this does not mean superstitious, faith-contrary, and immoral customs. No member of the catholic church of Christ should therefore leave his assembly for trivial reasons, nor attend assemblies where Christ and his truth have no place; how serious schism is, several passages [of the Old and New Testaments] prove. From the foregoing, it is evident why the church is adorned with such outstanding epithets given by its bridegroom in the Holy Scripture. Bullinger has now explained what he thinks and believes about the holy catholic church of Christ, what he teaches about it, and how highly he values it. From this, it is evident how brazen [Cochläus] is when he claims that [the Protestants] have a false opinion of the church, assign no function to it, and hardly value it; assigning more to it than its bridegroom does brings it no honor; this is purely deceptive. Furthermore, the opponent cannot claim that what Bullinger has said about the church is not founded in Scripture; nor can he claim that it is only beautiful, empty words, for the morals and testimonies of the churches in Switzerland and Germany prove the opposite; these churches remain faithful to Christ, expect everything from him, and think that they need no other nor should marry another; hence the tears of the opponents; the latter regret that their nonsensical Roman head is rejected and salvation is attributed to Christ alone (and not to indulgences), that Christ's justification nullifies human righteousness, that the sanctification given by Christ questions the holiness of [Roman] ceremonies, that the purification [forgiveness] in Christ abolishes the gold-consuming purgatory, that such atoning power and priestly honor belong only to the head Christ, that other priests, atoning sacrifices, mediators, and [monastic] ways become superfluous. The aforementioned churches do not arise from human counsel, but from the proclamation of the Word of God and their connection with Christ; so if [Cochläus] claims that Bullinger has poisoned the Zürich church, this can only be true if the Gospel is equated with poison. It is therefore evident that these churches are not refuges for heretics and not meeting places of schismatics, but true, holy churches of Christ, thus catholic communities; with his slanders, the opponent only tries to elevate himself; [Ottheinrich] should not be shaken or deterred from what he has begun because of this; rather, he should always keep in mind the kings Hezekiah, Josiah, Valentinian, and Theodosius; out of love for him and as a future testimony to his zeal for truth, Bullinger has written this and dedicated this writing to him. In conclusion, Bullinger recommends to him the learned and pious preacher Adam Bartholomäus, along with the other church servants.</p>

      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent prince and lord, Lord Ottheinrich, Count Palatine of the Rhine and Duke of both Bavarias, my most gracious lord, Heinrich Bullinger's Exposition on the Holy Catholic Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>I give thanks to God the Father through our redeemer Jesus Christ, that you too, most illustrious prince and most gracious lord, have been enlightened by the holy and true word of His Gospel, and thus through you, the churches subject to your dominion have been freed from the errors and superstitions of human traditions.</p>
      <p>We earnestly pray to the same that He may confirm in you what He has begun, so that you may persevere to the end. For you know that salvation is promised not to those who begin well, but to those who happily finish what they have well begun. "He who endures to the end," says the Savior, "will be saved" [Mt 10, 22].</p>
      <p>Therefore, we experience daily that the devil, the enemy of our salvation, is vigilant and promotes plans of destruction through those in the world who, by placing scandals in the way, intercept those running rightly in the Lord's race and divert the prize from those who are about to overcome. We need not look far for examples of this kind. In everyone's hands are biting and slanderous pamphlets written against the evangelical truth. Furious speeches of many are heard hourly, who think it little to call the doctrine or preaching of the Gospel new, unless they also add heretical.</p>
      <p>What is more, as I understand from friends, that infamous slanderer of evangelical doctrine, John Cochläus, who lives like a snail or slug in his own juice (slander), is active in the vicinity. As he contradicts God and men, he also opposes your good beginnings and hinders the course of the Gospel wherever he can. Indeed, he has attacked our churches and me, their minister, living far away in Switzerland, with his venomous writings, even though I have no dealings with this man. However, since the sincere fear of God and pious zeal for religion, instigated by God, arouse the pious to vigilance, lest we sleep securely in both ears, as the saying goes, in the endeavors of such wicked men, I thought it neither pious nor Christian to ignore those writings of the slanderous man, full of scandals against our and other illustrious German churches, and not to remove the scandal placed. Therefore, I initially responded to his pamphlet, in which he hostilely attacks my book on the authority, certainty, firmness, and absolute perfection of Holy Scripture. I candidly send the published response with added letters to the antagonist. He immediately prepares a reply, which he published on May 15, but does not send it out of his own ingenuity. I only received it from friends in October. In it, he repeats and somewhat amplifies his insults. Again, compelled by Christian piety, the care of the churches entrusted to me, and faithful concern for the brethren, I write this second response, to which I now prefix this simple exposition of mine on the Holy Catholic Church of Christ. In this, I explain what I believe and teach should be believed about the Holy Catholic Church of Christ according to the Scriptures, and how honorably and religiously I think of it. Although I have often touched on this cause before, I now discuss it peculiarly and in a certain method, for no other reason than that I see the adversary considering all our churches believing in the Gospel of Christ and unwilling to worship the church of the pope and prelates not as churches of Christ, but as refuges of heretics and conventicles of schismatics, claiming they have defected from the Holy Church of Christ. Therefore, with the sword of the Word of God, I will once and for all cut through that Gordian, indeed serpentine knot of the adversary, in which he has gathered almost all the heads of his virulent accusation.</p>
      <p>What I teach and profess about the Holy Catholic Church of Christ from the Scriptures, others also know that the ministers of the churches preaching the Gospel throughout Switzerland and Germany feel and teach with me, who hear their doctrine or read their books, so that with this exposition of mine, I not only continue to clear the native Swiss but also the other associated German churches from the most atrocious crime of defection alleged. I pray, however, your piety, most illustrious prince, to hear these things of mine with pious and patient ears. For I hope these will bear their fruit. "Church" is a word borrowed from the Greeks, meaning "assembly" in Latin, that is, a people called together to hear about the affairs of the republic. For ἐκκλησιάζειν is to speak at an assembly, and ἐκκλησιαστὴς is one who speaks publicly before a multitude. Hence Saint Luke in Acts chapter 19 [Apg 19, 39] used "church" for "assembly" or "congregation" that gathered publicly. The term was transferred to sacred use and began to be called the "church" of the communion of saints or the congregation believing in the holy Gospel of Christ.</p>
      <p>For the sake of teaching, it is divided into universal and special or particular, into the church of the ancients who lived before the coming of Christ, and of the new people who believed in the Lord after Christ's coming, into the militant and triumphant church, into visible and invisible, into the true and holy church of the good and the false or polluted of the wicked. The general church is the collection and assembly of all the faithful, even those who confess with their mouth to be Christians and participate in the sacraments, although they do not at all correspond to their profession. Of it, the Lord says: "The kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea and gathering fish of every kind" [Mt 13, 47]. The special or particular church, however, comprehends a certain number of believers. For Paul wrote to the church of the Romans, the Corinthians, the Galatians, and the Ephesians. In the letter to the Colossians, he uses "church" for a faithful family, saying: "Greet Nympha and the church in her house" [Kol 4, 15]. The church of the ancients is the society of all those who believed in God before the incarnation of Christ, just as the church of the new people is the assembly of all those who believed in Christ from the incarnation. Where I wanted to note that the assembly of saints was called a synagogue by the ancients, after the Gospel was preached, a church. For the name of the synagogue was unpleasant, as most understood it to mean the collection of Jews. Therefore, as the name of the doctrine was newly given and called the Gospel, so the assembly of those who believed in the Gospel began to be called the church.</p>
      <p>No one, however, is ignorant that a synagogue is nothing other than a congregation. For "συνάγειν" means to gather or contract into one. The militant church is the congregation of all the faithful who, still acting on earth, are fighting, contending with flesh and blood, with Satan and the world, struggling from earthly to heavenly things. For the triumphant society is of those who, having trampled death through death, sin, the world, and the devil, now reign with Christ the King in the heavens and triumph over all enemies. The visible church is that which is recognized by all men from confession and participation in the sacraments as a church. It is called invisible, not because the people are invisible, but because it does not appear to the eyes of men who truly believe and who do not, and is open only to the eyes of God. The true and holy church of the good on earth is the society of all saints. Confessing it in the creed, we say: "I believe in one holy catholic church, the communion of saints." David spoke of the false and wicked church. "I have not sat," he says, "with the council of vanity, and I will not mix with those who act wickedly. I have hated the church of the wicked, and I will not sit with the impious" [Ps 25, 4]. Having explained these common and accepted terms in this matter, let us now see what the holy catholic church of God truly is on earth, about which we have promised to speak. Some have not badly defined it. The church is the congregation of all the righteous who truly believe in Christ and are sanctified by the Spirit of Christ. Others, more briefly, conclude the matter by saying, "The church is the communion of saints." It could also be described in this way: The church is the assembly of all the faithful on earth and a very close union and society cohering by the Spirit; first indeed through faith to the head Christ sanctifying it, and then to each other through mutual charity.</p>
      <p>In this description, the first thing to be considered, indeed demonstrated, is that the church is called and is the assembly of all believers on earth, a collection or communion. Paul, therefore, writing to the churches of the Romans, Galatians, and Philippians, writes to all the saints in them, whence it follows that a particular church contains all the saints who are in it. Since the catholic church is nothing other than the collection of all particulars, who does not understand that the catholic church on earth is nothing other than the assembly of all the faithful? For lest anyone be astonished at the word saint or saints, it should be known that the apostle Paul calls no others saints than the faithful on earth, who are sanctified by the Holy Spirit of God, the will of the Father, and the blood of the Son of God. The same apostle, writing to the church of the Corinthians: "To the congregation," he says, "of God, which is at Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia" [2Kor 1, 1]. And again: "To the church of God, which is at Corinth, sanctified through Christ Jesus, called saints together with all who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place" [1Kor 1, 2] etc. The same apostle writes elsewhere that he persecuted the church of God, and again elsewhere he says that he received authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon the name of Christ. Whence it is clearly evident that the catholic church of God is the assembly of all in the world who believe and call upon the name of Christ. I think those who added "the communion of saints" to the Apostolic Creed, confessing "the holy church," had this in mind.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, neither Cyprian nor Augustine remembered that part in the exposition of the creed. To this belongs also the apostle's statement: "As the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and have all been made to drink into one Spirit; for the body is not one member, but many" [1Kor 12, 12-14].</p>
      <p>And shortly after: "Now you are the body of Christ and members individually. And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets" [1Kor 12, 27f] etc. We think these suffice for the explanation of what we said in the description: the catholic church is the assembly of all believers in the world.</p>
      <p>The members of the church, therefore, are all believers. And although there is a certain dignity and excellence among the members, yet the lowest member in the church is no less a true member of the church than the highest.</p>
      <p>We now descend to the exposition of what we said, that the church is a very close union and society etc. And first, we will speak of the union that the church has with Christ, then of the mutual society of the members of the church among themselves.</p>
      <p>We are united to Christ by the Spirit and faith in the closest communion and society, and thus to God Himself through Christ, so that He lives in us and we in Him, and communicates all His goods to us, as the prophetic and apostolic scripture demonstrates and illustrates with the most beautiful allegories and parables, especially of marriage. For it depicts a marriage between the Son of God, whom it calls the bridegroom, and the church, which it calls the bride, signifying the closest bond by which the church is united to Christ. The words of the apostle will explain this, who writes to the Ephesians: "So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church, for we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones. For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church" [Eph 5, 28-32]. All these are Paul's words. Marriage makes the two one body, whence the man is commanded to leave father and mother and cleave to his body. For marriage is not only a covenant of life but also a new kind of incorporation and a conjunction and indissoluble bond of all fortunes, communicating to the other as one's own. Such a bond is in a way between Christ and the church. Christ assumed our flesh, becoming ours in all things, and moreover, our flesh became His, which, however, contracted no impurity from our contact and fellowship. For He, being the Holy of Holies, conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, sanctifies and purifies His unclean church, washing it from all sins and by His contact conferring upon it His purity, if only it, not devoid of the Holy Spirit, believes that He has been given to it by God as sanctification, righteousness, and redemption. The apostle again testifying: "You were once impure, but you were washed and sanctified, but you were also justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God" [1Kor 6, 11].</p>
      <p>I think the article of faith from the Apostles' Creed should be referred here: "For we believe in the holy catholic church." We confess that all the faithful dispersed throughout the world are one society and indeed holy, that is, purged from sins by the Spirit and blood of Christ. Some contend that one must believe in the church, without author and without reason. Both ancient and modern writers have warned of this before me. For Cyprian in the Exposition of the Creed says: "He did not say 'in the holy church.' For if he had added the preposition 'in,' it would have been the same as the previous ones." Now, however, the syllable of the preposition separates the Creator from the creatures, and the divine is separated from the human. Augustine also reads in On Faith and the Creed: "I believe in the holy church" and not "in the holy church." His words are cited in De consecratione, distinction 4, chapter prima, which teaches us not to believe in the church, but to believe in God while living in the church.</p>
      <p>Paschasius also in the book On the Holy Spirit 1, chapter 1: "We believe the church," he says, "as the mother of regeneration, not in the church as the author of salvation. He who believes in the church believes in man. For man did not begin from the church, but the church began from man. Therefore, depart from this persuasion of blasphemy, that you think you should believe in any human creature, since it is not at all to be believed in an angel or archangel."</p>
      <p>The ignorance of some has dragged and snatched the preposition 'in' from the nearby and adjacent sentence into the subsequent one and imprudently added it from excess." These are Paschasius's words, whose book was highly approved by blessed Gregory.</p>
      <p>But also Thomas Aquinas in the Second of the Second, article 9, question 1 on faith: "If it is said," he says, "'I believe in the holy church,' it is to be understood that our faith refers to the Holy Spirit, who sanctifies the church, so that the sense is, 'I believe in the Holy Spirit sanctifying the church.' But it is better and according to more common usage, that 'in' is not placed there, but it is simply said 'the holy catholic church,' as even Pope Leo says." We have taken these from Aquinas. Now, what the fathers confess in the Constantinopolitan Creed, that they believe in the Holy Spirit, who spoke: "εἰς μίαν καθολικὴν καὶ ἀποστολικὴν ἐκκλησίαν," in one holy and apostolic church, does not have the sense that some follow. For the fathers do not confess that they believe in one church, but rather they confess that the Holy Spirit, in whom they believe, spoke through the prophets, in one holy and apostolic church. Therefore, they confess that there is one spirit of both peoples and testaments, one spirit of the prophets and apostles, who has worked in both what is of salvation in one catholic church. However this may be, it is certain that the saints believe in God, not in the church, and again believe the church, as far as it is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, follows the word of its bridegroom, and proposes it to be followed. But enough of this.</p>
      <p>We return to the mystery of union. Here belongs another allegory of the head and members. For Paul to the Ephesians: "God," he says, "gave Christ a name above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come, and put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all" [Eph 1, 21-23]. And again: "The husband is the head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the church, and He is the Savior of the body" [Eph 5, 23]. Behold, the apostle briefly explains what it is to be the head of the church, namely, to give salvation to the body. For as the head in the constitution of the human body seems to supply the whole body with vital power, so the church receives from the virtue, operation, and spirit of Christ what it is and lives. Moreover, the prophets and apostles gladly use the parable of the building and foundation, signifying the same society of Christ and the church. For they constitute Christ as the foundation itself, upon which they immediately place and build the church as a building. This will be made clearer by testimonies. In Isaiah, you read: "Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I lay in Zion a stone for a foundation, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; whoever believes will not act hastily" [Jes 28, 16]. The same testimony was also frequently used by our Lord Jesus Christ in the holy Gospel. Paul certainly: "No other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" [1Kor 3, 11]. And again: "You are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit" [Eph 2, 19-21]. The same is most significantly repeated by the holy apostle Peter in 1 Peter chapter 2 [1Petr 2, 6]; in the Gospel, the Lord says: "On this rock," He says, "I will build My church" [Mt 16, 18]. But the rock, according to Paul's interpretation, is Christ. Therefore, the church is placed upon Christ, adhering to and fixed in Christ, instructed by Christ for every good, and through Him even overcoming the gates of hell. Again, we read in the Gospel that the Lord said: "I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away, and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit" [Joh 15, 1f]. This is the envelope; the explanation of the envelope follows: "You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned" [Joh 15, 1-6]. I do not think there is a need for more extensive and clearer words. For who does not understand that by the Spirit through faith we are grafted into and united with Christ and consequently share in all the gifts and goods of Christ? The vine and the branches are of the same nature, and it irrigates them; therefore, the faithful are one with Christ, whom He irrigates and fructifies with His juice, I mean His Spirit, so that they may bring forth various fruits of good works. From these, I think it is clear that the church, that is, the assembly of the faithful, is such a union, by which the Lord has most closely joined it to Himself, imparting all good to it, cleansing and purifying it, living in it, animating and invigorating it, to bring forth the fruits of truly good works. And although from the whole discussion it has not obscurely become clear that faith and the Spirit are the bond by which the church adheres to and is united with Christ, I will nevertheless add one or two evident testimonies of Scripture on this same matter.</p>
      <p>Paul to the Romans 8: "If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His" [Rm 8, 9]. And: "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God" [Rm 8, 14]. "And if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ" [Rm 8, 17]. To which John responds in his canonical: "By this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us" [1Joh 3, 24]. And again: "By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit" [1Joh 4, 13].</p>
      <p>Again, the apostle Paul: "Christ," he says, "dwells in your hearts through faith" [Eph 3, 17]. To which John again responds, saying: "Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God" [1Joh 4, 15]. But to confess is the most proper work of faith. Therefore, by the Spirit through faith as a bond, we are united to Christ our King, Lord, and Head. Whoever lacks this bond, that is, who does not have the Spirit of Christ and is devoid of living faith in Christ, is not a partaker of the society of saints nor a member of the body of Christ, as the Lord Himself clearly testifies: "If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned" [Joh 15, 6]. Again, the apostle John: "God," he says, "is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him" [1Joh 4, 16]. Therefore, we do not separate the love of God from faith and the Spirit.</p>
      <p>Thus, those who rightly understand and believe the most open words of God see how gross and blasphemous is the error of Rome, that is, the seat of many errors, daring to assert that the pope - that is, the man of sin - is the head of the militant church throughout the whole world. The head gives salvation to the body, namely, the Roman pontiff provides it to the church. The body is joined to the head, the church to Christ by the Spirit and love through faith. But who, unless thrice sacrilegious, would place such a bond between the militant church and that foolish and blasphemous Roman head? With no less madness, the cardinals, bishops, and prelates of the Roman church usurp the name and primacy of the church of Christ, when most of them by their works testify how little or nothing they have of faith in Christ, so that they seem not even to hold the lowest place in the church, much less the first. What, that blessed Peter, whose successors they falsely boast themselves to be, left written: "The elders who are among you I exhort—I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed—shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly; nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock" [1Petr 5, 1-3]? In the same way, Saint Paul said: "Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God" [1Kor 4, 1].</p>
      <p>Also: "I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth, not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy" [2Kor 1, 23]. But leaving these, let us return to the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>The church is a certain body, which, as Paul said, is constituted of many members [1Kor 12, 12]. These, however, adhere to each other through the consensus of religion, through the unity of the Spirit, and especially through charity. That consensus among the members arises from the communion of Christ. For since He, as the Lord of the church, the King and only Head, has fitted all the faithful to Himself as members, sons, brothers, and co-heirs, the church cannot hate the bride of its bridegroom, the members, sons, and co-heirs; rather, it loves them most intensely, as the apostle John testifies, saying: "Everyone who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him" [1Joh 5,1]. "If someone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?" [1 Joh 4, 20f]. Wishing to present this union and congruence before the eyes, the apostle uses the parable of the members in the human body, writing to the Romans: "For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another" [Rm 12, 4f]. The same in the 12th of the first to the Corinthians more copiously and significantly expounding the same parable of the head and members and especially of these, testifies that there is the highest and most congruent consensus, diligent care, and most faithful help among the lowest and highest members of the church [1Kor 12, 12-30]. And more briefly also testifying that the saints on earth are connected by charity: "Above all," he says, "put on love, which is the bond of perfection" [Kol 3, 14]. Making mention of both unions - ours with Christ through the Spirit and faith and of all the saints among themselves through charity - the apostle John in his Canonical says: "That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ" [1Joh 1, 3] etc.</p>
      <p>This church of God is called holy, unique, and catholic - that is, universal - because it is not allowed to find more. Discussing this unity of the church excellently, the blessed martyr of Christ Cyprian in the treatise On the Simplicity of Prelates says: "The church is one," he says, "which is extended more widely into a multitude by the increase of fertility, just as there are many rays of the sun, but one light, and many branches of a tree, but one strength founded on a tenacious root. And when from one source many streams flow, although the number seems to be diffused by the abundance of overflowing, yet unity is preserved in the origin. Separate a ray of the sun from its body, the division of light does not admit unity. Break a branch from a tree, the broken one will not be able to sprout. Cut off a stream from its source, the cut-off will dry up. So also the church of the Lord, filled with light, extends its rays throughout the whole world - yet it is one light that is diffused everywhere, nor is the unity of the body separated -, extends its branches in abundance throughout the whole earth, expands its flowing streams more widely. Yet there is one head and one origin, and one mother rich in the successes of fertility" and the rest. But concerning this unity of the church, we have not only human but also divine testimonies. For in the Song of Songs we read: "My dove, my perfect one, is the only one" [Hhld 6, 8]. To which Paul, looking, said to the Ephesians: "There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all" [Eph 4, 4-6].</p>
      <p>Therefore, although the church is divided into many species for teaching purposes due to different accidents, it remains one true church. To understand this more correctly, we will go through the previous nomenclatures or species of the church.</p>
      <p>The universal church comprehends all who profess the Gospel, even hypocrites, for the apostle John says of these: "They went out from us, but they were not of us" [1Joh 2, 19]. Who does not see that the church of the saints remains one perpetually, which is not divided, and is rather purified by the apostasy or revelation of hypocrites? For Saint Augustine most religiously in book 7 against the Donatists chapter 51 thinks that the wicked are in the church, as chaff is in the wheat, tares in the field, traitors among citizens, and deserters among soldiers. But it is manifest that the wheat is made purer, the field more joyful, the citizens safer, and the soldiers stronger when chaff, tares, traitors, and deserters depart from them. Moreover, the unity of the church is not divided by particular or special churches, as a kingdom is not divided by the abundance of many cities. For a kingdom is constituted of many cities, just as a whole body is made up of many members.</p>
      <p>Again, that the faith is the same, the church is the same of those who were before Christ and those who were after Christ; it is proved by what Saint Peter says that the Spirit of Christ was in the prophets [1Petr 1, 10f], and what Saint Paul writes to the Corinthians, that all the fathers ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ [1Kor 10, 3f]. Nor are there many vineyards, but only one vineyard of the Lord, in which different laborers work under different times. In what things we differ from the ancients has been said elsewhere more often. Now indeed the triumphant church has not found another head, another militant. This one sees in a mirror, what that one sees face to face. Nor does charity cease in the saints. Hence it is that there is perpetually one body, one church of the blessed and those to be blessed. Therefore, the apostle to the Hebrews, speaking of the fathers, says: "All these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, did not receive the promise, God having provided something better for us" [Hebr 11, 39f]. Thus the unity of the church is not divided because one is called visible, another invisible. For if the visible has faith, the invisible gift of God, it is the same with the invisible, not different. Moreover, as there is one church of the wicked, so there is only one of the pious. That there is one body of all the wicked from the beginning of the world is most clearly argued by what the Lord said in Matthew: "Upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar" [Mt 23, 35] etc.</p>
      <p>But that there is only one church has much consolation. For from this, we gather that we are both associates and co-heirs of Christ the Lord and of all the saints from the beginning of the world, friends and household members.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the Lord makes so much of the communion of His church that He considers him a deserter and apostate from religion, whoever separates himself from the Christian society, and He commends its authority so much that while it is violated, He considers His own diminished. "Whatever," He says, "you bind or loose on earth will be bound and loosed in heaven" [Mt 18, 18]. And they are schismatics who, although they do not err in the sincerity of doctrine or articles of faith, yet separate themselves from this unity of the church, which rightly worships God, attributes everything to one, asks everything from one, hears one, and seeks all fullness in the only Son.</p>
      <p>For this unity of the church consists first in the communion of Christ the head and members in the Spirit through faith, by which we are so united to Christ that He communicates all His goods to us, and we participate in His life, justification, and sanctification, and as members depend on the only head, asking everything from one, attributing everything to one, and adhering to Him alone with the greatest hope and love.</p>
      <p>Those who teach and seek salvation elsewhere than in Christ break this bond of the body of Christ. This unity of the church also consists in the unanimous consensus of sound doctrine, drawn from the word of God, in the firm observance of truth and faithful obedience, finally in the religious worship of God and the legitimate use of the sacraments handed down by the bridegroom. It does not quarrel hatefully and obstinately about rites in the church from the saints. About which we will soon say something. Whoever now, against the scripture, which is the word of God, against the articles of faith, and against the sound doctrines of the church born and nourished by the word of God, receives, chooses, hands down, follows, and pertinaciously retains and defends different and alien things from his own opinion or human choice, is a heretic. Moreover, the unity of the church consists in the unanimous, amiable, and charity-filled communion, and in the offices of charity of the saints, who so adhere to and mutually help each other with love, zeal, counsel, and aid, as the members of a man in the human body. Hence the apostle: "Bearing with one another," he says, "in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" [Eph 4, 2f] etc.</p>
      <p>Now, as there is one church, so it is said to be dispersed throughout the whole world, bound to no place. Therefore, John in the Gospel says that the Son of God died to gather into one the children of God who were scattered abroad [Joh 11, 52]. The Donatist heretics were foolish, who fixed the church to a certain place, asserting that the church was nowhere except among those infected with their error. Our Romans are not much different, who also do not recognize any true church of Christ in the world unless it has first subjected itself to the Roman see. But this is the tyranny of these men. The canonical truth makes all the churches of Christ throughout the world equal.</p>
      <p>This one does not desire to dominate that one, nor that one this one; in charity, they all embrace each other mutually and all recognize and celebrate Christ as their head, king, and pontiff. The same truth makes all the ministers of the churches equal. It testifies that all are of the same power, dignity, and honor, except that some have obtained more excellent gifts than others. But here the word of the Lord prevails most: "Whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant, and whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave" [Mk 10, 43f]. To this seems to pertain that famous sentence of Saint Jerome to Euagrius: "Nor is the church of the city of Rome to be considered different from that of the whole world. Both Gaul and Britain and Africa and Persia and the East and India and all barbarian nations worship one Christ, observe one rule of truth. If authority is sought, the world is greater than the city. Wherever there is a bishop, whether in Rome, or Eugubium, or Constantinople, or Rhegium, or Alexandria, or Tanis, he is of the same merit, and of the same priesthood. The power of wealth and the humility of poverty make a bishop either more sublime or inferior. Otherwise, all are successors of the apostles." These are his words. And although he says in the same letter that the presbyters chose one of themselves, whom they placed in a higher rank, as a remedy against schism, yet that does nothing for that seat, which is worshiped by many today. For as he does not subject all the churches throughout the world to one Roman see, so it is a human invention, and today lacks the end for which it was established. For those who sit in that seat disperse more than they gather, who sell what is Christ's, and impose their laws on the church instead of the word of Christ, bringing us Antichrist, not Christ.</p>
      <p>About which I said something in chapters 27 and 29 of my first response. However, it will not be difficult to gather from what has been brought forth so far, whence the church arises or how it is planted or even preserved. It does not arise from the earth or the dispensation, will, and favor of the Roman pontiff, but through the Spirit and the word of God from heaven. For if the church is the assembly or collection of all believers, if it is united with Christ by faith and the Spirit - and by the Spirit, the unity of faith and charity coheres with all the saints; but the Spirit, faith, and charity are heavenly gifts -, the church certainly arises from heaven. Again, if faith is from hearing, and hearing through the word of God, if also the church is rightly said to be generated from the word of God, it is certainly most rightly believed to be born from God. For Paul says: "In Christ Jesus through the Gospel I have begotten you" [1Kor 4, 15]. And Peter: "You have been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever, which is the very word that was preached to you through the Gospel" [1Petr 1, 23-25]. But the church is planted, governed, and preserved by the same word of God by which it is generated. For the apostle again says: "Christ gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints, for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ; from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love" [Eph 4, 11-16]. These we have brought forth from the apostolic writings so far, how the church is planted and preserved. Therefore, the church of Christ will not be built or preserved by any human arms or counsels or practices. For the Lord, about to gather the catholic church from the whole world, did not send soldiers, but preachers of His word, who would subdue the world to Christ with the sword of the word of God. Indeed, Christ Himself is said to slay Antichrist with no other sword than the spirit of His mouth [2Thess 2, 8].</p>
      <p>And the apostle Paul, writing to the Corinthians, says: "When I came to you, brethren, I did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God" [1Kor 2, 1-5].</p>
      <p>But this church, which is born, governed, and preserved by the Spirit, faith, and word of Christ, does not err (we speak of errors of faith and doctrine, not of vices of life and morals), not because it is a collection of men, but because it is the church of Christ, that is, of which the Lord Jesus Himself said: "The sheep follow the shepherd, for they know his voice. Yet they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers" [Joh 10, 4f]. Therefore, Cyprian is read to have said of it: "The bride of Christ cannot be adulterated, she is incorrupt and chaste. She knows one house, she guards the sanctity of one chamber with chaste modesty." Otherwise, indeed, that scripture is always true: "Every man is a liar, but God alone is true" [Rm 3, 4]. Because, therefore, the true and holy church of Christ follows its own will in nothing, but everywhere and in all things depends on the one word of God, in which there are no shadows, no errors, it is therefore said not impiously that the church of Christ does not err. For Paul also wrote to Timothy: "These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly; but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth" [1Tim 3, 14f]. Why, I ask, is it the pillar and ground of the truth? Because it rests upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, who is the rock and the very truth. Therefore, truly and properly, the word of God itself, by which the church is governed, is the pillar and ground of the truth, and the church, because of the word of God, on which it rests, is the pillar and ground of the truth. Therefore, whatever the church judges, it judges according to the word of Christ, and it judges nothing at all without the word and against the word of Christ. It subjects itself in all things to the rule of the word of God, nowhere does it claim dominion over the word of God. To this pertains that most evident prophecy concerning the Spirit, the word, and the church of Christ in Isaiah chapter 59: "This is My covenant with them: 'My Spirit who is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your descendants, nor from the mouth of your descendants' descendants,' says the Lord, 'from this time and forevermore'" [Jes 59, 21]. And in this way, the church is both daughter and mother. For it is generated from the word, and it generates and nourishes by the same word of God. Hence, truly, the mother of the faithful, the church, is highly esteemed by its pious children. To which that of Cyprian pertains: "He cannot have God as his father who does not have the church as his mother. This keeps us for God, this assigns the sons it has begotten to the kingdom. Whoever, separated from the church, is joined to an adulteress, is separated from the promises of the church" etc. Moreover, the church, which is neither born nor governed and preserved by the Spirit and word of Christ, does not at all deserve to be called the holy church of Christ, as the Lord again testifies in the Gospel, saying: "He who is of God hears God's words" [Joh 8, 47], whence it follows that those who do not hear the word of God are not of God. The same Lord denies that the Jews are His sheep, nor does He allege any other cause than that they neither believe nor obey His word. From all these, there is no one who does not gather what kind of church that is, which not only does not hear the word of God but persecutes and extinguishes those who believe the word of the Gospel, and moreover relies entirely on human traditions. But today it claims for itself the primacy and dominion over the whole church of Christ. But speaking of such, the Lord pronounced: "Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him" [Joh 8, 43f].</p>
      <p>But leaving these, let us proceed to demonstrate more clearly that the church is marked by the word of Christ and faith in Christ as the most certain note, that is, to explain a little more significantly by what notes the Lord has designated for us His true and visible church. Indeed, only God knows the invisible church, who are His, and who will persevere to the end. Yet, because it is useful to know who are to be considered the children of God, God has accommodated Himself to us in this part. He wanted faith to be estimated from charity and repentance, so that we may recognize as members of the church those who, by open confession of faith, penitent life, and participation in the sacraments, confess the same God and Christ with us. Wherever, therefore, the pure word of God is preached and heard in its genuine and orthodox sense, not corrupted and depraved, where true repentance and remission of sins in the name of Christ flourish, where the sacraments are legitimately exercised according to the institution of Christ, where faithful prayers are poured out to God the Father through Christ, where, I say, there is faithful and continual adoration, invocation, and worship of the eternal God, there is the true church of Christ. Let us hear divine and human testimonies about these. Saint Paul: "Christ," he says, "loved the church and gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish" [Eph 5, 25-27]. You have in these the internal and external notes of the holy catholic church. The internal is the sanctification made freely by the blood of Christ and accepted by faith. The external notes are the word and the washing of water, by which he understood the preaching of the word of Christ and the dispensation of the sacraments.</p>
      <p>In 2 Timothy 2, the same says: "The solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: 'The Lord knows those who are His,' and 'Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity'" [2Tim 2, 19]. Moreover, we read in the Acts of the Apostles that the Jews, having heard the preaching of Saint Peter, were cut to the heart and said to the apostles: "What shall we do?"; but Peter replied: "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" [Apg 2, 38]. And again: "And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers" [Apg 2, 42]. The faithful have in these few things the most certain and manifest notes of the holy church of Christ, so that there is no need for repetition. Discussing this true church of Christ, the ancient writer Lactantius in the book of Institutions 4, chapter 30, says: "The only catholic church is the one that retains the true worship. This is the fountain of truth, this is the dwelling of faith, this is the temple of God, into which if anyone does not enter, or from which if anyone departs, he is alien from the hope of life and eternal salvation." But because even heretics think their church is catholic, it should be known that it is true where there is religion, confession, and repentance, which healthily cures the sins and wounds to which the weakness of the flesh is subject. Cyprian the martyr also in On the Simplicity of Prelates says: "Whoever," he says, "is separated from the church, is joined to an adulteress, is separated from the promises of the church. Nor does he pertain to the rewards of Christ, who leaves the church of Christ; he is alien, profane, an enemy. He cannot have God as his father who does not have the church as his mother. If he could escape who was outside the ark of Noah, he will escape who is outside the church" etc. To this pertains what Saint Augustine writes in the book Against Faustus the Manichean 19, chapter 11, in these words: "Men cannot be gathered into any name of religion, whether true or false, unless they are united by some visible fellowship of signs or sacraments." And the same author in more than one place, as well as Tertullian, enumerating the sacraments of that Christian society, counts not the seven papal ones, but the two Christian ones, baptism and the Lord's Supper.</p>
      <p>Here, however, it should be especially noted that many, without faith, hypocritically hear the word of God, pray intently in the sacred assembly, and also participate in the sacraments, but for this reason, they are not members of the holy church, although the external notes are found in them. For such sit at the wedding among the invited; but since they are not clothed with the wedding garment, they are cast into outer darkness.</p>
      <p>Again, others lack the external notes of the church, do not hear the external preaching of the word, do not participate in the sacraments of the church; not because they despise these, but because, detained in captivity and entangled in chains, or hindered by some other necessity, they are not given to hear and receive what they otherwise desire to hear and receive from the heart and, when allowed, frequent with the greatest joy of mind; and these are nonetheless members of the holy church. You have a living example in Daniel and his companions, who, taken to Babylon and alien from the sacred and assemblies of the people of God, were beloved and accepted by God, while in Jerusalem many daily attended the sacred assemblies, who were nonetheless an abomination to God. Which undoubtedly is also the case today. For many are found in Turkey, Greece, Asia, Ethiopia, and Africa, servants of Jesus Christ, who, excluded from the Christian rites by Mohammedan tyranny, are nonetheless members of the church, while among us you find many participating in our rites out of hypocrisy, who are nothing less than what they hear Christians. From these, we can certainly gather that the church is bound neither to a place nor to external notes; which, however, as handed down and received from Christ and the apostles, it faithfully and religiously uses and keeps when allowed.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, from the beginning, in the use and accommodation of external rites, it used great freedom, indeed it almost bound and burdened itself with no ceremonies. And when the rites had somewhat increased, yet pious and prudent men were found who, to maintain freedom in them, wanted all quarrels about them to be far away. About the moderate rites of the ancients, I say nothing of the superstitions of the pope. Saint Augustine, gravely disputing about this matter to Januarius, among other things, excellently says: "There is no better discipline in these for a grave and prudent Christian than to act in the way he sees the church act; to whatever place he may have come. For what is enjoined neither against faith nor against good morals is to be held indifferently, and is to be observed for the society of those among whom one lives." The same soon again says that the church of God, constituted among much chaff and many tares, tolerates many things, and yet does not approve, nor is silent, nor does what is against faith or good life. These so far about the notes of the Christian church.</p>
      <p>It should further be said what the catholic church of Christ devotes itself to, what it is occupied with, or what it works. It adores God in essence one, in persons three, but adores in spirit and truth; it worships Him with spiritual things and purity, with which it knows He is delighted. It exercises itself in faith and the word of God indefinitely, meditates on the law of the Most High God. It loves holy assemblies and congregations, loves the preaching of the word of God, with which it is both delighted and most affected. It prays most intently, invokes God the Father through Christ the mediator, praises His goodness most ampliously, and gives thanks for benefits most abundantly, and thus always exults in God its deliverer and savior.</p>
      <p>It gladly and joyfully communicates in the sacraments of its bridegroom in the assembly of the saints. As it is most observant of just discipline, so it voluntarily subjects itself to it, venerating its teachers and bishops as fathers. It purges itself from the contagions of the world, flees vices strenuously, pursues virtues with holy zeal, mortifies the old Adam, and is daily renewed to the image of its creator and redeemer, to whose will it conforms itself in all things and in all words, deeds, and in the whole conduct of life, offering itself as a living and rational sacrifice to God at every moment. It openly, candidly, outside of danger, whenever the glory of God requires, and even in the greatest dangers of things, with the loss of its possessions and even life, confesses God and Christ. For the same, it suffers much, and indeed willingly. For carrying the cross willingly, it follows Him who first entered into glory through the cross and ignominy. It also strengthens the weak, stirs up the slothful, consoles the sad; it leaves and tramples on present, perishable, and earthly things, to grasp and hold those future and eternal goods of its beloved bridegroom. Above all, it exercises itself in Christian charity, sincere and not feigned; it forgives all, serves and expends itself for all, harms no one, briefly fulfills all the duties of piety and holy life, always cheerful and indefatigable.</p>
      <p>For it is not without significant reason that the church is called by the teacher of the Gentiles and the most elect man "a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle" [Eph 5, 27]; which, although it does not have by its own benefit or virtue, but by the grace of Christ the bridegroom, nonetheless, since it is wholly turned to solid purity, and with all its strength (as I have explained so far) strives for holiness, the absolute purity, which it does not fully and according to the strict judgment of God achieve while living on earth, is imputed to it by the goodness and munificence of the bridegroom; to which that of the Savior pertains: "He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean," John 13 [Joh 13, 10]. Therefore, the true members of the catholic church of Christ do not rashly desert the congregation of the catholic church because of some blemishes with seditious schism; again, they avoid alien congregations outside of Christ and the truth, lest they pollute themselves with any profane rites. To which the apostle Paul, looking, says: "Let us consider one another," he says, "in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another" [Hebr 10, 24f]. And how great a crime schism is, can be gathered from this, that those who once made an idol were put to death by the usual sword; but those who wanted to make schisms, the leaders, the earth swallowed up, and the consenting crowd was consumed by fire. Again, the apostle Paul, teaching that the true members of Christ do not participate with the impious or idolaters: "What fellowship," he says, "has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness? And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? And what agreement has the temple of God with idols?" [2Kor 6, 14-16]. And the rest. And again: "You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the Lord's table and of the table of demons." 1 Cor. 10. [1Kor 10, 20]. Therefore, the holy church of Christ keeps itself pure from all contagion and profanation, which it always devotes itself wholly and in all things to sanctification most religiously.</p>
      <p>From what we have discussed so far about the catholic church of Christ, the pious can easily understand why it is adorned with so many excellent epithets, indeed worthy praises. For it is called in the scriptures the court of God, the house and place and temple of God, the city of the great King, Mount Zion, the holy city Jerusalem, the threshing floor of the Lord, the fold of Christ, the flock of the eternal God, the beautiful dove, the sister of the Lord, the bride of Christ, virgin and mother, mother and daughter, the immovable rock, the fruitful olive, the enclosed garden, the well of living waters, the sealed fountain etc. These are given by the munificent bridegroom and glorious King Jesus Christ. We are all invited by these most ample praises to the fellowship and society of the church, in which we are united to Christ the bridegroom and redeemer by faith and to all the saints by charity.</p>
      <p>I have explained so far, most illustrious prince, what I think from the scriptures about the holy catholic church of Christ, what I believe about it, how I finally teach about it publicly; how much I also adorn it, how I revere it, in whose most salutary fellowship I desire to adhere, in whose bosom I most religiously contain myself. I have explained what it is, how it is united to Christ the head by the Spirit through faith and to all the saints by charity, what benefit comes to the faithful from it. I have taught that there is only one, and in what the unity of the church consists.</p>
      <p>I have said whence the church arises, by what things it is planted and preserved, also by what it is recognized, marked with notes; moreover, what its studies are, what it is occupied with and exercises itself in, and how much it takes care not to separate itself anywhere from the union of the body either by morose schism or by participation in profane rites.</p>
      <p>Now, therefore, it is permissible to understand how slanderous and shameless my adversary and the adversary of all the churches throughout Germany believing in the Gospel of Christ is. Will he continue to say that we have a wrong opinion about the church of Christ? Do we assign nothing to the church, who assign to it what the scripture, the mouth of God, grants?</p>
      <p>Are we truly malign and sparing in proclaiming its praises? To assign more to it than He who joined it to Himself as a bride, for whom He also underwent death, is not to adorn it with just praises, but to stain it with foul lies.</p>
      <p>We gladly acknowledge whatever is granted to it everywhere in the scriptures, even if we have not inserted them in these of ours. Nor do we reject what the holy fathers, however august, have most ampliously discussed about it according to the analogy of faith and the rule of scripture.</p>
      <p>Perhaps he will say that these of ours are fabricated from ourselves, the same neither firm enough nor sufficiently proven. But he will be refuted by the testimonies of the scriptures cited and accommodated by me in this exposition. If, by his usual impudence, he continues to say that splendid things are indeed said here about the holy catholic church of Christ, but that ours differ from it more than twice through all, he will be refuted by the morals and testimonies of all the churches throughout Switzerland and Germany.</p>
      <p>Our churches have never defected from the very head Christ, have never separated themselves from the society of the holy catholic church, indeed they stand firm even now in the true unity of the church and will stand, God granting, to the end in those things in which the holy unity consists. The bond of the Spirit, faith, and charity remains whole and indissoluble. For there is and remains in our churches the true and living catholic and orthodox faith in God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These do not depart even a hair's breadth, as the saying goes, from the Apostolic Creed and the sound, right, open, and free confession of the saving faith of the ancient and apostolic church. All the pious in the churches acknowledge the mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God, the never sufficiently praised benefit of redemption, and the gratuitous justification of believers in the death of the Son of God.</p>
      <p>All adhere to Christ the redeemer, righteousness, head, king, pontiff, mediator, true God and man, intercessor, the only salvation of all the faithful, the way, the light, and the eternal life, and adhere to one indeed. For they do not acknowledge or receive another head with this or for this only, not another king and redeemer, not another righteousness, purification, and sanctification, not another high priest, not another sacrifice or offering for sin, not other mediators, not another salvation, light, way, and life either in heaven or on earth.</p>
      <p>In this way, our churches keep the virginal modesty and faith for the bridegroom Christ. Thus they adhere to one and depend entirely on one, so that they do not think they need others or can join themselves to others without crime; indeed, they know it is impious to communicate to others what belongs to the bridegroom alone. Hence the tears of the adversaries! It grieves them that the foolish Roman head is rejected, which has hitherto impiously sold itself as the head of the whole militant church. It grieves them that our churches attribute so much to the only redemption of Christ that they no longer want to redeem papal indulgences. It grieves them that in the justification of Christ, the righteousness of works and human merit, indeed injustice, is revealed.</p>
      <p>It grieves them that in the sanctification of Christ, the various sanctifications of ceremonies, and in the full purification of Christ, that golden-consuming purgatory of the pope is washed away and extinguished. It grieves them that our churches attribute to Christ the prince so fully the power of expiation and the high priesthood that they do not want to acknowledge another with this or for this as the high priest, not any other expiating priests, not any sacrifice for sin, not other intercessors, not another way, life, or salvation. For all our churches, taught by Saint Peter, unanimously cry out: "There is no salvation in any other. For there is no other name given among men by which we must be saved" [Apg 4, 12]. Let Cochläus see, therefore, who today, breaking that bond of the Spirit and faith and unity of the church, separates the bride from the bridegroom, leads the church away from the creator to creatures, or who, keeping the unity and most sacredly guarding the bond of faith, binds the church most closely to the one Christ the bridegroom as the most intact virgin.</p>
      <p>These our churches throughout Switzerland and Germany are not born from human counsels and constitutions from the earth, but through the preaching of the Gospel or the scriptures, the word of God, from heaven. For the first and solid authority in our churches is the scripture or the word of God. From the word of God, faith in Christ is taught. By faith, the faithful are grafted into and united with Christ.</p>
      <p>Finally, everything is instituted in these according to the lamp and rule of the word of God. By the word of God, the churches are planted, governed, and preserved. Therefore, what the adversary imputes to the church of Zürich (a city otherwise so illustrious, endowed with such power and dignity) that it lives on the poison offered by me, is as false as what is most false, unless to this furious slanderer the very Gospel of Christ seems to be poison, according to that of the apostle: The Gospel "to those who are perishing is the aroma of death leading to death, but to those who are being saved, the aroma of life leading to life" [2Kor 2, 15f]. But truly, in this slanderous man, you would believe that prophetic saying fits: "Their throat is an open tomb; with their tongues they have practiced deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips; whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness" [Rm 3, 13f] etc. But we return to our churches, in which the true notes of the church of Christ are found. For in these, as I have also said, the word of the Gospel is preached, and in it, repentance and remission of sins in the name of Christ are taught. The preaching of truth is heard, is highly esteemed, and is received. All acknowledge and confess their sins, supplicating God; they seek the just medicine of souls in Christ, and true repentance prevails. In these, God is invoked through the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Praises and thanksgivings are offered in a kind of continual sacrifice. The Christian sacraments are reverently administered and religiously received. But also discipline and brotherly charity are not ineffective. And although the morals of many in our churches are vicious, yet they always strive for better, acknowledge their weakness and sins, seek pardon and grace, and continually repairing themselves, conform to the will of God. I will not say more about the studies of our churches now, lest I seem to flatter the adversary, as he has previously interpreted some of my things. Perhaps he will also say that Paul flatters somewhere, where he praises the churches, in which he nevertheless soon blames some things and wishes many corrected.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is clear, most illustrious prince, that our churches throughout Switzerland and Germany are not refuges of heretics nor conventicles of schismatics, but true holy churches of Christ, associates of the catholic. It is also clear that the adversary, by slandering, disgraces himself, not harming any churches of Christ. Therefore, let neither the clamor of this nor of another slanderer move your heroic mind or withdraw you from the holy and best thing you have begun. You have begun a most beautiful thing. Proceed prudently and steadfastly; and you will undoubtedly prepare for yourself a glorious name in the memory of the saints. Meanwhile, you will preserve both yourself and those subject to your dominion. You have the examples of the most illustrious kings to move you: Hezekiah, Josiah, Valentinian, and Theodosius. And since I love you, most illustrious prince, for your zeal for piety from the heart, I exhort you to the most beautiful things, and as much as I can, I wish to help you and remove what could hinder you. Therefore, I write these things to you, and I dedicate both my responses, in which I defend the cause of the church of Christ, the word of God, piety, and salvation against Cochläus, to your most celebrated name, at the same time to deposit with posterity, to whom perhaps the slanders of the adversaries will come, the testimony that there were men zealous for the truth, who wished the truth to be defended, and that there were not lacking princes who helped the emerging piety.</p>
      <p>Moreover, may you have the most learned and pious man, Lord Adam Bartholomäus, your evangelical preacher, together with the other ministers of the churches, my beloved brothers, commended in Christ. May the Lord Jesus, the prince of the kings of the earth, preserve you, most illustrious prince. Zürich, November 10, 1544.</p>
