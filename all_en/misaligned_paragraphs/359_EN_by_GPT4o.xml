      <p>[Greetings] D. Your letters have made me very anxious, most learned Calvin and dearest brother, because they indicate that my last letters have not yet been delivered to you. I will speak with D. Haller to demand them from those to whom he entrusted them. I would not want them lost or intercepted and fallen into unfaithful hands. Please relieve me of this anxiety if you have received them in the meantime. I responded to your last letters, in which you explain in many ways and through certain propositions what you teach about the sacraments, especially about the Lord's Supper. You include some things about Bucer and Jodocus and other matters concerning the Bernese. I indeed respond to those propositions, not to oppose yours, but to give you an opportunity to explain your opinion more clearly, if in any way it is possible for us to think and speak the same. I kept a copy, and therefore I am now sending you another one, though I do not know how well it is written. Due to business and haste, I was not able to reread it. Furthermore, I have faithfully explained what I desire in D. Bucer. I especially would not want this to fall into unfaithful hands. I also mixed in some things about Jodocus and the Bernese brothers. I thanked you for your commentaries on Paul's letter to Timothy, and I requested that you send other commentaries on the second letter to the Corinthians, to the Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians, the second to Timothy, and to Titus. I am not so shameless as to wish them to be given to me. But I will gladly pay the price along with the greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>For I am very delighted by your works. I added some things, if I remember correctly, about the affairs of the people of Constance. And since I hope they have already been delivered to you, I move on to other matters.</p>
      <p>Because of you and your recommendation, my dear Calvin, I would have gladly taken in the young man you recommended, but my circumstances are more strained than is suitable for relieving the poverty of many brothers. Yet our church is already sufficiently and more than sufficiently burdened. New burdens are daily imposed on our backs. May the Lord comfort the oppressed. However, I have decided to support him for a few days.</p>
      <p>It is entirely over for miserable Germany. The truth of the gospel has been taken away along with freedom. Papism is being introduced gradually and cunningly in some places, in others through terror and threats, and is being forced upon them. Constance is the most miserable of all: it is now subject to the House of Austria. You would be amazed if you read the formula of the oath by which they have bound themselves to King Ferdinand. They promise in it to accept the king's decision on religion. They swore by God and all his saints. Lord Jesus, have mercy on us and save us from evil. We are now working to persuade Ambrosius to join the ministry of the Bernese church. I hope he will comply kindly.</p>
      <p>A diet was held in Zurich by four Christian cities, Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen. They deliberated on giving a united response to the seven cantons. For they sent a delegation to each city proposing mainly this: 1. It is likely that the Emperor, while plotting against our freedom, will seek causes for war against us under the pretext of religion. Therefore, so that he does not seem to have a just cause, the seven cantons wish the cities to consider whether all the Swiss can conveniently give this response: that they will agree to the determination of a council if it can be convened free, general, and Christian. But since this can never be hoped for, each part of the Swiss will meanwhile remain in the profession of their religion. If the Emperor does not wish to accept this response, then all sensible people throughout Germany, indeed Europe, will be able to understand the Emperor's insolence and the innocence of the Swiss. 2. Let us not deny anyone who asks for fair justice. 3. Let those who seek discord in public affairs through lies, insults, and slanders be restrained, and let it be arranged with preachers that they preach moderately, not too immoderately. They deliberated on all these matters, and there was a beautiful agreement on all articles of the response among the four cities, except for one concerning the council. For the people of Basel wanted to simply agree to a general, free, Christian council.</p>
      <p>The three cities, thinking it should be handled cautiously, want to carefully explain what kind of council they agree to. Therefore, so that the people of Basel also agree with the three cities on this article, and that this may be obtained from the people of Basel, another diet will be held on December 9 in Basel, after which delegates will be sent to the seven cantons to report the united response of the cities and to discuss with them what seems to pertain to the safety and peace of the whole church and Switzerland. Meanwhile, we must pray to the Lord that he may prosper the efforts of the saints and destroy and overthrow the plans, plots, and violence of the impious. Certainly, these are very dangerous times.</p>
      <p>I am eager to see what you have written against the Imperial Interim. A certain Saxon has published two sheets against the Interim, but they contain nothing but insults. Moreover, I do not hear of anyone preparing anything against the Interim. I have compiled some things in German, but not with the intention of publishing them. I also delivered a brief speech against the Interim in an ecclesiastical assembly, but it is not such that it deserves to be made public. Nor do I know if it would be printed here. Our magistrate has been so harassed because of Gwalther's published Antichrist. But both Gwalther and I have been greatly troubled because of that booklet, so that in this ulcerated age and in this place, especially at this time when the Swiss are holding a diet to restore concord, it is better for me not to publish anything, lest I provide material for a new fire and do more harm than good.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed brother in the Lord. Greet the brothers, especially D. Farel, D. Viret, and others. D. Bibliander, Pellican, Gwalther, Werdm√ºller, and especially that neighbor of mine and dearest brother D. Musculus greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 6, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger and of all the pious.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man D. Johannes Calvin, most vigilant overseer of the church of Geneva, his always esteemed lord and brother in the Lord. Geneva.</p>
