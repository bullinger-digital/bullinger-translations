      <p>S. P. You indicate in your letter written on June 18 that you have not received any letters from us and have not heard anything about the success of our journey, even by the slightest rumor, most esteemed lord and father.</p>
      <p>This matter has caused me such distress that I do not recall having felt greater pain for many days.</p>
      <p>For the thought of your concern for the boys, in which you still write you are engaged due to your paternal kindness, came to my mind, and the sorrow you express in your fatherly letters immediately afflicted me.</p>
      <p>But I beseech you, my father, to believe that this was not due to our fault, and to remove this blame from me and the boys, I will recount from which places we wrote to you about our departure.</p>
      <p>First from Basel, where I included a book by Sta. Orichovius (named Chimera) written against Stancarus, which a certain compatriot of mine, Stanislaus Kerner, who lives with Oporinus, undertook to transmit to you, and since he did not fulfill this, as I see, I now severely accuse him and demand an explanation through letters.</p>
      <p>But I also beg you to reclaim this book by Orichovius from him and hand it over to Mr. Simler for reading.</p>
      <p>Orichovius wants to appear as a remarkable artist there and has achieved such a name with this writing that he himself is worthy of the name Chimera forever.</p>
      <p>From Basel, we descended to Strasbourg by ship and stayed for eight days, and from there we wrote to you again, but more fully from Heidelberg, with thanks for your piety towards us, the traces of which you had sent ahead with a new example of kindness in many of your writings.</p>
      <p>The same letters contained what was to be written about the Landgrave Prince we saw there and about your son Christoph.</p>
      <p>And it would be strange if they had not reached you in eighteen days, especially since Mr. Erastus never usually entrusts letters to uncertain couriers. As for those I wrote from Frankfurt, I would not be much concerned if the previous ones had reached your hands.</p>
      <p>For at least I had indicated in them how conveniently the boys were to be transported to Leipzig, which journey was finally successfully completed by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>For on the fifth of June, we entered Leipzig safe and sound, where it was especially pleasing that it was most convenient to send letters to you.</p>
      <p>For that Jost from Kassel, the Landgrave's courier, returning from Dresden from Elector Augustus, received our most complete letters to deliver to you all, which since I see you have not yet received, I will briefly summarize the state of the boys in these, for which I spent several days inquiring about suitable lodging, a difficulty arising from the strange and varied way of living there.</p>
      <p>For elsewhere lodging is sought, elsewhere food, then bedding must be prepared for the lodging, and drink procured separately for the food, which arrangement you can easily imagine would have been very inconvenient for our boys.</p>
      <p>But aided by the efforts of a certain good and pious doctor, to whom Mr. Gesner had given me letters, a certain grave widow received the boys into her sufficiently comfortable house.</p>
      <p>For lodging, food, and bedding, they pay one florin each per week, excluding wood, washing, and candles.</p>
      <p>We could not arrange for less. Indeed, the widow affirmed that she had shown favor in this, for she wished to receive a thaler from each.</p>
      <p>This briefly about the boys, especially since more was written in previous letters.</p>
      <p>As for myself, I did not enter my homeland in this expedition of ours against the Muscovite for certain reasons, which I learned from friends' letters in Leipzig.</p>
      <p>For I did not wish to waste my efforts further in pursuing courts amidst the clamor of arms without a legitimate calling, and for this reason, I preferred to remain here through the entire month of September.</p>
      <p>With all your writings and letters, I thought no delay should be made, lest the most fortunate progress of the orthodox churches, about which much is written, be hindered, and so I sent everything to Krakow to the hands of the ministers with a courier hired for six thalers.</p>
      <p>I myself returned to Marburg, where I was received most kindly by Mr. Hipperius on your account, with whom I live pleasantly and usefully, constantly recalling the memory of your exceptional piety and kindness with the utmost respect.</p>
      <p>However, I will not linger here longer than until the Frankfurt fair, at which, by your advice and encouragement, I have decided to acquire some fathers for myself.</p>
      <p>After the fair, I will return straight to my homeland, God willing.</p>
      <p>And unless I knew that at the time when Froschauer is preparing his journey to Frankfurt, you would be very busy, I would most earnestly request from you, most kind father, what our brothers, the ministers of the word of God, urge me to do, namely, that you write letters to Prince Radziwiłł, the Palatine of Vilnius, about this Blandrata affair and the whole controversy, and warn him to beware of being infected with such great impiety, or if he is already infected (as they say), to consider the matter more diligently and see what he is doing.</p>
      <p>And since the orthodox ministers, who oppose this Blandrata impiety, have been slandered throughout Poland by the Blandratists as teaching something different from the holy scripture and the orthodox confession, they beseech you by Jesus Christ to honor them with your testimony that they do not depart from the confession of your churches, the evidence of which is their refuge to you in this most serious matter.</p>
      <p>They wish the names of the principal elders to be expressed in your letters to the Palatine of Vilnius, such as Sarnicius, Jacobus Sylvius, Paulus Gilovius, Stanislaus Wissnovicius.</p>
      <p>For it has been decreed that they themselves will handle this matter before the prince with their adversaries.</p>
      <p>But as I rely on your kindness to comply more boldly with their wishes, so considering your most serious occupations, I hardly dare to hope that I will obtain it, but if it happens, as you are inclined to do good for our churches, I would wish that a copy of these letters be sent to me through Froschauer along with them.</p>
      <p>I also consider it very necessary and strongly request on behalf of the boys that you write again to the great Mr. Cikowius, their father, about this very matter. For that Gregory Paulus, the notary, is entirely intent on drawing this excellent man, Mr. Cikowius, to his opinion.</p>
      <p>And he has already held his meetings several times in Mr. Cikowius's house in his absence.</p>
      <p>All others judge that at least Mr. Cikowius should be restrained by your authority.</p>
      <p>These tritheists, I don't know what monster they are nurturing, as they labor so much to draw that man to themselves.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will do it both for God himself and for the love of his sons.</p>
      <p>I myself wish to deliver those letters into his hands.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I do not doubt that you have learned from Sarnicius's letters about the state of the Polish churches, about which everyone has conceived all good things by the grace of God, provided they are not abandoned by you, whom you once undertook to assist in promoting the glory of God.</p>
      <p>As for the death of Felix Cruciger, if he has not written anything, take it thus, in which otherwise good man a remarkable judgment appeared.</p>
      <p>For when he was ordered to leave the ministry because of this impious doctrine by the lord and patron of those churches he presided over, he had decided to move to Pinczow to the assembly of Italians.</p>
      <p>Thus, on the day of Easter, he was already bidding farewell to his congregation, and when he finished, he suddenly fell to the ground and could no longer speak from that moment, and finally, the next day, he departed from this life.</p>
      <p>To whom I sincerely wish that the Lord God may be merciful.</p>
      <p>Sarnicius also writes that he has recovered that writing of Mr. Calvin against Stancarus and included it with the letters you sent back to us with the package unsealed.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that you have transmitted it to Mr. Calvin in Geneva without delay, so that I expect some solid treatment and explanation of both the Stancarus and Blandrata matters at the next fair, as promised.</p>
      <p>Regarding the booklet, which Sarnicius says he published under another's name and sent to you along with letters, I ask that you write your judgment to me and, if it can be conveniently done through Froschauer, send that very booklet to Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>I will return it again through the same, once I have at least read it. For it is very important to know what our people bring against the adversaries before I reach them.</p>
      <p>I beg you not to hesitate to grant this to me.</p>
      <p>And now farewell most happily and for a long time, my most esteemed father, with your entire family and holy church.</p>
      <p>I respectfully and dutifully greet our most pious mother and all your children.</p>
      <p>I offer the respect I owe to your fellow students. Given at Marburg in Hesse, July 20, 1563.</p>
      <p>Most devoted and most observant of you, Christ.</p>
      <p>Thretius.</p>
