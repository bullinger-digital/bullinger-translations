    <p xml:id="regest1">Has read Schwenckfeld's letter to Jud and finds his suspicion confirmed that the former has a bad disposition. On one hand, Schwenckfeld claims not to be an Anabaptist, yet on the other hand, he directly expresses Anabaptist thoughts. Also, on the question of governmental authority, he contradicts himself, thus proving his unreliability. By claiming that the sects would not disturb the state, he only reveals his intention to cause a schism in the church. On the question of the relationship between church and government, Bullinger cites several passages from Augustine's works. He asks Jud to heed his remarks.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have read, dearest Leo, the letters of Schwenckfeld that you sent, recently written to you, from which I now conclude that he is as I have long suspected: corrupt in mind, not as firm in speech as he is vain and talkative, boasting of the spirit and the great mysteries of God with a certain majesty, but shamefully ignorant of Christian simplicity. And I wish I were mistaken and found rash in judging another's servant. But I fear too much that what I say is true.</p>
      <p>This man writes, or rather vomits, whatever comes to his mouth. You will find nothing solid in these letters, everything is tumultuous and unconsidered, cold and rash, not only those he wrote on the journey but also those he previously sent to you on the same matter, constantly straying on the same string. For I am not now saying that he almost verbatim revived the arguments of the Donatists in this cause, whom not some papal church, but the truly holy and catholic church condemned a thousand years ago, not with clamor but with scripture. Certainly, he casts doubt on and obscures all the truth confessed today and clearer than light, when with notable audacity he explicitly says that the gospel has not yet been preached nor any church established today. And when you compared the Anabaptist doctrine to a corrupt or poisoned fountain, he openly objects: «It is not yet known where the poisoned well is», as if the foolish, impious, and rash doctrines of the Anabaptists were not revealed to the whole world. But this Vertumnus, as he says, does not support the Anabaptists, whom he also claims to have as enemies. But if you look more closely at each point, you will see the man favorable to the Anabaptists, yet more slippery than Erasmus. For now, he denies being an Anabaptist, but soon he cries out that true baptism has perished through paedobaptism. Moreover, he carries the sanctity of these people, which all the saints know to be more than monastic superstition in the simpler, that is, more ignorant ones, but hypocrisy, impiety, obstinacy, and destined malice in the leaders. What is more, he somehow defends the most impious doctrine of Hoffmann, that heretic and blasphemer of the highest order? But here too, like a dog, he drinks from the Nile and flees. What, he says, if he does not understand how Christ took our flesh from Mary, was he therefore worthy of chains or to be beaten? Who indeed says this? See therefore the acumen, observe the cunning. Truly, there are many holy and simple people who do not know the manner of ineffable things, but they plead ignorance and do not rashly blurt out anything in matters not understood. But he does nothing of the sort, but openly teaches, indeed asserts himself to be a true prophet of God and his teachings to be certain. By teaching perverse things, he slays the souls of many and by picking at the incarnation of Christ, he blasphemes God. But he says: He does not deny Christ, but rather wants to elevate him with his doctrine. As if we do not recognize the deceitful words of Arius and Valentinus. Christ is not elevated by anything unless it is good and consonant with truth. That Schwenckfeld has smeared certain scripture passages on this matter, as if supporting Hoffmann, in the margin, truly, truly revealed his wickedness and offended me beyond measure, so much so that I would have thrown away the letters if I had not been compelled to read them in full for your sake. Is it not a notable malice in the man that he drags these passages: «This is the living bread that came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven» etc. [John 6:51, 53, 58] to the defense of Hoffmann's impiety, which believes Christ was incarnated not from the virgin but from heaven? This single malice is enough for me as a great argument that there is nothing of solid piety in Schwenckfeld. For piety rightly abhors this mystery of impiety. For John says: «Every spirit that does not confess that Christ has come in the flesh is not from God» [1 John 4:3], in the flesh, however, which he took from the virgin or the seed of Abraham, which he meanwhile denies and therefore is antichrist.</p>
      <p>Now, even in this very cause, which he argues with you, he reveals the inconsistency of his mind and contradicts himself «not understanding», as the apostle says, «what he speaks or about what he asserts» [1 Tim 1:7]. For at the beginning and in general, he entirely warns against punishing the Anabaptists. He carefully warns against the magistrate doing or administering anything in ecclesiastical matters, yet soon he says: «If it happens that the Anabaptists make an uproar or harm anyone in body and goods, then the authority has its right to exercise against them as against others.» And what else do we think or why are the Anabaptists punished, except that they teach against the magistrate, taxes, and oaths, that they divide the church with their baptism and lead from the true to the false. For what, even if they deny what we teach to be true, or refuse to understand? Was the doctrine of the apostles false because many refused to accept it? Again, when you asked: «What would happen if every fool were allowed to rise and chatter?», he responds: «If it were to go too far, then a magistrate might intervene; since it remains with faith, teaching, and ceremonies from God, he has nothing to hinder.» Therefore, if you judge this man by his own mouth, what else follows from the contrary than when Christian doctrine, faith, and discipline are corrupted, it is the Christian magistrate's duty to correct. But with the Anabaptist doctrine, both the doctrine and discipline of Christians are corrupted. Therefore, it is the magistrate's duty to prohibit them. Where then are Schwenckfeld's positions now, that the magistrate should do nothing in matters of faith, etc.?</p>
      <p>But what need is there for more? Indeed, I consider this man born to foster and defend errors, heresies, and schisms, so that I do not know if Germany has ever produced his equal. For what is more impudent than what he says: «It does no good as long as faith with its followers is not set free.» O the rashness of the man! For if any faith should be free, surely the truth must be oppressed. And there can be no other true faith than our one faith. Outside of this, there is no true faith. Paul and Christ himself commanded bishops to watch over its preservation. But if any faith should be free, what need is there for vigilance? Let everyone do and believe what they please. If that contradicts the truth, surely that faith alone should be free, which is true. But if it is the Christian bishop's duty to watch, surely it is also the Christian magistrate's duty to watch.</p>
      <p>But it is especially amusing that he says sects do not disturb the republic, that there are many and various sects in Constantinople, Venice, and Prague. But with this, he reveals what the man, eager for schisms, is attempting and that he aims at nothing but to divide the church into a thousand parts. However, as for what pleases Paul about sects, what they contribute to the republic, no one is unaware. He adds: «There are so many monasteries and yet peace remains.» From this single example, however, he should have learned how pestiferous it is to foster sects. Therefore, by the same reasoning, he should protect the monks, so that he deserves to be called the patron not only of the Anabaptists but of all errors, indeed even of the monks.</p>
      <p>In short, from all these things, I can gather nothing else than that Schwenckfeld is a slippery, cunning man and a marvelous craftsman at inciting schisms, from whose company and conversation I would most wish you to abstain. You know what Paul says from Menander: «Bad company corrupts good morals» [1 Cor 15:33]. You yourself complain that your mind is already troubled and perplexed enough. It will be more perplexed if you continue to converse with this dark one. You will indeed have advised both yourself and all of us, indeed the whole church, excellently if you guard yourself against him. For there is no hope of gaining the man. You see what mind he is endowed with. He is ready to teach, not to be taught. How often does he insist: «I would commend you to God.» Moreover, you know with what sincerity, integrity, and learning our Theodor is endowed, you know with what colors he paints this man. That Capito is not entirely displeased, you know the excellent man has often been seduced by the hypocrisy of some and led around by foreign doctrines. Bucer, who is both more learned and sincere and constant, does not approve, as you know, of the man. You indeed say it is a temptation, which has come to you. I interpret the perplexed conversation to be a perplexed fruit. Satan attacks us from the right and the left and strives to deceive us with a thousand tricks. Let us meet him with constancy and faithful prayer. What is true is simple. God has not proposed doubts. A mind not constant with itself invents doubts for itself. Neither do I lack temptations nor do I believe anyone is without them, but I always return to simplicity. I have advised these things especially because it seems most advisable. Since you are of a weak and perplexed mind, abstain from the company and conversation of the crafty.</p>
      <p>I have said these things about Schwenckfeld, but about the cause itself, it did not seem worthwhile to deal with more or to respond to each point, because the man of exceptional learning and sanctity, Augustine, responds to each point more learnedly and clearly than anyone today can. I only wished to note the places.</p>
      <p>About the church, he speaks clearly enough in the 3rd book «Against the Letters of Petilian», volume 6, up to chapter 14. He has most copiously disputed about the same in three books against Parmenian, volume 5, also chapter 20 «Against the Donatists after the Collation» with collected annotations.</p>
      <p>What business the church and ecclesiastics have with kings, he explains in «On the Correction of the Donatists» chapters 13 and 14, volume 8; «Against the Letters of Petilian» book 2, chapters 92 and 97.</p>
      <p>Whether anyone should be compelled in matters of faith, he examines in «On the Correction of the Donatists» chapter 15, and in the 2nd book «Against the Letter of Gaudentius» chapter 17, volume 8, also «Against the Letters of Petilian» book 2, chapters 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88.</p>
      <p>On the correction of heretics, he disputes in the book «On the Correction of the Donatists», also «Against the Letter of Gaudentius» book 2, chapters 11 and 26.</p>
      <p>Whether persecution can be drawn as an argument for truth, he disputes in «Against the Letter of Gaudentius» book 2, chapters 12, 13, 14, 15, and «Against the Letters of Petilian» chapter 17, volume 11.</p>
      <p>These, my dear Leo, are what I had to indicate now, which if they please and satisfy, I give thanks to the Lord. I hope, however, they will please. They certainly satisfied me in the past. But what I have written, I pray, take in good part, since they have come from a friendly mind. For believe this, my Leo, that I embrace you with such sincere love that I would do anything for your sake. Therefore, I also grieve more vehemently and more than can be said for your situation, that you are thus troubled by temptations. May the Lord instruct and establish your heart for the glory of his name and the advancement of his church. Amen.</p>
