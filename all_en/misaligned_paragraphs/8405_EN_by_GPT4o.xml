      <p>God with us! Dear sir and brother, I have been credibly informed that an honorable council in Chur, my gracious lords, has made an agreement between you and Mr. Ganthner, so that he acknowledges his errors and mistakes, henceforth leaves the Anabaptists and Anabaptism alone, does not burden himself with them anymore, lets go of this dispute between you both, and does not think of it anymore, and lives peacefully and brotherly with one another, and unanimously teaches according to our common confession and refrains from all foreign opinions. But despite this amicable agreement and direction, the aforementioned Mr. Ganthner stood at the pulpit in the church on October 8th and preached, among other inappropriate articles, the following, as can be clearly testified by many who were present at the sermon: (1) The Lord in Matthew 13 commands the servants not to uproot the weeds but to let them grow among the wheat; that is the clear word of God. Therefore, no one should be expelled or driven away. (2) The apostles used the ban and shamed the sinner but did not expel or punish anyone in another way. This ban is necessary for the church. (3) The example of Peter with Ananias and Sapphira does not prove punishment; for God did it. (4) The sayings of the Old Testament also prove nothing; for we are a new people. (5) The apostles did not force anyone to believe; for faith is free as a pure grace of God; it must be driven. (6) If someone makes a conscience that he does not want or cannot harm the enemy, whom Christ calls to love, even in the greatest need of the fatherland, then a government should not force him but let him remain by his conscience. (7) And since a Christian should not swear at all, but our speech should be: "yes, yes" and: "no, no", one should not impose the oath on those who want to follow the aforementioned rule. (8) Frell has done nothing; for he has not incited any rebellion. Therefore, he should not be expelled. (9) The papists should be expelled and uprooted, as they act so clearly against God, and not the Anabaptists. He is compelled to say this, as a dispute has arisen, and what he has ever taught and said, he can substantiate with divine scripture, and thus he will also remain.</p>
      <p>If this were the case and Mr. Ganthner had indeed uttered such things in the open church as mentioned, he would have grossly overlooked himself and held his lords and superiors in little honor, whose agreement he has so willfully and brazenly broken; I will not say more about it now. These his articles are in all things and fundamentally Anabaptist and have long been rejected with holy divine word by all churches of the Confederation and the German nation, as well as by other nations that have accepted the gospel and signed our confession. And if someone preaches such articles and supports them, he is not to be tolerated by any Christian community unless he has previously, as he offered, substantiated them with the divine word. And moreover, a Christian government should ensure that he substantiates it. If he cannot do that, as he will neither be able to substantiate it in eternity nor can, then what is right should happen, and one should not allow such a person to confuse and mislead the church, and moreover, to cause discord and strife among those who have been well content with one another until now. (1) If one should now let the weeds grow, why does he then in the 9th article want the papists to be uprooted? Let them also grow among the weeds, and henceforth do not punish murderers or other evildoers either, etc. (2) I have now dealt with the Anabaptists for over 40 years and have convinced them of their errors, and especially they have always rejected the ban, which they have never understood or been able to uphold. (3) Since God also acts and punishes through the government by day, 2 Chronicles 49, Romans 13, why then does Peter's example not apply, that one should punish? (4) If then the sayings of the Old Testament prove nothing, then one should discard the whole New Testament, in which Christ and the apostles prove all their matters with the Old Testament.</p>
      <p>And this is a true Anabaptist article. (5) Faith is not only a free grace and gift of God, but also all virtues and avoidance of vices. But who wants to leave unpunished those who commit great vices? (6) Conscience has always been a cover for all hypocrites and those who want to cover and excuse their vices. Where is it written that everyone's conscience and not the written word of God should be the rule by which we judge and act? (7) One should indeed not curse and swear excessively; but swearing an oath is commanded by God. If one should no longer give an oath because of perjury, the whole government would collapse, Hebrews 6. This is a true rebellious, Anabaptist article. (8) Even if Frell has not incited any rebellion now, it will still come; let no one be concerned. But has he not already caused enough unrest? How is it now in Chur, and how peaceful has it ever been because of the dispute? Whoever does not see this, does not want to see anything. (9) If one should then not tolerate the papists at all and spare the Anabaptists so much, who does not see that Ganthner is the protector of the Anabaptists? Why does he not also say here that the apostles have banned? Why does he then not also ban the papists?</p>
      <p>This article also reeks of rebellion, etc. His words sound rightly as if he wants to act willfully against the recognition of the pious government, as if he does not have what he should from the government. And since he boasts so proudly and offers to substantiate his errors and Anabaptist articles with scripture, it is only right that he does so and that a government sees to it that the man does not cause them fear and distress, God forbid. And it is up to you, Mr. Tobias, to act earnestly in this matter and to seek common peace and salvation, to seek a pious government for a free, impartial conversation, in which he would declare our church doctrine as right or wrong. For he has now openly aligned himself with the Anabaptists, whom he protects and preaches Anabaptist articles. May God correct him; for I wish him well, have written to him before, and he is dear to me. But I never trusted him to utter what he now does. May God improve it in him.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God and send greetings to my good lords and friends.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, October 13, 1570.</p>
      <p>In particular, I send greetings to both my lords the mayors, the city bailiff, and the guild master, etc.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the elder, yours.</p>
