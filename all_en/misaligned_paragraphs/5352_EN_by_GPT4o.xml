      <p>S. D. I am compelled to write as quickly as possible, therefore you will forgive me, honorable lord and dearest brother. Our scouts have been sent to the Five Cantons.</p>
      <p>They return, reporting that they will attack even without money. They say they will set out on the 8th of this month.</p>
      <p>They burn with a remarkable zeal, indeed hatred, against heretics. They will destroy all, if the Lord permits.</p>
      <p>However, I hope that by divine dispensation and most just judgment, they will find what they do not seek. It is rumored that they will go through Burgundy to Dijon.</p>
      <p>They boast of having Germans and Spaniards as allies in war. Our people have resisted as much as they could, but that Frölich is relentless. Thus he shows his gratitude to France, which made him a lord from a beggar.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord and say diligently: Scatter, O Lord, the people who desire war. Then it seems that he should be warned in due time.</p>
      <p>Let him not neglect the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>This nation is very strong and once gave King Francis 2000 of the bravest soldiers. I know that Guise is seriously pressing for Rhaetia to provide soldiers.</p>
      <p>Whatever writings of Condé I could obtain, I have communicated to the more powerful through Johann Fabricius, the most vigilant pastor of Chur, and by the grace of God, I have ensured that they have now publicly denied soldiers to Guise in the Chur assemblies. This is most certain.</p>
      <p>At this hour, I receive letters from Chur indicating that it would be very beneficial if the prince would write friendly letters to them. Thus they will be kept in line.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there are many who complain of being overlooked and despised.</p>
      <p>Come, my lord and brother, ensure that letters are written to them. If they cannot be better managed by the prince, I can handle the letters excellently, both quickly and safely, if they are sent to me. And I will gladly do so.</p>
      <p>I do not cease to encourage and restrain them, etc. However, let him write to the most distinguished councils of Chur and the Communities of the Three Leagues of Rhaetia, etc. Farewell and take care of these matters quickly with your faith and diligence.</p>
      <p>Master Martyr and the fellow ministers honorably greet you and yours. May the Lord bless you. June 5, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>There is a man of singular strength, Hercules von Salis, and another, Captain Georg Karlin, who strongly defend the cause of Condé, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, and in his absence to Mr. Johannes Budé or Jonvillier, my most honorable lords and dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
