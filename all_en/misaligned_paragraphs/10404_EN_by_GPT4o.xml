    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's friendly admonition at the recently held synod helped him to calm down. He was not prepared to suddenly have to defend himself against people who had previously flattered him, and he does not understand why they accuse him of controversially handling contradictory scriptures; if he had erred, they should have pointed it out to him. They will continue to try to push him out of his office, but he is not attached to it and will not give any cause for further dispute. He would like to know from his accusers why they reproach him for insisting on a blameless way of life and claim that he points too little to Christ; critics like these, who sometimes judge overly strictly and then again leniently, cause a lot of harm. Although he has done much for the church - especially in Zurzach - he is now condemned in his own camp; this letter is not meant to rekindle the dispute, but silence could have been interpreted as an admission of guilt.</p>

      <p>Greetings in abundance.</p>
      <p>Although it might be considered presumptuous for a man of humble fortune to trouble someone occupied with more serious matters, the sincere favor of your spirit, shown to me in our recent meeting, moved me to speak to you freely, setting aside my modesty. Your faithful and friendly admonition greatly revived me, restoring my greatly disturbed mind to its former tranquility with your sole support. Therefore, I had intended to show my gratitude at the first opportunity, so that you might continue to show yourself not only to me but to all in such a manner.</p>
      <p>However, I delayed writing, lest I trust too much in my still fervent mind, stirred by the unexpected provocation of some; for unanticipated blows strike deeper. I speak from experience in this matter, as I was nearly shipwrecked by hidden reefs, not being sufficiently cautious.</p>
      <p>For these men, who previously showed themselves so kind and benevolent in all things towards me, did not even give me a hint of their intense hostility until the moment when I had to respond unexpectedly before the entire assembly of magnates, saying whatever came to mind. Nor is it yet clear what moved them; for they pretend and feign to be offended by certain doubts I raised. Although I acknowledge having done this once or twice, I do not think it worthy of such a complaint, especially since I see that learned men commend not only the exchange of letters among students of literature but also the comparison of conflicting passages and friendly controversy, as it yields not only a richer experience of things but also sharpens the mind.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I think they will not desist from their undertaking until this apple of discord is removed. This could be conveniently done if I were to leave the arena or if they (which I would not wish) were to achieve their desire concerning me. For if this does not succeed, they will approach the matter by another route.</p>
      <p>Piety commands me to care for this. For unless the dire impulse of these men, with which they affect me, subsides in due time, and they desist from the zeal, which is not good, I have decided to cut off their opportunity for slander. I would not want it to be perpetually reproached to me, namely, that we, being heralds of concord, foster discord and enmity. Therefore, it seems advisable to rather withdraw the occasion and let the hatred rest, like one who extinguishes a fire by withdrawing the fuel.</p>
      <p>However, I wish to know from these accusers of mine what they think about certain things I said, which they claim were wrong, such as: that I said the innocence of a just man who restrains himself is not contaminated by the iniquity of the wicked, and also, that I strive greatly to persuade the people of the integrity of life, etc. I wonder about these things, whether they do not diligently instill the same in the flock entrusted to them, if they are sound in faith. How is it, then, that what is done well by others is turned into a vice for me alone?</p>
      <p>I have poured these things into your bosom, noble man, as a lament of my grief, who have hitherto been found to sincerely wish well for the Christian republic and to have defended its parts against papist beasts, especially those of Zurzach, with all my might. Now, however, I am pursued by my own people and men of my peace, who strive with all their might to affix a black Theta, not without great pain do I endure.</p>
      <p>Although I have restrained myself until this day, so that I have not complained to any of them with even the slightest word about the injury inflicted, I wanted to complain a little to you, whom I hope will be a fair judge in this matter, and lest, as often happens, the accused, always silent, seems to consent. Therefore, I beseech you to consider it kindly, that I, occupied with more serious matters, am hindered by me, who will henceforth temper my pen.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger, and weigh the matter with fair judgment, which I certainly hope, and take me into your protection, and you will find me obedient to the will of the pious.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Balthasar Stoll.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned, distinguished by various fortunes, Master Heinrich Bullinger, herald of evangelical candor among the Zurichers, his lord, etc.</p>
