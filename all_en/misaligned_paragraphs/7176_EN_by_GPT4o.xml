      <p>On the 17th of October, I received letters from you, and again on the 16th of May; for which and for your most learned homilies on Isaiah, I give the greatest thanks I can. Last summer, Nicolaus Carvilius passed away, and at the beginning of this month, Robert Beamundus, the president of Trinity College in the University of Cambridge, also died. They have gone before; we shall follow when it pleases the Lord.</p>
      <p>John Neale, a leader and of great authority among the barbarous and uncivilized Irish, despite his oath, incited sedition against our queen. Throughout this year, he has not rested from arms. Recently, he was killed in a conflict. Now there is hope that those rude and inhuman people, who live only by plunder, will become more civilized and urbane.</p>
      <p>After the king of Scotland, Heinrich, was killed, the queen married the Earl of Bothwell, who was not long ago created Duke of Orkney.</p>
      <p>His wife is still alive, a most noble and excellent woman, as I hear. A divorce was made with the intervention of the pope's authority. The nobles have brought the queen into order, and yet they treat her very humanely, not forgetting (as is proper) due obedience. The duke has fled to I know not where, hated by almost everyone, because he so cruelly killed his king: with whose consent he did this, I will not write; but rumor spreads wondrous and horrendous tales:</p>
      <p>Rumor, an evil than which no other is swifter, as tenacious of falsehood and wrong as it is a messenger of truth.</p>
      <p>The princes of Scotland have some cohorts, and on all their banners or insignia, they have this image painted.</p>
      <p>A green and very beautiful tree is depicted, under which lies a tall and naked man, strangled with a rope: near him, a naked young man pierced with many wounds. Then a little boy is depicted, crowned with a golden crown, kneeling, with hands raised high, and these words coming from his mouth, "Lord, have mercy on me, and avenge the blood of my father!" By these are designated the king, the servant, the son. I cannot write more. Business presses. The courier is in haste. The rest to you, Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>I would have written to Wolphius, Lavater, Simler, Vonlichius, Froschauer, Julius; but it is not permitted: would that it were! May they interpret it in good part. I will write another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet all my friends.</p>
      <p>In haste. At Ludham, July 31, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
