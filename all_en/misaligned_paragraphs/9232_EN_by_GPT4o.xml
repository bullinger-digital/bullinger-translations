      <p>So that you may also thoroughly know how things are going here and elsewhere in the League, I wanted to add this to the other letter, after I understood the basis from my consul. Today, on the 6th of March, nine men from the League are here, and also some from the Godshouse, to deliberate on how to appease the communities that intend to break away, and something would have been done today; but not a single envoy (which was expected) has arrived from the Ten Courts; for the previous weeks, the Ten Courts were gathered in Davos, where it was proposed to bring to their communities whether they would also send envoys here. But no decision was made in Davos; for the three courts in Pr√§ttigau, Schiers, Castel, Klosters, and the half-court in Schanfigg want to delay or at least defer something further on their own. Therefore, no envoys have come from the courts, only a letter stating that they are not allowed to send envoys, especially the Davosers; since the judgment is against them, they must remain silent; however, they would gladly accept what the two Leagues do for peace and unity. Thus, as I understand, tomorrow they will proceed and hold a significant League day without delay and there amicably arrange and improve the communities' affairs that have been previously neglected.</p>
      <p>For, as I wrote to you earlier, the communities complain particularly about six points: 1. the new Valtellina captain Gallus von Joch; they want him removed; 2. regarding the legate; 3. concerning the 7000 guilders; 4. regarding the union; 5. Conrad is otherwise out of the dust; 6. the common man has been miserably deceived by the mint masters, and these mint masters and their kin want to govern our church and suppress their preachers; therefore, God will also punish them. But their arrogance is such that I can do nothing here, therefore I ask again that you do not forget me; let another serve abroad for 14 years, etc. In summary: the communities want the original judgment to remain as they made it, as they appointed it a year ago from the enemies. Thus, life and property are forfeited to the Rhaetians; thus, Mr. Conrad must be out of the lands; thus, Gallus, a deceitful man and Count Hannibal's secret and Rhaetian undergarment, must sit under the stairs for a while, and some envoys, who perhaps for money led the cart astray, must sweat; thus, there will be greater fear and better discipline. But I do not believe that they will let the peasants be pacified, even if they hold a League day and write against all things to the communities, since the courts are not allowed to send envoys and want to pursue the judgment in another way.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there is great outcry and displeasure on all sides. God has also sufficiently warned us from heaven of great dangers and punishments: but we have improved ourselves so much that we now want to silence the preachers. For at the last League day, the great houses and true leaders of the pensions and union let us be threatened and warned through Doctor Ruinelli, offering that they would silence us, and that we would be sent before the League. All this happened because they feared we would oppose the union and their other practices and dealings, as it is called among us. But there was no need to spread such lies and vain things; for by God's grace, we feared nothing, but wished for an occasion to be summoned before the League, which did not happen.</p>
      <p>But after they fought, it now succeeds for them, so that, since they desire to withdraw their attacks unhindered, those very ones who want to close our mills cannot open their mouths, and are hardly safe anywhere and can hardly speak. Thus, the godless encounter exactly what they fear and want to avoid with their miserable worldly counsels. - It is said here that in Davos a red cross and three suns were seen in the sky along with other terrifying things, which I will investigate further and write the details next, if possible. I can speak of nothing else from all circumstances than that we must pray and that great danger is present; for in short, one does not want to be punished by God's word anymore; therefore, God must punish with other means. - My gracious lords write to your honorable council amicably and thank them for their letter, in which they thoroughly inquire about our affairs, which they also write to them about all matters as they stand, and which I have also partially recorded here for you.</p>
      <p>May God be with you and all of us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Very quickly. 1573, 6th of March at dusk.</p>
      <p>But they are not allowed to make the writing public to anyone; for they now show it to some from the League, fearing the peasants might say:</p>
      <p>[Send you, who are from Chur, seeking help.] But I know that good lords are well comforted by you, our gracious lords of the Confederates. God protect us from misfortune.</p>
