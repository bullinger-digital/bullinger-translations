      <p>Greetings. All your items, most reverend lord, were well taken care of for our gathering, which Mr. Campell (Campell) kindly hosted for us along with our wives yesterday. We all express our immense gratitude to you, who do not disdain to so diligently and bravely fortify us against the trifles of the Academics. Above all, I see that I owe you more than I will ever be able to repay, even if I were to live as long as Nestor, for you so fatherly open the doors for my return, should I be expelled for the sake of truth, and in that certainly not light cause of ours, you show yourself to be so humane and benevolent to me in particular.</p>
      <p>I had planned to set out on my journey today; but Cobler (Kobler) dissuaded me, saying that your lake was not yet passable and complained that he had not been able to carry his goods all the way to Zürich. However, I promised our most honorable Mr. Consul, who is departing for Italy, that I would bring his gift with me and ensure that it suffers no harm on such a perilous journey. Therefore, I will certainly come soon (unless the Lord disposes otherwise) with the little gift; [which] I will absolutely have to do, as I do not have even a grain from which to make bread. I write this so that the most honorable Mr. Rodolph Gwalther (Rudolf Gwalther) may know the reason for our delay, to whom I will also diligently send letters to Lentulus at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>Mr. Flavius (Flavio) reported to me (whom we suspect to be a secret inquisitor of the pope among us) that it is certain the Spaniard has broken faith and treaty with the Venetians. - In Susch in the Engadin and in Davos, some dreadful voices have been heard in the air, and flames and fiery figures have been seen, etc., about which more certain and detailed information will be provided later. - Our Gantner (Gantner) expelled the learned and pious brother, Johann Gera (Johann Gera), who governed the Schanfigg Valley with the word, with his tricks and inserted himself into those churches, which he had previously presided over before coming to Chur. He offered his services to the peasants, even though he well knew that the place was not vacant; now he tries to excuse himself under the pretext that the peasants, not he, did this.</p>
      <p>Thus, many things simultaneously converge, which will reveal the man's impudence in due time.</p>
      <p>Mr. Campell, Mr. Pontisella (Pontisella), Mr. Bonett (Bonett), etc., especially greet you.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, March 20, 1571, in Chur.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your reverence, Tobias Egli (Tobias Iconius).</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and honorable man in every kind of virtue, piety, and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zürich, my singular lord, to be honored with the greatest respect.</p>
