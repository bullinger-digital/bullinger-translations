      <p>My friendly service and all that I love and hold dear, dear Heinrich.</p>
      <p>I am thankful that at this time (praise the Lord) I and my family are in good health. It would always be a special joy for me to hear the same from you, your dear wife, brother, and other loved ones.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, know that unfortunately, the Anabaptists have made many evil plans in these lands and have attempted to poison many significant places with their venom. Here in Cologne, several have been burned, some beheaded, a few are still imprisoned, and many have fled, who were previously considered pious and virtuous men and women.</p>
      <p>In Wesel, a great uproar has also arisen, and it is said that about three hundred were seen in arms, intending to kill the other citizens and strengthen themselves there to liberate the M端nsterites. However, their plans have been thwarted, and the M端nsterites still hold their city, despite the princes, perhaps hoping for a miracle. But they are tightly besieged; I also fear that when there is no more hope, they will completely ruin everything and their city and then willingly surrender to the enemy, come what may.</p>
      <p>The Anabaptists have also spread from this damned heresy to Deventer, Amsterdam, Antwerp, and many smaller places in the Netherlands. And they are being dealt with by the princes in such a way that they hardly dare to move.</p>
      <p>There is also a great rumor among us that His Imperial Majesty will come with a large force to quell the troubles of the German nation and to bring about a good reformation, so that we may serve God in unity of faith. May the Lord of peace grant us this, and soon.</p>
      <p>Also know that Arnold of Wesel, our teacher, passed away unexpectedly and suddenly two months ago, as he was preparing for morning prayers.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing special to write to you now, except that the almighty eternal God may strengthen and preserve you in His service and turn away from you all that might oppose His divine will in any way.</p>
      <p>Given in haste in Cologne, on Sunday Laetare, March 7, 1535.</p>
      <p>Dietrich Bitter von Wipperf端rth, your favorable friend.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my favorable, dear friend, to be delivered.</p>
