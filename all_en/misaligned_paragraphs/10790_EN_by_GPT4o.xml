    <p xml:id="regest1">The situation with the Bernese troops [in the Vaud] is good. Jakob Vogt writes: The Bernese have declared to the French envoy [Jean d'Estouteville] that they have no objections to King [Francis I]'s intended takeover of Savoyard territories. After that, they captured the fortress of Klus and left a garrison there with Jakob Hetzel as captain. According to their letter from Morges, they now intend to capture La Sarraz and Yverdon and have therefore requested artillery; these are already on their way with an escort. Fribourg is expected to occupy several places after negotiations with Bern. The Valaisans have also taken much land; a Bernese council messenger is with them. [Louis Daugerant, Lord of] Boisrigaut and an envoy of the Emperor [Nicolas de Gilley, Lord of Marnoz] have urged Bern to remain quiet; a detailed report is now being sent to the Emperor. - Sulpitius Haller adds: The departure of the Fribourgers was halted after receiving a letter from the Five Places. Bern has sent two more artillery pieces to Yverdon. Promises to keep Bullinger informed, thanks him for his report [on the negotiations in Basel], and sends greetings.</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings and willing service to you.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, I want to let you know that all is well with our troops in the field, praise be to God and Him in eternity. Dear Master Heinrich, a good friend and brother has written to me; I am sending you the copy: "My friendly greetings and willing service are always ready for you. Dear sir and brother, I want to inform you about our military forces, that they are doing well by the grace of God. Across from Geneva in the camp, the provost of Paris has come to them, in the name of the king, to inform them that the king intends to take some lands, which he believes he has a right to, such as Chamb√©ry, Romont, Salins, and the valley of Moriana. Our lords have replied that they are no less willing to move to the named places, as they have heard that some of their enemies are staying there. However, if the king wants to take these places into his hands, they will let it happen, not wanting to hinder him, as long as he allows them to do so, hoping he will be our good friend and neighbor; the lord is very satisfied with this.</p>
      <p>They have moved towards the Klus, which they intended to take; it is a very fortified place. They surrounded it and attacked it so that they surrendered, and thus took the Klus without any harm on our side, praise be to God, the troops inside laid down their arms, swore an oath not to march against us for three months. They then moved back towards Geneva, leaving a garrison in the Klus, with Jakob Hetzel as captain; for it is a key to the land.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday we received letters from them, sent from Morges, that they intend to move to La Sarraz, to take it, and also to capture some places along the way, then to Yverdon where they want to be today with a request to send them 2 cannons, 2 mortars, 2 catapults with their ammunition, which we are sending to them today with an escort of 200 men from the city; for no one is willing to stay at home, as we would all like to be with them.</p>
      <p>So I am hopeful that our fellow citizens from Fribourg will also be on their way, to take Remund, Rue, Payerne, and more places; for it has been granted to them. For we have sent our embassy to them and they have sent theirs to us regarding the places, and what has been negotiated would be too long to write. When you come here, I will show you everything.</p>
      <p>As for the Valaisans, we are well satisfied with them; they have also taken much land. We also have a council messenger with them in Valais.</p>
      <p>Nothing more for now. Commend you to God. Greet all your household and your children for us.</p>
      <p>Given on the 22nd day of February in the 36th year.</p>
      <p>Your servant Jakob Vogt.</p>
      <p>Borygo was here and now a messenger from the emperor, bringing strange tales, but in summary: We should remain quiet and at peace. We are writing to the emperor about all matters from beginning to end.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, I want to let you know that the Fribourgers have halted their departure after receiving a letter from the Five Places. Our lords have sent two more cannons to Yverdon to bombard the place from three locations. May God grant them success.</p>
      <p>What I have reliably to announce, I will always let you know.</p>
      <p>I thank you for the report you sent me, and the writer for it, and for the good rhyme, and Master Steiner and his also thank you, and greet Master Leuen and all good brothers. Nothing more, may God keep us in His care.</p>
      <p>Given on the 27th day of February in the 36th year.</p>
      <p>Your servant Biczius Haller, chief magistrate of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger. Servant of the church in Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
