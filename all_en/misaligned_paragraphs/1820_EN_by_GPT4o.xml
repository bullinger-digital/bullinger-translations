      <p>Letter of Heinrich Bullinger to Bartholomew Traheron, an Englishman, on the providence of God, and on predestination, election, and reprobation, and on free will, and that God is not the author of sin, 1553.</p>
      <p>You propose a question about what I think regarding providence and predestination. Some seem to think that we adhere too much to Melanchthon's views here, while Calvin has written most absolutely on the matter. This question indeed would require a complete and rather long book if you wish to respond appropriately. However, I will sketch my opinion in a few words, as more extensive discussions can be found in the books I have published. For I did not think this question should be passed over in silence, as you seem to seriously seek my judgment: indeed, I would not want to deny you anything.</p>
      <p>In that question, I have never wanted to adhere to the opinion of any private individual, seeing as much variation in this matter as in no other. However, throughout my ministry, I have followed the teaching that I see has been preserved in the church from the time of the apostles in a holy and orthodox manner. I have proposed this opinion in my books, even when Melanchthon in his earlier works still pressed a rigid kind of fate and took away free will from man. For he has changed, treated, and retracted those works of his so many times that it is not permissible to remember.</p>
      <p>The providence of God is the preservation and governance in God by which He takes care of all His creatures, I say, by powerfully preserving and wisely and justly governing things. For Scripture testifies against the Epicureans and the foolish judgment of the flesh, that neither the world nor the things in the world subsist by their own will, nor are they governed by chance, but all are preserved and ruled by the wise, omnipotent, and just power of God. Testimonies are found everywhere in the Psalms, especially 139, and 104, 107, 147. Job 38 and 39, finally in Matthew chapter 6 and James 4. 148 in these words: Fire, hail, snow, ice, and stormy winds that fulfill His word, which you will not regret having read. Nor does a small fruit arise from this consideration of divine providence. For it consoles man in all adversities: for he thinks that what he suffers is imposed on him by the most loving Father. However much evil torments you, you still think it is imposed by Him who wishes you well, not ill. It restrains man from being carried away in prosperity. For prosperity is in the hand of God, not in your hand. Therefore, He is feared, He is invoked, and He is worshiped.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it urges us not to attribute too much to means, with God as the first cause being overlooked: not to attribute to ourselves what is a divine gift: not to trust in fleeting things. And indeed, all things that happen in human life present us with the opportunity to recognize His works, to praise His majesty, and to give thanks for benefits, to pray against evils, which we recognize God justly inflicts on us.</p>
      <p>Two objections are usually raised against this. If God works all things in all, certainly nothing is left for humans to do, and thus all effort and labor are abolished. Secondly: if God works all things in humans, then also sins, which are and happen in us by thinking, speaking, acting, and thus rapes, adulteries, murders, and other crimes that either others inflict on us or we on ourselves, are done by God as the author, whence God is constituted as the cause and author of evil.</p>
      <p>To the first objection, we say: all antiquity judges such an objection to be of foolish and impure men.</p>
      <p>For God does all things but through means, although He is not bound to them. For He works what He wills without means, as when He preserved Moses for 40 days without food and drink. He does some things against all means, as when He preserved Daniel in the lions' den and his companions in the fiery furnace. Yet it does not follow that means are useless and to be despised by humans. For God almost always uses them, not because He cannot do otherwise, but because it is fitting and useful for humans. For the providence of God does not disturb the order of things, does not abolish the duties of life, nor does it remove our economic or political industry, but through them, He works what He wills to be done in humans. Finally, humans accommodate themselves to these means, recognizing that God requires it and works in them in this way.</p>
      <p>Just as the pious do not become sluggish because of the providence of God, so they attribute the good, useful, and honest work of means to God.</p>
      <p>For although they recognize that parents preserve, nourish, and protect their children, vines produce wine, fields yield grain, yet speaking properly, we all say these things are done by God through parents, vines, fields. David conquered enemies, Moses redeemed Israel from Egypt, that is, God gave victory through David and liberation of Israel through Moses. David did not ignore that his whole life was governed by divine providence: yet he was not made idle, but fled from Saul and moved every stone in persecutions. So do all the saints, especially the apostle Paul in his captivity in Acts 23 and 27. For in considering divine providence, the saints continually look to the word of God, what it commands, what it forbids.</p>
      <p>For this is especially contained in divine providence. Therefore, whoever wants to consult himself should carefully consider what order God has outlined in His word, what He has written, and by what way He has commanded to walk, and let him walk in it, not separating God's precepts and words from divine providence.</p>
      <p>In the other objection, many have greatly tormented themselves. For some, seeing it would be most absurd to make God the author of evil, denied the providence of God. Others, again, convinced by so many clear testimonies of sacred scripture, testifying that God works all things in all, said that God also commits murders and rapes, that is, is the author of sin. But this doctrine is perverse. For God is the source of all good and does not do evil, nor does He destine or impel to evil; otherwise, how would a just God judge the world? We say, therefore, that God works certain things through humans as He uses them as secondary causes, as God cooperates, but God Himself sustains the work most of all, as when the apostle says: God works in you to will and to act, for the good purpose of the mind. Behold, God works or operates, but in us, not outside us or without us. We cooperate with God, who inserts in us the power of willing and acting according to His favorable will towards us.</p>
      <p>For without Him, we can do nothing good, through whom all the good works of the saints have been done. Elsewhere the same apostle says: We are God's fellow workers (namely in the holy ministry), you are God's field, God's building, according to the grace of God given to me. Behold, he says, we are fellow workers, but according to the grace granted, without which we are nothing. Therefore, God works through us in the ministry, and we work through His grace. So it is in all good works. But God works certain works of humans as the first cause, without which and against whose will nothing can exist, so that meanwhile the parts of the work are mostly of secondary causes, but nothing is left to God except permission. And in this way, God also makes evils and sins, namely, while He permits them, that is, while He does not prohibit what He could undoubtedly prohibit if He wished. Therefore, secondary causes, such as the devil and corrupt man, make sins or evils most of all: but God permits them, does not make them, being pure from all sin and suspicion of sin.</p>
      <p>It is objected: Permission is not operation: if therefore God does not make sin but permits it, certainly God does not work all things. Furthermore, a mixture of things follows from permission, so that the devil wants, what he can, to overthrow the world, etc. I say: God works all things that are consistent with His nature.</p>
      <p>He does not will sins, nor does He impel to sins, because they are contrary to His nature. Psalm 5 and Job 34. Romans 3. Therefore, He does not work sins, but permits them to happen. That permission is in divine providence and not separate from it. It is circumscribed by certain limits set by God, so that Satan cannot do as much as he wants. Nor can humans do as much as they want, but as much as God permits. The clearest examples are in Job and in the people of God, against whom barbarian kings could not do as much as they wanted. Thus, I say, that permission is included in providence, so that those works which are done by the devil and diabolical humans with God's permission are referred by the saints to God Himself as the author. For Job says: The hand of the Lord has touched me, the Lord gave, the Lord has taken away: he does not say: The Lord gave, the devil, the Sabeans, the bloodthirsty soldiers took away. He speaks thus, not because he felt that God had inspired the murders, but because the devil had inspired them with God's permission, and because God had withdrawn His hand, therefore he attributes the work to God, which was truly the work of the demon and bloodthirsty men, for which God justly punished them, to whom He was justly angry for that deed.</p>
      <p>However, He seems to have done it Himself who did not prohibit what He could have prohibited. Tertullian in his second book against Marcion and Prudentius in his Hamartigenia abhor such objections and similar ones as heretical, sacrilegious, and insulting to God. And indeed, only he who has never been rightly instructed in the catechism doubts that God has many and very just causes for His permission. For since God is just, He certainly does nothing against justice: since He is a Father, He does nothing alien to paternal affection. But we are taught and profess that God is such in the Decalogue, in the Apostles' Creed, and in the Lord's Prayer. John of Damascus recounts many causes of permission in his book on the Orthodox Faith II. c. 29. Yet some abhor the word permission as if it were alien to the scriptures: which is indeed strange, since it is certain that both the scripture itself and all the doctors of the church from the times of the apostles have used that word in explaining this matter. Did not God Himself say in Psalm 51: My people did not listen to my law, and I let them go according to the desires of their hearts?</p>
      <p>Did not Paul say in Acts 14: God who made heaven and earth and all things in them in past ages εἴασε, allowed, all nations to walk in their own ways, that is, God permitted any nations to live according to their way of life? For the way is the manner of life, to walk is to live. The same apostle in Ephesians 4 clearly demonstrates that those ways of the Gentiles were not from God as the author, saying: I testify by God that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, and the blindness of their heart. He attributes this to the devil in 2 Corinthians 4. It is certain that the most holy martyrs of Christ and doctors Irenaeus, Origen, Pamphilus, Augustine in his book on the divination of demons chapters 1 and 2.</p>
      <p>Retract. II c. 30. I do not think the Hieronymian exposition in his Commentary on Ezekiel chapter 5 is unknown to you. Therefore, we would be led by petulance, not religion, if we continued to despise ways and methods of explaining scriptures not alien to the scriptures and used since the preaching of Christ. We should not attribute so much to our inventions, and our own should not please us so much that we disdain the ways and methods of the Holy Spirit in explaining.</p>
      <p>Certainly, that God is not the author of evil (which in this dispute is like a sacred anchor), does not will evil nor impel to sin or destine human wills to sin, but that all cause and origin of evil are derived from the malice of the devil and the free will of man, is so clearly testified by the testimonies of scripture that no cause, no matter is equally illustrated. There are irrefutable testimonies: Genesis 3, 4, and 6. Isaiah 50. Jeremiah 23. Daniel 9. Zechariah 8. Hosea 13. Matthew 15 and 23. John 8, 13. Luke 22. 1 John 2 and 3. James 1. Romans 3, 5, and 7. Nor does scripture contradict itself when God is said elsewhere to harden and blind. Compare these places with others such as Psalm 92. 4 Kings 17. 2 Chronicles 36. Isaiah 33. Jeremiah 5, 7, 17. Ezekiel 2, 3, etc. Read the judgments of the ancients on this matter: Irenaeus in 4, Tertullian 2 against Marcion, Phylastrius against heresies heresy 77 and 53, Jerome on Isaiah chapter 63, Augustine on grace and free will to Valentinus chapter 23, tractate on John 53. You will find that necessity and inevitable fate have been condemned since the age of the apostles in the learned apology of the most holy martyr Pamphilus for Origen.</p>
      <p>Manichaeus contended that all things happen by necessity and that evil cannot be avoided. For God impels to sin, to which no one can resist. He warns everyone that the dispute in Romans 9 should not be extended more broadly than he instituted. Others should compare places with this one, where he discussed the same matter, such as 2 Corinthians 4 and 1 Timothy 1, 2, and 4, especially in 2 Timothy 2.</p>
      <p>The free will of man is considered according to its threefold state, namely what it was like before the fall, what it is like after the fall in an unregenerate man, and what it is like in a regenerate man.</p>
      <p>Hence, it will be said without difficulty to what extent man has free will, to what extent he does not. Before the fall, man, I say our parent, was most perfect and in all respects of free will, as scripture clearly says in Genesis 1 and 2.</p>
      <p>Ecclesiasticus 15. It is necessary to confess this clearly. For unless we understand here well that Adam was created good and free by God, we will later err in the causes of good and evil and attribute to God what conflicts with His nature.</p>
      <p>On this matter, Augustine argued learnedly against the Manichaeans who invented two natures in the book against Julian I. chapter 3.</p>
      <p>After the fall, man's intellect and will were not taken away, so that man was changed into a stone or beast, but the intellect was so obscured that it understands nothing divine further from its own powers, as it was fitting to understand. This is what the apostle also said in 1 Corinthians 2. From free will, however, the will became completely enslaved, so that man is now not only inclined to sin but subject to sin and sold under sin. Romans 7 and 8. And in this respect, man is not of free will. And yet he is again of free will. For as far as evil and sin are concerned, man operates sin not by compulsion but by his own will and nature. For man is not compelled to sin. For corruption from itself voluntarily operates corruption.</p>
      <p>A corrupt mind projects corruption, a will eager for corruption eagerly chooses and pursues corruption. And so all errors and sins proceed from man, so that it is not necessary to refer these to God as the instigator. As far as good is concerned, faith, virtues, and good works, the intellect does not judge rightly about these, nor does the will choose and follow good but rather evil, as I have just said: hence man has no free will for good, in an unregenerate man. Indeed, God has left from His great grace an intellect, very much different from the understanding of beasts, which He also commands to cultivate, and He adds His gifts and progress. For even the arts are not in our power. The pagans saw this who said the inventors of the arts were gods. In spiritual matters, we cannot even think good from ourselves. This is what the apostle said excellently in 2 Corinthians 3. Because the Lord first said: Without me, you can do nothing. And: No one comes to me unless my Father draws him, etc.</p>
      <p>Moreover, a regenerate man is of free will, not by the power of nature but by the virtue of divine grace. For through the Spirit of God, he can understand, add, and choose, finally do good. For unless we confess this, we will deny the freedom of the children of God and again introduce servitude more than legal. To this pertain the testimonies of John 8. If the Son sets you free, you will be truly free. John 15: Whoever abides in me and I in him, he bears much fruit. Philippians 1: It has been granted to you for Christ not only to believe in Him but also to suffer for Him. And chapter 2: God is the one who works in you both to will and to act, for the good purpose of the mind. 2 Corinthians 3: All our sufficiency is from God. Also: Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And here indeed the faithful work not passively, as they say, but actively. For although they act by the Spirit of God and all merit is due to God, yet we work, we do not merely suffer operation, and thus we also cooperate, made capable and confirmed by the same grace.</p>
      <p>The Manichaeans labored under this error, stripping man of all action as far as the will is concerned, and therefore they also turned him into a trunk or stone. But Paul: I remind you to stir up the gift of God that is in you, etc. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. A good part of chapter 8 to the Romans pertains here. Blessed Augustine agrees with the scriptures (on grace and free will to Valentinus chapter 17 and on the merits and remission of sins book II chapter 5 on correction and grace chapter 8).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it should not be concealed that free will in the regenerate also retains its weakness. For not always does that happen which we had determined, but almost the contrary. This can be gathered from the words of the apostle Romans 1. 15 and 7. James 4. Especially since sin dwells in us and fights against the spirit, the free do not freely and readily accomplish what they understand should be accomplished, and when they accomplish it, they do not accomplish it as fully as it should be. These things become clear if we read Paul's doctrine in Romans 7 and Galatians 5.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, since the powers of the flesh in the regenerate are not so powerful as to extinguish the spirit, there is freedom in the regenerate. Nor are they compelled to do good, but they do good willingly through the grace of the Spirit of God. This is simply what we think about free will, nor do we approve of those who follow either the Manichaeans or the Pelagians, about whom you can read Augustine against the two letters of the Pelagians book 3 chapter 8. Irenaeus 1. 2. chapter 5. also Augustine Epistle 106 to Boniface, on the merits and remission of sins 1. 2. chapter 18. Nor should we defend grace, he says, in such a way that we seem to take away free will, nor should we assert free will so that we are judged with proud impiety ungrateful to the grace of God. And would that all the learned today would adhere to this orthodox rule: certainly, there would be more peace and fewer disputes and superfluous arguments. Briefly, the church has never taught otherwise from the beginning about this matter.</p>
      <p>Consult, if you wish, Irenaeus 1. 4 against heresies chapter 76, Jerome on Jeremiah chapter 26. chapter 10 and 18, to Ctesiphon against the Pelagians themselves book 3 folio 137; Augustine to Marcellinus on the spirit and letter chapter 30, on the merits and remission of sins 1. 2 chapter 18, and against the two letters of the Pelagians book 4 chapter 2 and 6; on grace and free will to Valentinus chapter 13 and 15. If you wish, read Ecclesiastical dogma chapter 32 and 49.</p>
      <p>Moreover, predestination, preordination, or predefinition is that divine ordination by which from eternity He destined all things, especially man, the lord of all, to a certain end, and that by His holy counsel, judgment, or decree. Now the election of God is from eternity by which indeed He chose some to life, others to destruction.</p>
      <p>The cause of election and predestination is none other than the good and just will of God, undeservedly saving the elect, but deservedly condemning and rejecting the reprobate. For the apostle says: God, he says, saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His purpose and grace, which was given to us indeed through Christ Jesus before eternal times, but is now made manifest through the appearance of the Savior, etc. And again: God chose us in Christ before the foundations of the world were laid that we should be holy and blameless before Him in love, who predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of His glorious grace, etc. And soon: Through whom we have also been made heirs according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will. Therefore, God chose from eternity whom He willed. He willed, however, according to the decree and purpose of God, believers. And these indeed are predestined to death and destruction, those to life and salvation.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we do not constitute faith as our work as the cause of election or predestination, as if God chose us because of the faith He foresaw in us: but we attribute election and salvation to the grace of God, of which indeed the gift of faith in Christ is. For Paul does not say that God chose us because we would believe, but that we should believe. Whence Augustine also seems to have taken what he said: Not because we believe did He choose us, but that we should believe, lest we seem to have chosen Him first. See Augustine's Epistle to Boniface 106, folio 310D. Yet again, faith is included in God's decree. For since it is certain that God adopted us as sons through Christ from eternity, and that adoption is received by the elect through faith, as the apostle and evangelist John testifies in chapter 1, it is undoubted that the elect are believers: the elect indeed not because of the merit as if it were their own faith, but because of the divine dispensation and the order of true salvation, by which God Himself recognizes none as sons except believers and communicates adoption to us through faith, which we also receive by faith alone. For unless we concede this, we have removed the doctrine of faith altogether.</p>
      <p>We condemn here the error of Vitalis, who says that anyone can believe or not believe the gospel preached to him by free will. For the Lord said: No one comes to me unless my Father draws him. But the apostle also said: By grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God. We say, therefore, that all believers are elect and all believers are endowed with faith by God. We say that non-believers are reprobates, and since not all men believe, not all men are elect. But that some do not believe and perish, we do not attribute the blame to God or His predestination, but to the man himself rejecting the grace of God and not receiving heavenly gifts. Thus, the mouth of the Lord taught us to speak. For He says: Whoever has, more will be given to him, and he will have abundance, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. This pertains to the parable of the talents and the servants to whom they are entrusted (Matthew chapter 25). In John, the Lord says: This is the condemnation that light has come into the world, and the world loved darkness rather than light. This sentence is more fully illustrated by the parable of those invited to the supper in Luke 14. And elsewhere in the gospel: Satan sows tares. The same takes away the good seed from the heart lest it bear fruit. Whence also Paul, instructed by the words of the Lord, asserts that the god of this age blinds the minds of unbelievers. The Lord wanted to gather the Jerusalemites as a hen gathers her chicks, but they refused. Therefore, the blame is not to be cast on God and His predestination either impelling or retaining in unbelief, but on the perverse will of those unwilling.</p>
      <p>So, you ask, is there a faculty in man by which he receives or rejects the word of God? Indeed, there is in man a native corruption that repels the word of God. But if man receives the word of God, it is the grace of the one who enlightens. St. Augustine disputes much whether faith is constituted in our power, and whether God denies or does not grant faith to unbelievers? His dispute is found in the book on the spirit and letter to Marcellinus chapters 31, 32, 33, 34. Since these things are so, I do not usually teach, as some do, that God has rejected some so that He even now hardens them so that they do not believe the truth, granting the gift of faith to a few. Rather, we urge those universal promises and command all to hope well.</p>
      <p>Predestination indeed, concluded from eternity in the secret counsel of God, has finally been revealed to us through the prophets, especially through Christ and the apostles, that God is a lover of men, that He wishes well to men, that He has chosen all who believe in Christ to life, and thus that He wishes all men to be saved. Whence the gospel is commanded to be preached to every creature. For Isaiah: We all like sheep have gone astray, and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. The same: Come, all you who are thirsty, to the waters. Which the Savior repeated in John 7. Who also said in Luke and Matthew: Everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, etc.</p>
      <p>What is more, the same: It is not the will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones should perish. To this sentence, He adds the elegant parable of the lost sheep in Luke 15. Also, in John 3 and 6, it is clearly expressed that the salvation of all believers is, that is, that all believers are preordained to eternal life. The holy apostles Peter and Paul, with great consolation for the faithful, did not scrupulously and as if to be shared with a few, expose the matter of salvation. For he, when he came into the house of the soldier and saw the crowd of Gentiles thirsting for the word of God, said: I truly perceive that God shows no partiality, but in every nation, whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him.</p>
      <p>And again: God is patient with us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. But Paul, I say: The righteousness of God, he says, through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all who believe: for there is no distinction, for all have sinned, etc. And again: If one died for all, then all died, and He died for all, etc. I pass over countless other things of this kind which are everywhere in the scriptures. These, I say, I think should be urged in the church lest by disputing more scrupulously about the hidden judgments of God, about predestination and election of God, we cast scruples into the minds of the simple and the exercised alike, whom we can never again extricate: whence soon follows hatred of God, despair, and blasphemy, as if God, calling all and offering His gifts to all, wishes to give them only to a few and thus to play and dismiss others empty. Therefore, the divine promise and truth will come into danger. Thus, I am accustomed, as I have explained, to teach moderately, religiously, and orthodoxly about predestination.</p>
      <p>That Calvin, our brother in the Lord to be honored, strives in every way to assert the purity of divine grace, who would blame the holy man's purpose? That he also inserts somewhere that God not only foresaw the fall of the first man and the ruin of posterity in it but also dispensed it by His will: likewise, those whom He created for destruction to become instruments of His wrath, He now deprives of the faculty of hearing His word, now blinds and stupefies them more by its preaching, etc.: who does not see that these are proposed in such a way that the ancients would not have recognized them? I certainly would not dare to speak thus, as I think the sincerity of divine grace can be defended, even if we do not say that God creates man for destruction and leads or impels him to that end by hardening or blinding. Meanwhile, we overlook many things in the ancients because of the excellent gifts bestowed on them by the Lord. Who would deny that Calvin is endowed with great gifts from God?</p>
      <p>The Pelagians pressed Augustine heavily, so that in this cause he tormented himself most grievously and seems to write somewhat harshly in the books on the predestination of the saints and on the good of perseverance, also in the books against Julian. However, he explains himself in the little book in which he responds to articles falsely imposed on him. Read, I beseech you, that little book which is found in the Basel edition Tom. VII. Fol. 921. Prosper, a learned and excellent man, lived in the age of St. Augustine. After the death of blessed Augustine, he labored much to defend the blessed doctor, lest he seem to have disputed absurd and scripturally contrary things about predestination. Therefore, he wrote a book on the sentences to the chapters of the Gauls, also another: A Response to the Excerpts of the Genoese. In the same century lived blessed Fulgentius, who also treated this matter learnedly and piously in the book to Monimus 1. If you read this diligently, I am sure you will thank me for having reminded you of this matter.</p>
      <p>I have explained my opinion to you, most esteemed friend, more copiously and indeed more copiously than I initially thought, about what I think concerning the question you proposed to me.</p>
      <p>If I have answered well, let us give thanks to the Lord. If anything in this my response seems false or obscure to you, I willingly endure to be taught. For thus far, to gratify you, my excellent friend, I have written these things. Love me, live, and farewell.</p>
      <p>Commend me to the most sacred Archbishop of Canterbury and the best princes, the Duke of Northumberland, and others who love the truth. Zurich, March 3, 1553.</p>
