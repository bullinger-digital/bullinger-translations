    <p xml:id="regest1">Since his departure from Zurich, he could not write because he had no messenger. Thomas Hofmann informed him that in Zurich the completely unfounded rumor was circulating that he had already been dismissed in Balingen as incompetent. He and his assistant Martin [Decker] were insulted in a vile manner by the former Balingen pastor Konrad [Gösslinger] after he had discussed with them several times. Half of the Balingen clergy is rebellious and incompetent, while the other half is seriously engaged with the reformed doctrine. The church congregation, with a few exceptions, supports the Reformation, and even the initially hesitant council now stands behind the reformed pastors; the chief bailiff [Hans von Stotzingen] was admonished by the Duke to protect the reformed pastors. A pastor, probably Kaspar Franz von Maur, has slandered him in the "Krone" in Balingen. He hopes to have dispelled all suspicion in Zurich with this letter. He asks Bullinger to support his former parish Pfäffikon. He would like to come to Zurich for the spring synod. He awaits a response. Greetings, especially to the bailiff at Kyburg [Hans Rudolf Lavater] and his wife. He apologizes for his inadequate letter, but did not dare to write in Latin. Assurance regarding meat [shipment?].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, after I left you, I intended to write to you and my dear lords and brothers immediately about my situation, but the only reason I haven't is that I had no messenger, etc.</p>
      <p>Thomas Hofmann, the preacher at Eyttwyl in Ecker parish, came to me on Wednesday after Candlemas and told me that there was a common rumor among you that I had been expelled by my lords and fellow citizens of Balingen. He summoned me before an honorable council and asked me where I had studied, whether I was a master or bachelor or held any other degree. He also said to me that I had preached against the mass and images from the very beginning. Furthermore, he claimed that I was the one who could not give an answer to an honorable council. To this, I say truthfully, whoever has spoken against me has wronged my lords of Balingen and me, and he is not a pious, honorable man. That you, Master Heinrich, and dear brothers, have had sorrow on my account, grieves me deeply. The first sermon I gave was about what faith is, the second about marriage; for I had to conduct a marriage, which had been waiting for me for about a month, etc.</p>
      <p>That there has been a considerable outcry against me is not surprising. You know, dear brothers, that Satan does not rest. He is restless. He must be paid. There is one stronger than he. His kingdom is breaking day by day and must break with God's help. You should note this: There was a preacher for about 34 years in Balingen, named Master Conrad N., who came to us in the parish courtyard once, twice, three times, and spoke with us amicably and earnestly, and truly we with all discipline and honor with him, about the papacy, the gospel, and marriage, as well as about the sacraments, and brought him with divine word to the point that he freely admitted to us that it was the truth, especially about the holy marriage, which Peter and Paul, also Barnabas, did not lead around with them, but wives, 1 Cor. 9[5. 6]. He also freely and clearly told us that the gospel of God was the true teaching, which they and we should have always taught, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear brothers, see how our God is a God. This man has insulted me and you and all of us so badly that I cannot write it to you, namely heretic, false prophet, ringleader, deceiving people in the land like sausage sellers. Furthermore, he wants to accuse us of not being able to speak, etc.; and yet the matter stands so well now. O my God and creator, you alone are the one who enlightens and ignites the heart.</p>
      <p>As for the other priests, they are nothing. They know and can do nothing but sing requiems, play, whore, drink, swear, lie in board games. Yet it must soon be forbidden to the Balingen priests. As for the other priests and pastors, they come to the afternoon sermon on Sunday, listen earnestly, and also take part. But it is a necessity: What is in the principality must proclaim the gospel of God or leave the benefice. Many do this, etc.</p>
      <p>As for church attendance in Balingen, it is good. The common people are eager for the word of God. The women too, although some women are dissatisfied with us. I swear by my oath, the mass priests are stirring them up, for some want to leave. Otherwise, it is good. The authorities initially did not want to participate either. But now it is good. For we let a council gather and spoke with them, the common people now look to them, and they have sworn an oath to the prince to be obedient to him. It did not please them, indeed. But I spoke to them nonetheless, the prince also signed with his own hand that no harm should be done to us, by losing his grace, to the chief bailiff.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have been slandered by a preacher. He is supposed to be from my gracious lords of Zurich's territory and is said to have spoken at the "Krone" in Balingen, which I do not know, is probably true. Furthermore, no parish is provided for me, that the common people have had a shoe against me, and not unjustly, when one speaks like that of someone. But an honorable, wise council and a pious community in Balingen now hear well what my teaching is; which is not mine, but God's, John 7[16]. I suspect, based on everything that has been shown to me, the person is Herr Caspar von Maur, the pious man; for the description is that he is a handsome person, tall and eloquent. He would have liked to become a pastor in Balingen, as I have been told. If it is him, which I do not trust, I have never deserved it from him and do not want to deserve it from any pious Christian brother and no pious man. He should have rightly said to himself first: "Physician, heal yourself" Luke 4[23]. But we are such poor people, we do not consider any offense, so there is no Christian love in us. For which we should rightly be punished by God, etc.</p>
      <p>This is now, dear Master Heinrich, and brothers, the matter I wanted to write to you about, so that you know how things stand with me and you come out of the ark. For I have no doubt, if things were to go badly for me, you would have a heartache and sorrow with me, truly as I would also have for you. You can surely believe and trust me in this. For all honor and respect has been done to me in my gracious lords of Zurich's territory. I will never forget this for good, nor will my family, God willing.</p>
      <p>You should also, Master Heinrich, stand firmly by an honorable parish in Pfäffikon, where I have been a servant in the Lord for several years, that they may be firmly and well taught. I have no doubt about this. For good has been done to us there.</p>
      <p>I also intend, if peace remains, to come to you at the next synod, if it is God's will, in whom all power resides.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you, Master Heinrich, to write to me again about how things stand with you and my brothers everywhere, if possible.</p>
      <p>No more, but may God the Lord richly bless and protect you with His divine grace, and all of us. Amen. Given on St. Agatha's Day in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Hans Wagner, pastor at Balingen, your willing servant and brother always.</p>
      <p>Greet for me, Master Heinrich, your wife, children, and mother a thousand times. Also, Master Leo Jud, Bellicanus, Theodor Bibliander, Master Erasmus, and other dear lords and brothers, friendly and earnestly.</p>
      <p>Also my dear lord of Kyburg, who has done much good for me, and his noble wife, greet them for me earnestly and friendly. And if he wants to go to Surbrunnen, it is the very next through Balingen. If he comes to Balingen, I will, God willing, do him honor, etc.</p>
      <p>I ask you, Master Heinrich, not to be displeased with my simple writing. I should have written to you in Latin, but I fear I might have sometimes offended Priscian.</p>
      <p>Tell your wife and mother, I will not forget her regarding the meat, etc.</p>
      <p>To the learned and erudite Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the divine word in Zurich, my most beloved brother, etc.</p>
