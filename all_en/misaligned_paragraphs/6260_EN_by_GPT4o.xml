      <p>Salus et pax a deo etc.</p>
      <p>Greetings and peace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>Know, dear brother, that Mr. Rudolf wrote to me on Sunday, saying that I would find the entire Glarus matter in your letter, but I have not received any since Josue was with me 8 days ago; therefore, I am concerned.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I hear that the plague is near you; it does not particularly please me, but whatever God's will is, let it be. I ask you, if anything should happen to you all, let me know, whether it be day or night, for I want to help and support you all (to the best of my ability). God will surely protect His own.</p>
      <p>But if the danger is in some places, come over to me, I will share with you what I have, etc.</p>
      <p>The steward wants to doctor himself to death, has a new one every week, now has some old rags in the sweat baths, does not listen to advice, except what his pretty wife advises, he follows her, wherever she leads him, etc.</p>
      <p>The bailiff came to me on Thursday with his wife, for which reason I rearranged my books; for it would not be commendable if I had loaned them out to other people.</p>
      <p>But it is my wife's curiosity.</p>
      <p>Who is not strong, as the young lady will surely tell you, etc.</p>
      <p>No more, than God be with you all.</p>
      <p>Given on the 4th of September.</p>
      <p>Greet the people for me.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes.</p>
      <p>To his dear brother Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
