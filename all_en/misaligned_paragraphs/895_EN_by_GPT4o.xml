      <p>I received your letter today after eight o'clock in the evening, which was most delightful to me, as it displayed the fatherly affection I most desired from you; however, it also brought some distress, as it suggested that I am partly suspected by you of negligence, and partly of some cunning πονηρίας (wickedness). Indeed, my teacher, I am most distressed by this and strive again and again to make you reconciled with me.</p>
      <p>For it is true, as he says, that I have enticed his son here through letters; I freely admit this. However, I do not see how I have explained to you the manner and purpose with which I did this: therefore, I would like you to receive from me in a few words the reason for this action.</p>
      <p>When I was leaving there, Alexander's mother, an excellent and most holy woman, earnestly and tearfully implored me to show the due kindness to her, as her husband had passed away. I also saw that she was so pressed by poverty and the constraints of her household that she would eventually be forced to withdraw her sons from their studies and push them into the workshop of some craftsman. Therefore, I promised her my support, effort, and all my labor without any exception of place, time, or occupation, piously and righteously, as I ought.</p>
      <p>Not long after, I demonstrated this in action. As soon as that most good and great God had sufficiently prospered my affairs here, I immediately wrote to the boy's mother, asking her not to push her son into unworthy and sordid arts, but rather to send him here to me; for with God's help, I would either keep him in his studies or at least place him more suitably than she could at home, with a certain bookseller here, a man most perfect in his art and well persuaded of religion. And if you consider this action of mine more deeply, you will say that I acted not so imprudently, but rather fulfilled the promise I made to her piously; for at home, he would undoubtedly have long since been pushed into the workshop of either a tailor or a ring maker or a shoemaker. Here, however, he lives with me and engages in studies, which are the most desirable and excellent things granted and given to the human race by God, namely philosophy, that most powerful and glorious, indeed most ancient and noble art; if I could not have led him to such a beautiful and excellent study, or kept him on course, there was a workshop present, and a master present, who would have gladly received him for free. He could have studied mechanical disciplines with greater praise and honor in a distant and foreign nation than at home. Therefore, I do not see how I can rightly be accused by you of rashness or imprudence, much less how I have unjustly received this favor and kindness from the boy's mother.</p>
      <p>And so I come to the other objection, where you say you hear that I do not devote myself to studies and letters, but continually run to London from here and there.</p>
      <p>I cannot sufficiently marvel at this, since (as I certainly know) you have no good man as a witness to my negligence. But, you say, your letters betray you; for you have often sent them to us from London. I admit it. But, I ask, can a certain argument of either diligence or negligence be gathered from this? I do not think so.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, never, so help me God, have I gone to London except for the most urgent and necessary reasons. Twice I rode there with Mr. Peter Martyr, my dearest and most connected teacher, to the court of Canterbury, when I presented the confession of the Strasbourg church, translated into Latin by me at the command and advice of Peter and Utenhovius, to the Archbishop of the English, and also received some angelots. Thirdly, in the past year, when there was a debate here about the Eucharist, I immediately wrote down the disputation and handed a copy to the Marquis of Dorset; in whose court I spent several days pleasantly with Wullock and Scinner, most excellent men. When I left him, he kindly promised me 20 crowns annually for my study and labor, and he has most abundantly fulfilled this: for within these ten months, he has paid me more than 34 crowns in advance. Fourthly, I was called there by Treherne, my best and most faithful patron, through letters, ordered to offer certain lectures, written by me on the divorce of Peter Martyr, to the Earl of Warwick: from which also some profit came to me. Lastly, I went to London when I presented your letters, given to me in December, to the Marquis of Dorset at Peter's advice, and offered your study and kindness honorably: which was most pleasing to him of all. He also then, beyond all my expectation, greatly praised my study and kindness, who so piously extended a hand to my fellow countryman, namely Alexander: he said he would pursue me with his liberality all the more willingly.</p>
      <p>And in short, to touch on the matter briefly, if it is a question of securing the patronage of some prince, I think I should not just go, but hasten with sails and horses. You have, therefore, the causes and reasons for my journeys, which are not fictitious or rash, but true and connected with virtue and honesty. As for my studies, if you have any doubts, ask Mr. Cox or Mr. Peter Martyr, with whom I spend at least three or four hours every day, often half a day, in comparing the writings of the fathers and writing down lectures and disputations. I am not making anything up here, I am not inventing anything, the work itself is a sure and ample witness for me. Let people now go and lie about me there as much as they want: I will certainly not consider the empty shafts of words worth a straw. It will also be your prudence, my teacher, not to immediately give credence to such little men, unless the matter is well and thoroughly known.</p>
      <p>But enough of this now: I come to matters that are somewhat more serious than can be entrusted to Latin letters. So have it thus.</p>
      <p>For neither among you nor as a citizen nor as a resident did it happen that I became, but in a world far from your city, I have been made to be among those who are not of the same confession, so as far as I can, I am looking to find nothing that I would take from others, nor to introduce you to those of our people. It is not right for you to demand any gift or benefaction from them, but only to show some favor to those who have been the cause of some benefaction before me. I have sworn by the Almighty God that no one will ever hear or embrace me as a flatterer or sycophant, nor would I attempt this with you, knowing well that such things lead to hatred especially. Having spent my whole life in Dourgaiia, and never having been among those who rule among you, I would not be happy to be a stranger, except for one single two-year period, during which I spent most pleasantly among you, yet not having been sworn there during that time. Therefore, you should not be troubled or grieved on my account. As for your letters of recommendation concerning Alexander to Opper and Treherne, I cannot guess what they might achieve. For concerning the predestination of men, the admirable God has separated them so that I would not wish you to engage or contend with them through letters. This is confidential, so it should not be disclosed or narrated to anyone among all people. What then should we do in this matter, I do not know. I have just approached Mr. Peter Martyr, and asked what he himself considers best to do. He briefly replied that since Mr. Bullinger has decided to dedicate a book to these princes, I think the matter should be postponed until that time; nor would I want him to ask for any stipends either for you or for another, but only to ensure that the book is offered through Alexander: the matter might then succeed better on its own, while Bullinger's dignity remains intact, and your modesty also remains whole. This is his advice. I think it should be followed, as it is full of prudence and fidelity. It will now be your humanity and faith to bring the matter itself, which you have most kindly and humanely promised us, to a conclusion shortly. This will indeed be nothing more pleasing to the prince, nothing more worthy of your illustrious name, nothing more useful to us, that you can do.</p>
      <p>I have abundantly explained to you in previous letters the material and argument for handling this man correctly. I will now speak briefly. This man is born of the same royal stock and very closely related; he is a most ample counselor of the king's realms.</p>
      <p>He has diligently and laboriously strived to propagate the Gospel of Christ to this day. He is a thunderbolt and terror to the Papists, that is, a dreadful and terrible antagonist. He spoke most honorably with his living voice in the previous assemblies for the Eucharist. He is diligently cultivated by the king. He is learned, and speaks Latin elegantly: he is the fortress and refuge of all students and foreigners. He nurtures the most learned among him; he has a daughter fourteen years old, more holy and learned than can be said, to whom I hope to soon present your book on the holy Christian marriage, almost entirely translated into Latin by me.</p>
      <p>Have this inscription of the book: To Heinrich Grey, Marquis of Dorset; to Lord Ferrers of Groby, Herington, Bonvill, and Ashle, royal counselor, his most esteemed lord, etc. This is as a single title of named lords.</p>
      <p>In it will be mentioned the cities and regions that are under his dominion. I cannot write more clearly or expressly to you. Concerning Dudley, Earl of Warwick, your most loving, I write nothing now: for I am expecting his chaplain daily, a man indeed most excellent and learned; from him, I will fully learn the will of the lord, and then I will immediately write to you. The last thing will be that in your letter to the Marquis of Dorset, you should express immortal thanks to him, who has so kindly extended his faith and right hand to me for your sake. Also, commend Alexander diligently and officiously in private letters to Andreas Wullock and Robert Scinner, men most devoted to your church; not that you seek any stipend for us, but only that they may have us commended to them. They themselves know well Alexander's necessity; they help me all the more strongly. I would like you to give thanks. They will soon understand the matter themselves, or if necessary, I will interpret it well myself: this can be done with your dignity intact, and also with the modesty of the excellent boy preserved. Believe me, those letters of yours, which you gave to me last December, were most pleasing to them: for in them you seemed to speak and think honorably enough about them. I would like you to send a copy to each, or at least order me to do this here through letters. Do you understand the matter? If you send it here, enough will be done for them by mine for you: if you expressly order it in letters, I will hand it over to them here.</p>
      <p>It remains, my dearest and most desired teacher, that you may be well, and love me as you do. Mr. Peter Martyr greets you all; he wishes to give you the greatest thanks through me for your study and kindness towards him.</p>
      <p>He will reply within this month: he is now occupied with more serious matters. He has us most commended to him. Farewell again. The day before the calends of May 1550.</p>
      <p>From Oxford, from the King's College.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>The most negligent courier departed on the 15th day. To the man endowed with the highest piety, doctrine, and erudition, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
