      <p>Greetings. Since your departure and journey from us, which I hope has been fortunate and happy for you and your wife, it is rumored that the king is seeking 6000 Swiss; for what purpose, however, is clear from past events. I do not think your people will give their soldiers to the tyrant for parricide, unless they are insane. There are those who wish to excuse the king, as if that massacre was not done with his knowledge. Others assert that the king admits that the Guise family perpetrated it with his knowledge, but he understood that the admiral and his followers were plotting death for him and his mother. It is strange indeed if he fears the unarmed; he has oppressed all the unarmed.</p>
      <p>But if they deserved anything, what did the faithful wretches in other places deserve, their children, wives, and innocent crowds? Therefore, he attempts to cover the most monstrous parricide with fabrications and lies. But the Lord will find the guilty. For if God so severely punished Joash and the entire kingdom for the murder of Zechariah, as it is in 2 Chronicles 24, what will the King of France expect with his France? You will advise your people not to make themselves participants in innocent blood.</p>
      <p>Froschauer, having sent letters here the day before, submitted these new things, which are enclosed here. Teucher, who brought them ascending from Frankfurt, confirms the same; if they are true, they will soon be confirmed. However, I want you to share this news with our friend Dr. Johannes MÃ¼ller, to whom I am writing, so that he may receive them from you; I do not have the leisure to write out individual copies for each person. Our neighbors do not rejoice as much as they threaten. God knows when there will be enough of this arrogance.</p>
      <p>I commit myself and all of ours to Him, beseeching that He may have mercy on us and all of His people.</p>
      <p>Let us pray and cry out to the Lord, that He may be with us and turn away His wrath due to our sins from us.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your wife and children and friends, the councilors, Campell, Pontisella, Belinchet, Dr. Karl, and all others.</p>
      <p>I write this in great haste on the 26th of September, 1572. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Dr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his lord and honorable and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, preacher in Chur.</p>
