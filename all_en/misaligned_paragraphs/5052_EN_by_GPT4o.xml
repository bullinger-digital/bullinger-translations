      <p>I received your letter written on October 21st, along with the one you wrote to Mr. Peter, who is currently traveling, and I hope he will return to you safely in a few days. I was absent when he left, and when I sent back his horses, it was not possible to see him; but I will see you soon, God willing. Furthermore, I am grateful for what you wrote about the German expedition.</p>
      <p>Due to some rivalries and personal injuries, I suspect these issues are being stirred up, and I hope the matter concerning the people of Glarus will have a peaceful outcome. For all the wise Swiss understand well the danger their territory will be placed in and the troubles and calamities that will follow if they listen to those who, under the pretext of religion, want to stir up unrest and violate the rights of friendship. I hear that Philip is very distressed and anxious to maintain the authority of the Pope intact, and he is focused on ensuring that all ministers and those who preach the gospel differently than in their regions are expelled from France and that those who defect from the Roman See are severely punished, and he declares himself an enemy of all who support them.</p>
      <p>Due to the planned colloquium in France, the Spanish bishops have not yet gone to the council; among them are appointed the Archbishop of Granada, the Bishops of Salamanca, Le√≥n, and Oviedo. A fire has destroyed a large part of the city of Valladolid.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings with much interest to the consuls, the most honorable magistrate, and the fellow ministers, and remember us in your prayers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>At Saint-Germain on November 7th.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>What you have learned from the Diet of the Rhetoricians and the Hermits, you will write back. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
