      <p>Greetings. Yesterday I received your letters, to which I did not respond, as I was waiting to see what those I sent to you would report. I believe I wrote earlier that I would ensure that the host of the Ciconia understands that your recommendation has greatly benefited him and that you can promise him that I will do what you would do if you were the envoy yourself. The death of the Queen of England has interrupted the peace talks, and everything has been postponed to the beginning of February. There is still hope that peace will be established, although there are many difficulties and many things could happen in a short time that could disrupt everything.</p>
      <p>I have heard that Cardinal Paul pretended to be dead and had a funeral arranged, with everything set up for his escape. It is also reported that soldiers are being gathered in Milan and everything is being prepared for war.</p>
      <p>God will do what is beneficial and will pertain to His glory. In the state of the Swiss, I will strive to ensure that peace is maintained and that everyone follows peaceful counsel, and I will not omit anything. Please greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Baden, December 13.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
