      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, I give God praise and thanks that He has relieved you of the toothache, and you should know that your well-being and that of yours is my joy. May God continue to keep us in His blessing. Regarding Master Balthasar, although I have had a tiring day today, I have written to Glarus and asked the Landammann Schüler and Beldi, the bailiffs of Baden and Rheintal, and also bailiff Vogel, to do their best in the matter and to give me a hopeful and favorable response. I have sent my letters, including the one written to Schüler and enclosed in the letter to me, on their way. May God grant grace to it. Regarding my hospitality, I intend, God willing, to have the 24 men for a meal on the upcoming Monday around 5; the other 34 I plan to have on the following Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you can send me some venison, I would like to have it by Sunday evening or before 10 on Monday morning; if you can, send it in such a way and do not entrust it to a sluggard or a drunkard who loiters on the road and arrives at an inconvenient time. But if you cannot obtain any game and it is possible for you, then send me some hare; I will pay you for it as well as for the game. And if you have neither venison nor anything else, I invite you to be here on Monday before noon, etc. You will be surprised; there are two beautiful large books that the 58 men have given me as a gift, among them mostly very prominent people and all honorable citizens who bear a good heart towards me, which greatly pleases me. Thank God and pray that I may conduct myself in such a way that it is a benefit and joy to all the pious.</p>
      <p>God be with you; all my people greet you, and greet all of us, our dear Susanna and Liseli.</p>
      <p>Dated on St. Lawrence's Day at 5 in the afternoon, 1571. Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Poor Peter Grebel has been removed from his benefice, etc.</p>
      <p>To my dearly beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
