      <p>May the Lord bless you and your household and all our pious friends! Indeed, I have not received any letters from my friends for 5 weeks; therefore, I could not write anything. But during this whole time, I have been overwhelmed with occupations and my health is not very firm. However, what I received from Strasbourg, I sent to Mr. Ruinelli with the condition that he also shares it with you. The king again requests 6000 Swiss; for it is not enough that many perished in the previous expedition. If they are granted to him, it is a sign of Pharaoh-like blindness and hardening. Our people strictly prohibit all military service. Those who now march, intending to destroy with force. There is no money, only scraped together for the departure; in France, there is neither to bite nor to break and the land is badly devastated. If anyone wants to destroy, he can do so without the thanks of God and the world. These are the terrible judgments of God. May the Lord have mercy on us and protect us from evil! There is much misfortune and misery everywhere; may God improve it! Would that He soon resolve this conflict in the world with His judgment!</p>
      <p>Farewell. I wrote this very quickly. January 13, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your senior Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet our lords and friends, as well as your family.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To the pastor at St. Martin in Chur, Mr. Tobias Egli.</p>
