      <p>Greetings. While I hasten to approach you with a free foot, I am called away from the sacred, venerable man, by the goddess and am advised to weave harsh events into papers or to recount sad fates with a bound foot.</p>
      <p>"Do you not see," she says, "how now with discordant arms the whole world resounds with armed horses, how much the license of horrendous iron rages?" The impious, the only bloody kingdom for Christian men, now the lilies of the warlike French stink, and the fierce Spaniard strengthens the Italian powers, and the Tartarean head, sprinkling the earth with German blood, has now soaked many fields and thinks nothing is absent, that with the German subdued, he might subjugate all of Europe to Italian rule.</p>
      <p>In this, he bends the Stygian Acheron with many complaints and from everywhere compels neighboring aid, so that he might mix the lowest with the highest and the stars with the earth, and disturb all safe things with infernal evils.</p>
      <p>With various trials, the miserable Belgium proves this, the French peace bloody only for the pious, and for you, O Friesland, producing harmful disturbances, the prodigious madness of the Duke of Alba:</p>
      <p>Offspring of the Furies, not yet sated with bloody slaughter and robbery of the nobles, do you thus surpass the tyrant Marius himself in savagery, the craftsman of the false bull, and Phalaris?</p>
      <p>O the easy horses of Diomedes! O Busiris himself, gentle, and Tullia, the virgin, in her native murder!</p>
      <p>Is it thus right for princes to break all law when slain, thus to expose themselves before the rostrum?</p>
      <p>They deserved no evil; for all laws demand: to take up martial wars for the ancestral hearth, for the altars, for the law of God, for the gift of the saving word, to willingly pour out life.</p>
      <p>But the hatred of the right sharpens you to such daring deeds, you, I think, the vile members of the earthly god, that unless you are cruel, satiated with human blood, no overflowing pools will quench your thirst.</p>
      <p>This thirst absorbs bodies with wide estates, bodies of noble leaders to be wept for three times.</p>
      <p>A witness will be Nicholas, born of the noble lineage of Hattstatt, powerful in deeds and riches.</p>
      <p>He desires to restore the exiled nobles while attempting to restore them to their ancient land, but by the cunning of the enemy vulture, he is disturbed from his own seats and stripped of all goods.</p>
      <p>No less does the same dire tyranny hold the Venetians, outstanding in order.</p>
      <p>It was their custom, preserved for many years, to retain the judgment of faith for themselves, lest the one who seeks ill-gotten gains (seeking the profits of the belly) twist the holy entrails with an unkind hand, now they themselves offer their throat, now with the law broken, they are slaughtered as a pleasing victim to wild monks, nor will the power be given further, which has been taken away, to interpose the judgment of faith;</p>
      <p>Rather, they are burned everywhere with a slow flame, bodies ennobled by illustrious goods.</p>
      <p>Thus God punishes the soft leisure of our life, our internal dissension and grave discord.</p>
      <p>From which, that we may finally be relieved, miserable and oppressed, the wrath of God must be appeased with much prayer.</p>
      <p>Live, farewell, great man, illustrious leader of the flock of Christ, and consult the commands of our good goddess.</p>
      <p>Chur, 1568, 25th of August.</p>
