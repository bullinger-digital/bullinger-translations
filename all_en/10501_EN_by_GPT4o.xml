    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius, who inquired in letter No. 457, gives a positive judgment in letter No. 467 about Bucer's report to the people of Münster and the doctrine of the Lord's Supper contained therein: Life and righteousness come solely from faith; to the Word, God added visible signs of invisible grace; in bread and wine, only the believers receive Christ's body and bread; grace is not bound to the sacraments, which are nothing without faith. Thus, contrary to earlier suspicion, Bucer does not oppose the people of Zurich everywhere. Dark expressions can be interpreted mildly but can become dangerous for many. They stem from his commendable zeal for concord, while Luther stubbornly insists on the sensually perceptible presence. Schnepf reported to the Hessians about Blarer's change in doctrine. Blarer's inconsistency is displeasing. Luther will assert the carnal eating against Bucer's "Defensio" as he did previously against the people of Frankfurt; he arrogantly refused to respond to Pellikan's letter. Shares the confession sent to Blarer, No. 463. Bucer's "Defensio" is very pleasing except for the concessions contrary to scripture, which should be removed, to those who invoke saints and believe that God does good for the sake of the saints. Misses the simplicity in Augustine's "De cura pro mortuis agenda." Thanks for the remarks No. 443 on his "De testamento"; the German version is expanded in some places, and his "Assertio de utraque in Christo natura" is attached, in which he used similar Church Fathers' passages as Bucer. Writing on commentaries on Paul's letters like Bucer. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To Lord Martin Bucer, dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I do not know what you wrote to Myconius, venerable brother in the Lord. He certainly inquired with great diligence in recent letters whether I was pleased with your booklet to the people of Münster. For he himself has not yet seen it. Therefore, I have written and collected from it certain things that could not but please me. They seem to be of such a nature that they contain the entire sum of your doctrine on the sacrament:</p>
      <p>All life and true righteousness come from faith alone. As this tends towards one God, so it relies on divine promises. Therefore, the Lord always began the work of salvation with promises. And he proposed it to us in the manner of men. Men, moreover, are accustomed to add signs to words, such as the pledge in marriage and the joining of hands in contracts. Therefore, God also added signs to his words and promises as testimonies of his goodness and truth, and visible words. Hence, the common saying is often repeated: "A sacrament is a visible sign of invisible grace." Therefore, the visible signs in the supper are bread and wine, but the invisible are the redemption obtained through Christ, the body and blood of the Lord, which are offered or exhibited to the faithful by Christ alone through divine power, and are received spiritually by the minister ministerially and by the saints in mind. Not that grace is bound to the sacraments or that it is infused through these as instruments and channels even to those who partake of the signs without faith. For it is a most shameful error to teach that grace is in the sacraments or that they bring grace with them, but that sacraments are nothing without faith and that only faith makes one truly a participant in the sacraments and that God also works through our ministries. To which pertains what is written: "Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of God" [Romans 10:17], likewise: "Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of Jesus" [Acts 22:16], likewise: "Let a man so consider us, as servants and stewards of the mysteries of God" [1 Corinthians 4:1] etc.</p>
      <p>These are the things that could not but please me and which have removed from my mind the suspicion I once had of Bucer being opposed to us in Zurich. For I seem to see that Bucer does not oppose us in every part, which I once miserably feared. However, there are in that whole work things which, for your zeal, Bucer, with which you meditate on mending concord among the dissenters, you say more freely, a little more obscurely, and somewhat ambiguously. Of this kind are the terms exhibit, offer, unite, naturally, corporally, and some others, which do not offend me, who seem to see and am persuaded that you do not differ from us in the main point of the doctrine. Nor am I so dull as not to know how to interpret them more mildly. Would that in our age, in which this battle has become more intense, the simpler ones would not be offended by such things! Who, as you know, stumble more frequently when they sometimes fall into the reading of the ancients. Indeed, I could not but approve of your holy zeal, with which you seek to compose the dissenters. Meanwhile, I have always feared that your effort would lack successful outcome. For we know that Luther is a man of both a very hard and unyielding nature. I fear he will continue to assert the substantial, palpable, and sensible presence and proscribe all who do not wish to use this gross manner of speaking. Would that he truly believes and sincerely confesses with his mouth what you say he feels, Bucer!</p>
      <p>I hear that Schnepf has written to his Hessians with congratulations and a song of triumph that Blarer has descended to his opinion. There are some good men there, zealous for the truth, who were displeased by what seemed to them Blarer's inconsistency or imprudence. You see, they agree with us, if what we have learned by rumor is true. Indeed, I fear that Luther himself will also inflict his venomous tooth on you because of your recent Defense against the calumnies of the Bishop of Avranches. You know what he once published against the ministers of Frankfurt and the Mummummeros, what they boast, how he insisted that in the supper all things are carnal, as in which the very flesh of the Lord is eaten really with the bodily mouth etc. Conrad Pellican, a man, as you know, most gentle and modest, a few months ago greeted Luther with the most friendly letters, made the most honorable mention of our doctrines, and sought friendship. But he did not deign to respond to the excellent old man, who has deserved well of letters and piety, with even a word, indeed he replied to the messenger with disdain that he was more learned than to wish to be taught by such men.</p>
      <p>But lest I detain you, occupied with many things, I now submit our confession, which I sent to Blarer on October 22nd, so that you may judge from it how your defense pleased us. It is as follows: "What the blessed memory of Huldrych Zwingli [...] This is our confession."</p>
      <p>I appended to this in a letter to Blarer: "And this is my brief confession on this sacred matter, indeed not mine alone, but also of all of us who preach Christ in Zurich, [...] it is fitting to strive and labor." This to Ambrosius so far.</p>
      <p>From which you will easily conjecture how your defense pleased us, which I have only today truly perused with my eyes, rather than sufficiently examined with the acumen of my otherwise dull mind. In which it did not entirely please that you write in E 3 about those who, without any command and example of scripture, invoke the saints to pray for them, unless you understand this of certain ancients, not of the people of our age. Although it cannot be approved even in the ancients, what was done without command and example of scripture. It is certainly known that today the saints are invoked against the command and example of scripture. Therefore, I would wish that sentence omitted along with that in which you assert that God does many things for the sake of the saints or in favor of the saints. Which, although the faithful may understand in some way, the impious will think the door is open to worship the saints. Faith certainly teaches that God does all things for us and bestows good things for the sake of Christ. Isaiah also cried out: "Abraham did not know us, and Israel did not acknowledge us, but you, O God, are our father and redeemer" [Isaiah 63:16]. Meanwhile, I do not know how Augustine twisted himself here in the little book "On the Care to be Taken for the Dead." I truly embrace simplicity more in this cause, which you not unhappily executed from the beginning of this cause. You bear with an even mind a friend who advises you, venerable brother, to whom I give great thanks for what you recently wrote about our little book, which we wrote "On the Testament." We have now expanded it in some places and published it in the German language, as you see. We have added what we sketched "On Both Natures in Christ." At the end of which you will find some things about the matter of the Eucharist, almost excerpted from those fathers whom you used in your defense, so that one might seem to have borrowed from the other.</p>
      <p>Farewell now and do not cease to embrace me with the love you have begun. I am writing on some of Paul's epistles. I hear you are also attempting the same. What you are doing I do not know. Meanwhile, I know that you have published some things on the Romans of Paul. If that is true, I would like to read them. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 28th.</p>
      <p>Leo, Pellican, Theodor, Battus, and the brothers wish you well. We wish Capito, Hedio, Bedrot, Dasypodius, and the others well. 1534.</p>
      <p>Have H. Lavater commended.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
