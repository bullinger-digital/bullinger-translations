      <p>If I had not explained all the plans of my undertaken journey to you before my departure, most illustrious man, I would have feared that you might find something lacking not only in my duty but also in my humanity, since I have not written to you about my departure until now. But you remember (I know), how all my affairs were so entangled when I was leaving, that I had to think entirely about departing and despair about returning. Thus, it seemed to God to allow my affairs to be disturbed for a time, so that in this exile, while almost all of our people are afflicted in some way, I alone would not enjoy such leisure and peace.</p>
      <p>But God is faithful, who does not tempt anyone beyond what they can bear, and therefore (though not without great troubles of travel) He restored to me my goods, which I was seeking, and I thought it should be communicated to you, because I have always perceived you to be of such a mind towards me, that you were concerned about my affairs like a most loving father, which, although it might seem somewhat common to me with all the others whom you think are led by the zeal of true religion and piety, I easily noticed that you embraced me and mine with a peculiar, not to say singular, love, caring for us no less than if we had belonged to your family. In this matter, while you gave no small judgment of your piety, you also (to speak of myself) bound me to you in such a way that I can scarcely comprehend in mind and thought how much I owe you, much less can I repay in reality so many benefits. But as you expect no compensations here, so I must ensure that your benefits bestowed upon me do not seem to be given to an ungrateful person.</p>
      <p>As for my affairs that were being conducted there, I think everything has been settled in such a way that there is nothing about which anyone can justly complain. But if anything has been omitted either by my forgetfulness or by the negligence of my people, I ask you, most noble man, to inform me, and I will take care to resolve whatever it is promptly. In this journey of mine, nothing has occurred so far that not only does not lessen the tedium of my journey but also greatly increases and displeases it. If the rest correspond to these, I will soon regret this labor.</p>
      <p>For to speak truly of Tübingen, where I still am, I find nothing certainly worthy of praise, but almost everything is reprehensible, whether you look at the church, the school, or the manners of the people. For in the temple, many remnants of old papism still remain, such as musical organs, Latin chants with endless inflections of voices, not varied but confused, the attire of ministers not differing from the pontifical, certain gesticulations at the Lord's table, the sacrament being put into the mouths of participants as if they lacked hands or would profane the sacrament by touching it, to pass over painted images and other trifles. The school has many professors, but few learned ones; I might perhaps truly say none. The theologians are all young, who would be more suited to learning than teaching.</p>
      <p>The professors of philosophy and dialectics, to include languages as well, are perhaps learned but very dull, so that those who sell themselves as masters in the arts can express nothing acutely as philosophers nor in Latin as grammarians. There are many skilled in law, but so religious that a great part of them do not know even the first elements of religion, indeed they say it does not pertain to them. The moderation of manners is such that unless they intersperse an oath every third word, they consider the speech poorly seasoned. For exercises, so they do not languish in idleness, it is most customary for them to drink to drunkenness in taverns until late at night and to lead dances with girls, and because this is not enough, they walk the streets with tortoises until the twelfth hour. They think all these things and much graver ones are permissible for them, provided they keep themselves pure from Zwinglianism.</p>
      <p>If anyone with a more severe countenance, like Cato, corrects their manners and inveighs against drunkenness and blasphemies, he is immediately considered an Anabaptist. I have dealt with some of the professors about their Lutheranism, but, by the immortal God, what weak arguments they bring, how ineptly they refute ours, they most often repeat that we deal with them philosophically, that we dispute too sharply about a simple matter, and other things of this kind. They have nothing to answer to Augustine to Dardanus, except that in other places Augustine calls the sacrament the body, by which they make Augustine fight with himself, for they do not know how to reconcile such passages, these are the more learned ones.</p>
      <p>The less learned, however, complain about us, that you teach that that supper differs in no way from profane and common banquets, that you do not remove music from churches, that you do not receive the body of Christ with greater reverence, and they pour out six hundred such absurdities. I wanted to briefly write these things to your excellence, not because I thought you were unaware of them, but so that you might understand how much hope there is of these churches being purified someday. Here I know no more than three Zwinglians and they are very lukewarm.</p>
      <p>May your dignity fare well and may it keep you and your church safe for us for as long as possible. Tübingen, April 24, 1558.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, John Aylmer, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant preacher and proclaimer of the divine word, his lord and most esteemed patron. Zürich.</p>
