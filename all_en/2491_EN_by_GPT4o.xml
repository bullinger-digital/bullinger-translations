      <p>Greetings. Since letters from those who are absent are like a conversation with those who are present, I am therefore not unwilling to write to you, most esteemed and kind man, and all the more so because not only from your letters to me do I perceive your goodwill towards me, but also from the conversations of others it is conveyed to me about your interest in me, not only the kind you bear towards all members of Christ our Savior, but also about a certain special inclination of your mind taken up towards me, which (they say) you often show by inquiring about me. Thanks be to God, who has implanted this will in you towards me.</p>
      <p>I would inform you about England if any good news were coming; however, concerning the bad news, nothing is yet certain, and what is being conveyed can be better reported by this messenger: in short, everything is falling back and rushing into worse.</p>
      <p>About myself and my condition, I could say much; but I do not wish to trouble your kindness with unnecessary matters. However, concerning that Bancho, about whom I wrote to you before, I have something that I now earnestly ask from you. I have so far relieved his necessity with my limited means; but now, due to the injury of these times and the rage of adversaries, I am almost stripped of everything, and they rage against me and those like me, so that what will follow, God knows, to whose will and providence I commit myself as to the best father and most compassionate. That I may do this continually and to the end, I earnestly ask you to pray to the same for me and with me. I hear that the cause of this fury of the adversaries is because of the testimony I openly gave to the truth in that synod held in London last year. Meanwhile, however, they have sought with the utmost and most accurate diligence some other plausible pretext. When they could not find one, they finally denounce me as a heretic because of the freely expressed opinion against that nefarious opinion of theirs of the bread being converted into the body of the Lord, etc. I call it a freely expressed opinion not only because it was freely spoken by me, but also because that assembly ought to have been most free and the opinions expressed therein. About which this messenger Chamberus, a most dear brother in the Lord, can explain more fully, and how the adversaries (filled with the utmost hatred against the truth) behaved against what is just and good, against all law and right.</p>
      <p>But to return to Bancho, he will think it well enough with him if he can be with a printer, an honest and pious man, and be in the place of a corrector and editor. He hopes that this can be done by the testimony of your voice. There is no need to commend him to your kindness with many praises or the ability he has to undertake such a task. He is learned in Latin, so you can judge for yourself; he is not unskilled in Greek; he is of peaceful manners, fervent in true religion, and very studious of letters. In my opinion, you will confer a benefit on him, with whom you can place him, and yet I will consider it a benefit conferred on me in some part (for Bancho's sake), because (as it seems) I will not be able to support him at my expense for long (as I would like) unless things turn out differently than they appear and are at present. I could have wrapped these things more discreetly, but I did not think it was my place to do so, but rather to explain everything openly and plainly (to your kindness). May God be with you in every way and preserve you for the glorification of His name and the benefit of His church. In Strasbourg, on the fifth day before the Ides of December 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted James Haddon.</p>
      <p>I wish very well to the most excellent man Mr. Bibliander and the most esteemed father Mr. Pellican; I ask your kindness to convey my greetings to both of them.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and most esteemed [in Christ] father Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
