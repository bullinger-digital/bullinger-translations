      <p>To Lord Bullinger, his most beloved and esteemed friend, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings. Yesterday your son visited me, and it cannot be expressed how welcome a guest he was to me, due to the great love I have for you. But he became even more welcome through our mutual conversation, as I discovered him to be a truly modest, eloquent young man, and learned beyond his years. Therefore, my dear Lord Bullinger, I congratulate you, for by the goodness of the heavens, you have such a son; for he is worthy of such a great father, just as you are most worthy of such a son.</p>
      <p>May the best and greatest Lord ensure that your son continues to improve day by day, as he has begun, so that he may one day be a great honor and ornament to you and your entire homeland! There is no doubt that this will happen, provided that the same God keeps him safe for a longer time, as we hope. May the Lord abundantly complete the good work that He has most happily begun in your son. Amen. However, I complain about our Heinrich, because, although I tried very hard to persuade him to stay with me for a few days to regain his strength and recover from the fatigue of such a long journey, I could not obtain this from him. And when he absolutely refused to comply with my wishes, I offered him my horse for the journey, along with money, if he needed it to complete the journey. But your son refused to accept all these things from me.</p>
      <p>However, fearing that perhaps he was too embarrassed to ask for what he needed, I gave him four shields under the pretext that he should deliver them to my son, etc. As for any news from the Venetian territory, you will learn it from your son. Otherwise, there is nothing here that I can inform you about, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the ulcer, which you wrote was troubling my son above his neck, I was somewhat afraid that it might become more dangerous for him; however, I trust, as I should, in your kindness, that you will not fail to ensure it is treated. I wish to know how he has recovered.</p>
      <p>Regarding the baths, which I had allowed my son to visit, I say this: act as you see fit for the boy's health; I did not allow it otherwise, except that he should act as you advised; therefore, all this is left to your judgment. Furthermore, my son had asked me to allow him to learn music, and I also allow this, if it pleases you; for I wish him to be imbued with all the arts worthy of a free man, as much as possible. Whatever expenses are incurred in achieving these, I will certainly not regret them.</p>
      <p>But enough of this; you know my mind. Finally, I am about to attend the upcoming Chur fairs, God willing.</p>
      <p>I ask you to write to me then, so that my son and also my brother Hector may be well, and if there is a need for money or other things, write, and I will not fail. May the Lord God continually keep you and all yours safe!</p>
      <p>Farewell, perpetual honor and ornament of Switzerland, and love me as you are accustomed to, and keep me in your thoughts. Given in Zuoz hastily on the 9th of May, 1558.</p>
      <p>The same as above, most devoted to you, Friedrich von Salis. To the most distinguished and truly incomparable man in every kind of learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed and respected lord and patron. In Zurich.</p>
