    <p xml:id="regest1">The school authorities have received the letter from Biel concerning Beat Steinegger [No. 2165] at the Zurzach market [June 1, 1545]. - They would gladly help the [people of Biel], but unfortunately, they cannot in this case. Currently, there is no position available; if there were one, it would have to be filled with young pupils of the [Zürich] church, especially since Steinegger (who has shown disobedience to his preceptor Johannes Fries since Christmas [1544]) has publicly demonstrated his disobedience by neither attending lectures nor taking exams. How could he be preferred over the obedient [students]? Therefore, the [people of Biel] should not blame the [people of Zürich] if they send Steinegger back. - The [people of Biel] should not completely turn away from Steinegger despite his disobedience, but rather admonish him and observe whether he might obey them more than the [people of Zürich]. It would be a shame if he were to fall into poverty, having already learned so much. - The school authorities ask for a benevolent reception of their letter.</p>

      <p>To the pious, steadfast, honorable, prudent, and wise, gracious, dear gentlemen, our willing service, friendly greetings, and whatever we can offer in honor, love, and goodness, may it be ready for you above all.</p>
      <p>We have received your letter, dated Wednesday after Pentecost, at the Zurzach market, and have understood your very friendly request concerning Beat Steinegger. We inform you in response that we are entirely inclined and willing to serve and assist you and yours, wherever possible, and are so ready to do so that we regret when we cannot or are unable to do so.</p>
      <p>Concerning the aforementioned Beat - whom we should provide with a position within or outside the city of Zürich so that he might have his sustenance - we have not been able to do so this time for the following reasons: Firstly, there is currently no position vacant; we also do not know when something might become available. Furthermore, even if something were to become vacant, there are so many young men, well-educated by our gracious lords from the church, that the vacant positions could be filled many times over. Beatus has behaved diligently, skillfully, and well (as we previously informed you). Until now, at Christmas, he has not committed any wrongs or dishonorable acts that we are aware of. However, he has turned away from his diligence and has become disobedient to his preceptor, Master Johannes Fries. When he was instructed to attend the lectures, he did not do so; indeed, he did what he wanted and not what he was told. Yet we hope he will return to obedience. However, when we examined all our boys at Easter, appointed and summoned Beatus to the examination, he defiantly stayed away and let it be known to some that he had nothing from us, therefore we had nothing to say to him or to justify and examine him, etc. Since his persistent disobedience is evident on that day, and even if something were vacant, to which we might appoint him, you can well imagine what obedience that would bring among ours, especially if the obedient ones were left behind and the disobedient ones were put forward. Therefore, our very friendly request to you is that you do not take it amiss that we do not provide for Beatus, but rather, upon your decision, if we cannot provide for him, send him back.</p>
      <p>We also ask on his behalf that you do not let his foolishness and peculiar, persistent disobedience towards us cause you to completely withdraw from him, but rather that you admonish him as necessary and further test whether he might obey you more than us, for he has learned so much that it would be a shame if he were to fall into poverty, etc.</p>
      <p>With this, we kindly ask that you receive this letter from us willingly and understand all loyalty and willing service to us.</p>
      <p>May God Almighty graciously keep you in peace and all good things for a long time.</p>
      <p>Dated Zürich, June 9, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours always entirely willing</p>
      <p>Johann Jakob Ammann, Schoolmaster, and the appointed over the schools of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the pious, steadfast, honorable, prudent, and wise mayors and council of the city of Biel, our gracious dear gentlemen.</p>
