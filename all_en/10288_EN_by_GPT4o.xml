      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write now, except perhaps this warning, which concerns us all, that we must cry out against the French gold. For if what I hear is true, there are great factions among the Five Places, with some favoring the Emperor and others the King of the French. Among us, there are already enough factions, with some supporting the Anabaptists, others the Papists, and others constantly pursuing new matters, so there is no need for royal and imperial parties to arise among us. Our people promise to defend their side vigorously. May the Lord increase His spirit in His own. In the meantime, let us be exceedingly vigilant. Among the Five Places, a great amount of money has been distributed. Those who did not receive as much as they desired protest against the wealthier, not out of a sense of justice, but out of envy. Hence, the situation is miserable, but such is the usual reward of these matters. There are others who rejoice that they lack nothing and consider themselves to be entirely fortunate.</p>
      <p>I hear, dearest brother, that you have published some dictations of the most learned man Johannes Oekolampad or taken from his mouth, which I ask you to send as soon as possible. I have sent the "Commentary on the Acts" and bid you farewell. Utinger wishes you well. If you ensure the Hebrew grammar of Theodor Bibliander is printed as quickly as possible, you will have done a most pleasing thing for all of us.</p>
      <p>Last day of August 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Oswald Myconius, the most faithful overseer of the Basel church, beloved brother.</p>
