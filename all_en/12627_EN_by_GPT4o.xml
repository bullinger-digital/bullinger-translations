    <p xml:id="regest1">The bearer Johannes Grünblatt, pastor in Ostheim, is in trouble, which he will report on in more detail himself. He recently sold grain in Kaysersberg, which he receives as part of his salary. On the way back, he stopped at an inn in the village of Kientzheim (which belongs to the lordship of Count [Georg] von Lupfen). There were some people from Colmar who idolized the Emperor [Charles V]. When asked who he was, Grünblatt replied that he was a servant of the Word of God. As a result, curses were uttered against him. Thoughtlessly, he replied that the Emperor was a traitor to the fatherland and should be quartered. Now this is being talked about everywhere, and it is feared that the people of Colmar or Ensisheim might arrest him on the highway. Therefore, the court officials of Count [Georg von Württemberg] thought it best to send him away for two to three months until the matter calmed down.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The Count [of Württemberg] has gone to war. He leads the army of his brother [Ulrich von Württemberg], consisting of 12,000 well-paid Württembergers. He is supposed to attack [Maximilian von Egmont, the Count] of Buren, near Neckarsulm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- A messenger [...] of the Count reported today that Ingolstadt is still besieged [by the Schmalkaldic League]. A captain [Ottavio Farnese] from the papal army and a Macedonian prince [Aranito Comneno] sent by the Pope [Paul III] to assist the Emperor are said to have been captured. Through their interrogation, important information about the enemy's plans could be uncovered.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger should continue to pray.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- He asks for forgiveness for the hastily written letter. [Grünblatt] wants to depart soon. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace of the Lord be with you. Here, the good Johannes Grünblatt, minister of the church with us in Ostheim, is in great danger, which he will explain himself. Therefore, it seemed best to the officials of our prince that he should move elsewhere for two or three months, where he could live more safely and the matter could either be settled or better handled. And so you understand what it is, I will outline it briefly. Recently in Kaysersberg, he sold grain, which he receives as part of his salary, and on his way back through the domain of Count von Lupfen, he entered a tavern in the small town of Kientzheim to have lunch. There were also some people from Colmar, who make their emperor a god, and when he offered a drink to one, he asked who he was. He replied that he was a minister of the Word of God.</p>

      <p>He immediately added angrily: "God's torture! No honest man should eat or drink with you," etc., along with other slanders. Finally, our good Johannes, quite irritated and thoughtless, said: "Oh, the emperor is a rogue and a traitor to his fatherland. It would be worth it, if one were to do him justice, to quarter him like a traitor and hang him on the four roads!" This is the essence of the matter, for it is certainly not possible to write down every detail, as he will indicate. The rumor about this matter has spread everywhere. Hence, we fear, since he is in a public place and on the main road, that he might be intercepted at night by the people of Colmar or Ensisheim. This is the reason for his departure. We commend him to you, etc.</p>

      <p>The prince has gone to war. He leads his brother's army of 12,000 citizens from Württemberg, who are hired for no less pay than that common soldier. He will attack the Lord of Buren near Neckarsulm. Yesterday, a courier from our prince arrived, who said that Ingolstadt is still besieged, and in a certain conflict, a captain of the papal army was captured, as well as a certain prince from Macedonia, who was also sent by the Pope to assist the emperor. From them, our people have discovered all the plans of the adversaries.</p>

      <p>You pray to the Lord for us with your church fervently, as you do, that our gracious God may deliver us from all evil.</p>

      <p>My dear Bullinger, take care. I had to write in haste so that I might quickly dispatch this brother. Farewell to all. Greet all fellow ministers. Given in Riquewihr, the Sunday after the Nativity of Mary 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erbius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother in Christ, etc.</p>
