      <p>To those letters dated the 12th of the calends of January, and delivered to me on the ides of March, when I was in London at the house of Hupper, I responded briefly and concisely during lunch; for I did not have a convenient place or time to write then. Now, however, having returned home to my studies and having found a little more leisure, I will write to you again on the same matter in a somewhat more detailed manner. Know, therefore, that I received your letters with the greatest joy and expectation, and in them, I noticed, above all, what I most desired, namely, that you intend to dedicate some of your works to the Marquess of Dorset, a most distinguished man. How pleasing this is to me cannot be expressed in words by anyone: just know that nothing has ever happened to me more pleasing or greater than what you have shown you will soon do.</p>
      <p>This one thing you desired, that I did not send a sufficiently clear and open title or inscription; which certainly should be attributed not to me, but to the fault of the prince's servant: for he described the title so ineptly. But since what is done cannot be undone, I now send you again the inscription given to me by the prince himself in this form: "To Lord Heinrich Gray, Marquess of Dorset, Lord Ferrers of Groby, Harrington, Bonville, and Astley, royal counselor, his most gracious lord, etc." He indeed told me that he is a prince, but does not wish to be considered as such by you: therefore, whether the name of the prince should be omitted, you will see. I certainly always use that name, and I will use it much more freely hereafter, since I see that he has now been elevated to the highest and most eminent dignity. For that honor among the English is to be born of royal lineage and to be a counselor to the king and the whole kingdom; which latter he has achieved with the highest praise and applause of the whole kingdom, so that he and John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, are considered the two most illustrious lights of the Anglican Church: for these two alone, above others, have exerted all their strength and virtue in restoring the church. They have completely suppressed and extinguished that destructive and pestilential conspiracy and attack, which was foully agitated last year. They are the terror and thunderbolt of the Roman pontiff, and are considered as such. These very men extended their faith and right hand to the king's uncle, who was miserably surrounded, and brought him back from the greatest danger of life, from darkness to light and life. Now if you consider the family, which he maintains here most abundantly, you will find from there a just and sufficient reason to praise him: for this prince is learned, and he has with him the most learned men, with whom he shares mutual study.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he is not so much great and serious as he is humane and truly liberal. For on the very day I brought your letters to him, he seemed to be carried away with joy for the future praise. He also liberally increased my annual stipend; for when I was departing from him, he, so help me God, offered his hand, and through a servant, counted out six English crowns for my travel expenses; when at first he had given only two, then five, and now he has added six with the letters. And I know and willingly confess that he, for your sake, both wishes and does much for me; for when he sees letters written to me by you, such a great and illustrious man, he considers that he owes me his goodwill and help in some way by right. Therefore, I would like him to understand through you, that both his kindness, zeal, and service have been most pleasing to me, and that I have given him wonderful thanks in your presence. For you know that men of this kind are nourished by expressions of gratitude as if by food, and are retained in perpetual goodwill. But why do I teach you to wash the fleece? You understand the matter correctly, and indeed most excellently of all.</p>
      <p>This one thing remains, that you diligently and sacredly preserve the memory of Alexander Schmuz, a young man of the highest promise. I have written to you about him almost ten times, hoping and confidently trusting that something will be added to his studies through your recommendation; but I know for certain that this can be done in no better or more convenient way than if you ensure that your book, written for the prince, is delivered through me and this young man. The prince himself expects this from no one more than from me.</p>
      <p>Of all your services, which are both the greatest and innumerable towards me, it would be most pleasing to me, and most worthy of you and your ancient humanity, if you would undertake to assist and adorn this young man. You (believe me) will accomplish this either by your authority and favor, which you have in abundance with this prince, or by a nod, without any petition. If you accomplish this, my teacher, you will confirm my hope of your goodwill towards the father of this most excellent and learned man; and you will attach Alexander, a most grateful, dutiful, and excellent young man, to my relationship and your observance by your greatest kindness. I have written to you at length about these things, so that you may understand that I am not writing in a common or ambitious manner, but as for an intimate person, and as the matter is, a member of Jesus Christ, and I am certainly persuaded that your generous and beneficent nature will consider it so.</p>
      <p>But enough of this. Nothing new occurs to me to write to you now. Everything is safe and tranquil. The assembly of the princes has been postponed to the calends of April: what has been done or decided, I am completely ignorant. From Hupper's letters, I think you will learn much.</p>
      <p>The religion of the Antichrist is despaired of and abandoned by all. The flesh-eating (sarcofagia) lies despised and scorned by all. Dr. Peter Martyr has undertaken to expound the Epistle to the Romans. Bucer, having begun to explain the sixth chapter of John, lies prostrated in the vestibule of his work by a serious and dangerous illness.</p>
      <p>What will happen, God the merciful Father will see: we certainly have almost cut off all hope that he will recover again. Many things are being spread here about a peace agreement between the English, French, and Scots, but from an uncertain source. As soon as I learn anything certain, and what I see is of interest for you to know, I will diligently and dutifully write to you. Just make sure you are well, and bring the matter itself to a conclusion soon; for nothing could be more pleasing to me at this time. Andrew Wullock and Robert Skinner, the chief servants of our prince, men not so much learned and wise as devoted and loving towards you, send their greetings. For God's sake, remember them honorably either in your letter to the prince or commend me or Alexander to them in private letters written in common. This will not only be good for our affairs but will also be convenient for adorning a small gift. Moreover, their singular integrity, learning, and close relationship with the prince, as well as the humanity and goodwill they diligently and dutifully show me for your sake, will bring confidence to write to them. Peter Martyr and our Rudolph, a young man most observant of you, with whom I live most pleasantly and sweetly, send their greetings, and I receive great pleasure from both his study and his virtue and integrity. Again and again, farewell, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>Given at Oxford in 1550, on the day of the Annunciation of Mary in the month of March.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted son in Christ, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
