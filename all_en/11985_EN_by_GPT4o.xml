    <p xml:id="regest1">Should be examined by the Council of Bern at the request of a long-time acquaintance [Beat Gering?] for admission to the preaching office, but Erasmus Ritter refused, so the council confirmed Hochholzer in his office [in Aarau] the next day. If [Simon] Sulzer had been in Bern (he was visiting Bucer), it would have led to a conflict; the Zurich church can consider itself fortunate to be free from divisions, as there are in Bern. Hochholzer conveyed Bullinger's greetings to Erasmus [Ritter]; Ritter did not receive Bullinger's letter, so Bullinger should write everything to him again and inform him who the messenger was; greetings. Hochholzer himself is in a financially distressing situation and also wants to change his way of life for this reason, for which Bullinger should advise him; Hochholzer thinks he must marry, but he still has doubts and recommends himself to Bullinger; this matter greatly hinders his studies. Sends next week the copy made on Bullinger's behalf.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>In recent days, I was in Bern, presented myself to the council, and offered my services. I was received, but only after being examined, even though I am from Zurich. This was suggested to the senators by someone I have known for a long time, who is of a certain character, that I should not be admitted to the office of preaching unless they first scrutinized what I thought about certain doctrines. Since those from Strasbourg are examined, there is nothing to prevent the same for those from Zurich. Understanding this, I did not object, because the truth is invincible; I would have freely responded according to my modest ability. However, Mr. Erasmus Ritter did not want to examine anyone from Zurich, as he said that neither he nor others were of such great learning as to reject someone whom the Zurich church had deemed suitable. Therefore, the council, considering the matter more rightly the next day, with Mr. Erasmus narrating what had been customary towards the people of Zurich and vice versa in Zurich towards the people of Bern, admitted me and confirmed me in my office.</p>
      <p>If Sulzer had been in Bern, certainly some tragedy would have been stirred. For he had at that time gone to Bucer. They are giving birth to a monster, but they will give birth to a lie. Even now they are plotting something, yet they do not dare to declare it in clear words. O happy Zurich church, which is free from such sects!</p>
      <p>There are schisms in Bern among the ministers of the church, the senators, and the common people. Mr. Erasmus certainly showed himself to be very kind to me. I greeted him in your name and inquired about the letters you said you had recently sent to him. He denies having received any letters from you since Easter. He fears that someone may have intercepted them. He asked me to write to you as quickly as possible about this matter, asking you to inform him again about those things you wrote in your recent letters, and also to recall to whom you entrusted them for delivery. For he suspects that some people are acting in such a way. He sends many greetings to all the brothers of the Zurich church.</p>
      <p>I now come to my own business, which certainly troubles my mind not a little. I am torn this way and that, I do not know what to do. I commit it to the Lord. I am uncertain where to turn. My affairs are such that I cannot continue in this way. Paying 41 florins just for food and drink twice a day is too much, not to mention other expenses that must be made in other matters. Moreover, there are many other reasons that urge, indeed almost compel me, to arrange my affairs differently. Therefore, I ask you to advise me, to look out for me. I can hardly turn my mind away from there; if there were any hope of obtaining it, I would not turn anywhere else. But since it does not please the Lord, by whose will and command all things are conducted, let the Lord's will be done. There are many honest and good people; I hope the Lord will provide for me. I will follow your advice, I have you alone as my counselor. You, do what seems right to you in my affairs, look out for me. You know my affairs and have thoroughly explored me, you see what my condition is, what the situation requires. To avoid being a scandal to the church, while living alone in private houses, a wife must be taken to avoid various suspicions, which you understand more rightly with your prudence than anyone could advise. I am in doubt about what to do. I ask you to advise me on what and how to act, and to have me entirely commended to you. This matter greatly hinders my studies. The Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>In Aarau, June 25, 1544.</p>
      <p>Next week I will send what you asked to be written back, expecting to receive other things from you. The journey has hindered it so far.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, his lord and esteemed father.</p>
