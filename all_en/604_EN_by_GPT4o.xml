      <p> Greetings. Our Butler has compelled me to write due to his hurried departure, so I have postponed writing at length until another time. However, I do not want you to be unaware that the letters entrusted to you have been delivered to Glarus with great fidelity, as I understood from the prompt response of Avienus. Certainly, I am most grateful to both our Frisius and your Humanity. The debt we owe to the most honorable orders of your city, as well as to your most pious college, is immense and irrecompensable. We have recounted to our Senate in great detail how honorably and magnificently we were received and treated there, and I am certain that our people will not fail in their duty to all of yours, even if they cannot match in ability to do good. As for my part, I will diligently ensure that I demonstrate my gratitude to both your other friends and to you, who have long bound me to you with great and many benefits, and you do not neglect anything that pertains to strengthening our mutual friendship. But let us set these matters aside: I am sending to you letters from Franciscus Dryander, recently brought from England and addressed to you, along with the attached formula of the English Reformation, which Dryander had copied for your and my pleasure, to at least give us a taste of the reformed religion there. I am eager to know what you think of it. To me, it seems neither impious nor imprudent to retain the rationale of the purer ancient ceremonies, lest the hasty abolition of them drive the obstinate people more towards ruin and hatred of true doctrine than towards edification and favor. Farewell. </p>
      <p> St. Gallen, July 25, 1549. </p>
      <p> Joachim Vadian. </p>
      <p> If you or any of your friends are going to send letters to England, make sure they are delivered to me, and do not doubt that I will ensure they reach the English shore by the 13th with good transport. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most magnificent city of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord. </p>
