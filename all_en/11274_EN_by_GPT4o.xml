      <p>Grace and peace from Christ Jesus, our Lord, Redeemer, and Savior, with the wish for the continual increase of Christ's kingdom, health of both soul and body.</p>
      <p>Honorable, worthy, dear sir and beloved brother in Christ, that I now unexpectedly for the first time address your honorable wisdom with a letter (trouble you), comes to me likewise without any foresight. Since I have come to GÃ¶rlitz from Zittau for other reasons, and in this, a message to Frankfurt has unexpectedly come to me, I cannot and do not know how to refrain from the friendship we have with each other through writings, which our city clerk Oswald Pergner has written to you, honorable wisdom, and I write to you as my dear lord and teacher for the sake of the teachings I have received from your books, with entirely friendly intentions, in the hope that my humble writing will not be against you and will be accepted by you in friendship.</p>
      <p>And if I, but also all your good friends, could learn of your blessed condition (well-being), and of your assistants in the word, namely Mr. Konrad Pellikan, Leo Jud, Theodor Bibliander, it is always a heartfelt and very great joy for us to learn.</p>
      <p>I also hope, if God wills it, I will arrange it so that I will visit you once and hear in person what I have long taken from your writings and have long desired.</p>
      <p>May God Almighty accomplish it according to His divine will. I, on behalf of my lords and friends, greet you kindly in every way, as well as all the aforementioned gentlemen and your assistants. I ask that you kindly accept my hurried writing and not turn it into anything negative. May Almighty God preserve your life in lasting health, so that you may tend the flock of Christ with God's word, etc.</p>
      <p>Given on Friday before Reminiscere in the year of our Lord 1539. Celestinus Hennig, citizen of Zittau in the Margraviate of Upper Lusatia.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, worthy Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the word of God in Zurich, Switzerland, my most gracious dear lord, friend, and brother in Christ.</p>
