      <p>[...] As you learned last year, we are oppressed by so many afflictions, and today we may complain to you about the same, and it is far from being diminished; rather, it increases day by day. The greatest sorrow, however, is that the strength of spirit and fervor for professing the true religion has not risen among our people as it did before, and they seem to be seized by such coldness that they appear to languish, not live, and to breathe Christ timidly. With astonishing cunning, Satan impedes the course of the gospel in this anarchy, partly, as I said, by a stupor and a certain lethargy that has seized many who should have progressed daily, so that our congregations seem to wither, which once flourished. I attribute the blame for this to the listeners, who do not receive the good word of God with the gratitude it deserves, and partly then, the enemy of the human race now seems to think openly about eradicating and extinguishing the truth, as he stirs up his fans to commit violence, so that in recent days the beginnings of this fury were laid in the destruction of our cemetery and the house of our congregation. However, the Lord has calmed it for a time. We are still in the same sea but with the storm calmed, yet we expect nothing good from the enemies unless we break their machinations with prayers. Therefore, as you do for all churches, so also be particularly mindful of us, who are affected by these unexpected disturbances, so that He may cause them to languish and sustain our declining republic. We also grieve not a little that these Saxon teachers act so furiously with our churches. We see how blind and confident their audacity is. Who can restrain the petulance of their shameless slander except God, the best and greatest? For the good and pious men oppressed by infamy from them, this will always remain, as Aeschylus aptly and elegantly said: τΗν αλΗΞειαν ανατιΞεναι τς Κρονς. And yet we pray to our God and Christ, the author of all concord, our Lord, to lead them to better counsel and to the recognition of the truth. Heshusius, that venerable bishop of Prussia, along with his Wigand, has published a book against the Exegesis with a plausible title, but he pours out nothing but venom and slanders against us. We hope, however, that our patrons, the senators of the kingdom, who profess the pure religion, will remonstrate with the prince and his advisors about how shamelessly this so-called reverend bishop has conducted himself in this matter. Would that some counsel of honest pacification could be initiated at the next imperial diet. Indeed, it would greatly benefit the promotion of the truth and the course of the divine word, which is hindered by these foolish quarrels. But the Lord will moderate all these counsels and see to the salvation of His church. The rest, which pertains both to the political state and the ecclesiastical, will be reported by our dearest brother, Mr. Thretius, who will then seek advice from you on our behalf concerning those matters that pertain to maintaining the proper order of the church, especially concerning those who, having made multiple apostasies, return to us. This matter, as you will perceive from him, being new among us and useful for the future, we ask that you be willing to assist with your counsel. We believe you will do this out of your piety.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Krakau, August 10, 1575.</p>
