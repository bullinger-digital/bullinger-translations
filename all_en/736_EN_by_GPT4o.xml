      <p>Greetings. I have nothing this time, except that I ask you to inform me as soon as possible of your counsel in this matter. We have sent our deacon Theobald back to the countryside for necessary reasons, and therefore we lack an assistant. I would like to have Christian from Aarau; it might also be possible to achieve this without my lords having to request it from my lords in Zürich. My thought is that he would be called for himself; if he then wanted to ask for permission in Zürich, it would be good; I hope it would not be refused, and my lords would be spared the request. I also hope he will not refuse; I know no one else who could stand by us better and whom I would prefer. After that, Gervasio could also be helped to Aarau. God be with you. Greet your whole household for me; all my household also greets you. Today is market day; I have barely been able to write this much. Viretus was here; something was given to them, but the manner was determined, with which they do not seem satisfied. But with those quarrelsome minds, hardly anyone will be satisfied; but more on this another time. Musculus and the other brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 11th November 1549.</p>
      <p>Your entirely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable compatriot, the most faithful minister of the church in Zürich.</p>
