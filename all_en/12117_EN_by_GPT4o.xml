    <p xml:id="regest1">Brunner has not written for a long time, as he had no reason to do so. The occasion for this little letter is the desire to inform Bullinger that his efforts [for the Gospel] are showing success even in Italy. - In recent days, Brunner has sent some [explanations of the Bible] from Bullinger's and Erasmus' [pen] over the Locarno bailiff [Joachim] Bäldi to the Minorite [Benedetto da Locarno]. He previously proclaimed the Gospel in Locarno and then in Venice at the Church of St. Mark. Now he preaches in Genoa (Liguria). - Benedetto's earnest requests for Bullinger's works were gladly fulfilled by Brunner, as he hopes for great benefit for the Church from them. [Benedetto da Locarno] reports that Bullinger's works are welcome everywhere, not only in Germany, but also in France and Italy. Brunner conveys this without any flattery, to further encourage Bullinger in his activities. - [Benedetto da Locarno] also wishes for the sending of a "Apology" by Bullinger; however, Brunner does not know which writing is meant by this. - Bullinger will be informed about the conditions in Glarus; everything is pacified because the Antichrist is allowed to keep his place. May God soon cast him out! - Brunner writes this letter as a testimony of his zeal for Christ.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>It would be very pleasing to hear that you, most distinguished man, and your family are doing well, as I am in good health. You may wonder why I have not sent you any of my letters for such a long time. You might suspect that I am sleeping the sleep of Endymion, spending a long time in idleness, not engaging in any business, but leading a soft life. To dispel this suspicion, I decided to send at least a few lines, in which I would offer an excuse, namely that I have had no reason to write until now. However, since I now have a small matter to write to you about, I have set aside all my affairs to comply with you as a singular friend. And regarding the matter, I inform you that your labors in the vineyard of Christ have not been in vain, as we see the glory of Christ being spread and increased daily, especially in places where we least expected it, namely in parts of Italy.</p>
      <p>For know for certain that in recent days I have sent some of your writings and those of Erasmus to a Minorite through the prefect of Locarno, Joachim Bäldi, who preached the Gospel there for a time, and finally, with the unanimous approval of the whole church, obtained the ministry of the word in Venice, where he proclaimed Christ in the Church of St. Mark to the wishes of all. Now, in Genoa, located in the parts of Liguria, he has been entrusted with the care of the divine word for his faith.</p>
      <p>He had requested your works and writings with such importunate prayers that it was not right to deny him; I also complied with him more willingly because I hope it will be of great benefit to the Church. The Minorite confesses that your works are very welcome and accepted everywhere among the nations, because they are full of both learning and piety. I write this without deceit and flattery; indeed, the field for praising you is very open, but my simplicity is not unknown to you; I strongly abhor not only flattery but every form of smooth-talking. Your singular modesty also does not usually endure even the most modest praises. Therefore, when I praise your holy endeavor and study, I do so mainly to add spurs to the running horse and to encourage you not to be weary of your labors, as you clearly understand them to be both delightful and fruitful to all who hold the sacred letters dear. And just as you have illuminated our Germany with your golden writings, so you will illuminate France and Italy. It will be our part in turn to favor your endeavors well and to pray that the Lord may allow you to live long for the benefit of His church and grant you firm constancy and patience for your holy purpose.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, that Italian requested from me a certain "Apology" recently published in your name, which has so far eluded me. If it was published with you as the author, let me know.</p>
      <p>Moreover, regarding how our affairs in Glarus are, I think it is not unknown to you. Everything is quite peaceful with us, but under the condition that the Antichrist also has his place; may God soon cast him out.</p>
      <p>Farewell, distinguished glory of our Switzerland. Given in Glarus, on the 19th day of January in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>I wrote this letter to you as a testimony, so that you may understand that I continue in the business of Christ and adorn the Sparta I have obtained to the best of my ability.</p>
      <p>Fridolinus Fonteius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, professor of theology and most learned pastor in Zurich, his lord and dear friend. To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
