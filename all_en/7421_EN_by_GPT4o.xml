      <p>Grace and peace and very much health from God the Father and Jesus Christ, our Lord, I sincerely pray and diligently commend friendly services.</p>
      <p>Even though, most illustrious man, Lord Bullinger, I have previously observed your favorable disposition and remarkable benevolence towards our nation, and especially towards my family, when you pursued the sons of the magnificent Castellan of Lublin, Myszkowski of holy memory, with the greatest love, for which I again give you the greatest thanks, I nevertheless took great joy and pleasure from the fact that you not only promised your benevolence and efforts to my nephew from my brother, Johann Myszkowski, without any exception of occupation or time, but also that you received him with his servant into your house so that he might be better advised in his affairs and studies, and that you wished him to be under your domestic and holy discipline.</p>
      <p>In this matter, you could do nothing more pleasing to me, for I hope that this will be of some benefit to our family, our country, and the church of God above all, for which service I wish you to trust that everything from me will be most ready in return. I only ask this one thing, which I do not doubt you will do out of your great benevolence towards us, that he may learn the German language and the liberal arts well and not apply his mind to higher studies until you think he is fit to grasp them, and that he combines all these things with piety, which is the most important. At this time, he is suspected by me of negligence, as he has not sent me any letters for such a long time, although I instructed him to write very often, and Mr. Christian Thretius showed him the route by which he could conveniently send letters to Krakow. I do not want you to ever doubt about the payment, for I have ratified and approved the contract made between you and Mr. Christian Thretius regarding my nephew and his servant, indeed, so that you may know the expression of my gratitude, I will prove it with clear evidence. What remains, again and again, most illustrious man, esteemed friend, I ask of you, that you take diligent care of both Johann, my nephew, and his relatives who are in your city, I will again strive to repay with every service.</p>
      <p>The admonition appended at the end of your letter about protecting and promoting the true church was most pleasing to me, and I will make an effort to promote it as much as possible through me, although the minds of the heretics are so obstinate that they would rather endure anything than depart from their opinion.</p>
      <p>May God, the best and greatest, grant them a better mind. By the grace of God, we will always protect the uncorrupted voice of doctrine, which sounds in your and our churches. To this end, it is helpful to us that our purer churches have been received into your fellowship and admitted to the subscription of your confession, in which we wish to persevere to the end of this miserable life, with Christ's favor. Farewell most happily, most illustrious man of God and esteemed friend, whom God may keep safe for his church for a very long time. Given in Krakow on the 12th day before the calends of April in the year of our Lord 1568.</p>
      <p>St. Myszkowski, March 21, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Excellency's sincere friend Stanislaus Myszkowski of Mirow, Palatine and General Captain of Krakow, Ratno, Slomniki, etc., by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend, most illustrious, and most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, dearest friend.</p>
