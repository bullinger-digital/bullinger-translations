    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes personally to Bullinger, as it is not his place to write on behalf of the council or the [“Secret Council Members”], but the matter is close to his heart. Does not know whether Konstanz will turn to [the Empire] or the Confederates, although the latter seems unfavorable at the moment and the intentions are varied; direct negotiations with the council should not be conducted and generally only with great caution and consideration. Knows nothing about the matter of Wilhelm von Peyer and does not believe that his case, as well as that of the Confederates, was negotiated; may God assist them. He likes Bullinger's idea of a skillful mediator, but he cannot imagine that such negotiations would remain secret; therefore, he advises against it.</p>

      <p>Especially trusted, much-loved brother.</p>
      <p>I consider myself now to have been able to send you a futile (costless) and yet certain (reliable) message, therefore I do not want to refrain from responding to your written letter, as much as I can in the time available, all for myself; for I truly, truly have not dealt with or intend to deal with this matter with either the common council or the secret council members. For it is not my business or duty, as I have also told you verbally before, but I have a heartfelt desire to promote the welfare of my beloved fatherland and its neighbors in every way possible, where it is somehow possible for me, with good means.</p>
      <p>And although I could respond much to your letter, I take this briefly for myself due to the time, that you report, if I thought that they would not want you at all and would hang themselves out of it, then I should show it to you; and I say by the highest truth to the gentlemen themselves, that I cannot at all know what my lords are inclined towards you or the other party at this time; for I speak of these matters with no one except perhaps in broad terms from the outside around.</p>
      <p>But I believe and suspect for myself, as I have also spoken with you verbally, that everyone who also sincerely wishes well for the Confederation has great important reasons why he cannot engage with the Confederates at this time, as anyone of little understanding can well assess. Therefore, I also do not believe that it will be beneficial and good for either your side or ours, that something concerning these matters reaches our people; for what you write about and what yours might now gladly see, is in my heart a difficult thing to do and to achieve; for the opportunity of the time does not allow it. So I think I understand your mediation well, and what is intended to be accomplished by F; but how beneficial and advantageous it will be, I am very concerned, you will experience. Yours, as is common among the people, assess things according to their situation and circumstances; but in my opinion, this cannot serve ours at all. Since it wants to have its way, I must let it happen and commend it to God; whom I heartily ask, that he may let it turn out better than my heart predicts. But it seems to me in every way advisable that nothing is negotiated with my lords either in writing or verbally, unless you have beforehand understood from some trusted persons here outside the common and secret council members that it is to be done; for otherwise, you would certainly lay a heavy burden on the necks of ours, even if it were only presented to the secret council members collectively and in council manner, in which I, as much as it depends on me, would gladly wish that they were spared; for they, without that and otherwise, are in need of great grace from God, that they may act wisely in their temptations and obliging matters of this time. It will also not only depend on how yours deal with the Confederates, but much more on how it will be dealt with ours; there I am very concerned, it might fail, due to many and various significant (serious) reasons. I truly know not a word about Wilhelm von Peyer's dealings; I would also bet greatly that not a single word about these matters has been spoken with him by any person here, on whom something depends. He might perhaps assume it himself. I know well that concerning the Confederates' matter, no talk or dispute is held here at this time by anyone, and as far as I hear, it is not thought of among the council members. Therefore, handle this matter very cautiously. I also want to diligently, as much as it depends on you, ask and request you to do this, also above all in this matter, which is of such importance to both of us, to ask the Lord to arrange and direct all means in the best way, so that human reason does not spoil anything in this, as commonly happens, but that he may guide all actions through his spirit for the best. Amen, amen.</p>
      <p>What you write about the skillful mediator, how he deals with trusted people, etc., how you might make and keep us good friends with honor, prudence, and means, that is a good way and pleases me very much, especially if, upon the found will, some trusted persons of your lords from Zurich were given authority to negotiate such, whatever it might cost; for that would be the most secret and confidential way to handle the Confederates' matter. But how the matter could also be brought to our people in such a secret and harmless manner, I cannot imagine or think, by my redeemer, other than that great burden and misfortune might result from it and perhaps nothing might be accomplished, so that to this day I still consider the only way I have shown you to be the best; for it would be no less serviceable to achieve the end that the Confederates seek in this, but less worrisome, harmful, but above all things more secret, safer, and more useful. However, this would now be a good beginning, if some of yours were entrusted and given such authority to negotiate, perhaps God would also draw the other means. Oh, my dear, pious Bullinger, let this matter be of utmost importance to you before the Lord; for much, much depends on it and more than we can now assess, should it turn to misfortune. May the true Father in heaven let everything go to his praise and glory according to his mercy.</p>
      <p>The 30th of May, anno 1544.</p>
