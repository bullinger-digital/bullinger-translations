      <p>I received your booklet to the king, I read it; it pleases me as do your other works.</p>
      <p>But I fear that you may have provoked the Sorbonne; for they are irritable, especially when they fear for themselves, that is, when they fear the king might be alienated from them by their adversaries, which they clearly cannot bear. For the Sorbonne is a place from which almost everything great in the entire kingdom tends to emerge, as you yourself know.</p>
      <p>But this is your work; we will wait to see what the Lord wants to happen from it. Regarding the people of Straßburg, which you recently asked about, now hear this: the preachers and their school fear for themselves, as happened in Schwaben; there is no security. New sects arise from worthless men: Epicureanism with Gentilism is gaining strength; Anabaptists, Schwenckfeldians, and Papists have their defenders and promoters; only the pious are detestable. The magistrates have devoted themselves to Karl, awaiting his command, although in the meantime they have subscribed to the Wittenberg Confession, which Moritz will send to the Council of Trent; for it is said that he sent it to the Emperor long ago. They have appointed Schledan as their envoy, a learned, prudent, and pious man, who will go to Trent with a scribe and two servants; which I almost marvel at, that they would so comply with the Antichrist. "They do so," you say, "because of Karl." So be it; why then do they subscribe to the Wittenbergers? In sum: by our deeds, we prove what kind of men we are, namely those who attribute nothing to Christ, everything to men. But enough about them.</p>
      <p>It is written that the people of Ulm did not grant passage to the Spaniards through the city, but built a bridge below the city, by which they are said to have crossed the Danube; however, after the army crossed, the baggage was prohibited, and an edict was immediately made under penalty of death, that no one should follow. We marvel at the decision; if you have heard anything, tell us later.</p>
      <p>You surely know that the Emperor has left Augsburg. Money is lacking, which is why the soldiers are draining the miserable populace. He is preparing a passage through Innsbruck into Italy, promising himself that he will undertake great things. He fears for the Duchy of Milan, his gold mine.</p>
      <p>The situation presents itself as a great evil to come, which no one knows upon whom it will most heavily fall; for almost all of Europe is involved here. May the Lord be present with His church, as He undoubtedly will be.</p>
      <p>A great man said because of these things that peace has been made between the people of Magdeburg, Moritz, and the Emperor, but it is not published because of Moritz's soldiers, to whom many months' wages are still owed. It is certain that the feast of Michaelmas was set for the reconciliation, which was written to me a few days ago from Wittenberg, the place appointed for the assembly.</p>
      <p>There is not even a mention of the oath here; however, I proposed it to the brothers, and they responded with one voice: "This has always been our intention and will not change, unless we wish to depart from the word, which God forbid." Would that it might please our Confederates to be wise at some point, and indeed for salvation; for they persuade themselves that they have the gospel as clearly as anyone else. Indeed, I contended about this matter with a certain relative of mine; from this man, I heard amazing things. May the Lord's will be done. Farewell always in Christ with yours and all the brothers. Basel, November 6, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most excellent man, Antistes of the people of Zürich, his especially esteemed brother and lord.</p>
