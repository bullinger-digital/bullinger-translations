    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter along with his response to Cochläus [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“]; praises the kindness with which Bullinger and also Vadian treat him, which springs from the love of God. He also read the letter to his brethren; they also express their friendship to Bullinger and send greetings. Thanks for the gifted book, which he showed, among others, to Konrad Peutinger, a staunch opponent of Cochläus, and refers to the enclosed letter [to Musculus]. Encourages Bullinger to continue the fight against the enemies of the truth. Shares his concern about the disunity [of the Swiss cantons]; may God grant them peace and also give Germany good princes! Greetings, especially to [Rudolf] Gwalther, whom he met in Regensburg in 1541.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your letter along with the booklet you wrote against Cochläus, the common enemy of truth, dearest Bullinger in the Lord. Indeed, it is true of you, as I often proclaim of Philip Melanchthon, that exceptional learning is joined with exceptional modesty and humanity. For what, I ask, is more modest and humane than that you, a most learned man and renowned for so many published works, seek the friendship of Musculus, who truly recognizes nothing exceptional in himself, when your friendship should have been sought by me and all good people long ago? I would have eagerly done so, had not an untimely, though not entirely unreasonable, sense of shame restrained me. This also happened with the most illustrious St. Gallen councilor Joachim Vadian, whose friendship I earnestly desire, yet I approach hesitantly with literary address, even though I was invited to do so by him when he was here. But it is well, excellent Bullinger; this is truly the nature of pious minds, that, as they possess the better, they seek not so much to be loved as to love. And they have this truly divine spirit from Him who is love itself, who not only loved first but also embraced the most worthless mortals, dust and earth, with indescribable love and testified to this love for us not with some trivial sign, but with the most excellent one, by sending and giving His only begotten for us.</p>
      <p>From this source, brother, I know with certainty that your spirit and that of others like you, who seek the friendship and companionship of ordinary and common men, among whom you will count me, flows. I therefore admire this divine modesty and humanity of your spirit and will strive with all my might, that if I cannot be equal in returning favors, I will at least follow closely behind.</p>
      <p>I read your letters to the brothers who serve Christ the Lord here with me. They also promise to observe the friendship once established between us and send their most dutiful greetings to you and your fellow ministers, learned men and renowned for their piety.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for the small gift of the booklet you sent. I will ensure that your writings against Cochläus - long since exposed as an enemy of truth and not held in as high regard among his own as he miserably wishes to be - are also read by other good men, especially by Konrad Peutinger, an excellent and venerable old man, whom I know to be particularly hostile to Cochläus above other adversaries, and therefore I immediately presented this booklet to him for viewing, as you can see in this note written in his own hand and inserted in these letters. Therefore, continue, by the grace granted to you by God, to oppose the enemies of truth with your writings and to illuminate the cause of Christ, in which the Holy Spirit may happily guide your efforts.</p>
      <p>That which is at the end of your letters concerning the discord among your people and allies has made me anxious, lest by some wickedness of Satan, new disturbances arise among you in this dangerous time.</p>
      <p>Nor do I doubt that there are among the enemies of the Gospel of Christ those who work night and day to kindle some deadly fire in your affairs. Therefore, there is a great need here for Christian prudence, vigilance, and constant prayer to the Lord, that no place be given to Satan. May the Lord preserve both you and your churches in His peace and grant also to the rest of our Germany truly pious, wise, and strong princes.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, most learned and humane man. Give my greetings in my name to all your fellow ministers, our lords and brothers, especially to Rudolf Gwalther, whom I, unless I am mistaken, met in Regensburg in 1541 at the diet, whom I then began to follow with a singular affection of love because of his exceptional piety, learning, and gentle manners.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, 1544, April 4th.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and equally humane man, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, lord and brother in Christ, to be greatly respected.</p>
