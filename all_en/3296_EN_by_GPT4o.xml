      <p>Greetings. I have scarcely ceased writing, and I begin again, but I will conclude with a few words.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I sent the book with the letters, which I entrusted to your father-in-law to ensure they were properly taken care of. In the meantime, I received your latest ones.</p>
      <p>Mr. Coignet passed through here finally on the 28th of August, 7 days ago. He told me many things, including those you mention about the arrival of Duke Guise. The magistrate will receive him (if he stays here for a while; you know those traveling with fast horses do not linger long in one place) and will deal with him as you have planned; may the Lord grant it turns out well! The form of the supplication is elegant and appropriate; nothing seems to need changing in it, although I now consider it entirely submitted. The French soldiers will be in great danger if the leaders depart and leave them in the midst of the enemy. All these things seem to lead to some considerable misfortune.</p>
      <p>It would be much safer and better for them to leave Italy and return to France. But they come and go, undoubtedly drawn by fate, as it is said.</p>
      <p>Various rumors are being spread about the Swiss. It is well known that they are contemplating the recovery of their freedom; but since they have serious adversaries, who are such, it is unknown which way the matter will incline. This matter is being conducted with the utmost determination of spirit, and perhaps it will be addressed at the next assembly in Baden on the 5th of September. Let us pray to the Lord that all may turn out for the salvation of the country.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 3rd of September, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, godfather and dearest brother. To the pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
