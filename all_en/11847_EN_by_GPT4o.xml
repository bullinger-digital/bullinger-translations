    <p xml:id="regest1">[The relatives of Niklaus Wyttenbach], who oppose the planned wedding [of Samuel Wyttenbach and Küngold von Schönau], and Wyttenbach himself are concerned about the lack of a fixed inheritance right for the sons; however, Samuel remained steadfast. Bullinger should ensure that an appropriate response to the contentious article can be given at the meeting [of the wedding party]; Fuchs would respond to [Niklaus Wyttenbach] that the matter would be left to him should the inheritance case arise, with the hope that he would act as if his own children were affected. Otherwise, there are no differences, but [the opponents of the wedding] are trying to thwart it by all means; [Samuel's] mother is on Fuchs' side. Request for discreet handling of the letter's content. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with us all. Accordingly, my friendly, willing service and whatever I can honor, love, and do good.</p>
      <p>Especially beloved lord and brother, I have received your letter once again, for which I thank you once again, that you take so much effort to write and to act; I do not know how to repay you, may God be your reward.</p>
      <p>Concerning our marriage matter, know that they have almost made the man unwilling, and otherwise have nothing to present except the article concerning the boys' advantage. They say: "There is really not much good there, because they do not want to specify it exactly; we would have gladly helped you with a richer one, also so that you would not have to incur such great costs; and if they know no one, you make a wide kinship," and much the like. But the devil could not prevail, praise be to God. Samuel has remained steadfast, may God grant what the cousin and all the relatives have said. Therefore, dear lord and brother, do well and discuss with them, so that when we come to the appointed day, they will deliberate and give him some kind of answer concerning the article. If I were in their place, I would answer him, since the inheritance has not yet fallen and he insists so strongly on it, we would leave the matter to him if the case occurs; for you hope for him, he would act no differently than he did with his sons against the daughters, according to the situation of the property, or that he now takes what he wanted to leave to the brothers, should it come to pass, so that he sees that no deceit is sought therein.</p>
      <p>If it is done with him and his kinship and the matter is concluded, or they let it wait until the case occurs, then one would act according to fairness. So I know well that he would not do it, but rather assume, he would let it remain by the article. Otherwise, there is no dispute; but they seek ways and means to prevent it. They gladly offer him another and show great hostility against them; but I do not heed them, tell them my opinion openly. The mother is also with me. Therefore, this is my writing. Wishing not to let anyone else see it and to keep it with you; I write it to you as my good lord and brother. I would have much to write, but the time could not allow it. Until God helps me home, I will write to you in leisure.</p>
      <p>Greet all your household and good friends and brothers for me. From Solothurn, on Monday before Gallus in '43. Your ever willing Peter Fuchs.</p>
      <p>Write to me sometime, if you happen to have a messenger. So I will do the same for you, for it pleases me very much.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of God in Zurich, my gracious lord and brother, to his hands.</p>
