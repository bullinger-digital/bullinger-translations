      <p>How deplorable the state of our once church is, this venerable and dearest brother Hieronymus will explain to you in person. You will not cease to implore with us, He who raises the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did, so that He may vindicate the glory of His name from these more than impious adversaries. Certainly, I often come into great hope that there is still much that the Lord will do with His little flock, and I will not be disappointed, I think, in that hope, unless the great day of Christ is at hand. Then, however, the victory of the elect over their enemies will be especially clear and glorious, so that from this the greatest consolation will shine upon us. Our Hieronymus was in the city the day before yesterday, and if you compare its current state with its former quite honorable one, he will tell you more truly as an eyewitness than I can write. Pray for us and with us for the common dangers of all the churches of Christ, which, if ever great before, are certainly greatest now, which indeed touch the greatest men of faith, for such they seemed, so much that they not only turn others but utterly subvert them miserably, so that we see in reality that what the apostle said is very true, that faith is not of all and that Christ is a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to many, and that the thoughts of many hearts are revealed. Would that we may be among those with whom the Son of Man, when He comes, will find faith, and who are waiting for their Lord when He returns from the wedding, indeed from those faithful servants who will present the talents entrusted to them with significant interest to their Lord, in turn hearing this commendable and truly most delightful voice: Well done, good and faithful servant, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, my dearest and best and much revered brother in Christ and indeed my heart, in the Lord. My wife, along with your most pious sister, diligently and respectfully greet you and your wife. My brother has not yet returned; Zviccius with his relative Peter Schär went to Rorschach yesterday to Marcellus. Schär affirmed that he would not commit himself to return without greeting you; but he was in such a hurry that I could not write anything. Greetings to your household, greetings to the excellent men, Musculus and Gervasius, those Englishmen with the treasurer Arnold and the other brothers and friends in the Lord, by whose holy prayers I both desire and hope to be helped before Christ, especially by yours.</p>
      <p>I commend to you this our Hieronymus, a truly holy man, as much as I can; if you can do anything in the matter of his son, assist him, even for my sake, be present for him.</p>
