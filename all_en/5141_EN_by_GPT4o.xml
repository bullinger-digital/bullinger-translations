      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your benefits, most illustrious Bullinger, which you confer upon our churches both publicly with your pious and learned writings, and privately bind us to you continually, are so great that no way can be found for them to be forgotten in our minds. For all of which, we also give thanks to you, which we owe to you, now and hereafter with the private and public assent of the entire church. We pray, however, to the Lord, that, since we cannot, He may kindly compensate these your infinite services towards us with His promised free reward to all the pious.</p>
      <p>Especially, we give you great thanks for this reason, that you have willingly accepted the sons of the noble, pious, and truly noble Lord Stanislaus Cicowski into your home to be nurtured and instructed in piety. This kindness of yours will ensure that in this way you bring great benefit not only to them alone but also to the rest of the church in Poland, of which we hope they will become nurturers by the example of their parent. For it is of great importance that such boys, who are expected to conduct affairs excellently someday, are well-educated and live with such men, from whom they may take both the example and the encouragement of all honorable action. Although we know that the gospel of Christ is announced and good letters are faithfully taught in other regions of Europe, where many of our people also reside, we believe that nowhere better than with you can our children be instructed both in foreign languages and the more humane arts, as well as in the purer knowledge of evangelical truth.</p>
      <p>For in our judgment, your churches have both a more purified doctrine of the gospel corresponding to that ancient apostolic simplicity and such an uncorrupted discipline that there is no doubt that young people cannot be easily corrupted there as elsewhere. Therefore, we commend to your piety the sons of this most noble man and their tutor all the more diligently, because we consider it of no small importance if your kindness favors their studies...</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we pray that, as you have been accustomed to pursue our people with great humanity and benevolence, you may continue in that excellent practice of yours. Above all, we beseech you to embrace these noble boys with such love that they may later rightfully call you the parent of both their life and doctrine. We too will not only give you thanks for this reason but also pray to the Lord that He may keep you a faithful minister for a long time not only to your churches but also to ours, to the glory of His most holy name. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and also pray for us to the Lord, that we may be able to run tirelessly in the path of the Lord until the end. Krak처w, January 21, 1562.</p>
      <p>Gregor Pauli, minister of the church of God in Krak처w, together with the elders of the same church.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Z체rich, brother in the Lord to be revered. Z체rich.</p>
