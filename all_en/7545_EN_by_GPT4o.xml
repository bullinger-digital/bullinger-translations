      <p>As soon as I had sealed the previous letter, I learned that a meeting of the four cities, Zürich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, is scheduled for Sunday in eight days in Aarau, etc. Herewith I send you the judgment, quite unfounded, against Mr. Egmond. Dated in haste, God be with you, as in the letters.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable Mr. Joachim Bäldi, former Landammann of Glarus, my kind, dear sir.</p>
