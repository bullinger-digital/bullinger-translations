      <p>S. P. When I received the book of my husband, most beloved compater, I wished, as he instructed me through his letters, that it would be published before this fair, so I sent it to Mr. Peter Martyr, so that he might take care of this in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>He excused this because of the doctrine of the Eucharist, which is not accepted there. It could be printed here with the good permission of the senate; but it is better that you yourself first review the book and ensure it is printed there. However, because I am not unaware that his memory is most sacred to you, I do not doubt that you will now gratify him in this matter, just as if he were alive. Indeed, he now lives with all the holy martyrs and with his Christ, the head of the martyrs; but I am dying here, until God reunites me with him.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for your most holy letters; I certainly now need such consolations and your prayers; I therefore ask you, by the holy friendship of my most holy martyr husband, from whom I am now bereft and consider this life to be death, not to abandon me. I am not one who can return equal favors; but you will render a pleasing service to God, who especially commends widows to you. Rachel and I thank you for the elegant gift sent at the New Year. Greet your excellent wife, my dearest commater, and all friends. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, April 11, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your most loving commater and sister in Christ, Anna Hooper.</p>
      <p>Your Rachel sends you a small English coin, on which are the images of Ahab and Jezebel.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian and most faithful servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zürich, to the venerable compater. In Zürich.</p>
