      <p>My good father, presently writing to the magnificent lords of your good city of Zürich about the disposition in which the very Christian king, my lord, finds himself to attend to the pacification of his state, and such that Monsieur de Beauvoir, the present bearer who reported it to me, will be able to reveal to you very well, although my letter is addressed to all in general, I have indeed wanted to additionally send you this word, which will serve for two purposes: the first to testify to you the friendship and respect that I bear for you, and the second to ask you that following the charitable zeal you have for the advancement of the gospel, you now exhort, indeed summon and call upon the said magnificent lords, to lend in such an urgent necessity both hands and shoulders for the rebuilding of this holy edifice.</p>
      <p>The form and means that I desire to achieve this will be more specially explained to you by the said Sieur de Beauvoir, for whom I will refrain from saying more here, and in this place, after having strongly recommended myself to your good prayers, I myself will pray the Creator to give you, my good father, in perfect health the full course of your happy old age.</p>
      <p>Written in Basel this 4th day of February 1575. Your entirely good friend forever, Henri de Bourbon.</p>
      <p>To my good father, Monsieur Bullinger, faithful minister of the word of God in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Prince of Condé writes to me in the month of February 1575.</p>
