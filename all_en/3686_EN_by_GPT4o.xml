      <p>Greetings. I received your letters while I was in Bern, and I am grateful that you are so concerned for your son. As for our matters, I doubt whether they will meet.</p>
      <p>What has been reported to you about Andelot, about Lord de Thermes, about the ships captured or sunk, I have not understood and I think they are false and not very credible, since Calais does not need supplies and is very fortified. The English, who wanted to land in Aquitaine, were driven out after suffering a defeat.</p>
      <p>Their queen is suffering from incurable dropsy. I sent your letters to Lord Sanlorenzo.</p>
      <p>From friends and relatives, a poem was sent to me, which was given to Lord Cardinal when there was talk of peace; it will not displease you.</p>
      <p>Give my many greetings to Lord Walter and Martyr and commend me to Christ in your prayers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, August 29.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
