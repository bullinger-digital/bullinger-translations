      <p>Pious, honorable, etc.</p>
      <p>My willing service, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding your letter, I have not wanted to respond at this time; for I have had to write a great deal to the Frankfurt fair in England, the Netherlands, Saxony, Hesse, Prussia, Poland, etc.</p>
      <p>However, today I have received some letters from Chur, which I suspect you are not informed about.</p>
      <p>The envoys of the Confederates arrived there on March 14, and were heard on the 16th by the League of God's House. A general assembly day has been scheduled for March 27 in Davos.</p>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, the envoys rode to the Upper League for the day to Trun. On the night of Sunday the 18th, letters and warnings arrived in Chur, stating that the Upper Engadiners are on the move with a banner, having summoned the Lower Engadiners. A council was held in Chur, and before daybreak, [Mr.] Mayor Tscharner sent word to the envoys to inform them of this.</p>
      <p>May God grant that it turns out well; uprisings never did any good. From Augsburg and Heidelberg, I also received letters today, in summary: it is certain that the Turk is equipping 200 ships and has never made a more powerful armament; he is said to want to go to Italy, etc. Lazarus von Schwendi has taken the fortress Tokaj in Transylvania for Maximilian, and it is thought that the Voivode, the Hungarians, and the Turks will expend all their resources on it. If so, then they are doing as always, stirring up the hornet's nest and then fleeing; it is no stately, steadfast resistance. The king in Poland is said to have dismissed his queen, Maximilian's sister, with the Pope's permission, because she is barren, etc. The Muscovites have harmed the Lithuanians and would have done even greater harm if they had not been hindered by the Tatars.</p>
      <p>The Count Palatine has the entire conversation held at Maulbronn printed (it has been sent to me) against Brentz.</p>
      <p>The scholars in France and some in the Netherlands have also written against him. We have both been observed for now three years, how we correspond with each other; now a whole crowd falls upon him, and I will be saved, although the God who has helped me alone so far would not abandon me in the future, even if I were to remain alone; to Him be honor and praise, and may He help me at all times. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Greet my good lords and friends.</p>
      <p>Dated March 23, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours.</p>
      <p>Cornelius, the captain of the Genoese, is said to be in Germany, preparing 3,000 landsknechts for Italy; many are said to have already come to Chur, but they are not allowed to pass and have been sent back.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable lord Joachim BÃ¤ldi, former Landammann of Glarus, my kind, dear lord. Glarus.</p>
