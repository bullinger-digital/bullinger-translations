      <p>S. D. I received your letters, Burcher, written on May 30 and June 1, promptly, and I thank you for your faithfulness and diligence. I would very much like to see the book of the Anglican religion. Therefore, you would do me a great favor if you could send me a copy once you have obtained one.</p>
      <p>If you receive any letters from England that pertain to me, I ask that you ensure they are delivered to me safely. If you have received any news about our Mr. Hooper, also how Bucer is conducting himself in England, finally how our Richard is doing, and what the state of your kingdom is, please share it with me. Perhaps you are not unaware of what the Emperor is doing or where he is now: we hear nothing about him here. That nobleman from Ghent, from Utenhofen, has surpassed your commendation: he is an incomparable man; and I thank you that, under your auspices and with our Hooper, I have formed a friendship with a man distinguished in every way. Regarding our affairs in Switzerland, know nothing else than that everything is peaceful among us; except that those republics which have accepted the French alliance are somewhat discordant among themselves, because many are found among them who still condemn that alliance. However, there is the utmost concord among the Christian cities, which have unanimously renounced the alliance. Some other republics have also renounced it: nor are those who accepted it hostile to those who did not, although they wished all to do what they themselves did. Among other things, these words are contained in the alliance: "And if the aforementioned royal majesty needs help to conquer the city of Boulogne and the lordship of Boulogne in Picardy, the Confederates are obliged to provide it, as has been previously explained regarding our other lands." You see how these bloodthirsty princes attempt to drag us along with them. Oh, if only the King of England would send a brief letter to all the Swiss, in which he would ask for nothing, but only assert and defend his right, finally urging them not to continue waging war against one who has done no wrong! Farewell, my Burcher, and write back diligently about all matters: farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>I am in the process of arranging for the stipend to be paid to your wife's brother; and tomorrow I will try again. The Lord knows what I will accomplish.</p>
      <p>May your wife also fare well. Greet all our friends and sisters in England.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 28, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours as you know, HENRY BULLINGER.</p>
      <p>To Mr. John Burcher, Englishman residing in Strasbourg, his most sincere friend.</p>
