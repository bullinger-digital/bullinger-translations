    <p xml:id="regest1">Of course, Bullinger did not disclose anything [about Blarer's letter regarding Molckenpur's courtship and the negotiations on Konrad Zwick's art of war]. - The [Zurichers] have agreed to [Molckenpur's request on behalf of the Schmalkaldic League]. Bullinger hopes that [Molckenpur] has been treated kindly. Also, [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater] did not mention [Zwick's] art of war to Molckenpur. Haab has furthermore written to [Zwick]. - The new bailiff in Thurgau, Leonhard Holzhalb, was previously a bailiff in Freiamt and performed his duties there so well that he will certainly continue to do so in the future. The Zurichers are not allowed to accept gifts from princes, lords, or prelates. However, they may receive presents from Confederates, as has been customary since ancient times. For example, the [Zurich] bailiffs may not accept a gift from the Bishop of Constance or from canons. This is also prohibited in the case of a legal dispute. However, the bailiff may receive welcome gifts from Confederates upon his arrival. - The idea of a [second] religious colloquy [in Regensburg] displeases Bullinger. Hopefully, it will not divide the [Protestants]. May Bucer remain silent once and for all! - Bullinger could not learn anything from the printers. However, Blarer should also communicate his concerns to the [print] supervisors. - In the meantime, Bibliander will have sent the mill [sketch] by Gerhard Westerburg, who stayed with Bullinger for 14 days and also gave him a print of it, to Blarer. Bullinger does not believe that the project can be carried out. - It serves Vadian right if he trustingly writes to people who then make more of it than he wrote. - Bullinger has [Johannes] a Lasco's letter [to Bucer from June 23, 1545] [returned] and awaits Blarer's judgment on it, along with [a Lasco's "Defensio verae doctrinae"]. - He sends his commentary on Mark.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Everything you desire for the sake of silence and discretion, dear sir and brother, you should know that you have been assured of it, and therefore there is no need for many words; when I know that I should remain silent, there is no further need.</p>
      <p>You have done us a great service by informing us, and regarding the recruitment, as it was done by Mr. Matthäus, our people have agreed, as you will understand better from him; since he primarily recruited, should war break out, we will not let our people run back to you, etc. I think and hope the messenger is treated kindly and well. I have ensured that my lords do not speak with Mr. Matthäus about the art. My lord Haab told me he wrote to your cousin; then I began to ask from afar if the negotiation with the art had completely stalled, etc. To which he replied: No, he would write and has written, etc.</p>
      <p>With the new bailiff in Thurgau, Leonhard Holzhalb, it is as follows: He was previously a bailiff in Freiamt and governed very well, so it is trusted that he will also do his best there. And as with him, other officials have been appointed, a question was raised about how they should conduct themselves in all matters. It was also mentioned about gifts, and it was decided that it should remain according to our sworn letter, which stipulates that none of us should accept gifts or presents from any prince, lord, or prelate, etc. However, if a Confederate, a good lord and friend, gives or presents something from his own goods in an unobjectionable manner, as has been customary since ancient times, that may well be, etc. Therefore, our bailiffs should not accept gifts from the Bishop of Constance, canons, external prelates, lords, etc., nor in legal disputes, matters, and conflicts from anyone at all. However, if the bailiff ceremoniously enters and then someone within the Confederation willingly gives a welcome gift from his own, as it is called, he may accept it.</p>
      <p>That is all that has been discussed about it.</p>
      <p>The colloquy does not please me at all. May God prevent it from leading to a division among you! I would like Bucer to have arranged enough colloquies and spoken enough, etc.</p>
      <p>I cannot learn anything from the printers; they must be doing it behind my back. Therefore, you may also approach others who have oversight. What I could prevent, I would do or inform you. I have reminded Theodor about the mill. Be assured, you have it now. Doctor Erhart Westerburg, who stayed with me for 14 days, also gave me a print. Do not think it is possible to make and bring it into effect. Painting is not difficult, etc.</p>
      <p>It serves Vadian right if he trusts and writes to some people; they then make more of it than he himself does, etc.</p>
      <p>I have received the letter from Mr. a Lasco, but I still await your judgment on it, along with the booklet against Menno the Anabaptist.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I could not write more now. Here I send a small gift, our labors on Mark.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 5, 1545. Greet yours. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his incomparable brother.</p>
