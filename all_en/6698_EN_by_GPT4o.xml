      <p>Our consul has not yet returned from the assembly; nothing is known here about the letters sent by yours. Perhaps we will have everything from the assembly. I sent your letters written to me to Mr. Steiger, the Bernese consul, imploring him to assist the struggling cause.</p>
      <p>Gallicium, the poor chicken. When that Lambert returns, then do what you can; for I received yours written on the 15th of this month. 21st February 1566.</p>
