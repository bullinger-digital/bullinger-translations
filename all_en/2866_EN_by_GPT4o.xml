      <p>S. Dear godfather and brother in the Lord, the bearer of this letter will verbally inform you well about our situation. My mother-in-law has been sick for a month, but she is somewhat better, praise be to God. Our sovereign passed through here on March 12th on his way to Heidelberg to attend the electoral assembly. May God grant him much grace, for he surely needs it. M. Michel Dillinger travels with him, as does D. Vitus, a pious man, etc. The Duke of W체rttemberg accompanies him with 300 horses. The common people in the Palatinate are pleased with his arrival, but the priests and monks are not. The Margrave is in Coburg, negotiating with his relatives; the Nurembergers are in great danger.</p>
      <p>The Duke of W체rttemberg does not allow the people of Ulm to bring wood from his land, which is why there is a great shortage of wood there, etc. In Dillingen, near us, people are expecting the cardinal every day, who will bring something from Rome to the Germans as a commodity. The Augsburgers have again ordered their citizens to arm themselves with swords and armor, and as in the old days, the leaders in the four quarters have been appointed again, and they have also accepted mercenaries into the city, etc. Sch채rtlin is in Burtenbach and pays the mercenaries until Easter. The situation is strange. May God set it right. We have heard nothing from the Reichstag. There is talk that King Ferdinand would gladly withdraw. In Styria, the Turks have caused great damage.</p>
      <p>Vienna, Hungary, and Styria are crying for help; but none is yet available. "Woe to Germany, when two horns will reign in it," says Abbot Joachim. I wonder if there is anything to the rumor about the people of Zug, that they are said to have burned the Bible, etc. I know nothing more, except that I hope to be with you after Easter and to settle all matters. The Lord be with you. Greet your household for me, my godfather, Mr. Lavater, and our dear brothers Gualther, Frisius, etc.</p>
      <p>In haste, in Lauingen, March 20, 1556. Yours always, Laurentius.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gregorius has arrived not far from me in a village called D체mingen. My gracious lord has kindly and graciously given him a gift of 10 guilders, 20 florins, etc. I fear he wants to enter the old order, etc. News from Vienna: The king held a diet in Pressburg with the Hungarians; what was negotiated has not yet been made public. It is certain that the Turks are constantly advancing towards Buda, Pest, and Stuhlweissenburg, where they are encamping their forces, and in a short time, 30,000 have arrived, daily bringing more troops, having made peace with the king of Persia and other oriental rulers, which is worrying, and they will attack us with great seriousness. In Vienna, there are still no troops or other preparations. What will be done? While we are preparing and holding a diet, he will surely accomplish his plans, dealing cruelly with the poor Christians, whom he daily leads away, strangling and killing the children in their mothers' wombs, as we hear daily from the Hungarians coming to Vienna and reporting gruesome acts that he commits day and night. It is believed that in a short time he has strangled, driven away, and captured 30,000 Christians in a raid, etc.</p>
      <p>With this force, he wages war against us, and if they do not want to, he drives them to it with whips and scourges, etc. I have copied this from a letter of a pious, honest man, written from Vienna to our city.</p>
      <p>To the pious, wise, and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my beloved and trusted lord and dearest godfather, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
