    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Negri has not written to Bullinger for a long time because he did not want to interrupt his serious affairs with unimportant [letters]. However, since he fears that his long silence could be interpreted as ingratitude towards Bullinger's benefactions, he would like to send a few lines with the departing messenger, from which Bullinger can gather that Negri is still entirely his and that the unbreakable bond of love of the Spirit of Christ between them continues to exist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Negri would like to present a very small token of his gratitude, namely his Rhetia.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He and his colleagues are, by God's grace, well, but concerned. War is breaking out everywhere. What does the Lord have in store for them? If his many affairs allow, Bullinger should send them news. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To Master Bullinger, Francesco Negri sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Nothing else has been the cause, most honorable Bullinger, for my not having sent you any letters until now, except that I did not wish to interrupt your serious affairs with my trifles. But when I saw that my prolonged silence might lead you to think that I had forgotten my respect towards you, I have written these few lines with the departing messenger, so that you may understand that I am as much yours now as I have always been, and that the bond of love, with which Christ has united us by His Spirit, is entirely unbreakable.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>However, I wanted to send you a small token of my remembrance of you, albeit a very small one, namely my Rhetia, so that this little gift, whatever it may be, may testify to my affection for you. But enough of this.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We here, by the grace of God, are well, but in the meantime, we are anxious about what the Lord intends to do with us, as we see the flames of war kindled everywhere. If you have any news, I beseech you, let us know, if, however, your occupations allow you the time. Meanwhile, farewell, most excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, 10th of August, 1547.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God, to be greatly respected. Zurich.</p>
