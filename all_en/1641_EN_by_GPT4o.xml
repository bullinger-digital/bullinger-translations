      <p>Greetings and grace from the Lord. Mr. Blaurer, my father, sent me two Latin booklets that you recently wrote for the evangelical churches. As you wished, I kept one for myself and handed the other to Mr. Calvin in person, who, along with me, expresses great thanks to you for this special gift. Shortly after, I received a letter from you dated April 20th, along with two French booklets, about which I have this to say. That you think I should be thanked for this, I am certain it is not due to any merit of mine, but rather an abundance of love towards you. What I have done for the church of God and for you, I have done sincerely: but how light is this? How small? How plainly nothing? May the Lord grant me to be able to contribute more diligently to the building of His house, and to you, my father, that you may continue long, bravely, and steadfastly in the work you have undertaken.</p>
      <p>I come to the other part of your letter, which indeed moved me deeply as it should. I congratulate Mr. Otho on his happy and timely departure to our Lord God.</p>
      <p>I mourn for the church's loss of such an excellent and learned man. But this, and far graver things, are deserved by the incredible treachery of all peoples, cities, and men.</p>
      <p>As for Gesner, what should I write? Many things indeed occur to me why, if he has been taken from us, I should rather congratulate him than be deeply afflicted: but when I think of his singular goodness, learning, diligence, and even his private friendship with me, hardly anything could have happened to me at this time more bitter and sorrowful. I do not write to him, so full am I of anxious fear. But see, I beg you, that you free us from this fear as soon as possible, or certainly, if what I least of all wish has happened, prepare a thorough consolation. But I wish this last duty may not be necessary.</p>
      <p>Regarding the French booklets you write to me about, the current condition of the times and people is such that they can scarcely be sold for cash in these regions. But our printers are accustomed to follow the trust of certain people to whom they entrust such booklets to be secretly distributed through the churches of France. This is usually done at the printers' risk, as these people, otherwise not bad, often lose their lives for the name of Christ when intercepted with the goods.</p>
      <p>This is indeed the miserable condition of our France, and yet you can scarcely believe how many willingly expose themselves to these dangers to build the church of God. The Lord will look upon us at the right time. If your printer is pleased to embrace these conditions, one part of the books, I hope, will be sold here, the other part will be subject to the dangers I mentioned.</p>
      <p>I will ensure that everything is entrusted to a proven and faithful person. I have nothing to say about the tumult of wars, except this one thing. Since these matters are managed by those who think nothing of the glory of Christ, indeed who abuse the name of Christ to cover their ambition, I do not see what joy we can hope for.</p>
      <p>We certainly must expect what those who put Christ after all things deserve. I indeed prepare myself for the worst, whenever I observe the indifference of those to whom the Lord has revealed His mysteries in our times. For this contempt must indeed be avenged. Therefore, pray to the Lord, as you do, for the miserable and afflicted church. For I see that the word of the Lord causes nausea among our people: thus it is necessary that it be given to a nation producing fruit. For here indeed all things are more desperate than they have ever been.</p>
      <p>And so, my father, to speak frankly with you and pour out complaints common to me with all good people, I fear that this may apply to us: It will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah, etc. etc. For a long time now, the excellent Mr. Haller has been striving to obtain a visitation of the churches: these storms are opposed, and those things which ought to have been first are postponed. Because we think of nothing but the world, we are blinded by the just judgment of God, so that we neither consider the source and origin of evils, nor seek counsel from the word of God rather than our own prudence. If some prince had declared war on us, we would certainly prepare with great diligence either for peace or for war. But the wrath of God we either do not feel, or we do nothing at all. What then awaits us? May the Lord provide and have mercy on His own, lest they perish with the wicked. For I have nothing else to hope or say.</p>
      <p>But so that you may understand how true are the rumors that our tyrant uses to cover his cruelty, I will tell you what happened fifteen days ago in Lyon. The churches of Narbonne had asked us for some brothers from whom the scattered remnants of their churches might receive consolation. We had sent four young men of singular piety, all of whom were intercepted in Lyon, in the house of a certain brother whom they had come to console as he was dying. Therefore, you will commend them to the Lord with us. For He alone can protect them, deprived of human aid.</p>
      <p>But perhaps I have said too much about these things. Yet for my respect for you, you will forgive me if I pour out my sorrows and groans into your bosom. Moreover, I send you two letters which I beg you to ensure are delivered to Heinrich Estienne, Robert's son, if he is there; if not, cut and tear them up. As for your students, we now have quite a few, in whose instruction we wish to prove our faith and diligence to your most ample republic: but we do not fear in vain that we may wish this in vain, unless they are subject to the laws of our academy. For foreigners usually, if we remind them of their duty, retort to us that the laws of the academy were made only for those who are supported by the stipends of our most magnificent princes. Therefore, they think anything is permissible for them. But we diligently inquire into the conduct and progress of our own, and frequently, so that neither the idle nor the wicked may be allowed to be.</p>
      <p>I wanted to remind you of this, my father, not only from my own opinion but also from that of my colleagues, so that, if it seems fair to you, you may write the opinion of your most ample senate and yours on this matter both to them and to us, so that you may indeed experience that we desire nothing more than to persuade you that foreigners are no less than our own, as is fair, commended to us.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to your prayers, my father. Mr. Viret and all of ours, to a man, send their greetings to you and all your colleagues, and especially my wife sends her greetings to you and your wife with your whole family. May the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, keep you safe for His church with the whole assembly of your excellent men and fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, on the Ides of May.</p>
      <p>T. Beza, truly yours.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
