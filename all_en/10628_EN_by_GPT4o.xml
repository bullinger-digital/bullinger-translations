    <p xml:id="regest1">He has heard that Hans Füßli is on his deathbed; therefore, he asks Bullinger to request the return of the seventh book of his chronicle, which was left with him, along with Füßli's transcript and additions, and to send it to him through the steward [Oswald Wirz]. He would like to receive the promised report on the campaign [to the Gubel] from Georg Ottli. He will return the borrowed books soon.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, it has come to my attention that our dear Hans Füßli is suffering from a severe and dangerous illness. Now, several days have passed without me being able to receive any message or write to you, so I am unaware whether he is still alive or has passed away. Therefore, I earnestly and fraternally request you, in the spirit of brotherly unity (bond), to ensure that, regardless of how the Lord deals with Mr. Füßli, the seventh book of the chronicle, which I recently sent to him through you, is kept safe and, if possible, to arrange for us to receive his transcript of the aforementioned book, along with his additions, etc. I have written to you through my steward with a friendly request, so that this rough, wretched writing of mine need not be necessary, etc.</p>
      <p>I recently instructed Georg Ottli, upon his departure, to compose for me some pieces of the campaign in writing, which he promised to do. It would be my very friendly request, if you could, without inconvenience, obtain such writings from him and send them to me, I would always be grateful to you. However, you should seal it with your seal and send it to me through my steward; he will return home on Friday or Saturday. At the "White Cross" in the church alley, he has his horse and lodging.</p>
      <p>Forgive me for my disturbance (inconvenience), as I call upon you, and commend you to the Lord God.</p>
      <p>Given at Bubikon, on the 9th of June in the year of our Lord 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Stumpf.</p>
      <p>I will soon return the borrowed books.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the city of Zurich, his most beloved brother in Christ.</p>
