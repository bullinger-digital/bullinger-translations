      <p>Greetings. Recently, I was exceedingly grieved, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, that upon returning from Winterthur (Vitodurum) I could not pass through there with any convenience. For I had a matter of no small importance in Aarau (Harundineto), which I could also accomplish in the absence of my cousin; but I heard that traveling from there to Z端rich (Tigurum) and then to Baden could only be done with considerable loss of time, since from Baden to Z端rich is no less distant than Aarau (if I hear correctly), although neither the journey nor the cost would have moved me at all, if our hired drivers, hastening their return to their own, had not shown themselves very difficult and unwilling to make that detour (as it seemed to them). There were indeed matters I intended to discuss with you, which I hoped to do not without some notable benefit to myself, so that you indeed would have suffered no loss, but I a great one, for not visiting you again; but I hope this, whatever it is, will be mended on another occasion, which the Lord will provide.</p>
      <p>I stayed in Winterthur for four days with my brother because of the estate left there by our late excellent cousin Dorothea, of which we had long been made heirs; but that excellent old man of yours, whose sermons I was listening to attentively, never greeted me, which he had previously done courteously for many years whenever I came to Winterthur, even meeting me at the inn, so that I clearly understood the man's mind was not so much alienated from me as it was aware of the grave injury done to me. I, who from the heart forgave that offense, would have invited him to dinner first, had not some good men and friends advised me that I would not be pleasing to him in this matter. When he happened to meet my wife near the church, he greeted her kindly, asked how she was and if she was well, and inquired about some other things, but did not speak a word about me. The other, Matthias's colleague, received me very kindly as soon as I entered the town, visiting repeatedly and even joining our table as a guest, by which he bound me to him with no ordinary benefit. But perhaps I have said more than enough about these matters, for if I wished to write to you all that some very honest men have faithfully reported about the injuries done to me, I would be very burdensome to you and meanwhile not convenient to myself or anyone else.</p>
      <p>I am sending here what I recently received from Upper Hungary and Augsburg, although perhaps everything has already been written to you by friends from elsewhere. Nevertheless, I did not want to fail in our old duty of writing about these matters, which I also earnestly ask you to do in return. Let us pray with humble vows to the Lord, that He may graciously grant our Germany sincere and solid repentance first, and then true and perpetual peace in Him, and not allow it to rage cruelly against its own entrails in this manner any longer.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my soul, with your whole family, whom you will greet accurately and reverently with my words and those of my wife. May the most holy and excellent men in Christ, Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, Wolf, Zwingli, Lavater, with all your other ministers in the work of the Lord, who love us in Christ, be greeted, whose sacred prayers I uniquely desire to be commended to our heavenly Father through Christ, especially yours.</p>
      <p>Make sure to diligently excuse me to our primary friend Rodolph Gwalther, who has deserved very well of me and my whole family, for not meeting him recently; for, as Christ loves me, it was not done out of neglect for him, much less out of contempt, but because I could not possibly do so without being an untimely interrupter to him. We certainly arrived in Z端rich after the eighth hour in the afternoon, so that it was not possible to go out after dinner; the next morning I went to the church to hear such a theologian and friend speaking of Christ's triumph with many others and then to address him after the sermon, where the former succeeded very happily for me, since he expounded the history of Christ's ascension, our avenger, written by Luke, so learnedly, gravely, and altogether pathetically, that I also seemed to myself to be lifted up to heaven in spirit; the latter I could not achieve, as my old friends from Constance and some from Z端rich intercepted me, and before I could withdraw from their greetings, the excellent Gwalther had already slipped away, and the host was urging dinner.</p>
      <p>At noon I visited you; you know yourself how tumultuously and as if in passing I did so, then I greeted the most learned Theodor and afterwards the most pious Pellican in the same haste. Meanwhile, it was announced that my cousin Zwicky with his wife and eldest son had arrived and were waiting for me at the Sword Inn, which caused me to return there immediately, passing by and not greeting Gwalther at that time, with whom I had intended to confer, either at dinner or the next day by all means.</p>
      <p>But indeed, matters were so mixed up for me one after another, that being excluded from all time, I could not accomplish what I had set for myself, which I nevertheless bore somewhat more lightly because it was certain that on the return I would more fully enjoy the face of the Lord and abundantly compensate for whatever duties might have seemed rightly to be desired from anyone towards me at that time.</p>
      <p>Since this hope, which I mentioned above, has also deceived me, nothing remains but to grieve for my own rather than your situation; certainly, nothing could have been added to you from my conversation with you, but much could have been added to me from yours with me, in terms of confirmation and spiritual consolation, although in the meantime I would have declared my loving and greatly observant sincere mind towards you, which I have always had and will have as far as it could be done. But I hope that another more convenient opportunity will occur for us to do all these things at another time, with Christ favoring us well. You, as my entire being in the bowels of Christ, love me constantly and support me perpetually with the pious sighs of your prayers, especially you, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, who know how much I have loved and reverently regarded you for many years. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Biel, July 7, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
