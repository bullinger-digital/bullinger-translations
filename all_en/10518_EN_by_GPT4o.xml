    <p xml:id="regest1">[Zürich Confession of the Lord's Supper from December 1534:] They once again present their doctrine. In the Lord's Supper, the body and blood of Christ are truly present and are eaten and drunk by the faithful in faith. The sacraments are signs of divine grace and present this to our senses in their own way. To avoid obscurity, it is explained in detail that Christ's true body is not imaginary and the Lord's Supper is not merely a commemoration with empty bread and wine; that Christ gives himself as life-giving food; that "truly eating" means recognizing him as the Redeemer and fully taking him into oneself; that his body and blood, although present for the believer even outside the use of the symbols, are also present in the sacrament only through faith, but here they are sensibly visible as an image of the matter that the spirit works inwardly; that unbelievers only receive the sign to their judgment, but believers eat Christ's body as their spiritual nourishment; that grace is not bound to the sacraments; that Christ gives the sole working spirit, while the recitation of the words of institution achieves nothing, although the ministers retain their significance; that harsh expressions are not offensive, but simple, biblical ones are better; that they do not teach mere symbols, but eat Christ spiritually, not carnally; that we become one body with him and, despite guilt, attain eternal life. They wish to persist in this scriptural doctrine. They seek peace with Luther, who should show that he agrees with them on the matter, even if with different expressions, and who should clearly explain the manner of presence in the sacrament. They give Bucer the authority to publish this writing and to present it to Luther, Philipp [Melanchthon], Brenz, Osiander, Agricola, or Schnepf, prohibit changes to it, and urge truth in his efforts for concord.</p>

      <p>The Zürich Confession.</p>
      <p>To Martin Bucer.</p>
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Although we have often, venerable brother in the Lord, Bucer, testified about our faith and doctrine, which we profess in the matter of the Eucharist, we now again, with a sincere heart and a good conscience, testify and confess before God and the whole world the same as we have always done before. Namely:</p>
      <p>In the sacrament of the Eucharist, that is, in the holy supper of thanksgiving, the true body of Christ, which was broken for us on the cross, and his true blood, which was shed for the remission of our sins, are truly present, given, and distributed to the faithful, who eat and drink the true body and true blood of Christ by faith. For the sacraments instituted by the Lord are symbols, signs, and testimonies of divine grace towards us, which not only signify the divine promises and the free benefits of God towards us but also in some way subject them to our senses and represent them. This is the sum of our opinion.</p>
      <p>Now, lest there be any obscurity or ambiguity in words, we simply and in good faith explain our position in this way:</p>
      <p>When we say that the body of Christ is present in the supper, we mean the same body that was delivered to death for us. For we do not imagine any spiritual or imaginary body. Nor does Christ have any other body than that which he took from the pure Virgin by the cooperation of the Holy Spirit, which he gave to death for the expiation of the sins of the whole world, which rose again from the dead, not stripped of human nature or converted into divinity or spirit, but purified, so to speak, or as others say, glorified. The apostles touched the true body, but glorified, they saw the true body ascend to heaven with their own eyes, the true body sits at the right hand of the Father, from there to come again to judge the living and the dead.</p>
      <p>We affirm that the body of Christ is truly present because of those who say that nothing remains for us in the supper after the bread and wine, as if they were empty signs of an absent Christ, not also of a present Christ. This opinion certainly never came to our mind, much less have we ever taught it. For we do not assert that this supper of the Lord is so much a memorial or commemoration that it only reminds us of an absent Christ, but rather of a present one. For what would we celebrate that is excellent or august if we only gloried in bare bread? Or how would it be called the supper of the Lord, which would be without the Lord? Therefore, we believe that the true body of the Lord, received into heaven from our eyes, sits at the right hand of the Father in some one place of heaven because of the mode of a true body, but in the supper, it is present in that way and by that reason by which the Lord himself presents himself to his own, by which he distributes himself to his own to be enjoyed, and the faithful mind can receive and eat him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we will now openly declare how he is present to his own, how he distributes himself to his own, and how they are fed with his true body and blood to eternal life:</p>
      <p>We have said, therefore, that Christ is truly present, finally that his true body is distributed to believers and that they eat and drink the true body and blood of the Lord. For Christ is that supreme and true priest, who alone acts here by his power. He promised to be with us, to distribute his body and blood to us as food for eternal life, and he declares the same by his own words, by which he explains how he distributes himself to us and how his flesh is eaten and thus enlivens believers: "The bread," he says, "which I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world" [John 6:51]. Therefore, he gives this bread to be eaten by us when he inwardly teaches us by his Spirit that by the sacrifice of his flesh we are delivered from the death of sins to life. For he is the bread of life and life-giving, who eternally satisfies, when we truly eat him, that is, truly recognize him by faith. Otherwise, the Savior cannot be recognized unless it is understood that he has satisfied for us. He could not satisfy if he could not suffer. But he could not suffer if he did not assume true flesh. Therefore, the bread gives us bread, that is, he himself, life-giving and satisfying the mind to eternal life, refreshes, liberates, absolves, and enlivens us, and that in this order: First, for our sake, he was incarnated and gave the assumed flesh to death for us, so that by the sacrifice of himself he might satisfy God the Father for our sins. Then he rises from the dead and ascends to heaven, so that we might clearly perceive that both the power of death and sin and the chain of damnation are broken, but life is restored. From here, he gives us faith, by which we trust in these things and receive and eat him distributing himself to us in this way.</p>
      <p>Therefore, by eating and consuming the body or flesh of the Lord, we can understand nothing else than that it is persuaded and firmly believed in the mind by the Spirit and faith that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was crucified for us and that by the sacrifice of his flesh, salvation has been obtained for us. This, however, is the food of the soul, not of the body, a life-giving food while it considers by faith this great benefit of the Lord, that he has redeemed us from eternal death and granted us eternal life. This food invigorates both for every function of piety and for eternal life. For who would not love him supremely or what would not a pious mind do or suffer for his sake, whom he sees has given himself entirely for him, has faced death for him, so that the faithful might live eternally? Therefore, this is to eat the flesh of Christ and to drink his blood: to be wholly seized and transformed into Christ, to give perpetual thanks to him, to die to him alone. In turn, in him who has embraced Christ with such love, Christ acts and lives, working and perfecting all things in him by his Spirit. This is to remain in Christ and to have Christ remaining in oneself.</p>
      <p>In summary: Christ distributes himself to us once when he delivered his body and blood to death for us. He distributes himself to us daily when he gives faith, so that we may eat and drink him. We truly eat his true body when we truly believe by faith that his true body was delivered for our salvation and his blood was shed for our cleansing. We do not acknowledge any other presence and distribution of the body and blood of Christ than true and spiritual, nor any other eating of the body of Christ than that which is done truly and by faith. And faith indeed is of true, not false things. And although the body and blood of Christ are always present to the faithful, even without the use of symbols, they are distributed and the pious feed on them, yet they are present, distributed, and eaten only by the same faith and not by any other means, even when they are celebrated in symbols. Not that the Lord instituted symbols in vain, but that these are useless to unbelievers without faith. What benefit they are to believers, what and how great they are, follows.</p>
      <p>For it is next to speak of the symbols, how they are testimonies of the divine promise and goodness and how they not only signify the benefits of God - I mean the very things - of which they are signs, but also in some way subject them to the senses and represent them.</p>
      <p>The supreme majesty of God, everywhere sympathizing with our weakness, clothes those divine things of his with certain coverings, both because divine things become more intelligible to us when exposed through human things, and because our industry is excited to the investigation and contemplation of divine things through visible and external things with a certain pious curiosity. Now among men, the delivery of anything seems more effective in some way when it is transacted not only with words but also with signs. This can indeed be seen in covenants, contracts, sales, and many other similar things. Therefore, Christ, wishing to lead his church into the contemplation of the benefits of God, especially his death, and furthermore to make it certain and undoubted that he delivered his body to be broken for the salvation of the faithful and his blood to be shed for our cleansing, did so by the sacrament of bread and wine. For when he said: "Take, eat [Mt 26:26]. This is my body, which is given for you [Lk 22:19]. Take and divide among yourselves [Lk 22:17]. This cup is the new testament in my blood [Lk 22:20; 1 Cor 11:25], which is shed for many for the remission of sins" [Mt 26:28] - it must indeed be true and firm what he said, that the body was given for us and the blood was shed for the remission of our sins -, to these is added the external and visible breaking of bread, the sensible pouring of wine. All these things prove to be true and firm, which the very words of the supper refer to and the faith itself of a pious mind recalls. Now even by sensible things, the saints are called to the consideration of invisible things. Therefore, what a pious mind sees happening in the bread and wine, it believes to have been done in the very body of Christ and the blood shed, namely that they were broken and shed. It also sees that these sacraments or signs have a certain kinship with the thing itself. For just as the human body is nourished and invigorated for its works by bread and wine especially, so the mind, which lives by faith in Christ and through Christ, is not otherwise preserved in life nor can it be invigorated for works of piety except through the very body and blood of the Lord, through the life-giving redemption and the Holy Spirit of Christ. Therefore, offering the bread, Christ says: "Take, eat [Mt 26:26]. This is my body, which is given for you" [Lk 22:19], as if he had already said: "As I offer you bread to be eaten by the mouth of the body, so I give my body to the mind to be eaten by the mouth of the mind and faith. This bread is a symbol or memorial of my body, and by it, I indicate to you the fruit of my death. For as the heart of man is strengthened by bread, so by the benefit of my death alone you will live eternally."</p>
      <p>Thus, I say, we acknowledge that the sacraments were instituted by God to be symbols, testimonies, and memorials of that illustrious grace, about which we spoke at length a little earlier. But that grace effectively nourishes inwardly through the Spirit and faith, works in the soul, makes the very things present spiritually, as the mind itself desires and can comprehend. The sacraments, however, are certain visible forms, which outwardly have the image of the thing that works inwardly through the Spirit, and now subject it to the senses in their own way.</p>
      <p>From these things, we gather and confess that unbelievers indeed participate in the sign, but not in the thing itself. For we know that he eats the bread of the Lord to death and judgment, who eats without faith. We know that he remains in Christ, who eats in faith. Judas did not remain in Christ and yet participated in the sacrament. Therefore, Paul rightly advised, saying: "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup" [1 Cor 11:28]. Therefore, not those who press with the tooth, but those who eat with the heart, eat the body of Christ, who understand the visible food spiritually, hunger spiritually, taste spiritually, are spiritually satisfied.</p>
      <p>We also gather that grace is not bound to the sacraments, nor are these as instruments and channels by which grace and therefore the very body of the Lord is infused even to the unbeliever. For the faith of the recipient is capable of grace and the body of Christ, not the circumscription of the sign. The Lord himself distributes himself to us. Faith receives and eats him. For to our one Savior belongs all things of salvation. He gives the Spirit, teaches, feeds, enlivens, and restores all things. No creature can do this. The minister recites the words of Christ. Nothing will be perceived from it, to whom faith and the Spirit of Christ are lacking. Where these are present, he will feel that the bread is the body of Christ, that is, that body of Christ is to him what bread is to the body, namely, a saving and true food of the soul.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we duly honor both the ministry of the word of God and the minister and the just administration of the sacraments. For we acknowledge that ministers are ministers of God, dispensers of the mysteries of God, co-workers of God. We receive them as Christ, we accept their word and ministry as the word and operation of God, which it is. Therefore, we will attentively and with pious minds receive all the words of Christ and the very words of the supper. Yet we will attribute all increase and all fruit to Christ alone, who certainly did not institute the sacraments in vain, even if one Spirit works all things. For by them, salvation given to us by God is proclaimed, the promises of God are pronounced with authority and some confirmation, they convert the senses from visible to invisible things, they exercise faith, which they also promise to the neighbor, and invite to mutual charity. And while all these things are done, one and the same Spirit works, who now draws without an instrument, now through an instrument, as much and how he wills. Thus, faith alone has the power of justifying, which we cannot attribute to symbols, which are testimonies of God's goodwill towards us.</p>
      <p>Again, since the sacraments are visible words, which teach sensibly, and even the name itself, of which they are symbols, they do not offend us when we hear the bread called the body of Christ. For circumcision is called a covenant, the lamb a passage, and even Paul himself calls the bread the body of Christ. We do not wish these expressions to be changed. But let them be explained by faith and in the manner of holy scripture, and they will have not a little grace and a splendid clarity. Nor do the pictorial and august expressions of the ancients offend us, by which they either represented the excellence of the thing or pressed adversaries and deniers of the flesh of Christ. It does not offend that Chrysostom says that he who is above in the heavens is ground by the hands of all and that our teeth are fixed in his flesh. This their times bore, perhaps even demanded. We rarely or never use them, as we must consider the state of our churches, for whose edification Paul wanted all things to be instituted. Therefore, we use clear, articulate, and simple words, which we know to be suitable to the matter, our church, and our times, and which we do not doubt are consistent with faith and consonant with the holy scriptures.</p>
      <p>From these, we think, a fair reader will gather that we do not assert that mere symbols are celebrated or that a feast day or supper is held without Christ the King. For Christ, our King and Priest, is present at our mysteries. He distributes himself to his own to be eaten, but in that way and by that reason by which the faithful soul desires and comprehends, and as the Lord himself said: "The flesh profits nothing. It is the Spirit that gives life. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life" [John 6:63]. Therefore, he is truly, but spiritually present and eaten, not carnally. Hence the supper is not any kind of prefiguration and representation, but a living and true memorial. Therefore, that our mystery is both tremendous and joyful, in which Christ himself, the consummator of all sacrifices, is present, the true priest and unique victim, the altar truly pleasing to God and the most certain propitiatory, the firstborn from the dead, the firstfruits of our resurrection and therefore of our mass. We hear his joyful voice proclaiming in our hearts: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him" [John 6:56]. For by a stupendous exchange, we are now joined to God through the flesh and blood of Christ, our head, by the power of the Spirit, through whom we are buried with Christ and made alive. We are bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh. For although we are subject to corruption because of the nature of our flesh, yet by participation in life, we are recalled from our weakness according to the property of that life and reformed to life when we eat by faith the flesh united to the eternal word and therefore life-giving, which is able to reform to immortality those who partake of it.</p>
      <p>We propose this assertion of ours to so many, lest any doubts delay anyone in our matters or some suspicion arises about us. We do not wish to peddle the word of God nor to use any evil deceit in the most sacred matter. Meanwhile, we are not of a gladiatorial mind towards anyone, but we avoid what opposes faith with sound reasons and scriptures. For we are servants of Christ, not of men, nor have we sworn to the words of any master. We follow, venerate, and respect canonical truth. We will remain in those things. We have hitherto delivered these things to our churches in good faith and with a sound conscience. The same was delivered before us by our predecessors, excellent men, of excellent mind in piety and letters. What they received with sincere and pure faith, we will not recant or change anything in these, except what scripture commands to change. Indeed, if Christ supplies strength, we will lay down our souls for the confessed truth. For with firm faith, we know that in this matter we confess what is conformable to the scriptures and what has always been catholic to the whole church.</p>
      <p>As for Luther and his followers, we exercise no enmity towards them, indeed we desire to have peace with them in truth and from the heart. We bear, as we have just said, the ancient fathers, who, discussing this sacred matter, used vehement expressions. But these, lest anyone stumble, immediately exposed themselves and in other places testified that they reject all carnal servitude here. Therefore, there will be no contention with Luther over words, provided he explains the insolent, obscure, or ambiguous words of our age, so that we may see in the matter itself - as you assert, Bucer; for we have not yet seen any writings of this man - that we agree, although we seem to differ in words. Therefore, let him explain that the flesh of Christ is eaten only by faith, that the body of Christ acts in some place of heaven circumspectively, although according to divinity he is everywhere with the Father, but in the sacred supper, he is present by the proper manner of the sacraments, which mode indeed makes things truly present, not carnally and so that they can be grasped by the senses, but spiritually, so that they are perceived only by faith. If, therefore, he explains himself in this way, it will indeed be permissible for him to use his own manner of speaking. For we also use our own, not foreign to the scriptures nor to the manner of speaking of the holy fathers. Certainly, in this depraved and perverse age, we must speak more circumspectly, lest we provide any handle for a new error. Meanwhile, we do not entirely shun those very forms of speaking, but we rightly bear them when explained by the rule of faith and truth. For we are not, as we seem, authors of seditions or disturbances, but as much as possible, we desire and have always desired to have peace with all who call upon the Lord from a pure heart. We also testify by the very coming of our Lord Jesus Christ that we do nothing in this cause through contention or vain glory, but all things soberly for the glory of the name of Christ and that the clear light of truth may be purely received and brought forth as simply as possible without any obscurity and ambiguity of words.</p>
      <p>We also give you, Bucer, dearest brother in the Lord, the authority to publish these things of ours, to print them, and furthermore to present them to Luther, Philipp [Melanchthon], Brenz, Osiander, Agricola, Schnepf, or anyone. And although we have no doubt about your faith, Bucer, we adjure you by the saving cross of the Lord Jesus Christ to publish and present these things of ours in these characters, notes, words, and sentences as you receive from us, and to have the truth commended to you in mending concord, lest it be endangered anywhere. We desire nothing as much as holy concord and confess that much praise is due to you in Christ if holy, just, and true concord is established under your auspices. In which we have now and always agreed on the conditions we have hitherto reviewed. If anything is lacking in these, let it be indicated in good faith with written reasons and scriptural authorities, by which these of ours seem to be opposed, and we will receive it with a most grateful mind. May the Lord Jesus have mercy on us and his church. Amen.</p>
