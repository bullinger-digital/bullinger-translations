    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Upon his arrival in Basel, Christoph Froschauer immediately handed over the letter addressed to Myconius as well as to Johannes Gast [No. 2850] to Myconius. While reading, Myconius was surprised that in the letter also addressed to him, Bullinger asked to show the letter to him, Myconius, whom he could not write to! This was just so Bullinger could also laugh about his forgetfulness! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] The Zurich students returning from Marburg [Fabricius Montanus, Karl Schweninger, Heinrich Hindermann, Hans Rudolf Funk, and perhaps Wilhelm Meyer] report nothing good about Landgrave Philipp of Hesse. However, it is likely that he is merely hiding his true intentions. Myconius continues to trust him, especially since he struck down one of his advisors after the advisor recommended seeking peace with Emperor Charles V. The Landgrave must therefore be a man of God who despises the peace offered by the Emperor! As an Augsburg [...] mentioned in his letter: "What kind of peace is it that is no peace at all?" No wonder that under such circumstances Wolfgang Musculus and others want to leave Augsburg. The Papists have won, while the much larger part has lost! The latter must now reap what they have sown! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] There is nothing but rumors about Strasbourg. One hopes to soon learn something verified. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] The Englishman [John Hooper] now coming to Zurich is recommended to the people of Zurich. Myconius does not know him well, but hopes that he will do justice to the great piety of his wife [Anne tâ€™Serclaes]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] The alliance that Bullinger wrote about on the back of his letter is only meant to deliver a proper blow to the Emperor and his motto "Always further," even if no progress for the Gospel is to be expected from it! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] What Myconius reported in his letter [No. 2855] about the four ships laden with gold and silver from "India" [America] must be corrected. The ships did not anchor in Antwerp, but in Spain, from where the merchants will gradually bring the money intended for the war against Germany to Antwerp. However, Myconius cannot quite believe this either, as the Emperor is known to be so stingy! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> [7] The people from Basel who went to Strasbourg have still not returned. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest8"> [8] Greetings, also to the whole family and to Rudolf Gwalther, to whom Myconius will write soon. </p>

      <p>S. It is surprising why you played such a trick in the letters sent through Froschauer. For when you addressed them to me and to Gast, and Froschauer immediately handed them to me, after I had finished reading, I found this: "show this to Myconius," and shortly after: "I would have gladly written to Myconius; I cannot." I began to laugh (as I immediately saw the error and lapse of memory), for you had forgotten that the letters were addressed to me! I wanted to point this out so that you too might laugh.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, those returning to you from Marburg do not speak favorably of Hesse. I am surprised, unless perhaps he does not want his intentions to be known. I have conceived a good hope about the prince from the beginning, so I do not easily believe bad things about him. It reassures me that when he asked for the opinions of his advisors on what they thought he should do in these troubles, and one of them advised making peace with the Emperor, he struck him down with his fists. For he seems to me a man of God, who abhors the kind of peace that the Emperor offers. I therefore agree not easily with the Augsburg man who wrote: "Oh peace, not peace, but the parent of many calamities!" It is no wonder, then, if Musculus and others threaten to leave. But the Papists have won, and the much larger part has been defeated! Let them bear what they have willingly, indeed without anyone asking, accepted.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have not yet received anything about the people of Strasbourg except rumors, but they are clearly false. I expect the truth any day now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Have the Englishman who comes to you recommended. For he has the appearance of piety and sound doctrine; therefore, I consider him worthy of being well-treated by you. His wife is very pious. I wish, therefore, that her husband would be entirely corresponding; I say this for no other reason than that I have not contracted familiarity with him for so many days, from which I could fully know the man's character.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The alliance you wrote about on the back of your letters, if only it were struck! Not that I so favor alliances for the Gospel, but so that Charles would have those whom he would be forced to fear, if perhaps that "Always further" would ever fall.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I did not write correctly about the four ships. Ships came from some unknown part of India (America), laden with gold and silver, to Spain, and from Spain, they are gradually imported by merchants to Antwerp to the detriment of Germany. However, it remains doubtful if this is so, due to the Emperor's unimaginable greed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Those who left here for Strasbourg have not yet returned. Therefore, I still do not know what the matter is. I have nothing more.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family and Gwalther, to whom I will write as soon as there is leisure. Basel, March 24, 1547. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of Zurich, his venerable brother and lord. Zurich.</p>
