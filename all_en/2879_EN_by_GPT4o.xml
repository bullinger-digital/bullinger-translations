      <p>Greetings. I received your letters through Johann Thomas from your area, and I have sent those concerning Erb from Richenwyl, the pastor, through the bearer of this letter. However, I have retained the booklets and letters for Charles de Moulin, as I recently learned from Mr. Vergerio that he is being held in custody separately in a certain fortress by Count Georg. Although I do not know the reason for this, there are things I suspect, and for this reason, I am deeply saddened. We are expecting the former governor of the city of Montbéliard, a very pious man and advisor to the prince, from whom I might learn about the current state of de Moulin and, if it is convenient, I will send both the booklets and letters through him, whom I know will either not accept them or, if he does, will take care of them with utmost fidelity. I have nothing new except that Ferdinand is again reported to have suspended the latest and cruel edict against the professors of the gospel until the end of the upcoming assembly, because he was moved and overcome by the tearful and most urgent supplication of the delegation, which consisted of 40 most noble men, or rather by the difficulty of these times, and thus he has restrained his previously conceived fury. But some also write that Maximilian's preacher is still teaching, alternating with a Jesuit, in the presence of both kings and the entire court of both.</p>
      <p>The Jesuit breathes murder and blood according to the nature of his deity, while the other presses the word of Christ with remarkable skill and gentleness, not without the illustrious applause of all the pious and the gathering of the common people. It is said that the people of Magdeburg are not yet sufficiently reconciled with their adversaries, the archbishop and the two electors, but they have been released by the enemies because Heinrich of Brunswick voluntarily promised his assistance to the city, evidently fearing that if they were subdued, he would have danger at his doorstep. Otto Heinrich has succeeded Friedrich in the electorate, under whose governance all the pious hope that the kingdom of Christ will be greatly increased; the prince indeed seems to be endowed with an uncommon zeal for God, of which he has always given extraordinary examples. It would only be desirable that he had a more accurate account of expenditures.</p>
      <p>It is reported that our people in Zug have raged against their pastor and the biblical and evangelical books. Since you are aware of these matters, I ask you to write to me at the next opportunity. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all your people.</p>
      <p>Basel, the day before the calends of April, in the year 1556. Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
