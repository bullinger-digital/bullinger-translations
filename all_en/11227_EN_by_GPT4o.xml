    <p xml:id="regest1">The wagoner who is transporting the belongings of Melchior [Wirz] is delivering the desired books to him; Vives’ “De anima” will be delivered to him via [Johannes] Fries and costs 4 Batzen. [Thomas] Platter did not find [Bullinger’s “The Old Faith”?] in Frankfurt, and Gwalther has not yet been able to ask [Hans Heinrich] Winkeli about it. According to [Johann] Bebel, the Latin Aristotle costs two Gulden. If Grynäus does not lecture on Cicero’s speeches as promised, Gwalther will receive private lessons from Otto [Werdmüller]; he therefore requests that the works of Cicero be sent to him. Refers to the letter delivered by Butler [No. 1183]. Beat [Gering] sends his regards; he has been constantly associating with Bucer and Capito, who appeared at Grynäus’ wedding these days. Further regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The wagoner came to me in Basel on the fourth of October, who is to transport Melchior's belongings, and with this very convenient opportunity presented, I decided to send the books you requested from me to you, esteemed patron. However, when I spoke with Oporinus, who printed Ludovicus' "De anima," he said he would send the same book to Fries; therefore, he thought it best to also include your copy and place it in Melchior's barrel. You will receive this book from our Fries, the price of which, as Oporinus says, is four Constance Batzen (a type of coin).</p>
      <p>Our Platter could not obtain any copy of your book in Frankfurt; however, when I wanted to approach Winkeli himself about this, I did not find him at home.</p>
      <p>For he had ordered them to be brought to him from Frankfurt. Now, since I have not received any response from him, I cannot write anything certain to you about these matters. You will have these through the next messenger, as I hope.</p>
      <p>I spoke with Bebel on your behalf, who said that the Latin works of Aristotle cost two florins.</p>
      <p>Simon Grynaeus promises to lecture on Cicero's speeches; but if he does not fulfill this promise, our Otto offers to teach me privately. Therefore, I ask you to hand over the works of Cicero to this wagoner who is carrying these letters, as he will return to us in the coming days, so that he may bring them to me.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more now. I assume you have been informed about other matters through the letters delivered by Mr. Butler.</p>
      <p>Our Beat sends his regards, who for some unknown reason has always been in the company of either Bucer or Capito these days; for they appeared at Grynaeus' wedding. Please convey my regards to your wife and mother, the most honorable matrons, and the entire family.</p>
      <p>In Basel, from the house of Mr. Miconius, on the 4th of October, in the dead of night, 1538. Rudolf Gwalther, your most loving.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich, his dear lord. To the distinguished in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his patron and most esteemed teacher.</p>
