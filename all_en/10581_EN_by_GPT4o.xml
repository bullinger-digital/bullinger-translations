    <p xml:id="regest1">Fears that the Germans have nothing good to expect from the French king. Let Gregor Mangold send his preface to Zwingli's "Opus articulorum" and Christoph [Froschauer] his commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. Can hardly believe that the proponents of the theological doctorate seriously refer to Paul.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have always feared, my dear Myconius, that the Frenchman would bring great harm to Germany. He is impious, a devourer of kingdoms, cruel and bloodthirsty, and he does not love the Germans except for his own private gain. He knows that the primary glory of the infantry is owed to the Germans. Therefore, he loves them, so that he may slaughter or deliver others to death and seize kingdoms. But you will see, I hope, the mighty hand of the Lord. For there is no other king alive today who has shed more Christian blood. Perhaps the rumors that are spread are unfounded; perhaps it is better for the French and the Spanish to agree than it is beneficial for us. But let the will of the Lord be done.</p>
      <p>The apology I wrote for Zwingli, I entrusted to Gregor Mangold to deliver to you, and he surely gave it, I think, the preface which I prefixed to the "Opus articulorum" of Zwingli. Now I have ordered Christoph [Froschauer] to deliver our Commentaries on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians.</p>
      <p>I am more amazed than I can easily express, whether some play with sacred matters or act seriously, when they say that Paul in the Epistle to the Corinthians and Ephesians speaks of scholastic doctors, when it is certain that Paul never even dreamed of such a thing.</p>
      <p>Our enemies of piety would rightly accuse us of subjecting scripture to our own whims, as if we were twisting it like a waxen nose in every direction. We will someday feel what this pursuit of pride and pomp will bring forth. It would befit us to be humble professors of Christ, imitators of the apostles of Christ. We prefer the philosophical demeanor and arrogance. But more on these matters another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell now and love us, as you always do.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 5, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant Antistes of the people of Basel, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
