      <p>Greetings. In the absence of Mr. Haller, my dearest godfather in the Lord, your Caleb, truly in name and in reality a wise young man, has happily entered the land promised to all the chosen and faithful. I advised Burckhard to take some time off for the sake of refreshing his spirit while studies are on break; however, he wanted to show what the fearless spirit can do more than the weakness of the flesh.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I beg you not to take it badly that I write less frequently. I am very different from who I was a few years ago, if you consider my diligence in writing; I, who was once a prolific writer, am now a keeper of silence and peace. I believe that with your wisdom, you understand well enough what the nature of old age is... As for the current movements, I finally received letters from my people in Augsburg yesterday. I lack a scribe; otherwise, I would write by the hand of others, which I neither like nor have time for, especially with other labors that I delight in, and due to the sadness of spirit, which I am forced to feel day and night because of public dangers. However, Mr. Haller, since he has companions whose help he can use, can remedy whatever inconvenience this is, to whom I also usually communicate what is conveyed to me. We must pray to the Lord to restrain these very serious and truly dangerous movements for the refreshment of His church. Farewell very well, my dearest godfather. Greetings to your family, friends, and all brothers. Bern, 22nd of September, 1552.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your godfather in the Lord. To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the church in Zürich, my dearest godfather in the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
