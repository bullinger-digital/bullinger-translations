      <p>Krak√≥w, March 1, 1558.</p>
      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Not long ago, I sent you a letter from here, dear friend and esteemed master Bullinger, to which I attached others for Mr. Jakob Zwick and my wife.</p>
      <p>If they have not reached your hands, they could be requested from Mr. Johann Lyner of St. Gallen; for I sent them to him. Now, since there was no opportunity to write, our mutual friend Mr. Utenhovius came and urged me to write as he had the right to do. He, along with Mr. a Lasco, passed through here on their way to Prussia, and due to haste, he had no time left to write. Peter Paul Vergerius, if only he were truly either Peter or Paul! He has written serious accusations against Mr. a Lasco and Utenhovius to many of the Polish nobility.</p>
      <p>They are accused by him of having written about themselves and their future mission to Poland in a manner that was neither candid nor Christian, according to your humanity. And he is not content with having written these things privately to the nobles, but also threatens to publish an apology of his innocence. And because the holy and pious men see a great disturbance arising in the Polish churches, they desire this to be calmed and settled by the counsel, authority, and industry of the people of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you should, with your vigilance and skill, ensure that he refrains from his apology. He should not only be advised to desist from this, but also be persuaded to remain at home and lead the churches entrusted to him away from the worse Lutheran doctrine to the true and perfect knowledge and confession of both natures in Christ. For to abandon his certain and manifest calling and to seek a worldly mission, which could be harmful to sound doctrine, is certainly not the act of a Christian man.</p>
      <p>God sent him among the Lutherans to convince them of their error; not to agree with their errors or to introduce them into well-established churches. He promised the entire church that he would not introduce the Augsburg Confession; but I hear he is planning something worse under a changed name, namely the Waldensian doctrine corrupted by Luther. Poland does not need a similar mission from him or anyone else.</p>
      <p>By the grace of God, the churches are well and Christianly established, and I see no one here who has a taste for Lutheranism.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it will be your duty to admonish the man to desist from both the apology and the mission: for I greatly fear that he is preparing for himself an indelible infamy and eternal damnation, unless he repents. But since he may have taken the occasion for his apology from the letters written to you by Mr. Utenhovius, he requests and beseeches you to kindly have a faithful copy made of everything that was written about Vergerius and sent to him: for he does not believe he wrote anything worthy of a public apology. My affairs are in the same state as before.</p>
      <p>For although there are some who desire the art, I am afraid to reveal it before I have received a privilege. I judge that there is no other cause for delay than that I do not have the means to reward my labors. And certainly, nothing has harmed or will harm our business more than that I do not have what to repay and what to give to the parasites. Without a gift, the affairs of everyone at the prince's court are cold.</p>
      <p>And I fear that in the end, poverty may force me to return with the matter unfinished, which your humanity could indicate to Mr. Jakob Zwick; so that he may know how impossible it is to bring a matter of such importance to an end with such small expenses. I commend my wife to your humanity, and I pray that you may continue to support her with that paternal love with which you have embraced us in our less favorable affairs until now. I know my long absence saddens her; but let her console herself: I hope everything will turn out for the glory of God, if not, for our benefit. I will perform the duty of a faithful husband: let her not forget the duty of a wife and a good housewife. Remind Johann Billinger of the promise he made to your humanity.</p>
      <p>He has promised me loyalty, let him prove it to himself and to me. This will not happen unless he abstains from drunkenness and bad company, and learns to live frugally while away. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours as you know, J. B.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, my gracious master.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
