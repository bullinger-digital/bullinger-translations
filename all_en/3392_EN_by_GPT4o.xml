      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>I would commend these two young men to your kindness, most humane Bullinger, if I did not know that all pious and studious individuals are otherwise most commendable to you. Until now, they have diligently applied themselves to good letters in Strasbourg, not without progress; now it has seemed good to the school authorities that they should go to Zürich to devote themselves to theology. May the Lord grant them the increase of His spirit in their holy studies.</p>
      <p>We would not want them to be imbued with the confused doctrine of Marbach and his ilk, having learned from our own peril. By God's grace, sacred matters are handled rightly among you, and there is no danger that they will be infected with any perverse and contentious doctrine there. I am sure you will all ensure that they do not, corrupted by the allurements of youth, disappoint our expectations of them. A new rumor is spreading among us that the Scots have invaded England with great force and attacked the kingdom's most fortified city after London, and that Philip has been compelled to hasten his journey to England, leaving a garrison of ten thousand soldiers at Saint-Quentin and five thousand in another town, to meet his kingdom's needs in time.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman is said to be advancing with a force of 30,000 soldiers towards the city of Arras, relying on the great hope that he can repair the loss he suffered in that miserable conflict. The outcome is the Lord's.</p>
      <p>May the Lord scatter the counsel of Ahithophel and may He alone reign forever. Amen. My fellow ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>I wish Theodore, Martyr, Gwalther, and all to be well. Schaffhausen, November 3, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and esteemed brother.</p>
