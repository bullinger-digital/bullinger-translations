      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have nothing new at this time to write or send to you. Our Panthaleon will be disputing the questions of Borrhai in these days, so that he may more easily attain the title of doctor, which he has long desired; for he is a slave to glory. However, I have not yet examined what kind of questions they are; if I knew it would be pleasing to you, I would have sent them.</p>
      <p>I recently also sent letters to you, which are being delivered by Mr. Johannes Thomas Hausierus from Magdeburg, a delegate sent by the city to the Swiss churches to collect aid; you can better understand this matter from him. Everything is peaceful with us, although the plague still troubles us a little.</p>
      <p>If you have not yet received the dialogue of the Council of Trent, write back, and I will send it, so that you may read what those bishops, who are now acting in Trent, are instituting, and so that you may know the names of those who wish to be the pillars of all churches. They do not want to dispute with heretics, but to admonish them to return to the church, etc.</p>
      <p>Homilies of Chrysostom have been found in Greek, never before seen, which Oporinus has under the press, and I will make you a participant in them. Farewell and continue to love Gastius. Basel, February 4, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>The preachers of Augsburg have lost all grace in preaching. At first, they were flattering; but since they direct their sermons according to the prescribed Interim, the people are beginning to recognize the old papism. Therefore, they have few listeners; the faithful remain at home. Everything there points to sedition. May the Lord protect his own from all heresy.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
