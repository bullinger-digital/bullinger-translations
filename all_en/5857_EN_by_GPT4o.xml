      <p>S. D. In my recent letters, I informed your piety about the efforts and books of Brentius and his duke sent to France.</p>
      <p>Now I am very anxious for the brothers in France, lest anything adverse happens to them; for in Lucerne, in our vicinity, new soldiers are being recruited to be led into France.</p>
      <p>Many fear a massacre is being prepared for the faithful; many say the Franco-English war is flaring up again.</p>
      <p>There are those who say the king is coming to Lyon.</p>
      <p>I can neither think nor say what it is; I only warn in advance that soldiers are being recruited in Lucerne.</p>
      <p>For your vigilance, ensure that the leading men in France and those who need to know this do not remain ignorant of it.</p>
      <p>If I am anxious in vain, forgive me for this; I certainly love the churches of France and will not cease to warn them, I will love them forever.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 27, 1563.</p>
      <p>Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The brothers and all the colleagues greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Beza, Mr. Jonville, and the others.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful minister of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
