      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed brother and friend.</p>
      <p>Greetings. The scarcity of news makes me slower to write. For I am reluctant to send letters that would lose their charm due to age before they reach you. Now, since our Beza has promised to ensure that my letters reach you quickly, I did not want to neglect the duty in which I confess I have been too remiss.</p>
      <p>I do not know what is happening in England. The new alliance with the French does not promise as much good to me as many expect for themselves.</p>
      <p>Would that it at least somewhat mitigated the rage of his father-in-law. For atrocious edicts have been published by which the perpetual state of the kingdom is shaken so that new ways to rage against the pious are opened.</p>
      <p>What has hitherto been granted to sorcerers, forgers, and robbers, and is still granted, that they have the right to appeal to the supreme courts, this is taken away from Christians, who are ordered by ordinary judges to be dragged to the fire without appeal.</p>
      <p>Relatives of those who are in danger of their lives are forbidden to dare to intercede unless they want to be considered supporters of heretics.</p>
      <p>To ensure that there are no lack of incentives for the fires, a third part of the goods is assigned to the accusers. If any judges seem too lenient, punishment is demanded from them. It is provided that the chancellor of the kingdom does not admit to public offices those who have ever been tainted with even the slightest suspicion, and that no one hereafter occupies a place in the courts unless he is hostile to Christ. Whoever aspires to a public office is ordered to offer testimonies from many by which they prove themselves obedient sons of the Roman church. If anyone deceives, punishment is imposed on the recommenders. Punishment is also decreed for cities that have elected teachers by vote who are even minimally suspected of Lutheran doctrine. The supreme courts are imposed with a law, if any counselors are seen to favor our doctrine, that they must clear themselves by oath. All are ordered to worship God the healer more intently than usual on bended knees. Parish priests are commanded to read the Sorbonne articles to the people from the pulpit every Sunday, so that the solemn denial of Christ resounds everywhere.</p>
      <p>The goods of all who have migrated to us are adjudged to the treasury, even if sold before departure or alienated in any way, unless the judges recognize that they were sold with the intention conceived before the crime. Geneva is mentioned there more than ten times, always with notable disgrace added. But at the same time, all places are added in which a departure from the Roman seat has been made.</p>
      <p>This cruelty must necessarily be followed by the gravest disturbance. And already fires are kindled everywhere, and all roads are besieged so that no one may flee to this asylum. If any means appeared to relieve the wretched brothers, labor should not be spared. And I would have already set out there to take counsel, if the way had not been closed at this time by the prayers of your people. Nevertheless, I implore you in the name of Christ to diligently look around at everything. But from those who sit so securely in their own danger, I do not see what remedy can be hoped for. What is this monstrosity? The sword is sharpened to slaughter us, and we flee consultation, brothers with brothers. However, it is fitting for us to accustom ourselves with these lessons to fix our eyes on heaven. How I fear that we will soon pay greater penalties for this our torpor than would be desirable.</p>
      <p>Nor indeed do I wonder that they are so slow in repressing the enemy's assault when they cherish in their very bosom the rascals by whom the church is torn and lacerated and exposed to the mockery of the enemies. There is a certain Dominican who emerged from his own filth with bad omens as a minister of the word in a neighboring village. He shouted before the assembly of judges that he had a disagreement with me and with the church of Geneva: and he did this without any provocation. Not content with that, he produced a paper filled with foul insults, where he attacked me more than twenty times in a hostile manner. Having learned of this, he was sent back home. Now, emboldened by impunity, he insults me no less fiercely than any satellite of the Council of Trent. This is the communion of the church which we profess daily. I omit other no less unworthy things which I swallow not without sorrow. Although I am not so much moved for my own sake as for the public, because I see that such a confused and Christ-alienated dissipation cannot stand for long.</p>
      <p>Farewell, best and most esteemed brother. May the Lord always guide you all, bless your pious endeavors, and keep you safe with His protection. Geneva, on the Ides of October, 1551. Greet diligently in my name Mr. Theodor, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalther, and the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
