    <p xml:id="regest1">The Zurichers are informed of the content of a letter from Simon Grynäus from Württemberg addressed to the Basel theologians. He expressed pessimism about the effects of the Württemberg Eucharistic Concord, which was only achieved through vague formulations, mainly due to his personal negotiations with Erhard Schnepf. In his opinion, a separate joint confession of the Swiss churches should be drafted by Bullinger as soon as possible to have a solid basis for negotiations. The Baselers have already written to Bern and now ask the Zurichers to write to Schaffhausen. A meeting could take place in Aarau or perhaps even just by correspondence, as time is pressing. The Baselers do not see what new could be said anyway. They have signed the Zurich confession [No. 482]; if the Bernese also agree, it could be sent to Grynäus immediately. The Swiss should not sign the Württemberg Eucharistic Concord for reasons of conscience. They ask the Zurich pastors to consider the matter carefully and also to consult with trustworthy councilors.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace.</p>
      <p>We are sending you the summary of the letter from Mr. Grynäus to us, so that you may consider what needs to be done. He writes in despair regarding the matter of the Eucharist. While we believe that we truly and effectively partake of the body of the Lord through faith, there are those who claim that by the power of the Lord's words, the natural body is given and received even by unbelievers, either through the ministry of the priest or the exhibition of Christ. Therefore, as far as concord is concerned, it is nothing but deceit. You know, brothers, what the words of the confession are. What do they have other than a deceptive appearance? We confess to both sides, and neither side departs from its opinion in the meantime. Such concord is sought by those who are tasked with resolving the matter. They think something should be allowed for the sake of peace, even if it is unjust. Some Lutherans think we lack something that needs to be mended. They say we are compelled to confess the presence of Christ in the supper. In the meantime, we use some kind of perplexity. Therefore, it is necessary for each church to state its opinion before entering into a colloquy. This is the advice of all. Grynäus does not see any solid foundation here, and if there is any, it is none other than Luther's, to which he has not been able to consent so far. Concord will therefore be without foundation. Meanwhile, it proceeds as far as can be understood. Grynäus allows that essentially in the supper, the body of Christ is in the faithful, and likewise, the essence of the body of Christ is received by the faithful, but only by their own, with the declaration that this reception is by faith alone, etc. However, this confession does not satisfy Schnepf and, presumably, Luther. For besides this eating, Schnepf says that by the power of Christ's words, the natural and substantial body is received supernaturally and miraculously. I would like to write down Grynäus's words here: "I have rejected this and cannot yet accept it, and I know that if I must go to the concord, I will be cursed by everyone, for I will have to be the only devil in hell, the peacebreaker and tearer. I wish that the Lord would graciously lift me out of the game now, so that I may not waste the truth with you or bring any harm to peace." Moreover, he thinks this is the means by which God will punish the sins of Germany and ingratitude over the sent gospel.</p>
      <p>The meeting will be around Christmas. Here are his words:</p>
      <p>"Create a confession in which, as much as possible, the love of peace and truth is preserved, so that no one can justly complain about us. Do this as soon as possible through Bullinger, but let Bern, Schaffhausen, etc. be involved." We have written to the people of Bern - you will write to the people of Schaffhausen as they are nearby - we have allowed them to arrange a meeting in Aarau or to conduct it by letters. We give you the same. The time is short. We will hardly be able to meet, and after we have met, I do not know what else we can decide than what we have been able to so far. It will not be permissible to depart from the truth taught for the sake of truth itself and for the sake of our people. For what kind of concord would it be if we were to prepare discord among our own members? Although we have written to the people of Bern that we are pleased with the meeting. Let them only inform us and you in time whether it seems appropriate. We have subscribed to your confession. If we knew the same was done by the people of Bern, it would be easy for us to decide that this confession should be sent to Mr. Grynäus, before he leaves Württemberg, so that he may take it with him. The rest would be entrusted to God, unless you have another plan. Briefly, this comes into consultation, after it is certain that concord is necessary, what kind of concord should be accepted, since it cannot be solid for the above reasons, unless God softens those hearts harder than iron. For if we consent to the Württemberg confession, we will harm our consciences, we will harm our people in many ways, not without great damage to the word. What kind of people we would be towards God, everyone understands. But if we think otherwise, the people, already wonderfully fatigued from contention, will lack the strength. About this matter, Grynäus says: "The great, unspeakable, cruel scandal is coming; the people have already become tired of such a long dispute, they will and want to listen no more, but each goes his own way in his heart, will not let himself be called back, only, we grasp the matter with the earnestness of our hearts," etc. Therefore, you will weigh the matter diligently and not without invoking God. This time seems to us to be the one in which the truth of God, which he has truly granted, will be established or completely taken away because of our ingratitude. May God send his spirit, so that we may see and choose what is most holy. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 18, 1534.</p>
      <p>It seems advisable that you handle this not without your trusted senators, if there are any to be trusted. For this matter does not concern many at this time. We ask you to be watchful through God.</p>
      <p>Your brothers in Basel.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger and the other brothers in Zurich proclaiming Christ, their dearest brothers in the Lord.</p>
