      <p>Greetings. At the same hour that I recently received your letter, I replied; but when I wanted to deliver the letters, which I enclose here, to the courier at the inn, he had already departed. Meanwhile, we received news from Herpipolis that Maurice died on the third day after the battle from a cannonball wound, because his bladder was also injured, and it is testified that he ended his life with a most Christian end, having declared that he was involved in this war not for any private gain, but for the public good. Also, Heidecker is still alive, and numerous banners of the margrave's army have been captured, with Albert having escaped from their hands once and again, who now announces an exchange of prisoners with Heinrich of Brunswick and restores his forces as much as he can, so it seems he will attempt the matter with new efforts. Moreover, his plans were discovered from intercepted chests, which contained his secrets, and thus these were communicated to the Emperor and Ferdinand through dispatched horses. If this is true, I fear that this past disaster was only the prelude to more serious evils, and I am very suspicious of the doctors who are called to heal the paroxysm. These things, my brother, I did not want to hide from you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the one who brings this is an Italian man, as those who know him testify, a holy man and from a family not moderately oppressed, whose son we would certainly have received, if not only all the places for stipendiaries were full, but we were also overwhelmed with extraordinary ones. Therefore, we provided him with travel funds as he prepares to return to Italy. If you would assist the needy, you know from whom you will receive your reward. Farewell. Basel, August 3, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Greet all your people.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
