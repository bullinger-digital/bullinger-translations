      <p>S. I am greatly impressed by these young men from your region, who are distinguished by their liberal education and endowed with singular sweetness of character and piety, whom I would commend to you alone, were it not like commending you to yourself. The Diet of Augsburg still seems to have a contest among the princes for religious freedom, while the clergy are pressing for the peace of the empire; however, there are those who affirm that the princes will obtain what they desire, although a certain prominent figure dared to say: "One is not obliged to uphold the Passau agreement; for it was not established through the ordinary way, but was forced with violence and the sword." From this very pact, however, the princes of Saxony, Brandenburg, Hesse, and the Palatinate insist that an equal number of assessors from the Augsburg Confession be appointed to the Imperial Chamber; for this they strive through a delegation from the Emperor on one side, and the Diet on the other. It is said that Heinrich of Brunswick openly aspires to the Electorate of Saxony, as it was long promised to him by the Emperor and Ferdinand, so that there is no lack of material for internal conflicts. The Cardinal Bishop of Augsburg, on the Lord's day, among other absurdities, also spewed forth this from the pulpit: "The wretched and blinded Lutherans perpetually object to us that nothing should be added to or taken away from the word of God, understanding that these things were said to the Jews, not to us.</p>
      <p>We, we are the Church of Christ, and he who despises us, despises Christ, and he who does not listen to us is to be considered a heretic." And he finally concluded that ecclesiastical traditions are to be preferred far above the word of God, because they give their strength and authority to the Gospel, not the other way around. A bishop truly worthy to be adorned with a triple hat, so that the lid would have a fitting and decent pan.</p>
      <p>He quickly departed with the papal legate Morone to Rome, so that in the place of the deceased pontiff, they might substitute a creature similar to themselves, formed by them. There is a rumor that the ruler in Pern has defected from the Emperor, from which a huge amount of money has so far gone to the Emperor for the strength of war, and also that Valencia in Lower Germany has been captured by the French; but these are carried by uncertain rumors, and yet I did not want to conceal even this from you, my esteemed Bullinger. Farewell. Basel. April 16th, in the year 55.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
