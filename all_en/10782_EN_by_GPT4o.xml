    <p xml:id="regest1">In place of the ill Berchtold [Haller], answers Bullinger's question about the state of Bernese affairs. The Bernese army has broken 25 castles on its advance and settled in Geneva for two days, where nobles from the surrounding area have presented themselves for homage. The Genevans have not yet taken a position on the demand for the transfer of sovereignty rights [of Savoy] to Bern. The army is now advancing on Chambéry, where the surprised enemy is said to have retreated. The discipline of the Bernese earns them respect even among their opponents, and their success has led to a change of heart among previously resistant neighbors, as Freiburg hopes to gain Vevey and Romont, and Solothurn would also gladly be part of the victory. Other states, like Zurich, have offered help, but there is no need for it. From Sion, 6000 Valaisans have advanced into Savoy, and Bern, despite reservations, has accepted the offer of a joint campaign; this can no longer be dismissed by the opponents as a purely Protestant matter. There is hardly any threat, as Duke [Charles III] is in great distress and [Emperor Charles V] must be on guard against [King Francis I]; an imperial envoy from Milan [Giovanni Matteo Longo] received assurances from Bern in this regard. There is good hope for the progress of the Gospel, as long as no arrogance arises. Sulzer is pleased about the [Basel] Synod, which bears much fruit in Bern. He asks to comfort Berchtold [Haller], whose condition is hopeless. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Although I may perhaps be an untimely interrupter of your occupations, dearest Bullinger, yet that remarkable love of yours towards our Berchtold and also towards me compels me to address you with my letters from time to time, especially since our mutual friend, as I fear, will henceforth be unable to write, from whom in your last letters you so ardently desired to be informed about the state of our affairs. Therefore, taking this torch from him, I have decided to make every effort, if not with great gravity and erudition, at least with the utmost fidelity, to make known to you everything that is known to me, whom it is expedient to be informed of our affairs and who, for the sake of our peculiar cause, I do not doubt will be troubled for the singular zeal in the church of God, being also certainly persuaded that you will consider favorably and kindly what proceeds from your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Therefore, concerning our army, understand thus: namely, it has so far advanced steadily, capturing and burning more or less 25 fortresses, one of which, the notable predatory one named Bine, was occupied by the Genevans themselves, which was spared, and some other more illustrious ones, which our senate has decreed to be completely demolished. Our forces stayed in Geneva for two days to hear the nobles and counts everywhere, many of whom surrendered themselves as supplicants to our forces. Meanwhile, our forces requested from the Genevans the transfer of the vidomnat and bishopric to them, as those who have won it with the sword. I have not yet learned their response, as the Genevans have taken time for deliberation. The camp, however, has moved towards Chambéry, the city and palatine court of the ruler, to seek out the enemy directly, who is rumored to be lurking there, although you will find many who think no one will oppose them, so greatly is the enemy leader dismayed and cast down, and so devoid of counsel, since nothing has ever happened to him so beyond all hope and expectation as this war, plainly thinking that, struck by the recent disastrous defeat, they will dare nothing hostile against him, and would that he were not confirmed in this opinion by his supporters, whom he has here - he has them excellently "acting like Allobroges"! And indeed, as you know, such was the state of affairs, such great threats from all sides, that the senate, deterred by the inconvenience or even impossibility of the matter, openly declared that it would rather admit anything than war, until partly overcome by the lies, perjuries, and fraud of the enemies, partly by the pity for the oppressed, and finally also by the imminent danger to themselves, they were driven into the sudden fervor of war as if inspired by some divine power, so much so that it is evident from this that the hearts of the rulers are in the hand of the Lord. Therefore, with the same alacrity with which the war was decreed, it is being conducted with the utmost concord and piety, which indeed can exist in the camp, continuing among themselves. There are no games, no harlots, no plundering, no cruelty, so that they have not even touched a villa, although at the mere rumor of war the wretched feared everything would be devastated by fire and plundering. And the fame of this clemency not only conciliates the Savoyard populace to our forces but also strikes the adversaries, who now conjecture the outcome of the war from the least inauspicious signs. This is the reason why our neighbors everywhere, who had left nothing undone to terrify us, have lowered their crests. For the Fribourgers had signified at the outbreak of the war by letters that if anyone, not only of their own dominion but also acting elsewhere in their pay, were harmed, we should see that they would take it in the highest displeasure. This insane writing was received with laughter by our forces and answered with few words. These, I say, so fierce, now treat our people, if they have any business there, with benefits. Indeed, they also quarrel among themselves and contend with words, accusing the authors of surrendering the city to the Genevans as the cause of the greatest inconvenience. It would have been very convenient for them to meet in Vevey and Romont. But the Solothurners also marvel at nothing more and even grieve that they were not called into the alliance of this war. So easily are minds changed even with moderate fortune. Furthermore, we rejoice that some Swiss cantons, along with yours, have offered their assistance, should the matter require it, as a sign of excellent goodwill and a mind not at all alienated. But as far as this war is concerned, we hope there are enough forces, even if we had to engage with a more powerful prince. For it is a just, not a tumultuous army, having the most select men, "branches of Ares," who will undoubtedly report victory, unless the Lord intends to chastise us again with His rod, whom we nevertheless confidently trust will regard us mercifully, not indeed for our merits, but for the glory of His name. Therefore, my patron Bullinger, I bid you be of good cheer and to hope well, not only considering the hope itself but also the cause of the hope.</p>
      <p>Moreover, which I almost passed over, the people of Sion have recently taken up arms and with an army of six thousand have made an incursion into the territories of Savoy across the lake, namely to occupy there what has not yet surrendered to our forces (for our army has only crossed to the further part of the lake and occupied what was encountered). Therefore, having sent letters and envoys to our forces, they solemnly testified that they had come not as adversaries but as friends and allies in the war; they would share their leaders, whom they have as men not entirely impious, with our forces, since they have undertaken to avenge the injury received from the Savoyards for the money taken by force, which they had sent for buying salt, and the merchants killed, only praying that we do not oppose them, as they will do everything without fraud and deceit. When these matters were reported to our senate, although they understood that they were driven not so much by any just cause or hatred against Savoy as by the desire to extend their dominion, they nevertheless decided that they should be treated amicably and not be rejected, although in the meantime they do not join their army with ours, which is advancing to its destination. What land they further gain, they intend to share with my lords and the Valaisans. Therefore, since it has come to arms, I do not indeed fear them even for this reason, that if either the emperor has threatened anything or any other prince is preparing for revenge, he may understand that even men of the opposing religion have come into the alliance of the war and that we can be distinguished the less, but if any greater burden of war appears, the whole of Switzerland will rush to arms. Although they think there will be no adversary in this matter, as long as nothing else is sought than solid peace for the Genevans, even those who come from there think. For the Duke, entangled in a very serious illness, is struggling in extremis, his son having recently died at the emperor's court, and he, in whom he most trusted, is involved in other dangers impending from his brother-in-law. To prevent us from joining him, he sent his envoy, the Duke of Milan, to inquire what our forces are planning and intending; for it seems that this expedition is not only undertaken to aid the Genevans but is also planning a greater war on this occasion and perhaps will advance into foreign regions with French stipends. To whom it was answered that they were drawn to this war by no other matter, being otherwise most desirous and eager for peace, except by the pity for their oppressed fellow citizens and the treachery of the Savoyard, with a fuller explanation of the whole cause; therefore, they are contemplating no other war except against the Duke and that only within his own borders, wherefore they bid the imperial majesty to be secure as far as this matter is concerned. With this response, the envoy departed content, so that it may appear from this that the French efforts are not unfruitful for us, the less so since no one will move arms against us, as the emperor perpetually fears that he is being sought by French arts. And these things are all very plausible so far, as if Christ the victor were raising some sign to hope well for the propagation of the freer profession of the gospel and to instill fear in the impious, lest they can be wicked openly and with impunity hereafter. With which indeed not inconsiderable treasure we ought to be content, since we understand how far we ourselves are still from the perfection of the spiritual church, let alone that we should hope to set everything up elsewhere by arms. And would that we do not have to fear most of all, lest, elated by any success and enticed by desire, we do not keep ourselves within limits, but soon, bursting forth into the immense, we indulge in avarice and the lust for command! Wherefore the Lord, the director of this play, must be prayed to, that He may mercifully continue to regard us and keep us in His will.</p>
      <p>The agreement in the synod was so harmonious that it exhilarated me more than anything ever, and indeed I see that multiple fruits have returned to us from it, about which later. May the Lord grant that we all breathe Christ unanimously.</p>
      <p>Concerning Berchtold, the matter is serious, for besides the rupture, dropsy has also set in, which, bursting through the rupture, produces the most fetid putrefactions and intolerable torments for the excellent man. Therefore, I beg you, console him with your letters as soon as possible - I know he will be cheered if he lives that long - and farewell, my most esteemed patron, and forgive the loquacious and barbarous letter. If anything can be done for you by me, let me know. You will lack nothing in Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell with your wife and children. Greet for me Leo, Theodor, Binder, Collin, Amman.</p>
      <p>Bern, 11 February 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer. Berchtold and Conzen wanted to have their greetings written to you.</p>
      <p>I have not reread, so take it in good part.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed patron. To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
