      <p> Greetings and best wishes. Our godfather Johannes Huber delivered your letters along with the booklet in which you have pursued the essence of our religion, most esteemed Lord Bullinger and dearest brother in Christ. I was greatly delighted, both because I understand that you interpret the rarity of my letters kindly, and because I see that you are continually working on something for us, from which the church seems to gain growth and benefit. I give you immense thanks and have no doubt that the Lord Jesus, in whose affairs you are so diligent, will reward you on that day when you hear that lovely and desirable voice: "Well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your Lord." The times are perilous, as you write, exceedingly so. The Church of Christ is besieged by many enemies on all sides, not only external but also domestic. I was certainly terrified by what you wrote about the Saxons. If only they had remained quiet and left our churches, already troubled by enough disturbances, alone. For what do such dissensions and contentions produce but offenses among most people? The cries of the Antichrist's followers are well known; but let them shout even to hoarseness, the truth nonetheless deserves the defense of all good people. Our Savior was set for the fall and rising of many, and every plant that the heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up and torn out. What especially concerns me is that everything seems to be getting worse day by day even among us, who boast of the gospel of Christ. If we look at the magistrate, he is diligent in expanding the kingdom of this world, but in the kingdom of Christ, he dozes and snores continually, and, what is most serious, he wants to be a master in the kingdom of Christ and can no longer tolerate a somewhat freer profession of evangelical truth. Indeed, he is gradually beginning to act as a persecutor of Christ's servants. Now, a good part of us, who preside over the churches, of whom I confess I am one, indeed teach the pure word, but we express our doctrine with our deeds rather unfaithfully, and we are a stumbling block to others. But what is the common people like? Impious, blasphemous, bloodthirsty, greedy, drunken, given to adultery, fornication, usury, lies, and deceit. What kind of crimes and scandals do not flourish today? From what kind of people is that hypocrisy absent, which the Lord so greatly abhors? Not to mention that incredible ingratitude, which is shown by most to the preaching of the saving word. O the most dreadful appearance of this age. Can we expect anything other than impending ultimate destruction? How shall we help such lost and ulcerated matters? We will pray, as you rightly advise, unceasingly and will faithfully perform our duties. </p>
      <p> We will cry out and raise our voices like trumpets and will resist the malice and impiety of men, committing the rest to the Lord and will not fear, even if our throats are to be offered to the axes, so that we may save and rescue our souls with the elect. For indeed, if ever there was a need to resist evil, it is now especially. </p>
      <p> Furthermore, the Anabaptists (who are anti-baptists and antichrists), as I wrote before, still rage in the church which Christ has entrusted to me and cause me much trouble. </p>
      <p> We have now come to a discussion with them for the third time; but the more often we meet with them, the more errors and heresies we discover in them, so that their sect seems to be a certain Lerna of the most depraved heresies. May the Lord uproot it, so inimical to His cross. Recently, one of them dared to say that infants are pure and subject to no sin; another that man has free will to save himself. Is not the merit of Christ thus trampled underfoot? This seems especially execrable, that they can so insinuate themselves with the simple and unlearned, so fascinate their minds, that we have to fight not so much with them as with most people. Many even of our own, indeed almost the greater part, are very reluctant to bear being criticized by us. They hold, respect, and venerate them as holy men of God. O that we were such, they continually sing to us, and persuade themselves that they are fortunate because of their integrity." But if we drive them away," they say, "we must fear that we drive away the Lord's blessing. This is the greatest difficulty. They know how to excellently secure blessing for themselves and hatred and envy for us. They call us lazy bellies, hirelings, who do not feed but fleece the Lord's flock, corrupters of the oracles of God, [Greek], to whom the inheritance of the kingdom of God is denied. And they hurl these insults at us in person, when we most amicably confer the scriptures with them; what do we think they do when we are absent? I write these things, most esteemed brother in the Lord, so that your kindness may understand how much we need to be vigilant and to pray without ceasing for the churches, not only ours but also others. And I beg you, in both private and public prayers, to commend our church to yourself and pray to the Lord to deliver it from this cancer that so greatly creeps among the simple. Indeed, I am in danger of shipwreck when it comes to this, that my people think I should say nothing against this sect." Preach to us," they say, "the gospel and cease to speak against the Anabaptists, or we will no longer listen to you." Am I not standing between the altar (as it is said) and the rock? Will I not be a mute dog if I remain silent in the presence of these so harmful wolves? The Lord will be with me, as I hope, and will also bring an end to these things; for I have not decided to abandon my duties. </p>
      <p> I have already arranged for the booklet, which you sent as a gift to Mr. Burcher, to be taken to Strasbourg; for today the ship sets sail from here. Farewell with all yours. </p>
      <p> Written hastily on the 4th of March in the year 1556. Yours, Johannes Hospinianus. </p>
      <p> To the most holy doctor and interpreter of heavenly philosophy, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, acting as chief pastor in Zürich, the most noble metropolis of the Swiss, his Lord and brother in Christ, always most esteemed. Zürich. </p>
