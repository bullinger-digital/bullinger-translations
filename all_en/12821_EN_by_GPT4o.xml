    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Praise be to God! And may Bullinger prove himself steadfast in the Lord!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Hilles is only now responding to Bullinger's letters from October 28 and December 4, 1546 [not received]. Heartfelt thanks for the honorable gift of the commentary on Luke written by Bullinger, which he has gratefully received, just like the previous commentaries on the other Gospels and the letters of the Apostles. May God grant him the strength to regularly and diligently delve into it, as Bullinger has urged, and to dedicate the best part of his life to piety and good works.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Hilles has informed Ludwig Lavater of what Bullinger expects from him, and he has no doubt that the young man will be diligent during his studies in Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Like Bullinger, Hilles also fears that the terrible time of war has begun, in which God delivers His own to the enemy for punishment and chastisement.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren, is allegedly trying to reintroduce the Mass in some churches in Frankfurt. However, he is said to still allow the preaching of the Gospel for the time being.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] John Burcher has probably already communicated the changes that have occurred in England. Certainly, there will be even greater upheavals. King Henry VIII has imprisoned the most influential Duke of England for some time, [Thomas Howard, Duke] of Norfolk, and his [eldest] son [Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]. Since it is generally believed that Henry VIII will soon die, both are said to have planned to reintroduce the papacy in England. It is said (though this has not been confirmed in writing) that father and son were beheaded. It is also said that this Bishop of Winchester [Stephen Gardiner], who considers himself the Holy Spirit, but rather embodies the papal spirit, has been put in the Tower of London in their place. Many believe that this will serve to honor God and promote the spread of the Gospel. This could well be true, especially since England has already been visited by God and the current Queen [Catherine Parr] and the Earl of Hertford [Edward Seymour], the uncle of the king's son, Prince [Edward VI], favor the true doctrine and hate the papal fabrications.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings to Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, Rudolf Gwalther, and all the others Hilles knows, especially to Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler], who also sends greetings from Hilles' wife [Anna, née Lacey].</p>

      <p>I am only now responding to your letters dated October 28 and December 4. First of all, I owe you immense thanks, my most esteemed lord, for having deemed me worthy to receive your commentaries on Luke, just as you previously did with those on the other evangelists and apostles. I pray to the most good and great God that I may be able to meditate on them continuously, and, as you urge, to dedicate the most important parts of my life to the study of piety and good works. Pray to the Lord for me, I beseech you, that I may do so, and that I may adhere to the Lord until the end.</p>

      <p>I have told Brother Lavater what you commanded or at least desired, and I have no doubt that he will always make good use of his time here and will be diligent in learning good literature; and to ensure this, my constant exhortation will not be lacking.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I fear, as you write, that the time has come when the Lord will visit our iniquities through cruel war, and will deliver us to be punished or chastised into the hands of our enemies. For I hear (though I hope it is not so) that the Lord of Buren is now trying to establish Masses in some churches in Frankfurt; meanwhile, he still permits those who wish to hear the Gospel and follow the truth to do so freely.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Recently in England, as John Burcher has written to you, I believe, there has been some change, and undoubtedly there will be even greater. For England has had only one Duke, namely of Norfolk, for some years. The King has imprisoned him and his son because (as they say) when the King was about to die, they attempted to restore the primacy of the Pope; recently, however, I hear (though I have not yet received letters about it) that both father and son have been beheaded; and, as they say, in their place, in the Tower of London, the Holy Spirit, or rather the papal spirit, that Bishop of Winchester has succeeded. May God grant that all these things serve to the glory of His name and the propagation of the evangelical doctrine, as many of us think. However, it may happen after God has visited the sins of that kingdom. For the current Queen and the Lord of Hertford, namely the uncle of the King's son, the Prince, favor the pious and sound doctrine and hate papal inventions.</p>

      <p>Greet Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, Rudolf Gwalther, and all others known to me there, especially your most pious wife, to whom my wife also sends her regards.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and live always happily.</p>
      <p>Yours, Richard Hilles.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my particularly good lord and friend, to his hands. In Zurich.</p>
