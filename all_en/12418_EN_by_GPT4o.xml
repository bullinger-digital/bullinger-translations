    <p xml:id="regest1">A new Schmalkaldic League meeting is scheduled for April 1st. Everything is being handled confidentially by wise participants, which pleases Myconius. [Johannes] Sturm was able to bring a treaty negotiated with [King Francis I] of France, which is very favorable for the Protestants, to Frankfurt. [Francis I] has, however, only sent observers to [Frankfurt]. [King Henry VIII of] England has sent no one. The delegation from Emperor [Charles V] never appeared. [Elector Frederick II of the] Palatinate came to Frankfurt with his brother [Wolfgang of the Palatinate-Neumarkt]; likewise [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse. The Mainz [Archbishop Sebastian of Heusenstamm] also appeared there, but he did not meet with the Protestants. It is very welcome that the Protestants have sent a delegation to [Charles V] to explore his intentions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The [Second] Regensburg [Religious Colloquy] has finally begun. Currently, the discussion is about justification, especially since free will and original sin were debated earlier. Bucer speaks [for the Protestants] as Philipp [Melanchthon] is absent. In his place, Georg Maior was sent. The [Catholic] opponents want to keep the content of the debates secret, but the [Protestants] want the world to know about it. It was finally agreed to store the [protocols of the negotiations] in a chest under the supervision of the Regensburg council, to which one of the presidents and a representative of each of the two parties to the discussion received a key. Charles [V] must, however, still give his consent to this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- In the first session [of the Council] of Trent, six points were decided: 1. That the bishops and prelates should pray and fast. 2. That the priests should hold mass once a week. 3. That [the participants] should lead an honorable, simple lifestyle. 4. That the civil administration [of Trent] should protect the council participants. 5. That provisions [for the participants] should be ensured. 6. That recorders, scribes, and messengers should be appointed. Bullinger will hear the rest from [Rudolf] Gwalther and [Hans] Vogler [the Elder].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Myconius is well-disposed towards Theodor [Bibliander], but does not know what he thinks of him. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>S. On the first of April, a new meeting has been scheduled by the Schmalkaldic League. Matters that could not be resolved before will be addressed there. The plans, discussions, and all other matters are being conducted in secret, which pleases me greatly; for this shows the wisdom of those who are gathering there. No one knows what Professor Sturm presented in Frankfurt. However, it is certain that he brought the best conditions from the French for the Protestants, even though the French only sent observers there. The English sent no one. The Emperor's delegation never appeared. The Palatinate, however, came to Frankfurt with his brother Wolfgang, who is still unmarried, on swift horses, and Hesse also arrived there. They discussed common matters; that much is known. The Archbishop of Mainz traveled there but did not meet with the Protestants. It is pleasing, from all that can be known, especially that the Protestants sent an honorable delegation to the Emperor to see if they can ascertain what to expect from him. I cannot know anything else from the Frankfurt meeting.</p>

      <p>From Regensburg, these are the news. The colloquy has finally begun, and since there was a discussion about free will and original sin before, justification is currently being discussed. The spirit of the Lord was present in this discussion with Bucer, who was given the role of responding in the absence of Philipp (in whose place Dr. Georg Maior, a man of calm disposition and very learned, was sent). The opponents want the discussions to be held in utmost silence; our side wants the opposite: For the gospel should be preached to every creature. A compromise was found, that everything should be kept in a chest, which is in the hands of the Regensburg council. Three keys are distributed as follows: One for the presidents, the other two for the parties in the colloquy. The matter has been written to the Emperor, whether he wants this to be confirmed or not. A response is awaited.</p>

      <p>From Trent. In the first session, six articles were decided upon, among which: 1. That bishops and prelates should pray and fast. 2. That priests should hold mass once a week. 3. That they should have an honorable and not overly expensive household. 4. That the civil magistrate should watch over the council's participants; for a bishop was expelled from his lodging one night; they say he was looking for fire. 5. That provisions and supplies should be ensured. 6. That notaries, scribes, and messengers should be appointed. You see, said someone, "the grace of the spirit" according to the poem of Alexander: "May it help me and make me complete what is useful." You will hear the rest from Gwalther and Vogler.</p>

      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family. I wish well to Theodor; I am completely uncertain about his feelings towards me. Please greet Pellican in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, March 6, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy Bishop of the Zurichers, D. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord in Christ. Z[urich].</p>
