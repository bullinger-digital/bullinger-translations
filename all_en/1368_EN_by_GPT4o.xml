      <p>Most illustrious man, I have eagerly awaited Gribaldo with my nephew, and they have not appeared anywhere. May the will of the Lord be done.</p>
      <p>I stayed in Bern for 10 days; thus, exhausted by expenses and tedium, I now head to Lausanne and then to Geneva. If they finally come, tell them I will be waiting for them in those two cities. I have dealt with these lords regarding my matter, whom I indeed found benevolent, and I hope that they will support me. There is still time, if you ministers are willing to provide me with what the people of Basel have provided, namely letters of recommendation and a good testimony, which I ask of you. Mr. Haller has dealt with me and continues to do so as if he were a brother. You will have done me a favor if you thank him in an extraordinary manner. Meanwhile, while I waited here, I took care to have an Italian booklet printed, in which I discuss much about the council; I think it will be beneficial to my Venetians. My man here will give you four copies: you can send them either to your friend in Augsburg or perhaps to England, and if you want more, he will provide more. You will give him those two bundles of books, which my other servant had brought; for he will take care of having them transported to Italy. Furthermore, ensure that Froschauer gives him three volumes of all your books, both from the Decades and from the rest, also three from the commentaries of Peter Martyr, which I will faithfully pay for, so that he does not transport only those few books to Italy now, but others at the same cost. If any of my letters are sent to you from anywhere, please send them immediately to Mr. Haller, which I ask of you again and again. I am preparing a booklet on whether the evangelicals should go to the Council of Trent. You will have it immediately. See at the end of this Italian booklet; for I have described a decree from the acts of the Council of Constance, which beautifully pertains to the matter, namely that no safe conducts made for those suspected of heresy are to be observed. I am now entirely focused on this cause: I see you are more concerned about it than anyone else I know. Farewell, brother in the Lord, and pray to God for me with your entire church. I bid all the brothers to be well. Bern, August 6, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
