      <p> Greetings. Our Paul, a pious man full of faith, has been called by Johannes Haller, the minister of the Bernese church, and there is a not at all vain hope that some suitable church will be provided for him, or rather that the church will be more consulted by the goodness and diligence of such a man, and not by ordinary learning. Therefore, I would like to ask you, who are very loving to him, not to fail to support him with your commendatory letters, which will greatly benefit him. I have indeed written to Mr. Haller myself, and I am convinced that I will achieve nothing more certain than if your letters, which alone could do everything, are added to mine. However, there is no reason for you in Zürich or those in Bern to fear a greater number of exiled brothers. For there are churches everywhere that do not neglect any duty in supporting and nurturing them, and nothing is lacking for those who truly trust in the Lord. With us still remains that unique Konrad from Konstanz, a learned and pious man known to our Musculus and Paul, who, with such constancy of mind and with such an increase of faith, was the first of all to preach the gospel of Christ in Ravensburg, dismissed from his church with many tears and great sorrow when the magistrates ordered him to leave the city. I believe our ministers will make an effort to designate some suitable place for him as well, where he can increase the talent entrusted to him with much interest and render excellent service to his Lord, as he began. </p>
      <p> Otherwise, we have nothing new except that one thing, which is written to us from Italy: </p>
      <p> Philip, the son of the Emperor, is to come to Genoa with a very well-equipped fleet by the Ides of October; and the reason for his being called by his father is not very clear, unless it is credible that Charles is intent on establishing his son as the successor of the empire with the favor of the estates. Thus the vicissitudes of affairs vary, so that the Germans, who for many centuries ruled over the Spaniards, with the most illustrious peoples migrating there, now in turn bear the Spanish emperors and are compelled not only to endure them migrating to them but also to receive them with open arms. Therefore, let the Swiss be vigilant, lest they be overwhelmed by some very harsh servitude imposed by the same nation. </p>
      <p> Farewell, and greet Mr. Musculus in my name, and likewise Mr. Gervasius. St. Gallen, four days before the Calends of October, in the year 1548. </p>
      <p> Joachim Vadian. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the noble city of Zürich, my very esteemed lord. </p>
