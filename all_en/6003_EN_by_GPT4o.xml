      <p>My born greetings, highly learned in Christ, dear lord and friend.</p>
      <p>I could not withhold from you my favorable opinion, that a beloved cousin and friend has passed away, for which I must mourn.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is our kind request to you, that you would send my housewife six guilders, which I hereby send to you, for white bleached linen as wide as can be obtained from you in Zurich, as the sample is, which I send to you herewith.</p>
      <p>However, I would like them to be much wider than the sample is.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is my dear lord and husband's request to you, that you would send him the house book, which you have made, and write down what that and the other books, which you have sent to my dear lord and husband, cost; for he will have such paid to you, etc.</p>
      <p>In doing so, you do me a friendly favor, etc. And my dear lord and husband and I wish you and your beloved housewife a very happy New Year, and hereby commend you to Almighty God.</p>
      <p>Dated Rappoltsweiler, January 2, in the year 1564. Maria, Lady of Rappoltstein, etc.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned in Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dear and good friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>"Lady Maria von Erbach, Lady of Rappoltstein, 1564."</p>
