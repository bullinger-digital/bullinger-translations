      <p>Most learned man and my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>I have seen what you wrote to me yesterday, and I have gladly understood everything, because you have satisfied me as I desired. Therefore, I confess that I owe you very much and I give thanks, and whatever I can and have, I offer it all to you. I have conveyed your greetings, as you ordered, and they return your greetings in kind. Indeed, I will not forget your recommendation towards your people, where I can be of help to them, as I have done so far. I have nothing else to write, except that as usual I am yours and the heavens have made me yours, to whom and to your family I commend myself with all my heart.</p>
      <p>In Bremgarten, 12th of September, 1544.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Giovanni Domenico Panizzone.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man and my most esteemed lord, Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
