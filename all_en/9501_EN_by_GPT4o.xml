      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I wrote previously to you, a man always like a father to me and most honorable lord, about this boy Jakob Schnurff, and we asked the council to ensure that something be given to him by his uncle; his mother cannot support him in this time of universal difficulty, as she can barely sustain herself. We have received no response. His mother now sends him and begs (I also beg, as much as I possibly can) that through your efforts and those of good people, he be received into that number, denen man das muͦß gibt (to whom one must give).</p>
      <p>The mother indeed lives among us after her return so honorably that she is dear to everyone; she cooks in the Dionysian college, certainly worthy of being helped to be freed from this burden. I believe he is the son of a citizen of your city. But I do not wish to say more, lest I seem to doubt.</p>
      <p>I received your last letter two days ago; I will do, as you command, in the best manner, as they say.</p>
      <p>The Pole is said to be coming and going; everything is full of pretenses and deceit. Strange things are reported, which have been attempted concerning Strasbourg. The Netherlands are silent.</p>
      <p>The cause of Maderi has finally been explained, how ridiculously, it is hardly believable. Everything is denied, lies and nonsense are put forward, none of which are mentioned. Cornerus is now being examined to be created a bachelor. The rest next time. May God always be with us. Amen. On the 20th of November before dawn.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Erastus.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
