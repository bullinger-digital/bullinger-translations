    <p xml:id="regest1">After returning from Urdorf, he had himself examined by Christoph Klauser. He hopes for a speedy recovery. Klauser advises him against continuing the bathing cure, which is why Ott bids farewell to his fellow bathers. Bullinger should ask Werner Steiner to pay Ott's debts, as agreed.</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings beforehand, dear Master Heinrich.</p>
      <p>When I came home, I immediately went to Doctor Christoph and told him my concerns. He examined my throat and immediately made a gargle solution for me, which I should use immediately. I have done so and am in good hope with God's help that my condition will soon be good. However, regarding the bathing, I also asked him. He does not advise me to continue bathing because of the great heat, since my illness has come from excessive heat. Therefore, my friendly and earnest request to you is that you kindly ask all our fellow bathers not to be angry with me. I also thank you and all the others for all the good. For if I could serve any of you, I would always be found willing. And as I have discussed with Master Werner Steiner about all matters, I ask him to settle (pay) it for me, and as soon as he returns home, I will settle and pay him.</p>
      <p>Nothing more than may Almighty God be with us all, and may God bless all your baths, etc.</p>
      <p>Felix Ott, dyer in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, honorable, and wise Master Heinrich Bullinger, currently in Urdorf.</p>
