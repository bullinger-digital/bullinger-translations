      <p>Most excellent Bullinger. I know that you are eagerly awaiting my letters, both to learn about my arrival in Italy and how my affairs with the Venetians have turned out. The former, with Christ as my guide, has been quite successful. As for the latter, things have gone quite miserably; for those letters of recommendation only achieved this: that exile was proposed to me from the entire territory of the Venetians. For they wanted me to be safe among them if I were willing to follow their religion, that is, the Roman one; otherwise, I had to leave their borders entirely. I, who belong to Christ, preferred to be an exile rather than enjoy Venice with its abominable and accursed religion. I departed, therefore, not without great danger to my life, towards Ferrara with a calm mind and fully prepared for the cross, leaving behind my wife and all my possessions. Then I will set out for Florence to see if the Lord has prepared a place of rest for me there, attracted especially by the supreme kindness and pious disposition of that prince; I also hope that an honorable condition of living will not be lacking for me there. If only those letters had been written to him, they would undoubtedly have greatly benefited this cause. It pleased the Lord that things turned out this way to test my faith; for I had not yet experienced the threats of princes and the ferocity of their countenances, now I truly know how much it is worth to bear the cross for Christ, to whom I give thanks for delivering me with my faith intact from the mouth of lions. Their affairs are deplorable as far as piety is concerned; they have the Antichrist as their most intimate companion. The rest, so as not to be a burden to you, you will learn from Lord Lelio, especially what I would now wish to be done for me by you; you will do so with the humanity you are accustomed to.</p>
      <p>While I am eager to satisfy you, other impediments present themselves; my exile and flight for Christ will sufficiently excuse me to you if I do not send those glass vessels now; I will make up for that loss when I have found some leisure. Finally, I implore you, along with the other faithful, to sigh to the Lord for my persecution, that my faith may not fail. In the meantime, farewell with the whole church. I have received all your letters. Write to us sometime, I pray.</p>
      <p>Given on the journey, August 25, 1549.</p>
      <p>To the most steadfast and learned minister of Christ in the church of Zürich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, always to be honored. Zürich.</p>
