      <p>Greetings. After a few days of not writing, I now resume my duty; but I will be brief with you, because, as I was previously hindered by business and did not send you any letters, I am still not fully free from business, so I am compelled to be brief. My son-in-law Simler and I are very eager to know what has happened in that assembly, about which you last wrote and to which we suggested our advice. I hope everything has turned out well! Here, by the grace of God, we are doing quite well; but in a remarkable way, the persistent dearness of all things burns and presses us. There is no doubt that the hand of the Lord is upon us, and I wish we would all recognize it, implore God's mercy, and amend our ways. Certainly, our magistrate in the city and countryside has instituted a day of supplication, which, to be fortunate and auspicious, we began on the 25th of this month; I have included the printed form*. May the Lord have mercy on us! Mr. Beza sent letters this week dated partly the 19th and partly the 21st of this month; in them, he mentions that many good men are dying in Geneva and that recently Mr. Ezra Roset, a truly good man, has also passed away, etc. The school is closed, everything is scattered. He vigorously maintains his position; may the Lord be pleased to assist him and preserve him for His church! He adds that Mr. Admiral of La Rochelle was summoned by the king to the court; he obeyed the king and was received by the king with the highest honor and benevolence, and is in the highest favor, from which the Guise family has fallen and retreated to their own. It is a remarkable thing if no deceit is involved; but these are the works of the Lord. Let us pray to Him to strengthen the peace granted to France, restrain the troublemakers, and protect the good. The Turks are said to dominate in Dalmatia and appear with their ships almost in sight of Venice, about which I expect more certain information from you.</p>
      <p>Froschauer has not yet returned from Frankfurt; when he returns, I will write if he brings anything worth mentioning.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your entire household, Mr. Campell, Mr. Pontisella, the consuls, Bonett, Gregor, and all our friends.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 28th September 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my brother and beloved fellow minister.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
