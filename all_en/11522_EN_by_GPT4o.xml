    <p xml:id="regest1">Even if [Christoph] Froschauer has settled accounts decently with Stumpf, the fee does not correspond to the effort, yet God will reward Stumpf for his work [on the historical work about the Council of Constance], which he undertook for the benefit of the Church and which has already received much recognition. Perhaps Adrian Wirth can assist him with an illustrated or colored edition of Ptolemy; Bullinger is, moreover, ready to do his utmost for him.</p>

      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to his Johannes Stumpf.</p>
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. Indeed, it seems that our Froschauer has dealt quite generously with you. Although I freely admit that the reward does not correspond to the labors. However, what is lacking, the Lord, the giver of all good things, will make up for. For I know that you undertook that labor not for private gain, but for the benefit of the Church. And indeed, it is not commonly approved by all whom I have heard have read it so far.</p>
      <p>I have not had a painted or colored edition of Ptolemy so far, nor do I know anyone who has, unless perhaps Adrian Wirth of Altdorf can provide you with a painted copy. Otherwise, I would deny you nothing that is within my power.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>March 15, 1541.</p>
