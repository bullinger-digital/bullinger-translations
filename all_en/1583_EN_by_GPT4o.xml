      <p>I received your letter, most learned and upright man, written on February 10th, and as for the Saxon army, you should know that it does not stand with the Emperor's side nor was it gathered by the Emperor's cunning and prudence. However, after receiving money from the Emperor and the princes, it was dispersed, and this was not done without reason; for in that army there were many captains who were loyal to the Emperor, whom it was necessary to send home, lest they understand what was happening, and thus the bishops were deceived, thinking that with the army dispersed, they did not need soldiers and cavalry, and they sent away their own or the greater part, who immediately swore allegiance to new captains who were not far away.</p>
      <p>Thus, once again, a great army is gathered against the Emperor in Saxony and Hesse. For Maurice and the Hessian have entered into an alliance with the French, and certain other princes, and hostages are given on both sides. The money is already here, which the king must pay for three months with the hostages. We are expecting the princes to arrive. The king is in great preparation; for he has summoned all the nobility, and most of the princes accompany him, intending to go shortly to Germany, to which the Saxon army, which is also hastening greatly, must join, to fulfill what it promised, as the royal envoy to the princes of Germany wrote to me. He left the queen as regent, to whom he gave counselors, learned and upright men, and told the Parisian senate, where he gave a public speech, that he would not return before ten months and that they should obey the queen as if it were himself, and that he would give them the Swiss for the preservation of the kingdom.</p>
      <p>An edict was also published in favor of the Germans, who are considered to be like citizens and confederate friends of the kingdom of France, so that they can acquire in the kingdom of France as fellow citizens and do not need to obtain other letters, so that they can also live in their religion even without selection... as long as they do not teach publicly. The royal prosecutor did not want this to be read publicly, but to be secretly inscribed in the senate's records, cardinals from the king, Lotharingus and Castilionensis, were sent, who had it read and published with open doors of the senate. I also think the king will enter Lorraine on the first of April, to retain two imperial cities, which will be easy to do, both because they are not fortified, and also because he has taken their protection for many years, which he still wants to be always under the empire. Afterwards, he will go straight to the Emperor, if the Lord permits and the princes fulfill what they promised, although some in France suspect the faith of the German princes. Therefore, they do not willingly... such a departure, especially since all the princes want to accompany the king. The Emperor is also gathering an army, which he pretends to send to Hungary; but I think the matter is otherwise and he is afraid; for he cannot fail to know something about such practices, and we would like him to be in Augsburg already. Among the Saxons, some counts loyal to the Emperor have been captured, so that if any of ours are intercepted, we can redeem them and avert the force and tyranny of the Emperor. As for what you write about the papal legate, who has been in France for some months, it is certain that the king allowed him the expedition of some Roman provisions, as they call them; but he added a treasurer, who would receive the money, so that not even a penny came into the hands of the legate. He had promised to ensure that Mirandola would be left free, but... he is delayed. I think the king will soon send him back to Rome; for he could retain countless spies in France under the pretext of the legation. There is no mention or hope of peace and concord between the Emperor and the king, indeed I expect the most bloody war... to begin in Germany. May the Lord truly turn it to the praise of His name. I am very busy; for almost every day nobles from France come to me; for the king wants nothing to be done in the empire without consulting his grandfather. There are also some Saxons here with me, sent by their princes, who have reached here not without danger. I will diligently write everything I learn that is worthy. Some Parisian theologians, who preached against the senate for not punishing the evangelicals severely enough, have been accused and, as I hear, will be punished, and judges have been appointed to summon them to court. I am glad your book has been translated into French; we will find a way for it to reach the king's hands. I regret only one thing about the prince, that he almost never reads, but it will be enough if he is willing to listen. I thank you for what you write to me and for your diligent warnings to be cautious; for we have dealings with a most powerful and cunning enemy. I sent the privilege sheet to the court for the book on animals; I retained a copy of it with me; as soon as I learn anything, I will write back. I also received your latest letter written on February 26th. Farewell. Basel, March 1, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Maurilius Musaeus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Zürich ecclesiastic, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>In March 1552.</p>
