      <p>I have received your letters, and there is nothing for me to write back to you now, except to express my greatest thanks to you, for although you are very busy, you do not neglect the duty of writing. If Vergerio is still there, I earnestly beseech you to commend me to him with reverence, again and again. May our Lord and Savior Christ make firm the good words you pray for my calling. The envoys from Biel, Senator Nikolaus, a truly excellent man and devoted to the glory of Christ, along with my dearest son Funkel, will explain everything to you in person with the utmost fidelity. I will ensure that the package you sent is delivered to those doctors as diligently as I love you, my Bullinger, and regard and honor you as my greatest friend. There was no need for such great entreaties in such a small matter; for I wish you to be entirely persuaded that there is nothing so arduous and difficult that I would not undertake it with the most willing spirit for your sake, if you so command, and I would be most ungrateful if I did not also devote myself to you, however little I am. Farewell with all yours, and strongly assist me with my family in our prayers to our heavenly Father. Winterthur, July 5, 1551.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Ambr[osius] Bl[arer].</p>
      <p>The envoys will tell you what trouble has occurred between the Bishop of Konstanz and the Senate or that man from Bouville, when you remind them of this.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his especially esteemed friend and by far dearest brother.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
