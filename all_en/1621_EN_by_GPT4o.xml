      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I give you immense thanks for the book; I will return it on another occasion, and there is no need for you to write so often about the price. Did we not agree that I would send you other books, equal to those you give me; therefore, do not mention this matter again; write to me about any books you wish, and I will acquire them, and I will inform you of those I request; I will send page for page. As for the news with us: Strasbourg has been approached by the constable through a herald; what answer they have given is not yet known for certain; but it is certain that they have sent him wheat, flour, and oats, and have escorted the herald out honorably. The Bishop of Strasbourg has been written to, that he should provide better for the royal court and prove himself, and how his royal majesty would have reason to deal with him differently, yet he wishes to be a gracious king to all those who will not oppose him in the future. Likewise, a herald has been sent to those of Schlettstadt, that they should provide him with a pass and prove themselves, and send an envoy to him within 8 days, or they shall see what will happen to them. He has also dealt with Colmar in this way, but has not written a word to the government in Ensisheim, which they are very surprised about; they are afraid, and plead with their wives and children to come to us.</p>
      <p>You also know well how Dr. Schertlin won Gorse, with 4 priests stabbed there, who defended themselves in the monastery and castle. He then moved towards Diedenhofen; it is thought they have also surrendered. These priests deserved this punishment, who five years ago killed many who communicated under both kinds in the nearby village, where Farellus had preached. You undoubtedly know that story.</p>
      <p>I sent the gilded books through the king's public messenger to Dr. Morlet, so that they may reach his hands with the letters you attached; do not think me so foolish as to entrust letters written to such powerful princes to just anyone.</p>
      <p>The booklets you requested have not yet been found by our booksellers; but they will search diligently; if they find them, I will send them with the next messenger. Caelius is going to write about the state of Poland.</p>
      <p>They say that Dr. von Aldenburg is in Frisia with a large army and is devastating everything. Farewell. April 21, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>May you share this with Theodor, to whom I wish all good things along with all the brothers.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zürich, my gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
