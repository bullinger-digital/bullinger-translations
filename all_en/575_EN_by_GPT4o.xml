      <p>Most excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>As for the dangers and martyrdoms, I do not know if the Lord reserves that crown for me. I must return to Italy. First and foremost, both I and others will diligently ask the heavenly Father to grant me the spirit of confidence and to advance His glory in us and through us daily. Then you will take care to send to me as soon as possible, which stories you would prefer to be depicted on those vessels. I would prefer to express in deeds rather than acknowledge in words how much I owe to you and the other ministers of the Swiss for the hospitality received from all. Therefore, you will always have me most devoted, so may God grant that some opportunity will present itself for me to gratify you in some matter.</p>
      <p>I will write to you diligently if there is anything new; thus you should write back to me in return.</p>
      <p>Mr. Haller, in my name, requested from Calvin some copies of astronomy, about the Interim and some other things, and perhaps, as he told me, they will be delivered to your bookseller Foscovero, and as soon as Lelius returns, you will take care that they are sent to me through him, informing how much money I should send for them. Farewell in the Lord and love me. Your letters to me should be sent either to Chiavenna to Augustin or to Bergamo to Francesco Belinchettus. If Mr. Lelius stays too long in Basel, I would wish that you would take care to have them sent to Chiavenna or Bergamo to Belinchettus through you.</p>
