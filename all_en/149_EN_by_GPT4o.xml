      <p>Salvation, grace, and peace from God the Father through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>I received some very pious letters from you some time ago, dearest brother, to each of which, especially to those with which you sent your most learned writings on the Acts of the Apostles to me and Musculus, I responded and gave my letters to a certain learned man named Clement, a man of small stature, who said he had been in Luzern and Solothurn for some time and still had his belongings in Zürich. For he returned here and said he had given my letters to a certain man from Zürich, who was going to you from St. Gallen. But I suspect the man opened my letters and perhaps misused them. I also wrote two letters to you; one I sent to Lindau, the second to Konstanz; I am surprised by the delay or interception, and it will not be without danger, since love and piety towards you do not allow me not to write to you about necessary matters, etc. Therefore, please have me excused; I am entirely yours and will remain so, however rarely and little we communicate with each other. I am certainly sure that one will see the other in the presence of the triumphant God as co-heirs of Christ, from which hope no danger nor any persecution will tear us away; if only the remaining time of this life could be spent with you, even in poverty, nor do I wish to be happier here.</p>
      <p>In what state the affairs of the fatherland are, you undoubtedly see. The priests boast greatly and exult, having nothing else in their wishes than that the kingdoms of their father the devil may return; meanwhile, others think differently, namely how to reduce the dissenters on both sides into servitude. I am not very concerned about this, as I know that one must serve the times. May the holy will of the Lord be done. Amen.</p>
      <p>I rejoice that the Bernese have uprooted Bucer's tares and that my Haller has been sent there in exchange. For if I have rightly examined my soul and conscience, I find that the wrath of God has been stirred against us for no other reason more than the abuse of the sacraments, from which abominable idols have been made.</p>
      <p>How harshly the Lord punishes idolaters, the examples of the ancients, expressed everywhere in the holy scriptures, teach. Oh, if not the Turk, then that other Pharaoh, may soon arise and seize and tear apart the scourge with the scourged, truly these things are very much to be feared. Our city was quite political and provided a considerable example of piety. Now, due to the wickedness of foreigners, it has become so shameless that you can hardly recognize its face. This, however, I would say, with some thousands of pious inhabitants saved and excepted, who have neither bent the knee before Baal nor have been seduced by the allurements of wicked men. Thanks and glory to God forever.</p>
      <p>The bearer of these letters will explain the rest to you. By the kindness of God, I am well with my eight children and five grandchildren. It seems that a connection and friendship should exist between you and me; for in the number of children we are equal, in body, years, and spirit we differ little; let us therefore remain an indissoluble bond to each other in the name of the Lord. Amen. You will diligently greet the councilors, the chief scribe, your colleagues, especially my Gwalther, and all the other learned men.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your most honorable household. June 4, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg (Laetus).</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, incomparable friend.</p>
