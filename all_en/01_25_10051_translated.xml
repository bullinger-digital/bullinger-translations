  <input>Gratia et pax a deo patre per dominum nostrum Iesum Christum.

Tandem absentem absens inhortabor, nimirum alias strenuum, ut id adhuc alacrius perfitiat, quod coepit. Intelligis autem, quid velim, id enim intelligo, de quo iam sepius usque in multam consultavimus noctem et ad quod te multorum et sapientum et pientissimorum cum veteris tum nostrae aetatis hominum inhortatur exemplum, imo cur horum potius quam sacrarum litterarum proferimus calculum? Vidisti autem, quid illae iubeant, sed et tua illa ad imaginem dei formata conscientia animaque certe a deo docta idem, quod illi omnesque nos consultamus, suadet. Cave itaque, ne frustra a spiritusancto obsignatus sis. Is nimirum cupit hoc tuum sibi corpus in templum consecrare sacrum [1 Kor 6, 19f], cupit inquam is familiarior tibi esse, quam fuerit hactenus.

Nosti enim coelestis Pauli sententiam me Hercle gravissimam: «Qui adglutinatur scorto, unum corpus cum eo est; at qui coalescit domino, unus spiritus cum domino est» [1 Kor 6, 16f]. Agnosce itaque tempus ac oportunitatem redime, id quod sacratissimum Pauli pectus toties inculcavit; agnosce dei vocationem et quod a gravi carnis somno evigilandum est; agnosce denique vocationem, imo occasionem a deo tibi iam toties oblatam. Exuli, imo mendico idem praecipitur, quod tibi, neque is se excusare potest, ut inopiam maxime obtendat. Interim te deus opulentia donavit. Quid ergo? Benefitium dei agnosce atque gratias age. Hae autem gratiae illi laudatissimae, si illius obedias praeceptis. Convertere itaque ad dominum, et ipse ad te convertetur [Sach 1,3]. Sed quid «convertetur» dico, cum ipse videas ipsum ad te esse conversum! Proinde accelera, nam qui amant, qui semel deum viderunt quique eius senserunt suavitatem, non tardant, sed sese celeri cursu ad odorem proripiunt. Omnis enim mora periculosa, quoniam in salis statuam conversa est Lothi uxor, quoniam et dominus adseverat: «Quisquis manu semel admota aratro respicit, is plane me non est dignus» [Lk 9,62]. Quid, o bone deus, audio? Quid enim hic habet, qui deum non habet? Quid hac re fingi potest miserabilius? Qui deum habent, omne bonum habent, pacem ac gaudium. Nemo ergo tam stupidus esse velit, ut tantum bonorum thesaurum abiiciat atque negligat tardando seu respitiendo. Senex es, frater mi, morti propinquus es, o amice omnium charissime, vides, in quo rerum statu simus mortales. Hoc ipso, quod scribo, plurimum vitae meę decedit, ignarus denique, quo oculis [!] momento auferat e vivis omnipotens. Adhoc omnes satis superque satis offendimus dominum, ut is nunc ira exestuans consultet, quibus diris, qua peste quove gladio impietatem nostram ulciscatur. Hic iam tu tuam venerare senectutem, memorare mortis fatique. In eluctabile tempus atque ita iam vitam tuam institue, ut, cum vindex venerit, templum suum non usqueadeo vastum inveniat. Nam adeo nos pestis, fames et gladius terrere non debent ab uxoribus, ut multo magis invitent, nimirum ut praecinctos lucernasque in manibus tenentes dominus inveniat [Lk 12,35]. «Deus est», inquit Petrus, «qui pios novit e tentationibus eripere et incredulos ad perpetuam torturam servare» [2 Petr 2,9]. Dominus est deus ipse munimentum nostrum, ipse pro nobis filium expendit, qui sane non tardavit, sed omnia semel nostri causa fecit. Ne itaque nos in re non usqueadeo involuptuaria tardemus! Paulus non putat fieri posse, ut sive gladius sive ignis sive mors a domino avellat fidelium quempiam [Röm 8,35-39]; quanto minus avellere debet a tam glorioso dulcique domino foeda libido.

Illum non tardavit aequale cum patre imperium neque coelorum regia quicquam movit, ut hoc tardius veniret. Deinde sciebat, quid illi patiendum erat, nimirum post imanem dilaniationem, post risus atque ronchos impiisimorum nebulonum tandem atrocissimum crucis supplitium. Scivit haec omnia, nec tamen tardavit, imo et cupidus et gaudio gestiens irruit in mundum ingratissimum. Vide nunc, quid nobis agendum sit. Nos pollicitationes habemus, ut amplissimas ita certissimas, nam et propheta testatur: «Iuvenis fui atque senui, interea iustum non vidi derelictum nec posteritatem ipsius mendicitate damnatam» [Ps 37,25]. Sunt item nobis praeclarissima sanctorum exempla; astat denique ille ipse Christus e coniugata, tamen perpetua virgine natus atque classicum canens. Num impiissimi ingratissimique merito censeremur, si ei non obsequndaremus in re tam levicula, cum tamen ipse prior nostri caussa subierit negotium et asperius et multo durius? Beati ergo omnes, qui timent dominum et qui ambulant in viis eius.

Haec scripsi, amice omnium dulcissime, maximo erga deum adfectu magnoque tui amore raptus, non ut iacentem engerem, sed ut currentem incitarem moraeque et, ut ita loquar, procrastinationi obstarem, quod certissimam esse sciam decantatam illam sententiam: «Quae serius fiunt, et tepidius et hoc difficilius fiunt». Tu omnia boni consule, utpote ab omnium, quos in terra habes, amicissimo profecta. Vale.

  <output>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.

At last I will exhort the absent one, namely you, who are so brave otherwise, that you may zealously pursue what you have begun. You know what I mean, for we have often discussed it until deep into the night and the example of many wise and pious men of both ancient and our times exhort you to it, indeed why do we rather cite them than the sacred writings? You have seen what those command, but also your conscience, formed after the image of God and certainly taught by God, recommends the same thing we all consult. So beware lest you have been sealed in vain by the Holy Spirit. He indeed wants to consecrate to himself this your body as a temple [1 Cor 6:19ff], He wants, I say, to be more familiar with you than he has been hitherto.

You know the most weighty statement of the heavenly Paul: “He who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her; but he who is joined to the Lord, becomes one spirit with Him" [1 Cor 6:16ff]. So acknowledge the time and the opportunity, what the most holy breast of Paul inculcates so often; acknowledge the vocation of God and that we must awake from heavy sleep of the flesh; acknowledge finally the vocation, indeed the opportunity already so often presented to you by God. The exiled one, nay, the beggar is commanded the same thing as you, and he cannot excuse himself by pleading poverty. Meanwhile, God has endowed you with wealth. What then? Acknowledge the grace of God and give thanks. But these highest thanks can be offered to Him if you obey His commandments. So turn to the Lord, and He will turn to you [Zach 1:3]. But what do I say, when you already see Him turned to you! Therefore hasten, for those who love, who have once seen God and experienced His sweetness, do not linger, but rush with speed to the scent. For every delay is dangerous, since Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt, and since the Lord says: "Whoever puts his hand to the plow and looks back, is not fit for the kingdom of God" [Lk 9:62]. What, O good God, do I hear? What has he who does not have God? What can be more miserable than this? Those who have God, have all good, peace and joy. So no one should be so stupid as to reject and neglect such a treasure of good things by delaying or hesitating. You are old, brother, near to death, O most dear friend of all, you see in what state of things we mortals are. While I am writing this, much of my life is passing away, and I am ignorant when the Almighty will take me away from the living. Moreover, we all offend the Lord sufficiently and more than enough, so that He now, boiling with anger, consults by what dreadful plague and sword He will avenge our impiety. Now revere your old age, remember death and fate. Spend your life in a time that cannot be escaped, so that, when the Avenger comes, He will not find His temple so desolate. For we must not be frightened by pestilence, famine, and sword, so as to invite them rather than our wives, namely that the Lord may find us with girded loins and lamps in our hands [Lk 12:35]. “God is," says Peter, “who knows how to deliver the righteous out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished" [2 Pet 2:9]. The Lord Himself is our protection, He Himself has spent His Son for us, who certainly did not delay, but did all at once for our sake. Let us not then linger in a matter so little pleasant! Paul does not think it possible that either sword or fire or death can take away from the Lord any of the faithful [Rom 8:35-39]; much less should an impure and ungrateful lust take away from the Lord so glorious and sweet.

He did not tarry in His equal kingdom with the Father nor did the royal court of heaven move Him, that it should come more slowly. He knew what He had to suffer, namely after a humble disrobing, after the mockeries and grunts of the most impious rabble, finally the most cruel punishment of the cross. He knew all these things, and yet He did not delay, but rushed into the most ungrateful world, eager and joyful. See now what we have to do. We have promises, as ample as certain, for the prophet testifies: “I have been young and now am old, and yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread" [Ps 37:25]. There are also the most glorious examples of the saints; and there stands also He Himself born of a married, yet perpetual Virgin, singing a classic. Should we not be deservedly called the most impious and ungrateful, if we were not obedient to Him in so small a matter, when He Himself underwent a work before us, and a more severe and much harder one? Blessed then are all they who fear the Lord and who walk in His ways.

I have written this, O most sweet friend of all, borne away with the greatest affection for God and great love for you, not to reproach you, but to excite you to run and, if I may say so, to oppose procrastination, which I know to be a certain but often repeated saying: “Those things which are done too late, are done both colder and more difficultly.” Consult everything for good, being sent by the most friendly of all that you have on earth. Farewell.
