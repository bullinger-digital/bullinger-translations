      <p>Today, this speech was first completed by the printer and is on its way to Basel. Therefore, besides your copy, I am sending two copies, one of which I ask you to send to Mr. Bayonensis and the other to Mr. Bassafontaneus, and to inform them that today news has come here of the death of Duke Johann Friedrich of Saxony and his wife. Farewell and be well. Yesterday I wrote to you. TÃ¼bingen, March 19, 1554.</p>

      <p>To you, Bullinger.</p>
