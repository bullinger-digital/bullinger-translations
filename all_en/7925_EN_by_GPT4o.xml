      <p>Greetings. I received your most recent letter, most illustrious man and reverend father in Christ, on the tenth of July. In it, you indicate what the will of Mr. Froschauer is regarding the printing of the Catechism, and that on the same day you wrote, after a severe and prolonged illness, you were restored by the Lord to the sacred chair.</p>
      <p>We congratulate you and especially the church of God from the heart. For these are indeed times when, if ever before, now especially the counsel and authority of serious, learned theologians who truly love holy peace are needed.</p>
