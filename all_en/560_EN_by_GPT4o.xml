      <p>S. D. I wrote to you a few days ago through our Hieronymus Empor, and there is nothing now to add to those letters, except that I commend to you once again this Johannes Juvenel or Jungius, already well known to you. Believe me, he stands out from the common lot of ministers of the church, whether you consider his piety or his learning. He would like, with your help, to be appointed to some literary school, whether in Aarau or Brugg, etc.; for the directors of the schools in those towns (if we hear correctly) are in need, although outside of his plan and request, I would prefer him to serve the Lord as a minister in his church, if there were any opportunity, even if he himself, for some reasons, would much prefer another function. Could you assist him in going to Aarau or Brugg, or wherever a school might be vacant; later, perhaps, a capable man will be needed; he could well be appointed to manage a church, as he truly has great gifts for it and is a fine, devout, capable little man; he is also a Swiss, so he will have less hostility to endure among your people.</p>
      <p>My brother-in-law Peter Scher writes to me again yesterday that the rumors are increasing among them about the war against the Swiss.</p>
      <p>By God's grace, however, it will perhaps all be quieted. Funklius himself, unless all is deceiving, will be forced to leave. The colonel said in Constance that he had locked the church to a certain priest, noting Jungius, about whom I wrote to you recently; to this one, that is Funklius, he could not lock the church, but he would lock his mouth. The bailiff has let it be known that no priest who was a preacher in Constance will be allowed to preach in Thurgau. The abbot and the bailiff, as well as the king, might easily be able to achieve this. Well, may God's will be done. Pray diligently for us. In the highest and greatest haste; I cannot write more now.</p>
      <p>For the sake of this Jungius, I write to you, whom I commend to you again and again, as much as I can. You will also see Curio, to whom our Haller and Musculus bear full testimony of piety and diligence.</p>
      <p>To his dear Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
