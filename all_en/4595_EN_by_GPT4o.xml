      <p>Greetings. I received your two letters and shared with the council what needed to be shared.</p>
      <p>We thank you for your faith and diligence. We understand from other sources as well that the leaders, instigated by the priests, are preparing many things against all evangelicals, whom they intend to eradicate once and for all; but they plan their strategies in such a way that they promise everything safe and friendly to these with the Carolina art, while they inflict violence on those, and once they are removed, they attack others. Friends from Augsburg write that 3,000 Spaniards dismissed in Belgium are being recruited again and Philip is expected in Antwerp.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the death of the French king disrupts their plans. It is certain that Navarre has been involved in the governance and his brother, Prince of Cond√©, a wise prince who had been a captive, is held in high esteem. This is similar to what happened when Emperor Valentinian was removed and Julian was elevated.</p>
      <p>The King of Sweden has also died; his son is assembling a large army and is thought to be doing this against the Danes. These events remind me of the words of the Lord in Matthew 24: "You will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed." Tomorrow, delegates will be appointed to Baden; for a larger council will be held. On the 23rd of this month, a stone was removed from the Bread Market by a decree of the council, which was seen by passersby and had been thrown into the council chamber by the Bernese during the Tigurine War and had been preserved there for over 114 years as a memorial. However, the council decided that in these turbulent times, such symbols of... discord do not contribute to the strengthening of friendship. I know this matter will be very displeasing to the Pagans; for now, they have boasted that they are quite certain that the people of Zurich and Bern will never truly unite, as this stone is a stone of provocation and offense, etc.</p>
      <p>I am not responding to your letters in order now; for I am writing this with difficulty. I have indeed recovered, that is, I am no longer bedridden and have preached once and again, but with difficulty, struggling and should not. Now, however, strength was most needed; for I completed the first book on councils, extended the second up to the Council of Basel; now the conclusion needed to be added. This same work also needs to be written in German.</p>
      <p>I had also planned to write about heaven, the right hand of God, and the ubiquity of the body of Christ in the words of the Lord in John 14: "In my Father's house," etc. But I do not know how it will go; God knows; to Him I entrust myself.</p>
      <p>I wish you, your dear wife, and our dear lords and friends, both mayors, Philipp, Pontasella, etc., many good years: God be faithfully with you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 27, in the year of our Lord 1561. Ludwig greets you.</p>
      <p>Bullinger to the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, most faithful minister of the church in Chur, esteemed and dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
