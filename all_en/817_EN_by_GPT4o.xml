      <p>Most honorable Bullinger. I had replied to your previous letters a few days ago, refuting all those slanders that those most wicked informers had most unjustly inflicted upon me.</p>
      <p>As soon as you receive them, please, I beg you, let me know. If they are not satisfactory to you, I will make an effort to provide better and more credible ones. I give eternal thanks to God and the Father, for making me worthy to bear the cross from all sides, not so much from strangers as from those who seem to be our closest friends, and I pray to Him, as I hope, that He will not allow me to be cast down in such great distress. Regarding the complaint that was between me and the legate, although it seemed to be sufficiently settled as far as I was concerned, it is now completely removed by his death. May God grant that his soul enjoys eternal blessings, just as I have always been of a sufficiently peaceful and inclined mind towards him, and since death itself resolves all things, it is not necessary for us, who remain, to further reopen such matters. However, I will mention this, to see if it can be arranged for me, in any way, to be restored to favor with those princes, so that I may be reinstated, to be of use to my nearly afflicted affairs and the Church of Christ, which would be easier to obtain, since it was only a matter of private affairs and of little importance that was disputed on both sides. If you can achieve anything in this matter, since you have great authority and favor with everyone, especially with Mr. Bucer and perhaps with the Archbishop of Canterbury, I beg you to leave no stone unturned to accomplish it.</p>
      <p>But since the matter is such that it cannot suffer any delay or postponement, it must be expedited, lest anything be attributed to us. I know your mind is most devoted to both Christ and me; therefore, I do not doubt that you will exceed my expectations in this matter.</p>
      <p>You will inform me of all these things (if it seems right to you) immediately and greet the other servants of Christ in my name. Farewell in the Lord and love me. Given in Padua, January 24, 1550.</p>
      <p>Always your most observant, whom you know. To the most vigilant minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, always to be honored as a lord and brother.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
