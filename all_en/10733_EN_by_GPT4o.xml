    <p xml:id="regest1">What Anton Sprüngli from Zurich claims to have read in a chronicle about the loss of a St. Gallen banner to the Appenzellers and has told in St. Gallen is as false as the claim by some Appenzellers that St. Gallen bought back the lost banner. Although the loss of a banner would not be dishonorable - after all, the Appenzellers also lost banners at Bregenz and Marignano - there is no need to defend against an obvious falsehood. However, to prevent any discord, Bullinger should speak confidentially with Sprüngli, dissuade him from spreading the false claim, arrange for the chronicle to be corrected, and report on the conversation with him.</p>

      <p>My ready, willing service beforehand.</p>
      <p>Especially dear lord and brother, a few days ago an honorable fellow from Zurich, named Anton Sprüngli, was sitting in our city with two trusted good fellows. He let it be known and said, among other things (when the conversation turned to those from Appenzell and our matters), that he knew well, having also read it in a Zurich chronicle, that years ago we from St. Gallen, along with several cities, lost our banner to those from Appenzell, etc. This statement spread so much that it reached my lords, who, as I have well heard, were somewhat troubled by such a statement, considering that it is known to them that such a thing never happened, and it has also been recorded by our forefathers how things went at that time, as well as reported and indicated by the chronicles and written histories of those from Appenzell. However, they assumed from hearsay that they had our banner, which they sought this year and could not find at all, nor could they sense anything else than that their chronicle reported correctly and that many people's talk and hearsay were wrong and false, not to mention that we supposedly took such a banner from them through trickery and deceit and bought it from their countrymen, as some unruly and rebellious people in the land of Appenzell have spread and fabricated against the will and pleasure of the authorities in recent days.</p>
      <p>Now I do not understand why my lords are so concerned about it, even if they did lose a banner and whether the truth lies here or there; after all, a hundred years ago and longer, we also won banners from several cities, which still lie in their places, which are no less honorable and respectable, and which do not prevent God from granting them victory and allowing such an accident to happen. Thus, the banner of those from Appenzell hangs in Bregenz in the church, which they themselves are well aware of, and they also know when and how it was lost; likewise, a small banner in Lyon, which they lost at Marignano, and they rightly consider themselves no less honorable people. Thus, we in St. Gallen would be no less honorable if we already had a lost banner lying with our neighbors from Appenzell. However, since we know well how it went, and this is also sufficiently reported in chronicles that have been published in print, and it is well known which cities' banners were lost at that time, there is no need to contradict the untruth.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my very friendly request to you is: please hold a confidential conversation with Sprüngli and listen to whether he said this and on what basis it happened, and thereby persuade him, for the sake of reasons that you can well assess, to refrain from such talk; for I would not like any discord, especially due to unfounded talk, to arise between us and you. Knowing that my mind is well inclined towards the honor and good of the city of Zurich, and I am pleased with the favorable will they show towards my lords, which, with God's help, should continue to increase and not diminish on our part. I would also like Sprüngli to correct his chronicle so that it matches other written chronicles that have been published in print on this point. With the desire, please let this letter remain with you, as it was written in confidence, and let me know again through common communication what you find out from Antonin.</p>
      <p>God be with us at all times. Amen.</p>
      <p>In St. Gallen, on the 3rd day of December, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Vadianus.</p>
