      <p>Greetings and Peace. I had planned to visit you after the Baden assembly; however, we are overwhelmed by so many warlike tumults that it was not possible. I hope, however, that it will be soon; for you know that another assembly has been called nearby, and you are not unaware of the reason, which I ask you, with all good men, to carefully and seriously consider, lest anything from it disturbs the public peace. You know the Emperor's schemes and how much he delights in civil discord. If I have any news, you will see it in the enclosed memorandum, so I do not add more; you may share and offer it, if you please, to the lords, among whom I greatly greet your lord consul Hab[ium], who is a good and upright man. Hastily from Solothurn, June 26.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bas[safontaneus] wrote. You know the margrave was again defeated, put to flight, and Schweinfurt was occupied and burned. Brunche... he again seizes tyranny in Germany, and the princes fear him more than the margrave before, and not without reason; for he is entirely imperial and a scoundrel, if ever there was one; you know the man.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
