      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Brothers and fathers in the Lord, most esteemed, I write late because I returned late. For I had to spend several days necessarily writing to the French churches and satisfying the inquiries of present friends, and there was no immediate opportunity to send my letters to you. The summary of our journey is this: The people of Schaffhausen and Basel agreed with what your most honorable council decided, namely that the Bernese should undertake this mission in the name of the Four Cities at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since this matter was concluded more quickly than we thought, it seemed that enough time was left for us to also test the minds of our neighbors, who could join the Bernese at court in a timely manner. We set out from Basel, some towards the Count of Montbéliard, others towards Strasbourg, so that as little delay as possible would be interposed. The Count, having promised us everything very kindly, was of the opinion that while the Swiss were negotiating with the king first, we should also solicit other German princes, especially those from whom that Pharaoh (the king) was requesting new aid at this very time. We later learned that the people of Strasbourg also agreed with this, and they further advised us that if we met with Melanchthon and other theologians gathered at Worms and obtained letters of recommendation from them, it would greatly help our cause with the princes. Thus, laden with letters from the Count and the people of Strasbourg, we went to Worms.</p>
      <p>On the way, we encountered the Margrave of Baden, who had not long ago embraced the gospel. Since we also had letters for him, we decided to greet him.</p>
      <p>He, having listened to us most kindly, gave us letters to the Duke of Württemberg and promised to do everything for the sake of the brothers. Then, when we arrived in Worms, with the people of Jena and Magdeburg already departed, we greeted Dr. Philipp (Melanchthon) and others.</p>
      <p>Since they spent almost the entire day partly in conversation and partly in writing, they kept us for three whole days, as the outcome showed, by the Lord's arrangement. These were Dr. Philipp, Brentius, Diller, Pistorius, Marbach, Andreas, and Karg. Finally, when we were given the opportunity to speak, and they understood the reasons for our arrival and conferred among themselves, Dr. Philipp said: "We sincerely grieve for the plight of our dearest brothers, and as much as it is in our power, we have decided to assist them in their struggles; however, we would prefer that they meet privately in homes and do not approve of any nocturnal gatherings, and regarding the Lord's Supper, we advise that the brothers there either abstain from it altogether or seek it in places where it can be freely and customarily administered. Moreover, although we are convinced that you are interceding for truly pious and Christian brothers, we still need a brief confession to send to our princes, so they clearly understand that we are advocating for brothers of the same religion. As for the article on the Lord's Supper, which might perhaps delay you, we will write about it in such a way that the princes understand that our churches are not different from yours because of it."</p>
      <p>This is what he said in summary.</p>
      <p>We, having conferred among ourselves, although we had suitable responses regarding those gatherings which they did not approve of, omitted that entire part and, after thanking them, only responded about the confession: We, not having suspected anything about it, have no prepared confession, but we ask that they accept Calvin's catechism, published in eight languages, as a confession, as it is taught in all foreign churches. Then Dr. Philipp again said: "We do not labor over the matter itself, for we know that you uphold the same doctrine, but you still need to draft a brief document in which you touch upon the main points in a few words, to counter various calumnies and rumors, and to satisfy the princes and perhaps some others who are more difficult. You have undoubtedly read the Augsburg Confession and the other one we presented to the Council of Trent. In those, we do not think you would condemn anything regarding the matters themselves, although some controversies still linger in the article on the Lord's Supper. You are certainly not Anabaptists, or Stenkfeldians, or Papists, nor do you abolish the matter of the sacrament, and we have previously told you what we intend to do in that matter." We replied that we would take counsel and the next day, when we met again, we presented them with that brief document, of which we send you a copy, and it is only in the name of the French churches. We hope that it, as it was accepted by them, will also be acceptable to you. For in such brevity and time constraint, we could not pursue anything extensively, and we strove to accommodate everything to peace and concord, without any prejudice to the truth. Therefore, having received their common letters to the Landgrave, the Palatine, the Duke of Württemberg, and the Count of Zweibrücken, we headed straight to Marburg. There, we were received and heard most kindly by the Landgrave and his son, and we received a response full of exceptional piety. From there, we ascended to Heidelberg to the Palatine, who, having honored us with the table of his nobles, called us to him after lunch and, through an interpreter (for he could not speak with us himself), informed us that shortly before our arrival, he had written to the king about this very matter, which he had learned from elsewhere, in such words that he thought his letters would have some weight in breaking those attacks. However, he said he was entirely willing to send a delegation with the other princes at the earliest opportunity, and since he believed that the burden of organizing the delegation would fall on him, he asked for a period of three days to deliberate, so that we could go to the Duke of Württemberg and the Count of Zweibrücken with a full response. Here, however, we were somewhat hindered by a man of no small authority, one of those who would gladly hand us over to Satan himself if it were in their power. But good patrons were not lacking for a good cause.</p>
      <p>Thus, truth finally prevailed, and on the seventh day, having received an excellent response, we proceeded to Stuttgart. From there, to the Thermal Springs, where the Duke of Württemberg was then hunting with his relative from Brandenburg. He, being most gracious, and as far as we could discern, very diligent in conducting business, although we had brought him a huge pile of papers, nevertheless read them all before nightfall (for we had arrived at dinner time) and ordered us to return home at first light. "For I willingly take on this burden," he said, "and I will ensure that all the delegates meet at Montbéliard shortly, and from there, with specific mandates according to your wishes, proceed directly to the king. As for the Count of Zweibrücken, since you would have to divert quite far, and I have no doubt about his willingness, know that I will also diligently take care of this matter."</p>
      <p>Thus, having received his permission, we returned by the shortest routes to Strasbourg, then to Basel, and finally, by God's grace, each of us arrived home safe and sound. This is the summary of our mission, the outcome of which remains to be commended to God with constant prayers. Moreover, since we promised when departing from you that we would ensure our confession was more fully explained, we did not neglect this either, as we explicitly wrote that we except the article on the Lord's Supper, as it is set forth in the Augsburg Confession. But we also took this opportunity to converse with all those theologians and with most of them about peace and concord. We found that there are three things in which not all, but some, disagree with us, yet they do so calmly and moderately.</p>
      <p>The first is not what the matter of the sacrament is (for it is agreed among us that Christ himself, with his gifts, is offered to be communicated to us in the Supper) but what the connection of the sign with the matter is, that is, the bread with the body and the wine with the blood. For they want the body to be with the bread, in the bread, or under the bread, while we say it is in heaven, and yet the distance of places does not hinder it from being most present to faith, and truly offered to be communicated to us, and truly received by the faithful through faith, by the incomprehensible power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>The second is: not whether the matter is also offered to the unbelievers (for it is agreed among us that the sacraments are not nullified by human unbelief) but whether the unbelievers also receive the matter offered. For they say this because they couple the matter with the sign in an indivisible bond, while we say that the promises, whether bare or clothed with the sacrament, that is, Christ himself with his gifts, are received by faith alone, and therefore those who do not bring this instrument to this action are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, offered indeed but not received, nay, rather despised and trampled underfoot.</p>
      <p>The third is: what are the attributes of the glorified body, and how did Christ ascend into heaven and yet is with us until the end of the age. And these are indeed, as you know much better than I, matters of great weight and importance, but nevertheless, if agreement is reached on the first question, the other two will dissolve by themselves, and necessarily vanish, and I hope that ubiquity will find very few patrons. Why I hope this, I have reasons which I would prefer to explain to you in person, certainly we found no one who objected to our confession as contrary to our agreement, or who understood it differently than it was written by us, that is, by Dr. Farel and me, and recently more fully explained to you.</p>
      <p>But if any of the more obstinate ones should object to it in the future, it will be our task to interpret it: which we will indeed do, if necessary, so that it will clearly appear not only not to support them, but also to openly refute those previous errors. But I hope for much better things.</p>
      <p>For, to conclude briefly, we found a most candid spirit in them, whose authority is rightly held in high esteem among all learned men, and we heard from their own mouths words that give us the best hope, not only of a synod, unless it is hindered by us, but also of future concord and peace. For so far from that extreme harshness of some making others more learned and moderate either more hostile to us or less inclined to some holy colloquy, they seem, on the contrary, much more eager for the peace of the churches than ever before, even for this reason, that they may be led to some milder counsel by our mutual agreement. Nor are the more sound theologians alone in this will, but now also not a few of the most pious and greatest princes, as we have learned from many arguments in person. I certainly do not doubt to confirm to you as most certain that the Frankfurt assembly, held last year, was delayed for some time and then extended for this reason also, that that prince, whom Farel and I mentioned to you when we returned from the previous mission, hoped that someone would appear there in the name of the upper churches, as he had requested, with whom a way of establishing some agreement of concord could be discussed. Although no one from our side was sent there, which I wish had been done, yet by the consensus of the pious princes, I know it was decided that, after the Worms colloquy was concluded, they would meet again, and to that assembly, the upper churches would also be invited in some convenient and honorable manner. Since these things are so, and the wonderful Lord has scattered the plans of those who wanted us destroyed, and has inclined the wills of others not a little towards peace, it seems indeed that the afflicted church of God is, as it were, with its voice, awakening each of us at this time, and demanding from us by its right that each of us, by all means, now urge this matter with those whose will and authority it is fitting for this whole action to be undertaken and administered. Certainly, if, having been invited by those whom it was also fitting for us to ask, we refuse to come or do not bring a similar desire for peace, I do not see how we can excuse our supine tardiness before God, the undoubted leader and author of these plans, before the consciences of so many weak ones, before so many foreign churches, which are especially cruelly harassed under this pretext. But it is not at all necessary to exhort you at length to this matter, whose doctrine, combined with singular piety and prudence, is certain not to fail the church of God in such a necessary time.</p>
      <p>So let this be said about these things.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Worms colloquy, all who are involved in the action have sworn silence.</p>
      <p>It is conducted in writing, not by voice, and each side's writings are kept with their own writings so that a judgment may finally be made from the comparison. But what will that judgment be, and who will sit as judges? The Saxons requested that before the meeting, by the common consent of the pious, the Majorists, Adiaphorists, Osiandrists, and Zwinglians be condemned. The response was clear regarding the first three.</p>
      <p>For Major has long since satisfied everyone except them: they invent Adiaphorists for themselves, whose leader they do not dare to name, whom they nevertheless especially targeted in that accusation. Osiander's heresy has been sufficiently exploded by the common consent of the churches and even by published books. Regarding those they called Zwinglians, the response from others, both the princes' delegates (such as those of Augustus, the Palatine, the Landgrave, the Duke of Württemberg, and several others), and also from the theologians we met, was that it was too untimely to renew those dissensions, that they were not judges of the churches, nor had they come to condemn them, especially without a case being heard, that they should rather strive for peace, and seek a way to settle discord among pious and learned men. But they not only did not acquiesce, but also departed, having deposited a written condemnation of us, and, as I hear, with the adversaries. What they are plotting is quite apparent, and even Philipp has experienced it, to whom the King of Denmark and Augustus himself wrote back rather harshly, as I learned from his own mouth. But these are indeed Satan's plans, fearing not a little from that future colloquy, which we hope for.</p>
      <p>May the Lord restrain him and suggest a strong spirit to the pious princes, that they may persevere in that holy purpose of theirs, and by common counsel restrain the authors of dissensions. Meanwhile, the adversaries, having seized this very opportunity, are more and more evasive.</p>
      <p>Our side, on the other hand, insists, and denies that the princes will give the king even a penny hereafter unless the colloquy proceeds. While these things are being disputed, Dr. Philipp, with his son-in-law, utterly exhausted, and very saddened by the death of his wife, came to Heidelberg, where we were, to refresh his spirit, intending to return to Worms immediately.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve him in such a necessary time. What the outcome of that colloquy will be, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Our side certainly dared not hope for anything good from it. Furthermore, we received this from Paris.</p>
      <p>Three were first burned in September, among whom was a certain matron, very noble in both birth and piety, professing her faith to her last breath with all signs, while her tongue was cut off and a burning torch was most shamefully and cruelly applied to her private parts. These three were shortly followed by two other most valiant athletes, and finally also two others on the 23rd of October, among whom was a very young man, whose incredible doctrine and constancy greatly struck even the most savage executioners.</p>
      <p>Since that time, we hear that, after reading the Palatine's letters, some judicial reprieves have been granted. Most of the captives continue very bravely, so much so that the one who excels among all the captive women in both nobility of birth and abundance of friends, has flatly rejected the pardon offered by the king, spurning even her own and her parent's and husband's prayers and tears, certainly worthy of being commended to the Lord by name. She is called Lady de Rentigny, from her husband's name, who carries the banner of the Duke of Guise.</p>
      <p>Her father is the Lord of Rembouillet, in whose castle King Francis died. May the Lord grant her to persevere to the end.</p>
      <p>The church nevertheless continues to meet, but not so frequently, with most dispersed among other churches. But the ministers certainly guard the flock bravely, among whom our Galasius still moves. We are amazed that the Swiss delegates remain there so long, and the Germans delay so long.</p>
      <p>In Auvergne and Provence, two churches have grown from the ruins of Anduze, to which we have also sent ministers. Toulouse, vexed by plague and famine, pays the penalty for its cruelty.</p>
      <p>In Piedmont, they progress with remarkable success. These are, dearest and most esteemed fathers and brothers, what I thought should be written to you at this time. May the Lord Jesus continue to confirm you with his holy spirit and bless your holy labors more and more. All the colleagues pray for grace and peace from the Lord for you.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, November 24.</p>
      <p>Th. Beza, most devoted to your piety.</p>
