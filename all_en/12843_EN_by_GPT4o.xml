    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Wunderlich has understood the concern of Bullinger's letter [not received]. May God have mercy on His own and increase their faith!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Wunderlich has explained the whole matter in a letter to the ambassador of the French King Francis I, who is currently on his way [to the Swiss Confederation], and suggested obtaining a mandate from the king immediately in this regard, because otherwise the ambassador would not know what would become of the matter if he took charge of things at Lake Constance. The French are not very reliable among themselves, so they do not necessarily consider the proposals of good people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Wunderlich would have stayed out of the matter if it were not in service to God. Therefore, he intends to do everything for it. Immediately after the ambassador's arrival, he will seek him out and advocate for the welfare of the Swiss Confederation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The ambassador in question is the sieur de Lyancourt [Guillaume Du Plessis]. 26 years ago, he served [Louis de Forbin] sieur de Soliers [and] his brother [Charles Du Plessis, sieur de Savonnières], who was then the king's ambassador in the Swiss Confederation. Wunderlich knows him well. He is a friendly and pious man. As soon as he has responded, Bullinger will be informed by Wunderlich's own messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Wunderlich is gladly proving himself useful to God in this matter. May He grant Bullinger and his colleagues strength and perseverance. In haste.</p>

      <p>My humble, willing service along with all that I can offer you, honorable, gracious, dear sir. I have understood your letter with great heartache. May Almighty God have mercy on all His believers and increase their faith, so that we may be found in His will.</p>

      <p>I am currently writing on the post of the king's ambassador, whom he (the King) is now sending out, all from myself, the whole matter with the addition, if he had not wanted to, to handle it, so that it is immediately sent to the king, and the ambassador is sent an answer and authority; for he is for himself, neither a servant to the king. He then forsakes the matters at Lake Constance, and yet does not know how or what will be handled in it! For the French are entirely untrustworthy among themselves, and even if an honest man presents them with some truth, they despise it; not that I have caused it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I was willing to completely withdraw from the dealings. But since I can sense that I can serve God in it, no ill will, cost, or effort shall deter me, and as soon as the Frenchman arrives, I will immediately approach him and apply all possible diligence, so that in this and other matters, what may benefit the Swiss Confederation will be handled.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The ambassador on the road is called Monsieur de Lyancourt. He was with the lord of Soliers and his brother, a pot of the king in the Swiss Confederation, 26 years ago. I know him very well. He is not malicious and is inclined towards pious matters. Whatever response comes to me at any time, I will send to you secretly and immediately by my own messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>God, who is all truth, knows that I gladly wish to serve Him in these dealings. May He grant you and all His servants grace, that you may steadfastly endure to the end in your position and knowledge. Dated in haste at Neuenburg, the 4th day of February, in the year 1547. Your willing servant always, Hans Wunderlich.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Grossmünster of the city of Zurich, my honorable, dear lord, to his own hands.</p>
