      <p>Venerated father, as the courier was about to depart from us, I hastily wrote these lines and ordered the ones I had written to the Landgrave to be quickly copied.</p>
      <p>Please excuse the haste, if you will. I have received the Chronicle of Gottfried of Viterbo.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you have Hunibald on the matters of the Franks, and Mamertinus, and Jacobus de Voragine, I ask you to send them as soon as possible, as I had requested in previous letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell, venerated father, and be well. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Gwalter, greetings, to whom, if you please, you may show the enclosed note, so that, if it seems appropriate to you, it may later be sent to Mr. Stettan.</p>
      <p>Geneva, April 20th, on which day the snow covering our fields brought us great sorrow. Your most devoted Hotman.</p>
      <p>To the venerated and most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
