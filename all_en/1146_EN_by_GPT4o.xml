      <p>I recently wrote to you, most illustrious man, three letters and informed you about some matters that are happening in Italy.</p>
      <p>Now, since the occasion has arisen where I am sending my own messenger to Chur (as we are miserably harassed here by the Papists on one side and the Anabaptists on the other), I wanted to send these to you now. In summary: Italy has never felt such oppression and persecution as it does now. Satan, that is the Pope, is completely raging and raving with his followers. He often drags many into prison, often banishes many to the galleys, and often throws them onto the pyre. Many flee and rush to me, tattered and half-dead; I bear this burden as I can, but certainly, I will not be able to bear it much longer. If only something good would come from England for the salvation of these brothers! For I am not anxious about myself. I think you have heard that the bull of the council was offered to the Emperor, in which the bishops (I mean the Papists) are invited, indeed compelled, to appear in Trento on the first of May as papal instruments to condemn the Gospel; for whoever does not see that this will happen sees nothing.</p>
      <p>But listen, how he himself daily reveals his impious thoughts more openly. For not only has he approved the book with an issued letter, about which I wrote, but he has also issued a bull, a copy of which I have with me and will bring to you, in which he threatens his creatures, namely the bishops, not to read any of our books at all. And he will send them ignorant of our cause, unlearned, impious, rude donkeys to the council. But I am about to publish (I hope within 20 days, it is now under the press) a book in which I reveal to all of Europe some horrible and incredible plots and deceptions of these demons. I am thinking of coming to you; for I consider it necessary for the salvation of the churches and the glory of God. Farewell, most reverend brothers, and pray for us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you from evil.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, the day after Epiphany 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius, servant of Jesus Christ.</p>
