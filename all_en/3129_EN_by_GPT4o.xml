      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I confess, most honorable man, lord and brother Bullinger, dearest in Christ, that I am very, very negligent in writing letters to friends. I can hardly remember when I last sent you a letter. Please forgive me for this negligence and interpret it in a good way. I am often without opportunity, and rarely do those who claim they are going to you present themselves. Nevertheless, my love for you remains intact and covered. I have published my dialectic again, which I had also published fourteen(?) years ago. For many have urged me strongly from various places for many years to do this. Therefore, the wishes of good and learned men had to be fulfilled. I wish it may turn out well and be of great benefit to the name of the Lord and the church of the saints, which is my sole wish. If I escape the slanders of the critics and detractors, it is a wonder; for I have freely professed the truth, which is usually fiercely and improperly resisted by the children of this age. We all ought to do this, who are called to the profession of the liberal arts, so that they may become Christian and cease to be pagan; but we are mostly so perverse that we think Christianity should be kept far away from the arts. Experience has finally taught me to feel very differently; for all the arts can be taught in such a way that religion is perceived and instilled into the tender minds of children at the same time. But we are so immersed in profane matters that we hardly admit the sacred ones. I am also sending you a copy, which declares my grateful mind towards you; for I have received many things from you, which have been useful to me up to now and will also be in the future (if it is so seen by the Lord). Please take it kindly and fairly, and in Christ Jesus our Lord, farewell most happily together with all yours.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel on the day before Reminiscere in the year of human salvation 1557. Keep us and our churches commended in your most pious prayers.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man in sacred letters, Master Heinrich Bullinger, residing in Zürich, the most noble metropolis of the Swiss, teacher of divine oracles, his lord and brother in Christ, to be respected. Zürich.</p>
