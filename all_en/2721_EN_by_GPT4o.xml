      <p>Greetings. Our courier informed me that my previous letters, which I had sent to Zurzach, did not reach you, and that you would write through your people who were going to visit the wedding of Count Georg; whether this has happened or not, I do not know, for I have not seen any. I have diligently pursued the collection for the people of Locarno, and our people do not show themselves to be difficult, provided they understand what and in what manner has been done by the other evangelical orders; therefore, they have given this task to the delegates going to the Baden assembly, to explore this matter diligently. From the Augsburg assembly, the brothers wrote to me that everything is still uncertain; Ferdinand is seeking a postponement and promises a book that will declare such moderation in religion, which he does not doubt will be tolerable and acceptable to both parties, a new Interim indeed. However, what the princes will respond and accept is in the hand of Him who governs the hearts of kings.</p>
      <p>In Piedmont, they report that the siege of the city of St. James was disgracefully abandoned by the imperial army, although they had battered it with strong machines, and that the Viceroy of Naples was killed by a cannonball. The bearer of this letter will tell the lamentable story of the English bishop's fate, for whom we must pray to the Lord, that he may maintain an unbroken spirit in such grave calamity, as we have heard he has done so far. But farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 8th of September, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
