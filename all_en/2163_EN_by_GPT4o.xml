      <p>S. P. I have received your letters and give you my utmost thanks for being so cautious and diligent in sending my letters to Vergerius. I have very bad news regarding England: the Spanish marriage is certainly concluded, and the Queen of England has already sent nine cargo ships to Spain with her envoys to summon the prince, and with them, he will come around March. May God be with all good people. But believe me, this is something to be greatly feared by you and by us, and everyone should rush to extinguish this fire. On the 20th of the previous month, that queen ordered it to be publicly proclaimed that no one should speak of the Spaniards, the Emperor, or her marriage under penalty of death. I am now setting out to visit my home and household; but I have only obtained twenty days from the king. I will be back immediately; my people remain here, among them my secretary, who will have the same authority as I do. He is the one who recently visited you. If anything comes from you, he will send it to me in good faith; if you have anything from our Ver[gerius], please send it to him and pray for me. Farewell, most excellent one. From Solothurn, January 18th. In haste.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bass[a]f[ontaneus].</p>
      <p>The people of England and the entire nobility are making great efforts to prevent this marriage, and it is hoped to be dissolved; however, the Emperor's money is very influential; the Pope also, who is entirely against us, is vigilant against us for the Spaniards.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and friend, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>To be delivered to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
