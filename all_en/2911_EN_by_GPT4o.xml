      <p>We confess that we owe you not a little, most illustrious man, both because we are aided by your pious labors in the church, and because our care is particularly taken by you. For although you respond privately to one, we know that your response pertains to all of us, indeed to the whole church. We know indeed that those matters were not of such great importance (since they could also be learned from your other writings), that we would hinder you, occupied with other matters more pertinent to edification, with such questions. However, complying with the wishes of some curious rather than pious individuals, we requested this response from you, whose authority they also confessed to be moved by. Therefore, we ask that we be held excused by you (if perhaps there is any suspicion about us). Then we also give you the greatest thanks, most illustrious man, for having complied with our wishes, diverting yourself from serious matters to lighter ones. God, who is the author of peace, will not make your labor in vain, which you also intended for the reconciliation of peace. It is also pleasing to us that among other things you mention the doctrines of the impious Servetus and others, for we know that these private testimonies will be of no small benefit to men not so obstinate, and we have recently experienced this in one, who in our recent synod in Pinczów publicly confessed that he was recalled by your letters from the horrendous delusions of Servetus concerning the incarnation of the Son of God. What you lastly write to us about the sacramental matter, although we have long been instructed and taught by your writings, which we delight in, and we all subscribe to your opinion, it is nonetheless significant that you piously and diligently admonish us and urge us to retain purity in all things.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most humane man, not the least ornament of the church. May the Lord and our Savior preserve you unharmed for a long time for the glory of His holy name.</p>
      <p>Given at Pinczów on the 3rd of May in the year of our Lord 1556. [From the date in another script; Auth.?] Felix Cruciger Scebressinius, superintendent of the reborn church of Christ in Lesser Poland, in the name of all ministers and nobles united in the faith of Jesus Christ.</p>
