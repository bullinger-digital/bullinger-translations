      <p>The journey which I had undertaken at this time, I have now, by the grace of God, for the most part completed. So that in Bern we could see those things worthy of observation, your letters to the most excellent man, Mr. Haller, made it possible.</p>
      <p>But what shall I say about Mr. Calvin, Beza, Jonvillier, and others who, as soon as they recognized your handwriting, immediately offered us their assistance.</p>
      <p>Although indeed Mr. Calvin was so busy that he could scarcely converse with us on a few matters: yet what he did contribute is so pleasing that scarcely anything more could be desired.</p>
      <p>Then, after three days, we departed from Geneva towards Basel through Solothurn, and arrived here on the 2nd of this month.</p>
      <p>And now, what remains of the journey, we will complete shortly, God willing.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I ask that you do not disdain to address me with your letters before I depart for my homeland.</p>
      <p>If you wish to send them to me before the fair, which I would very much like, I think they should be sent here to Basel to the house of Oporinus to Andreas of Basel, the Pole, who will easily forward them to me.</p>
      <p>If you wish to send them to the fair, Froschauer can bring them.</p>
      <p>Farewell, therefore, most learned man.</p>
      <p>May you keep our churches commended in your prayers to God.</p>
      <p>I ask you to greet your most honorable wife in my name, and no less to convey my many greetings to your sons and sons-in-law.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, August 14, 1563.</p>
      <p>I ask you to forgive the roughness of the letters, certainly in this journey I was deprived of the time to provide more polished ones.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, entirely, Wenzeslaus von Ostroróg.</p>
      <p>To the reverend man, outstanding in piety and singular learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of God in Zürich, most esteemed lord and father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Letters of the noble Polish man Wenzeslaus von Ostroróg 1563.</p>
