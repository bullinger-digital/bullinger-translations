      <p>Greetings. You have a living letter from our Zanchi.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is no need for more words.</p>
      <p>You will understand from him what you wish to hear about Bernardino. He was with him in Basel.</p>
      <p>What I have from Bern, I have enclosed here; but I would not want them to be spread; therefore, you will keep them to yourself.</p>
      <p>I hear the last session was held on the day of the Conception of Mary, from which I conjecture that more were held this year than we have been able to attend.</p>
      <p>Therefore, ensure that you encourage all friends to communicate to us what they receive from there.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that I have not received any letters from you today; but I attribute this to your business.</p>
      <p>Mr. Zanchi will be very useful to the church of God in those parts; but I fear that the papist adversaries will pursue him with all kinds of hatred and devise plans on how to expel him from the place.</p>
      <p>However, the Lord is stronger than to be overcome by those talkers.</p>
      <p>Return what I recently sent to you, especially the articles of Bernardino.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell together with all yours.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Consuls, Gallicius, and Pontasella. December 10, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
