    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses gratitude for the publication of various works by Bullinger. [Lutheran] agitators have enforced an almost papist form of the Mass and ordination [in East Frisia]; most pastors were forced to adopt these rites. However, he himself is not willing to allow practices that lead the common people into idolatry. Describes the manner of celebrating the Lord's Supper that he introduced in Borssum eight years ago. Bullinger should improve it if he deems it necessary; Aquilomontanus sees him as his mentor and would have visited him long ago if he could afford it. He also seeks his advice regarding the improvement of church discipline among the Frisians, who are like the Jews; he would gladly exchange letters with him annually. Wishes to know how [in Zurich] admission to the Lord's Supper is regulated, and praises Bullinger for placing so much value on repentance; the widespread lack of repentance is mainly due to the poor example set by the pastors. Recommends himself to him and names Christoph Froschauer as a possible letter carrier. Sends greetings to Leo Jud and asks him to be urged to continue his efforts on Zwingli's posthumous works. Inquires about the Lord's Supper negotiations with the people of Strasbourg; cannot understand why certain people remain unteachable even after the publication of Bullinger's "De origine erroris" and Vadian's "Aphorisms," and sends greetings to Vadian. Sends greetings to Konrad Pellikan, whose Bible commentaries only the wealthy can afford in this country. Also sends greetings to all others with whom he and his brothers feel united in faith. They would be pleased if Bullinger participated in the Nuremberg Religious Discussion, although he himself does not expect peace from it; he implores him to do everything possible to ensure that consciences are not led into new bondage under the pretext of unity. Wishes to know what he thinks of Sebastian Franck, who, among other things, is gaining much attention with his "Paradoxa." Asks for forgiveness for his long, artless writing. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Hermann Aquilomontanus to Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church in Switzerland.</p>
      <p>I thank you, most learned man, on behalf of the brothers, for daily refreshing us with new and spiritual works, for kindling the light, renewing the Holy Spirit, and suggesting sound doctrine without ostentation. Continue, truly lovable man, to serve not only the Zurich church but the entire Catholic church. We have received here Paul illuminated by your sound commentaries, which all the pious in Holland and Frisia rejoice at heart, while the impious and elementary are greatly refuted. We have received the infancy and growth of the Christian church in the Acts of the Apostles renewed by you. We expect by God's grace the Gospels enriched with the best and most spiritual homilies, which indeed you will not deny to the prayers of the brothers, and although many have attempted the same, they desire your spirit and the thread of your discourse in that work. We have received many works elaborated with utmost vigilance in a short time: On the Truth and Authority of Sacred Scripture, the Institution and Function of a Bishop, which work I wish you had dedicated to another, a work worthy of a theologian. Recently, a divine work necessary for the Christian church on the Origin of Error concerning the Saints and the Eucharist was offered. Praise to Almighty God, who inspired this work in your mind, so that errors shown some years ago are now exposed to all eyes and the light shines in the darkness, so that none but the obstinate can err.</p>
      <p>It is amazing to say how our churches are disturbed by the elementary and new Galatians, who have come here twice or thrice to reform the church, greatly disturbed it, and finally showed what they sought. They sought money and glory, not Christ nor peace. They greatly disturbed a well-instituted church adorned with apostolic ceremonies, expelled the best and pious men from their seats, instituted a Mass that smacks of papism in place of the breaking of bread, and established ordination against Christian liberty. I cannot sufficiently wonder why they so abhor the institution of Christ and apostolic usage, while they attack papism with all their might. All laugh and mock those who do not follow them in everything. They desire to dominate, not to serve, and finally obtained that their rites are observed here in the temples by the order of the magistrate, and many pious (if they do not wish to wander) are compelled to observe them.</p>
      <p>I indeed freely confess to you, my esteemed teacher, that I cannot agree with them in everything, although we preach free ceremonies. For how shall we draw the simple people away from idolatry if the mode of idolatry remains? If we put into their mouths papistic bread marked with an idol, vestments, candles, altars, idols, in the manner of papists? You know, most excellent man, that the people depend on ritual, not on knowledge. I hold free ceremonies for time and place; yet I cannot keep and teach those by which the people of God are held in unbelief as free.</p>
      <p>It is now the eighth year that I have been a pastor in the smallest village of East Frisia, called from the lantern seat by the best patron, who exercises free jurisdiction in some villages; nothing has changed there, although often attempted by the greater and superior to join others. I have cleansed the temple, removed idols, altars, pictures, replaced convenient seats for hearing the word, duly adorned the table for the supper, not expensively, but neatly, a tablecloth is spread, white bread is placed in a pewter vessel, which I use at home, a purified pewter cup is drunk from, it is administered in common and decent dress, after hearing the sermon all compose themselves for prayer, they confess the faith with the heart, which I pronounce distinctly and clearly, submitting to evangelical correction they approach the table, sit, hearing the words of the supper they take the bread placed there by the minister into their hands, which I break into parts while administering. If the number is greater than one table, the first rise, the rest compose themselves at the table in the same way, hearing the same, doing the same. After the ceremony of the supper is succinctly completed, I admonish what befits a Christian; after these are completed, the church gives thanks to the Lord with one voice, sings. I began this manner with the best counsel at the beginning, I have decided to keep it to the end.</p>
      <p>You have the manner of our supper, which I know you will approve. However, if you wish to add anything with your spirit for the edification of the church, I pray you to do so; for I have chosen you as a teacher in these matters and the doctrine of Christ, whom I would have visited before now, if age and purse had not clearly commanded me to stay at home. Driven from paternal inheritance and seats, I am forced to live in remote exile and poverty. I spent my youth among sophists (as the letter indicates), now at fifty gathering grapes. I have seized Christ as the only savior, I preach him, inculcate him, secure in his merits I await death.</p>
      <p>Now with all my might and the counsel of the best, I am compelled to restore censures and correction in the church, which indeed is a labor before me, as if I seem to row against the current. Here I desire your counsel, how a simple, yet by nature stubborn people can be gradually induced to bear the yoke of the Lord. For I have often compared the Frisians to the Jews, whom they imitate in dress and ornament.</p>
      <p>If you saw them, you would swear by Isaiah that the whole world had taken women from them, since all of Frisia, who are not married to foreigners and do not wish to dishonor their nation, are dressed in red, wear bracelets on their hands, red stockings, and a head covering made in a singular way; this is the primary garment. If anything in this has been left by you or the best memory of Zwingli, I wish to see it. For your spirit and zeal for the church of Christ, I ask you to assist your disciple here and briefly state what should be done here; if you do so, we will correspond by letters once a year, even though we are very far apart.</p>
      <p>You will not only teach me but many churches, who daily praise God in you.</p>
      <p>I would like you to add the manner properly observed at the supper with you, whether you hear each one separately in conversion when they first approach, or entrust each to their conscience after sound doctrine. Here not the least care of the pastor is desired, in my judgment, since many admit all without selection, which I think should not be done, but once well-instructed and taught what it is to be a Christian, they should freely approach, lest we again strive with ceremonies made Jews and papists and bear the name of Christ in vain, having messengers for lords and judges for the judged. Moreover, before conversion and repentance, they show themselves as Christians, when they have not yet conceived the fear of the Lord from his mercy nor ever felt the love of truth. You act excellently, venerable teacher, who always begin with true repentance and clear the new field before you sow; indeed, in the prologue of the Origin, so that we may stand praying in the fear of the Lord, which is indeed rare here, since many wash their mouths with historical faith, few purify their hearts with true faith. I have often proclaimed the cause to be the pastors, in whom they see no sign of repentance (besides bare words), feel no care for souls, nor experience a spark of the spirit.</p>
      <p>They profess to be evangelicals, when they scarcely know what the gospel is. They run before they are sent, pressed by poverty and sloth. Having obtained office, they show themselves as lords, not ministers. Writing this, I blush and impose an end to the letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell, therefore, esteemed teacher, and consider this trivial letter for the love of Christ. I know you are occupied with greater matters, so that you do not have time to devote to these trifles; but not always with the learned, but sometimes with the unlearned, so that they may become learned, time must be spent. I have often tried, but finally dared to appeal to you and give thanks, so that you may know that you serve not only the Swiss but foreign nations not without fruit. Farewell, most pious of men, and place your Hermann among those who daily praise God for the gifts bestowed upon you. If you do not disdain to teach and instruct me and the church of our nation by letters, give letters to Christoph Froschauer or his servant at the Frankfurt fairs; I will entrust my trifles to him through merchants. But if you reject this writing, as it deserves, and pray for me and the church entrusted to me, I would like.</p>
      <p>Greet Leo Jud diligently from me. Give thanks that he has brought many of Zwingli's works to light; urge the man not to allow any of the works of such a great man to perish in neglect.</p>
      <p>We have heard with uncertain report that you have conferred with the people of Strasbourg and other preachers of Germany on the rite of the supper and the manner of the presence of the body of Christ in the bread. We desire to know what was done in that conference. I hope you all concluded as you wrote in the book On the Origin of Error concerning the Eucharist and the Mass in the last codex. I cannot sufficiently marvel at the blindness of some great men and, to speak more truly, their obstinacy and pertinacity, who, lest they be called inconstant anywhere, stubbornly defend what they have once conceived. Here they gradually lower their feathers and crests, clearly proposed by you and Joachim Vadian's Aphorisms; yet, because they have once begun to speak, they cannot be silent and stick in the same mud, as it is said. Announce greetings to Vadian in the name of the brothers here, who with an intrepid mind proposed the whole matter thoroughly and from the origin, so that many may act and speak more mildly and circumspectly.</p>
      <p>Announce greetings to Konrad Pellikan, a pious man given by God, with your words from my heart, who now opens to the whole world with what vigilance he has read the sacred volumes and with what spirit he has put on Christ; his volumes are bought here everywhere, but by the rich, since they are large and sold dearly. We are twice miserable here, first poor, then, if anything is to be bought, it must be paid for double, so that many are content to stand with one codex.</p>
      <p>To the other comrades and our brothers in the Lord Jesus Christ, announce in the name of all the brothers the increase of spirit and constancy in the divine work; for we are of one faith and sense from the origin of the gospel. It is fitting, therefore, that you extend mutual hands to us, lest the unity, which the Lord left uniquely commended, be torn apart.</p>
      <p>About to fold the letter, it comes to mind that I first decided to write that we all with all our hearts desire to know whether you are one of the elect called to the Nuremberg synod, from which many hope for peace in the church of Christ, unity of faith and ceremonies. I indeed, to speak what I feel, hope for no peace in the church of Christ, since our Lord left not peace but a cross on earth and the word of the cross of the crucified, nor will it ever be that the world will take up the yoke of Christ or receive the spirit of truth. Meanwhile, I predict the greatest disturbance in the church if they wish to prescribe to all there how it should be done in all churches, and do not leave free what Christ left free. Venerable teacher and brother in the wounds of Christ, you will be present there or at least your writings will be read there; I pray, beseech, and solemnly adjure by Christ crucified for us, not to initiate the snare of anyone's conscience or consent that it be done. From this future synod, many have appealed to Christ, to the liberty bought with the cross, to the sacred letters; why is it not allowed here what is allowed in all other past ones?</p>
      <p>Stand firm, my brother, as you have excellently begun in the prologue of Errors. First, let the greater ones repent and then show themselves truly converted and given to God. Let them give the church its pristine liberty, commit it to be governed by the Holy Spirit, and profess to be spiritual, which done, the best reformation is begun. Many object to my sense. "It is necessary," they say, "to have uniform ceremonies, by which the simple people are led by the hand and kept in duty; these free the synod will hand over to the churches not as a snare of consciences, but as an exercise of the body." Many and great assent to this reasoning and testify by published books that it must be done. However, if anyone desires to remain in the simplicity of the primitive church, they judge him a disturber, author of a sect, disobedient, obstinate, unwilling to have peace with all, but a wild singular to be driven from the forest, lest he infect others. Do you hear with what liberty they prescribe their ceremonies? In this way, the papistic church began, when the pastors of the churches were compelled under the pretext of peace and unity to join the multitude, and what was free at the beginning, finally became law, so that no one dares to speak. Truly Satan lies in wait for us with a thousand tricks, to oppress the liberty of Christ, to make us slaves again to men. We must be vigilant, lest he ensnare us with his wiles, even if he appears under the guise of an angel, peace, unity, and piety. Let us remain in the simplicity that is in Christ Jesus, with a clear voice proclaim repentance and conversion of heart (without which all is feigned), insist on prayer, almsgiving, inculcate works of charity. All these will be easy if first Christ rules in hearts with his spirit and impresses divine fear, then the Eucharist will be easily instituted, nor will a Christian desire any other rite than that handed down by the Lord, he will make light of all human masks knowing that God is not delighted in what blind men rejoice. May the Lord give the Holy Spirit to the leaders of this synod, that they may not be moved from Christ by hope and fear and may strive more to lay aside all papistic things than to support them, to keep the liberty of Christ bought with blood inviolate. Amen. I have spoken more boldly than is fitting to him from whom I ought to be taught; yet you will consider it kindly for the love of Christ, which bears all things, especially the weak. A new author of great spirit and varied reading, Sebastian Franck, here with his Paradoxes and other writings pushes the old from the bridge; he is seized, read by all both for the sake of novelty and for the new and unheard things he proposes. Yet many pious here are offended in many things, especially in the doctrine of the freedom of the will, of Christ, whom he affirms more as an index and messenger of salvation than a savior. I indeed have bought nothing of this and have read little and that cursorily.</p>
      <p>I therefore pray you to write your judgment, to which I attribute much. You know that all have a palate, but few have a healthy one.</p>
      <p>You have a letter no less troublesome than lengthy, in which contrary to all customs I have first vented my stomach, which after friendship is established, great authors teach should be done gradually. Yet your writings have made me bold, in which you offer heart and mind open and exposed to all, so that you have made me most devoted to you. And since we are so far apart that unless once a year or at most twice we may converse by letters, I have laid aside innate modesty, hardened my forehead, proposed all my things to you naked. If you receive them with the mind of a pastor and teacher, there is reason for me to rejoice; but if you reject them, as they deserve, this writing will have perished for me and will teach me in the future to address the great more cautiously and with greater reverence.</p>
      <p>Farewell and take care of your health, that you may serve the Christian religion, the little brothers, and good letters longer.</p>
      <p>Hastily, on the feast of St. Lawrence, in the year 1539.</p>
      <p>Hermann Aquilomontanus, pastor of the church of Borssum near Emden in East Frisia.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed teacher. To Zurich in Switzerland.</p>
