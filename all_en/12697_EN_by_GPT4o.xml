    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius does not want to send the enclosed dispatch without a greeting. So he writes whatever comes to his mind.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is extremely strange that the Schmalkaldic League cannot overcome the cunning of Emperor Charles V. However, they are not negligent, but rather unfortunate. The damage the Emperor is causing among friends and foes alike is horrific. May the Lord thwart his devilish cunning!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Catholic cantons of the Swiss Confederation are driving Myconius to madness with their godless pacts with Pope Paul III and their breach of faith towards the Protestant cantons! Now they spare the Emperor. But if King Francis I of France were to march against the Emperor, they would flock to the former in droves. Some say that the King has appointed captains in the Five Cantons who secretly pay cash to the mercenaries they are recruiting for a future war. Myconius is ashamed of such people who show themselves to be so unreliable. May the Lord visit them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The more the Gospel is preached, the more it is unfortunately neglected. Yet Christ already foretold his disciples that they would be hated for his sake. Myconius speaks from experience. Many people who pretend to be good Christians bring shame to Jesus' name. For they cling too much to earthly things. The words of the prophets about greed are proving true, for indeed all indulge their bellies and lust. The Gospel, on the other hand, encourages work and righteousness. As a leader of the divine teaching, Myconius would be hopeless if Christ had not promised to comfort those who mourn in Zion.</p>

      <p>S. There is nothing to write. However, so that I do not send this bundle without my own words, I at least wanted to greet you and add whatever comes to mind.</p>

      <p>I cannot sufficiently marvel at the cunning of the Emperor (Charles V), but even more at the misfortune of our people, not to say negligence, in not being able to detect his cunning. This would not trouble me so much if in the meantime he did not harm friends and foes so cruelly and impiously. His cunning is plainly diabolical! I pray to the Lord to break them (since He knows them).</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Confederates (Catholic cantons of the Swiss Confederation) drive me to madness because of their impiety in dealing with the Pope (Paul III) and their treachery against us. They support the Emperor. What if the French King (Francis I) attempted something against him (the Emperor)? They would flock to him (the French King) in droves. And there are those who say it is true that today captains have been appointed among them by the French King and have received cash to secretly gather soldiers for a future war. Is it fitting for men to act thus? It is not fitting! Therefore, I am ashamed and embarrassed that they so depart from the name and reality of men. May the Lord visit them with His grace according to His good will.</p>

      <p>It also pains me that the more diligently the Gospel is taught, the more it is neglected, so that I now easily understand what Christ once said to his disciples: "And you will be hated by all for my name's sake." I say this from experience. The name of the Lord Jesus is despised by many who until now wanted to appear as true worshippers of Christ. Why? Because the things of this world are so alluring that I often doubt whether it was truer what the prophets lamented in their times or today, when they say: "Everyone is greedy for gain, from the least to the greatest." There is no one who does not want to have, from wherever he may have it. And why have it? To satisfy the belly and lust. The Gospel and faith urge us to work and to live a life of honesty and integrity. The belly seeks pleasures. These titillate, flatter, and are sweet. Therefore, we shudder at anything that opposes them (pleasures) in any way. If Christ had not once promised a crown for ashes, oil of joy for mourning, and a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness to those who mourn in Zion, I do not know what we who preside over the teaching would finally do.</p>
