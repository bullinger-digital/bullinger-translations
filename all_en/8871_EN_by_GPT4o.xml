      <p>You ask about the public state. It still seems quite sad to me. They continue, as the acts I send truly testify, in punishing crimes. We fear, however, that the cobbler may go beyond his last, from which the greatest dissensions could arise. Nevertheless, they are beginning to accept admonitions, so that by acting more mildly, they may seek to achieve the hoped-for result and not, by investigating and handling all kinds of matters too sharply and anxiously, tear apart the concord once established. We also hope that this torrent will gradually be calmed. For if these lawyers continue to act beyond the limits of the mandate assigned to them by the communities, there will be a danger that the Upper League and our city will withdraw their support. However, the president of the Rhaetian Valley is expected; if he appears, it will suffice for many. I wish that, as I have hoped, he may be found blameless! Today, they treated the excellent man, the bailiff of Davos, too harshly, whom they accused of many things, of which he has no knowledge or guilt whatsoever. [But] although he promised to produce witnesses, nevertheless mention of torture was made before him; which I would have thought most inappropriate for a good man. It is to be hoped, however, that he will be able to enjoy the witnesses to be produced next Monday. If this is not done, there will be those who will withdraw themselves from this judgment. Every effort must be made to ensure that they do not take on more than the matter and the time can bear and delve deeper than necessary. Otherwise, it will soon happen that the minds, which are now united, will be separated, etc. However, they will not be dissolved until the heads have been sufficiently combed. I cannot say more; for the rest, you will learn from the acts and letters to the most honorable Mr. Treasurer. No danger is yet feared from the signs to be given.</p>
      <p>But in such a great vicissitude and sudden change, if anything happens, we will inform you in time. I believe that the Plantani or others have spread the rumor with the Swiss envoys.</p>
      <p>Most hastily. 1572, 19th of April, Chur.</p>
