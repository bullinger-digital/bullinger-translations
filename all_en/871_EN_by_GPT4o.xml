      <p>Grace and innocent life from the Lord. So that I may at least mitigate, if not entirely excuse, the charge of neglecting correspondence (about which you rightly and gravely reproached me in your last letter, most esteemed and beloved godfather), behold, I have taken care to send my third letter to you by post since the end of January; I hope you have received those and will receive these, with as much haste as possible, to inform your excellence of our private matters and the news and fate of this kingdom in more detail. But since our letters have often and frequently been lost on the way due to the negligence or rather treachery of the courier, it has happened on both sides, I think it worthwhile to repeat the main points of those letters in brief. I wrote that we are all well, as you know; my wife, however, is still weak and sickly as she used to be, but there is no danger of death (by the grace of God). Rachel is endowed with excellent health (by God's mercy), she is growing in body and mind and shows great promise of a most blessed memory in the future, she understands no language as well as Latin. I have not yet been to my homeland, where I was born, partly due to the danger of sedition and tumult there, partly due to the king's command to promote the kingdom of Christ here in London, and I am not yet allowed to leave the city even for one mile (unless well accompanied). However, I console myself with this task, which I began under favorable and arduous auspices, is being blessed by God more and more every day, and God has given ample and glorious increase to the seed sown by Paul and Peter; we do not water and plant in vain; may the name of God always be blessed. But now a new bishop of London has been appointed, a pious and learned man, provided that honors do not later change his character. I hope he will destroy the altars of Baal, as he did before in his temple when he was bishop of Rochester. It can hardly be said, most beloved godfather, with what labors and dangers we strive and contend to expel the idol of the mass; our efforts are not a little hindered by the form which the senate or parliament, as we commonly say, has prescribed for the whole kingdom, which is so deficient and dubious (even in some part plainly impious). I sent it to our Mr. Butler four months ago. I am so offended by that book, and not without grave cause, that if it is not corrected, I can neither be able nor willing to partake in the use of the Lord's Supper with the church. Many altars in this city, since I came here, have been destroyed. I began an epistle to Titus, which, when finished, I taught the Gospel of John and am now engaged in the eighth chapter; in the sixth chapter, which God gave, I freely expounded to the audience about the Lord's Supper. For the space of three months and every day once or twice I taught, and God was not absent from our work. A marvelous and very frequent crowd of people accompanied us, and God with them; for He opened their hearts to believe the things that were said by us.</p>
      <p>But I have incurred great hatred and no less danger from the sixth chapter. Nevertheless, the better cause stands, and this Lent I clearly and openly treated the same argument before the king and the princes of the kingdom. In this city, one of eminent learning and sanctity of life, named Cromer, a doctor of theology, well known to Mr. Butler, opposes our opinion in public discourse. On the Friday before Easter, the bishop of Worcester will preach and declare his opinion on the Supper, the invocation of saints, and the authority of the Scriptures. May God grant that he teaches purely. We all piously agree in one opinion on all articles before the king... whatever will be done, I will write to you immediately after Easter. The bishops of Winchester, London, and Worcester are detained in prison and stubbornly support papist doctrine. The bishop of Winchester, who is held captive in the Tower of London, offered himself and challenged a month ago to a disputation; he promised himself a glorious victory without a doubt; which if he had not achieved, he would submit himself to the laws and the king, that they might cruelly punish him.</p>
      <p>The keeper of the prison first accepted the condition; a day was appointed. When the bishop had certainly learned that I would not refuse that task, but would steadfastly support the best cause even at the risk of life, he changed his mind and said: if the king would free him from prison, he would undertake the disputation relying on God's help, which he would also report as a victory. What will finally be done, I do not know.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, let us pray that God may be with us, that we may promote His glory fearlessly. A book has recently been published here by the bishop for the institution and inauguration of bishops and ministers of the church, which I sent to Mr. Butler, so that you may understand their frauds and schemes, by what cunning they support the kingdom of the antichrist, especially in the form of the oath. Against which form I have brought forth many things for public reading before the king and the nobles of the whole kingdom, for which reason I have incurred no small enmities. On the fourth day after the reading, I was accused by the Archbishop of Canterbury before the king's councilors. I appeared; the Archbishop said grave things against me, that I had despised the form of the oath. I asked that the judges hear with impartial ears by what authority I had done this. The question was long and sharply debated between the bishops and me; but in the end, the catastrophe and outcome was to the glory of God.</p>
      <p>If the following summer does not boil with tumults, we hope for many good things in our church; for peace between us and the French is settled, on what terms, I do not yet know, I only pray to the best and greatest God, that under the name of peace, war does not lie hidden. The emperor, the day before I gave these letters to your excellence, sent our king two most excellent Spanish horses as a gift.</p>
      <p>On the same day, a German Lutheran sent to Choecus, the king's preceptor, a book, which recently came to light against the Anabaptists and Sacramentarians. The same book was given to the king to read; but it did not please the king nor his preceptors, that is, Coco and Checo. These two with the king understand the cause of the Eucharist piously. Mr. Bucer is now dangerously ill in Cambridge; for the lecture, he is treating the epistle to the Ephesians, for the sermon on feast days the sixth chapter of John. Valerandus admonished him by letters not to stir up trouble in the matter of the Eucharist. He replied that he would teach nothing against the opinion of Peter Martyr, which I sent to you handwritten in the middle of January. About the Interim (you know what I mean) I have not yet been able to obtain by any prayers that I might commit it to the press; but a few days ago, on account of certain matters, I might meet the king, to whom I will give it to read. Believe me, most esteemed godfather, you have never seen in the world such great learning combined with piety and a natural talent in a thousand years; if he lives and grows in these virtues, he will be a terror to all the princes of the world; he himself takes all the sermons he hears in his own hand and diligently reviews them after lunch with those who study with him. Many young men and boys, who are his companions in study, are well and faithfully instructed in the fear of God and good letters. Mr. Cox no longer teaches the king, he always remains the almoner, very devoted to you, and he had great thanks for the gift, as I have often said before. The Archbishop of Canterbury received it, as you know, yet to my knowledge, he favors me. The Marquis of Dorset sends many greetings to your excellence; I wish that what you are about to commit to the press, you would dedicate either to the king or to him.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, if Mr. Bibliander, our best and most learned godfather, or Mr. Gualter, a learned and most faithful minister of Christ, are about to publish anything, let them also dedicate it either to the king or to the Duke of Somerset, the king's uncle, my lord, who now lives at Sion, eight miles from the city of London, and is well, but is not yet of the king's council, he will be shortly, I do not doubt, or to the Marquis of Dorset or to the Earl of Warwick, a most faithful and intrepid soldier of Christ. He is now ill; but I hope no danger to his life is imminent. If he had not stood by my side in the cause of Christ, it would have been over for me five months ago, when the Duke of Somerset was in danger. Trehern is well; I think you have recently received letters from him. Your dictations on Isaiah, which you commended to Christopher Hales, have not been returned to me; we must spare the misfortunes of the man. For when he crossed from Calais to England, he was endangered at sea by the French, who threw the ship's cargo into the sea. I ask, with as much haste as possible, that everything be rewritten, not only on Isaiah but on the books of Kings, and I will satisfy the labors of the writer both by prayer and by price. For the cloth, which I hear your excellence has received, do not send anything to me, but, as you love me, from the price of the cloth you will take care to have described to me what I now ask of you, and the rest, which I will ask for in the future, until you learn more from me.</p>
      <p>But I wish to remind your excellence of this matter, that when you write to me in the future, you enclose your letters to me in the letters either of Richard Hilles or John Stumphius; otherwise, they will hardly or never reach my hands; such is the envy and hatred of men, that if they see from the superscription that they are addressed to me, they keep them for themselves. Therefore, unless a faithful courier happens, it is necessary to suppress those things which otherwise would not be kept silent. Such is the malice of men's minds today, that nothing can be interpreted with an equitable and right mind. Let me know which letters you have received from me since the calends of January; I do not ask this as if any danger threatens your excellence or me from the loss of letters; I care not a whit into whose hands they may fall, - but so that I may have better explored fidelity in the future. If you ever send letters of consolation for your learning and piety to our king, - make sure you do so as soon as possible -, and to the Earl of Warwick and the Marquis of Dorset, believe me, they would receive them with the most grateful mind. Send them to me, and I will faithfully deliver them into their hands. Now Mr. Consul will receive another cloth and a good one, I hope, at the usual price, namely 10 Tigurine basions per ell. Mr. Butler will also receive one, partly white, partly black.</p>
      <p>We have great thanks to you for the gift you sent to your Rachel; I, in turn, promise you in Christ, all your children, as long as I live, will be as my own, if I can be of any use to them in any matter. John Stumphius always acts honorably and diligently in Oxford; you can, if you please, apply spurs to him in your letters, which will incite him to continue in his excellent undertaking. If he needs anything, I will always be there for him; there is no need for his parents to be anxious about anything; you will greet them in my and my wife's name. My wife is very fond of our John Stumphius. John from Ulm is also well and diligently, as I hear, applies himself to his study; he has been splendidly and honorably assisted by the Marquis of Dorset, to the amount of 30 crowns per year. You will greet your wife with your whole family, Mr. Bibliander with his, Mr. Gualter with his, Mr. Pellican with his, Mr. Otho with his, Mr. Fricius with his, Mr. Sebastian with his in the name of all of us as courteously as possible. Martin Micronius sends his respectful greetings to your excellence with all others in Zurich. We sincerely greet Mr. Haler, the most faithful minister of the church of Bern, and Mr. Musculus. When you send letters to Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer and to Mr. Thomas, his brother, you will greet both in our name. May the Lord Jesus preserve your church and republic, that you may live in peace, fear, and holiness all the days of your life; we are mindful of you day and night in our prayers, that God may govern, protect, and defend you with His holy spirit against the snares of the devil and the world. Be mindful of us also and of our labor in the vineyard of the Lord: with the help of your prayers, we will establish a more glorious trophy in the church of God over our enemies. Except for the church of Zurich, and those who agree with it in religion, nowhere in the world is the word taught more purely than in England.</p>
      <p>Write back immediately a line or two, I beg; until I receive something from you, I will think that these too perish on the way. If you always ask Mr. Burcher to send your letters by post, I will pay the expenses. You will religiously and with all duty bid Mr. Consul, a man of God, to be well in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>A certain Zurich man is detained in prison here; his name is Valentinus Warmulus, if I am not mistaken, related by blood to Mr. Otho, a minister of the Zurich church. I do not yet know the certain causes of his incarceration, whether he used force on a woman or was with her with consent, it is hidden from me; a crime of this kind is charged against him. Furthermore, he is accused of having stolen some small sum of money. Today I will send to the prison to learn more through Mr. Utenhovius. I ask that you shortly inform me if he is a Zurich man or not; if the law can be satisfied with money, having been advised by your excellence, I will gladly pay it, provided it is repaid to me in Zurich. Farewell, most esteemed lord, and always love us.</p>
      <p>London, March 27, 1550; on the following Wednesday, God willing, I will complete the prophet Jonah before the king.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, John Hooper.</p>
      <p>Mr. Utenhovius sends his respectful greetings to your dignity, who undoubtedly assists you all with diligent prayers to God. If you knew how many times he has thanked me for sending him to Zurich, you would be amazed.</p>
      <p>There is one thing I will ask of you, most faithful friend, that after reading this, you write to Mr. Coelius Secundus, who is in Basel, and excuse me to him for not writing to him now. I have written so far and informed him of all matters which he had entrusted to my faith, nor have I ever been forgetful of him, as he will learn from me after Easter. I have attempted in favor of the man, which you will know later; you will ask him to continue in his purpose and not to fear. God lives, from whom he will obtain what he desires successfully. You will greet the widow and our hostess in our name, and if she is in need, we will not be forgetful of how piously she treated us in our pilgrimage.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most pious archbishop of the Zurich church, most faithful and esteemed godfather. Zurich.</p>
