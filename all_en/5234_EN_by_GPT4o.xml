      <p>Greetings. Behold, reverend father, what you have long desired, we now finally repay with interest.</p>
      <p>I am sending Italian copies, because you have more Italians who can translate. One copy is written to Mr. de Rozin√ü by a very papist person, as you see, he sent it to Mr. Philipp and me, the other is written by Mr. Balingketus.</p>
      <p>I send them with the condition, not that you return them, but that you send all these directly to Mr. Erastus; he is skilled in the Italian language.</p>
      <p>Brother Mr. Vallentinus will come to you; he will stop by Herter, to whom you will give my letters and encourage him to take care of it promptly and safely; he actually told me he wants to be with you this Friday. Someone from Bellitz is coming, tell Consul Ambrosius, it is quite certain that Bellitz wrote from Trent that a great prominent bishop was having an affair with an innkeeper's wife; but as he did not want to desist from his intention and the wife and her servants often gave him the slip, the wife revealed the affair to her husband. The husband went to the president, reported how and in what manner someone was pursuing his wife, asking if he had the power to take action against him. And as he found good advice from the president, he was able, after a long time with the wife (who barely went there), to arrange for her to summon the bishop, but to leave the servants outside. When he came, the husband, with his men whom he had prepared for the affair, attacked him and quickly stabbed him. When the servants, hearing some commotion, ran in from the street, it is said that eighteen of them also perished. He affirms all this as certain; but it is likely true, because the same is reported from four places now, except that some said it was a cardinal. You also, please, to Mr. Erastus.</p>
      <p>But the young men are negligent; urge the man to take care diligently.</p>
      <p>This is sudden; I did not know this Leodovicus was here or departing; however, since he was present, I wanted to give him letters. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, hastily.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 22.</p>
      <p>On the next Tuesday, more about Vergerio.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
