    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller has already responded to Bullinger's first letter [from December 11; not received] [with No. 2723]. Now he wants to address the later letter [from about December 14; not received], which arrived on December 26. Bullinger wrote that the three [Zurich] pastors [Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder, Lorenz Meyer (Agricola), and (Hans) Thoman Ruman] have been recalled by the council. However, this is exactly what Haller wanted to avoid. Bullinger will have gathered this from Haller's previous letter. Haller does not yet know the reasons given by the Zurich councilors for the recall. Yesterday, he shared the news with [Georg] Frölich. He also knew nothing about the letter from the Zurich council to the Augsburg council. Haller does not know where the letter is. The letter addressed to him by Bullinger was enclosed with a letter from [Ambrosius] Blarer to Frölich. After yesterday's [Sunday] sermon, Haller went to Frölich again to find out if the councilors had received the letter and had already decided anything about the return of the Zurich pastors. But due to the frequent council meetings, Frölich was not to be found. And since the bearer [...] of the present letter wants to leave at nine o'clock, Haller unfortunately cannot provide anything definitive. He will make up for this with the next messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Like Haller, Frölich is also against a recall. People would wonder why the Augsburg council is already sending back the newly appointed Zurich pastors! Some would suspect that it is hatching secret plans and perhaps intends to betray the Gospel. How the council will react to the letter from Zurich, Haller cannot predict.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In the last letter, he already reported that if the Zurich council allows it, one of the two pastors [Schwyzer or Meyer] will be sent to Kaufbeuren. In any case, Haller would not want Ruman, who preaches [at the cathedral] with [Wolfgang] Musculus, to be recalled, because Ruman and he are active at the two largest city churches [at the cathedral and St. Moritz]. Since Musculus and the other colleagues are already withdrawing, good results from Haller's and Ruman's activities are to be expected after the end of the war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Haller has not told the three Zurich pastors that they are being recalled. He only said that Bullinger wrote that they would soon be recalled. For Haller, there is no doubt that the difficulties arising from [Meyer's and Schwyzer's] stay in Augsburg will cause less offense than their recall. Haller is therefore gladly willing to continue tolerating them, rather than seizing the opportunity to get rid of them and thereby harm the church and the Augsburg council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger wants to ensure that the Zurich councilors inform in writing how the Zurich pastors (including Haller) should behave if Augsburg also submits to [Emperor Charles V]. The latter seems likely, especially since the other cities have also surrendered. Although the pastors call for steadfastness, the people, who are now shaken by the cowardice of the princes, will probably come to their senses too late!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Haller would not want to stay in Augsburg under any circumstances after a possible departure of Frölich. If the people of Augsburg hold on to the Gospel, he is also ready to die with them. If they submit to the emperor, he will not wait until he is handed over to the robbers, as is said to have happened with [Johannes] Brenz in [Schwäbisch] Hall! At the request of the local councilors, Brenz stayed in the city. But when the [imperial forces] gained the upper hand, he is said to have been imprisoned. If that is true, he will probably be led to the slaughter [at the council] in Trent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bullinger should therefore ensure with his authorities that the four Zurich pastors are granted free return from Augsburg, so that they are not delivered to death. If Bullinger deems it good, Haller himself will write to the Zurich council about this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The loyalty of the people of Ulm and the Württemberg [Duke Ulrich] is very questionable. Haller has read Blarer's report on the negotiations in Baden. He prefers the stance of the Zurich people to that of the Bernese, because God does not need such defenders of the faith [as the Inner Swiss]. It is known that dealing with the godless has always harmed good rulers. Many also place their hope in King [Francis I] of France. But Haller does not trust him at all. Allegedly, he wants to seize part of the empire. Strasbourg should beware of this! What will the Helvetians do now? Terrible! Not only the Gospel, but also the German Empire is being betrayed! May the Lord have mercy!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings to [Anna, née Adlischwyler], to the children, to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Gessner, Otto [Werdmüller], and [Johann Jakob] Ammann. Greetings from [Michael] Keller and Musculus. Haller has discussed the recall of the colleagues with the latter. They strongly advise against it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] [Hans Wilpert] Zoller has received a company as a gift from his employer [Sebastian Schertlin] for the new year. Zoller is now under the command of Captain [Christoph] Negelin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Best wishes for the new year!</p>

      <p>Peace and salvation through the Lord Jesus, etc. I have already responded to your earlier letters. Now, regarding the later ones, which I received on December 26, a few words. You write that three brothers are being recalled, which I would not have wanted to happen in any way, as I believe you have already understood from my previous letters. But I do not yet understand the intentions of our lords. Yesterday (Sunday) I was with our Laetus. I shared everything. He was unaware that letters had been sent to the senate, which I have not seen either. I do not know through whom they were delivered. My letters were enclosed with Blaurer's letters to Laetus. Immediately after the sermon, I wanted to meet Laetus again to find out if the lords had received the letters or what they had decided about the recall. But the senate was already in frequent session, so I could not go to him. However, the messenger is in a hurry; he is leaving at 9 o'clock. I would have gladly informed you of something certain, but it could not be done now. As soon as I have another messenger, I will inform you of everything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Mr. Laetus, like myself, believes they should not be recalled. It would be ridiculous for our lords to have called the ministers to provide for their dominion, only to dismiss them again as if despairing of retaining that region. Moreover, various rumors would spread, as if the lords were secretly plotting something and were not going to preserve the gospel, as they are already beginning to dismiss ministers in the face of impending dangers. These are his reasons. I do not know what the lords will do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I wrote before, and I still write, that one of the two should be sent to Kaufbeuren, if you agree. Romanus is in Musculus's church. I would not want him to be recalled. We have already occupied these two largest churches. From there, Musculus and others are beginning to withdraw. I hope, if the Lord grants peace, much fruit will be gained.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have said nothing to them about the recall. I pretend that you wrote this to me (I only said that you wrote they would soon be recalled). And I do this because I see that not as much can be destroyed if they stay, due to some importunity, as if they leave now, due to offense. I would rather bear this than, having seized the opportunity (which would otherwise not be unwelcome), cause offense to the church or bring the well-meaning senate into calumny.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I ask this, that you obtain from the lords of Zurich, that they consult us with letters on what we should do in these dangers, if we should sense that even our own are about to withdraw. For I do not think they will stay, but will make an agreement with the emperor by whatever means they can, if they see other cities failing. We encourage them as much as we can to be steadfast. They, struck by the treachery and cowardice of the princes, will learn too late.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Indeed, when Mr. Laetus leaves, I will not stay any longer. If they are steadfast and want to remain with Christ, I am ready to shed my blood with them. If they fail, I will not wait to be handed over to these robbers, as is said to have happened to Mr. Brenz in Hall. They persuaded him to stay. But when they became superior, they threw him into chains. Without a doubt, they will lead him to slaughter in Trent. So the rumor goes. I do not affirm it for certain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Therefore, I ask for your advice. Also, obtain from the lords that they make a free return possible for us from here, and do not allow us to be sold into cruel punishments. If you think it advisable for me to write to the most honorable senate of Zurich about this, I will do so.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The loyalty of the people of Ulm and the Württemberg is very doubtful. Blaurer wrote about the proceedings in Baden. I read it. I prefer the advice of the Zurich people to that of the Bernese. God does not want such defenders of his religion! We know how much the company and commerce of the impious have always harmed good princes. Many have placed their hope in the King of France. I do not think he is to be trusted. It is now said that he will also try to seize some part of the empire. Strasbourg should beware! I wonder what the Swiss will do here. O God! Not only the gospel but the entire German kingdom is being sold and betrayed! May God have mercy on us. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Greet your dear wife and children, Mr. Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, Gesner, Otto, Ammian, etc. Cellarius and Musculus greet you, with whom I have discussed what should be advised about the recall of the brothers. They absolutely think they should seek a return, which they should not do at this time. The opportunity should be awaited.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Zoller has become a standard-bearer again. His lord has given him a company as a New Year's gift, under Captain Nägelin, of whom he is now the standard-bearer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>In Augsburg, December 27, in the year of Christ's birth 1547. I wish you and all yours a very happy new year! Johannes Haller, yours entirely.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and venerable father. Zurich, to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
