      <p>Greetings. I was greatly blessed, my dear Bullinger, by the very joyful news of the success of Christ's kingdom among the Sarmatians, for there are indeed significant arguments that prove this, such as the favor of Johannes a Lasco with the king and the calling of Lysmanini's wife. May the Lord Jesus grant that we soon see the most abundant fruits from these holy seeds, and that for the glory of His name. In France, the king rages savagely against the saints, surpassing and about to surpass Caligula, Nero, and Maxentius, unless he is restrained by the hand of God. On the 27th of September, he executed several with the most exquisite tortures in Paris itself and is said to have sworn by the crown to utterly exterminate the entire seed, which he calls Lutheran heretics, beginning even with the royal family, which he understands to be infected with the same pestilence. He will now proceed to do this more resolutely, after success seems to shine on Philip, who is somewhat retreating and whose army is not faring very well... as if he would interpret the shedding of the martyrs' blood as an expiation of sins.</p>
      <p>But the Lord is the one who, with just the breath of His mouth, kills the wicked and scatters the plans of the wise taken against Him. Yet let us pray to Him for our afflicted brothers, many of whom have already been condemned to death, and among them some judges, for the sole reason that they refused to pass sentence against the innocent and to pollute their consciences with guilt; thus, it is not without consequence for them, what was for Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and Gamaliel among the most hostile enemies. Few believe in Ferdinand's success, and there are those who say that indeed the opportunity for conducting affairs well has not been lacking, but that Ferdinand is abandoned by counsel and hope. Regarding the colloquy, I receive the same as you and understand that Brenz, Diller, Jacob Andreae, along with Philip, have excellently resisted the Saxons' counsel, as they consider it unjust to condemn anyone unheard; they have said many things piously, holily, and learnedly, which would lead to peace and edification if they were to gain assent. What is now being done and how far they have progressed is completely unknown to me.</p>
      <p>Some say the Turk is pressed by his son through the Persian, others that he is again threatening Pannonia with an equipped army. From Italy, we hear that our people are returning, but not without losses, including the leader Heptenring, a man notable for his learning and singular modesty and a friend to us, which made it all the more painful that he could not be persuaded to stay at home by our exhortations and involved himself in an impious war against his conscience; he promised as he was leaving that this would be the last expedition he would undertake of his own accord, understanding it differently than he experienced.</p>
      <p>Would that even in his last moments he might have been given to truly consider his sin and implore the grace of Christ. They say he was slain by an Italian or a Frenchman, with whom he died fighting with mutual wounds, but two days after receiving the wound. Where Philip is and what Bolwyler is planning, I do not know; otherwise, I would write. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours.</p>
      <p>I wrote in Basel on the 18th of October in the year 1557. I have not yet received your letters through Peter Bern.</p>
      <p>Yours, Simon Sulzer.</p>
      <p>I commend this pious man to you; he was a monk and has suffered various things, giving evidence of perpetual and constant piety both here and elsewhere; he is going to Poland. You will act piously, therefore, if you commend him to Lysmanini and others.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
