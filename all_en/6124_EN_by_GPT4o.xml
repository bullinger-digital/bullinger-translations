      <p>Greetings. I had set out for Lyon when your letters arrived, which I received upon my return, most illustrious man, along with those written to you by the Pole who resides in Leipzig. From these, it was most pleasing for me to understand what he diligently writes about our friend Tretius and other matters. I now send them back, as I could not do so sooner, and I give you the greatest thanks for your letters written to me with such humanity.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it was very pleasing for me to see what you briefly encompassed in your letters. Mr. Beza read them and said he had not yet seen the book by Georgius Paulus against Mr. Calvin (which you mention), nor do I think it has been brought here. Mr. Beza will write to you extensively about everything, about the state of French affairs, about Mr. Calvin's adverse health, and other matters, which I therefore omit. May the Lord cause the enemies to be confounded with their plans.</p>
      <p>Your stipendiaries or church alumni are staying with a host who is agreeable to them. They were initially forced to pay a few crowns each in advance, as is customary in this city, otherwise, they would not have been received; thus, being without money to procure necessary things for themselves, they asked me to vouch for them in their name for some books at the printer, which I gladly did.</p>
      <p>Then, because they were in need of certain clothes, I lent two crowns to Isaiah Wogger and likewise to Johann Rudolf Bygel; I could not deny them this, seeing they were in need of necessary things. However, henceforth, if this effort of mine is not approved by you, I will not be so accommodating; for I would not wish to be overly officious without your consent.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most excellent man, I wanted to inform you of this once and briefly, so that you may instruct me by your letters at the earliest opportunity on what I should do in this matter in the future; for I would not wish to err on the side of caution. I will therefore await your advice.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>May the Lord always be with you, guide you with His spirit, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Brother Budaeus greets you sincerely and respectfully. Geneva, May 3, 1564.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, your most observant. To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Zurich church, most worthy of my respect. In Zurich.</p>
