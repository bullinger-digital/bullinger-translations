    <p xml:id="regest1">They understand the unexpected recall of Hieronymus [Kaufmann]; the position [of a schoolmaster in Zofingen] that became vacant as a result had already been assigned to a religious refugee from Valais when the recommendation for [Konrad] Klauser arrived. They assure that they will adhere to the agreement made [at the Zurich meeting].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>If you had not written such a convenient excuse for Hieronymus, beloved brother in the Lord, it would certainly have been almost impossible to avoid suspicion, so sudden was his recall. But we understand the reason for the action and we take it in good part.</p>
      <p>Then, the fact that you offer someone else is very welcome, as we greatly appreciate your concern for us. If only it might happen that we could do something for you in return someday!</p>
      <p>But listen to why Konrad Klauser was not appointed in place of Hieronymus. Your letter barely reached us on the 5th of August, by which time another had already been appointed in the previous one's place. He is a man from Valais, exiled for his confession of Christ, whom we had to take pity on, so that the pious man would not lose heart.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there was no doubt that Klauser would have been accepted, if only he had arrived in time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and know that we will faithfully remember and steadfastly adhere to our agreement. May those who would disturb this perish. Greet all your colleagues. 6th of August 1538, Bern.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter and Peter Conzen, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the people of Zurich, to be respected in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
