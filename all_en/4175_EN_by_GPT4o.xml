      <p>The bailiff of Untervaz (which is like a deputy bailiff with you, but Untervaz lies opposite Zizers across the Rhine on the mountain) recently wanted to go to Chur with his wife, with whom he had lived honorably for many years. On the way, they had a little disagreement, so that the wife went ahead on her own. She met a handsome young man, as she thought, who accosted her and with a handful of crowns led her further, whereby she was persuaded to go with him. After that, he disappeared from her.</p>
      <p>She did not dare to wait for her husband, but continued on to the city of Chur, where she sat down in front of a citizen's house. When her husband found her there, he asked her the reason for her haste and why she was so contrary and sad. To which she replied: "I am, God have mercy." Meanwhile, the man finished his business, and on the way home, as his wife sighed a lot, he coaxed her with kindness until she finally confessed everything to him when they came to their house.</p>
      <p>After that, a commotion is said to have arisen in the house above, and the man, when he entered the house, is said to have seen the devil distinctly for the third time. People say about the woman that she is not in her right mind and begins to stink with such a smell that no one can endure it near her. I hear that a similar thing happened in Zurich a few years ago, which you can know best of all. Whether it is true, I am eager to know; for these things should not be neglected, especially by a minister; I collect such examples for my own use as well.</p>
      <p>The abbot of Pf√§fers is greatly pleased with the new governor, as I hear from Mr. Tscharner and other pious people.</p>
      <p>You may, according to your insight, admonish and arrange that otherwise he is also spoken to earnestly; for there are still many believers in the Sarganserland, who now must. The Glarus man, who preceded him, is said not to have been very accommodating to the pious, although he pretends to be one of ours. There was great hope in the Zurichers; now if their governors also act more leniently, if they are too attached to the priests, alas, what a disgrace and shame that will be, not only with great damage to the church but also with dishonor to the city of Zurich. This to you.</p>
      <p>But what is the reason that not only the abbot, who is the greatest drinker, but also other papists in these parts are so eager for this new governor and, what is more, all of them desired him with their wishes before he was appointed?</p>
