    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger might wonder if Cousin has forgotten him, as he hasn't received a letter from him for a year. However, Cousin's high regard for Bullinger, to whom he owes so much, remains undiminished!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] There are several reasons why he writes so rarely. Firstly, he does not want to disturb Bullinger in his theological work, which is beneficial to the whole world. Secondly, he knows that Bullinger needs his limited free time to respond to the numerous letters from scholars around the world. Thirdly, Cousin himself hardly finds any rest and rarely finds someone who travels directly to Basel and to whom he could safely entrust his letters (which, in these times, one cannot fully trust anyway). But the main reason is not to interrupt Bullinger in his work.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] A new tragedy is unfolding in Germany. One must always be prepared for the worst. Accordingly, it is best to hide at home like snails. There is nothing left but to ask God to bring the reckless plans of men to a good end, as the goddess Pallas Athena is said to have done for the Athenians according to legend. The world rises with all its might against Christ. The more pious and better the [Catholic] boasters think they are, the more easily they are deceived by wolves in sheep's clothing! But Christ lives!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] If only one would recognize (which is clear even to the blind!) that the negotiations of the council aim to let the abuses in the church exist alongside the good. Naturally, the bad increases while the good diminishes. But even if the world were to perish, Cousin remains faithful to the Church of Christ. The Lord will decide on the reward of each one.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Cousin learned from Johannes Gast, who presumably took it from a letter of Bullinger's [not received], that Bullinger is fortunately doing better again. May Bullinger remain with the church for as long as possible!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to the learned and good Theodor Bibliander. Cousin will not forget to repay Konrad Gessner. Bullinger should tell him to remain true to himself. Greetings also to the Hebraist and theologian Konrad Pellikan, the excellent theologian Kaspar Megander, Otto Werdmüller, who is versed in all three languages and all arts, the Greek Rudolf Collin, Johann Jakob Ammann, and especially to the dear friend Rudolf Gwalther. Cousin cannot write to everyone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bullinger should take care of his health and remain courageous in this stormy situation. Through Gast and Sigismund Gelenius, he can always reach Cousin in writing by a safe route.</p>

      <p>Greetings and Peace. It has now been a year, illustrious theologian Bullinger, since I last wrote to you. You might ask, "What is this? Have you forgotten someone who has been so good to you?" But truly, if I have ever respected or honored you (as I have done nothing more devoutly), I am still most respectful of you and hold you dear in my innermost heart!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>There are several reasons why I write to you so rarely. Firstly, your heavenly duties, which benefit the whole world, should not be disturbed by my importunity (though I should have encouraged you as much as possible), so I am more reluctant to write. Secondly, if any leisure remains from such duties (which I know is very little), it is taken up by countless letters sent to you from the most learned men from all over the world. Lastly, I hardly ever have any leisure myself, and it is rare to find someone traveling directly to Basel to whom I could safely entrust my letters, and even if I do, the current state of affairs is such that it is not advisable to trust everything to letters. You see, this is the reason for my silence, that your studies should not be interrupted, which should be the primary concern for everyone.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In Germany, everything is full of new tragedies. Meanwhile, we hide away like snails, expecting the worst at any moment. Certainly, we have long seen that nothing remains but to ask the Lord to grant us what Pallas Athena is said to have granted the Athenians, namely, to turn the reckless plans of men to a good end. The world rises with all its resources and power against Christ, and the more pious and religious our boasters are, the more easily they are deceived by those who disguise themselves as wolves in sheep's clothing. But Christ lives!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If only we could deserve to have it revealed to us (or even the blind can see) what has been done in the Council of Trent, that the evils remain in the church alongside the good. Evils will naturally grow, and the good will diminish, as they usually do. However it may be, even if the world were to collapse, this will not separate me from the fellowship of the Church of Christ. The Lord himself will see to the reward.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Our Gast, informed by your recent letters, I believe, has recently reminded us of your improved health, which delighted me greatly. May the Lord grant that you remain with the Church of Christ for as long as possible!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Greet Theodor Bibliander, a man of singular learning and goodness, in my name. I see how much I owe to Konrad Gessner, and I will remember. You should now be my letter to him, asking him to continue being true to himself. Also, greet Konrad Pellikan, a man deeply learned in the Hebrew language and theology, Kaspar Megander, a truly great theologian, Otto Werdmüller, most skilled in the three languages and all arts, Rudolf Collin the Greek, and Johann Jakob Ammann, but especially my dear friend Rudolf Gwalther, for I fear I do not have time to write to everyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Take care of your health, incomparable master and teacher, and keep a strong spirit, sustaining yourself with your virtue in these storms of fortune, as you always do. Whatever you send to Gast or Sigismund Gelenius will safely reach me. From Nozeroy, on the first of August, 1547. Recognize the hand of the one signing, I beg you.</p>
