      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I received the letters sent to you, dear brother, from Augsburg and those sent to me through you, and I give you immense thanks for this favor. I am sending back your brother's letters and again thank you for sharing them. You understood that the prince has been captured, so it no longer seems appropriate to send anything to him, nor could anything be conveniently delivered to him except through Mr. Beza; but I am beginning to doubt where the most learned, pious, and excellent man is; I fear he too has fallen in that most fierce battle, of which they report, that in the memory of men none has ever been more savage anywhere. The papists have experienced that the evangelicals also have hands and courage, which they have long denied and mocked the wretched. I have briefly and cursorily touched upon the history, as much as I indeed know from the letters of friends (however, in such a variety of narration, I affirm nothing for certain), and what I sent to Poland, I send to you under the condition that you return them to me by the first messenger and keep to yourself what I explain; we will hear the true history shortly, God willing. Furthermore, I earnestly beg you, my brother, to ensure that the letters attached to yours are safely transferred as soon as possible to St. Gallen to our Liner, to whom you see they are addressed, or to Zollikofer; I would not want these to be lost; there is something worthwhile in them. I can hardly believe that the Emperor was gifted by the Turk with 7 camels laden with gold; I would rather believe that now heavy exactions are being instituted by him, so that he himself pays tribute to the Turk. If you have any certain information about his journey, please share it.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. Zurich, January 15, 1563.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Matthias 1563.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
