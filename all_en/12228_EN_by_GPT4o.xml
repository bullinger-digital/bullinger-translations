      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I know that pious and studious individuals are always welcomed by your kindness, esteemed lord and dearest brother. However, since many vagabonds often deceive good men and present themselves as scholars when they are actually scoundrels, I wanted to give this Mr. Gerhard Frisius a faithful testimony, so that he is not counted among the vagabonds. He is born of an honorable and noble family, a Frisian by nation. He came to us in Zürich for the sake of piety and learning. He stayed in the house of Mr. Pellikan (Konrad Pellikan). He is pious and learned. As he is about to return home and to his homeland, he particularly wishes to see you, the church, and your city first. He is wealthy and does not need support. Therefore, receive him as he deserves. By doing this, you will perform a deed worthy of yourself and most pleasing to me. For he is greatly loved by all of us because of his piety, sincerity, and learning. Live and farewell. Zürich, 16th of June, 1545. Yours, Heinrich Bullinger. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Joachim Vadian (von Watt), consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord. St. Gallen.</p>
