    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Peutinger received two letters [not preserved]. He did not respond to the first one, hoping for a calmer moment. However, he sent his apologies to Bullinger and [Konrad] Pellikan through [Johannes] Kielmann. Meanwhile, the second letter dated October 11 arrived, indicating that his people [...] have arrived in Zurich. It is a sign of friendship that Bullinger gives him hope [for their future]. May they become useful servants of the Lord!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It's a pity that Bullinger's [second] letter did not arrive while Peutinger was still in Kempten. There, he could have fulfilled the wishes of Bullinger's acquaintances [Marx Wydler and his companions], and even proven to them how much a recommendation written by Bullinger means to him. Meanwhile, the troops were withdrawn from the [Allg채u], and Peutinger has returned to [Augsburg]. He therefore recommended the people from Zurich to friends in Ulm by letter and hopes that they have now been drafted into military service.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Some Swiss mercenaries had to be dismissed. They did not perform their duties properly, either due to inexperience or ill will, or even as a result of faulty behavior. The remaining mercenaries have served willingly and would continue to do so. However, the princes [Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Elector John Frederick of Saxony] changed their plans. The [Schmalkaldic] army has shrunk, and the princes neither want to reinforce it nor incorporate the [soldiers from F체ssen].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Peutinger thanks the Lord like David for escaping without bloodshed. He prefers to be at home. Yet, in this war, every pious person is ready to take up arms!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] There are small skirmishes daily. In a larger skirmish on October 16, about 2000 men fell on both sides. However, the [Schmalkaldic League] retained the advantage, even if this does not matter to the Imperial forces. For them, it is more important to harm the enemy rather than to hold a place. Unfortunately, the numerically weakened [Schmalkaldic League] is not only abandoned by those who are equally affected by this war as they are, but also by several allies. Added to this are the immense costs. Yet, God is the Lord of Hosts! He breaks the arrogance of the godless! Emperor [Charles V] has never had to fight against an enemy with such great effort and in such an important matter. He is supported by the bloodthirsty clergy and their accomplices. They report everything to him while concealing everything from the [Schmalkaldic League]. Despite everything, the mighty enemy was held in check for about 16 miles. However, he did not engage in a battle, and the [Schmalkaldic League] lost the Danube bank below Ulm because it seemed more important to them to prevent the Emperor from advancing through W체rttemberg, especially since he can be more easily apprehended on the Danube bank than in [the Netherlands].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Thanks to Bullinger and his people for the kind care shown to the boys! They reported about it. Peutinger also knows that the people of Zurich would neither tolerate bad behavior from the boys nor deny them what is necessary. More about the [education of the boys] later.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Request for prayer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] Peutinger forwarded Bullinger's letter [not received] to the [Swiss] mercenaries in Ulm.</p>

      <p>I did not respond to your previous letters, most distinguished man, because I was waiting for a more leisurely moment, so that I could converse with you through letters with a somewhat unburdened mind. However, I wrote to my friend Kielmann, asking him to excuse me to you and Mr. Pellican. Meanwhile, your other letter, written in Zurich on October 11, arrived, from which I understood that my people have already come into your presence; it is a sign of your kindness that you give me great hope. May the Lord grant them His grace, so that they may someday be distinguished chosen vessels in ministry, and may the power and might of the Lord be magnified in their works!</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>However, my dear Mr. Bullinger, how I wish your letters had been delivered to me in Kempten! For there I could have gratified your wishes. Now, with the change in military affairs, the soldiers who had been in the garrisons of the upper province have long been recalled, and I have returned home, I regret the opportunity taken from me, by which your acquaintances would have known how much your recommendation was valued by me. Nevertheless, I did what I could. I immediately wrote to Ulm, where they are now serving, and earnestly asked friends to hold them in the highest esteem for my sake. I hope to achieve something with this request. If not, I ask that you do not attribute the blame to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Some of your people, whether through military inexperience or malice, or, as I think, through error (and I certainly do not know for sure, less than it was fitting for them, they performed their duty) were honorably dismissed through their colleagues. The remaining ones were eager and willing, and I would not have hesitated to undertake the risk of war with this soldier, if our princes had persisted in the same mind as before. But our forces were too small to conduct affairs. Our people were as reluctant to increase them as they were unwilling to have their own forces increased with this soldier.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I am nowhere more willingly than at home, and, like David, I give thanks to the Lord, by whose favor I have returned home with unstained hands. I do not know by what adverse fate I am driven into these disturbances. Yet the present war is such that no pious person doubts to take up arms.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I would write about our affairs if I had anything certain. There are daily skirmishes with light battles. One notable event occurred on October 16. About two thousand men fell on both sides, with nearly equal losses, but our side was superior; which is of little consequence to the Imperial forces. For they place their glory in the loss of the enemy, not in holding the place. We are a small number who sustain this burden of the world and the conspiracy of the antichristians against the Lord. Not only do those whose danger is as much at stake as ours not condescend, but many of our confederates abandon us; we are exhausted by these immense expenses. Yet the Lord God of hosts is our mighty redeemer, who has hitherto restrained the insolence and the open mouth with which these impious ones attempt to devour the world. Nor has the emperor ever had an enemy in all his wars against whom he had a more numerous army, better equipped forces, and greater opportunities for conducting affairs. For everywhere this bloodthirsty clergy and their accomplices, mixed among us, bring everything to the emperor; they close everything to us - in which I do not know why we still use this gentleness in preserving them! Certainly, by the Lord's favor, within a space of 16 miles, the formidable enemy was held back, to whom we have given the power of fighting perpetually, he has always refused, nor has he ever done so on equal terms. We lost the bank of the Danube, which is below Ulm, because we could not both protect that shore and prevent the crossing into the Duchy of W체rttemberg, nor could we do both at the same time, but we have him more easily in that place than within our borders, nor could we guard against such a great enemy in all respects, nor is it surprising that we are pressed by a burden under which great kingdoms have fallen before us.</p>

      <p>As for my boys, your help is most welcome to me; and mine write much about your and your people's services. For these, I will return thanks and will write more about the boys' affairs later. Meanwhile, I think you will not allow them to err or lack anything necessary.</p>
