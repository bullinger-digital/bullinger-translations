      <p>Grace and perpetual peace from God the Father.</p>
      <p>I sent to you, most learned Bullinger, a letter from Geneva, in which I responded to yours, but I do not know with what mind you received it; I fear, however, that it was less benevolently than I would wish.</p>
      <p>If there was anything in it written by me that might have upset you, a most serious and prudent man, I beg you, my father, to cast out from your mind any such offense, if indeed there was any, and embrace me with your benevolence as a father does a son. I loved Castalio's piety, but I did not love his doctrines, which he perhaps shared with Ochino, and I resisted him in debate more than once. For by God's grace, I am most zealous for Christian peace and unity, which today those who violate with new doctrines not known to the ancient church, violate and break the body of Christ. Furthermore, whoever is of such a kind will always find me a serious adversary, for Christ has called us to peace.</p>
      <p>It is indeed shameful to confess the catholic church and the communion of saints in daily profession of faith, yet not to wish to subject the sense of one's faith to this communion, which indeed ceases to be κοινςνια if there is diversity of opinions.</p>
      <p>Would that both your Ubiquitarians and our Tritheists would rightly consider this, whose heresies I so abhor that I have almost wasted away with grief. The Brentians have already been refuted by you, and not by you alone, but also condemned by the entire Christian world both in the past and today. But those remain to be refuted who so shamelessly tear apart and dissect that divine nature, against whose audacity we implore your help. For just as we have drawn the beginnings of clearer faith from you by God's will, so we greatly expect the growth and confirmations of the same from you. But you, as is your piety, are prepared to help the supplicants and the lowly, for we are all one body in the Lord, but the duties of the members of the same body are diverse, concerning which I think I have sent something of mine to you, my Thracian. I have been expecting letters from my homeland for many months now.</p>
      <p>I share a common lodging with Wilhelm Stucki, a young man from Zürich very devoted to letters. However, a certain man from Rostock of the Brentian sect lived with us, than whom I have never seen or heard anything more absurd, worthy to wander perpetually on earth, since he denies that Christ our Savior ascended into heaven.</p>
      <p>I see men arisen who mix heaven and earth. But about these matters, I neither wish nor care to write to you, most learned man.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to you as to a most benevolent father, and you with your flock to Christ the supreme shepherd. Paris, July 8, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours, as a most reverent father, most observant Johannes a Lasco, the Pole.</p>
      <p>Inside are letters from Petrus Ramus to Mr. Gesner.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent pastor of the church of Christ, as to a father to be revered. Zürich.</p>
