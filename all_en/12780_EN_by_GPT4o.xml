    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer would have liked to send the letter enclosed in the present writing yesterday, but the messenger had already departed. Therefore, he is now sending it with his own courier [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] [On December 28] at 10 o'clock at night, envoys from Lindau arrived, who were allowed into the city. They brought a letter addressed to Lindau from the people of Ulm, who supposedly sent a similar one to Konstanz, only that its bearer apparently was delayed. In it, the people of Ulm report that Emperor [Charles V] has pardoned them. However, the conditions are not listed, only that this supposedly did not happen to the detriment of their religion, as a free council is supposed to decide on religious matters. The Emperor imposed a fine on the people of Ulm. The people of Ulm are also said to have asked the Emperor to pardon all Protestants, but in vain.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] However, they were able to achieve that the southern German cities, just like Ulm, would be received into the imperial grace if they immediately submit. Therefore, all cities should send authorized envoys to Ulm on the coming Sunday [January 2, 1547]. These should appear in black clothing (as a sign of humility) (the people of Ulm also want to help them achieve peace). Otherwise, the Emperor will immediately send 2000 Dutch horsemen against the cities until they agree to negotiate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The council of Konstanz then merely decided to send envoys to Ulm on Sunday to learn the details and conditions of such a reconciliation and to act accordingly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer learned this confidentially from his cousin Konrad Zwick. Not even Blarer's brother [Thomas] knows about it. Blarer and Zwick have long deliberated on this and concluded that the Zurich councilors should write to the authorities of Konstanz as soon as possible, as outlined in the enclosed letter. However, the names of Blarer and Zwick must not be mentioned in the whole matter!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Emperor wants to win the cities over with kind words, expand the House of Austria, and allow no other alliances. Since the Confederation is certainly as concerned as Blarer and Zwick that Konstanz does not make a pact with the Emperor (which will probably happen if no other solution is found, just as it has probably already happened with the other southern German cities), it would be good if the Zurich council convened the other Confederates for a meeting soon and informed their allies about the situation and its possible consequences. Although the Catholic [places] will hardly want to take action against the Emperor, they should at least allow the [Protestant] places [Basel, Bern, Schaffhausen, and Zurich] to inform Konstanz that if they do not let anyone pass through their city to the detriment of the Confederates within a year, nor provide any other assistance to the enemy, the [Protestant] places will come to their aid in an emergency with the approval of their allies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Zwick would like to speak with Bullinger or (if he is prevented) with another skilled and trustworthy person about this, whether in Stammheim or elsewhere, provided that Zwick travels through Stein [am Rhein] [to avoid arousing suspicion]. Bullinger should quickly inform through the present messenger when and where Zwick should go. A meeting is necessary, especially since not everything can be handled in writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] This matter should only be discussed with the most trustworthy [councilors], as really only Blarer and Zwick know about it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Even if the Zurichers probably cannot set a date for a meeting immediately, they should nevertheless promptly address a letter, like the one in the enclosure, to the council of Konstanz. Zwick and Bullinger should also meet quickly!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] May the Lord help bring this matter to a good end! Our sins and our ingratitude have caused this severe trial and punishment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Apologies for the sudden writing! The matter brooks no delay.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] [Enclosure 1:] How some [Zurich councilors] should write to their secret councils.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] The [Zurich councilors] received credible news that negotiations are underway with the neighbors of Konstanz, which could soon cause great harm to Zurich and the Confederation. Therefore, they ask their secret councils to encourage the people of Konstanz in writing or verbally and to ask them not to engage in anything that could harm the Confederation, but rather to report accordingly. They are confident that the Zurichers and the other Confederates will gladly help the people of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] This is what the [Zurich councilors] wanted to communicate to their secret councils. They further ask them to address only the secret councils of Konstanz, so that the matter does not become public.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Perhaps the Zurich secret councils will come up with other measures to further maintain the good neighborly relations between Zurich and Konstanz. The Zurich [councilors] are also ready to contribute to this and are writing with this intention to Bern and Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] [Bullinger's note:] To the secret councils of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] [Enclosure 2:] What the secret councils of Basel, Zurich, and Bern should write to the secret councils of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] The secret councils are aware of the great danger in which Konstanz is hovering. They and their councils are interested in the well-being of Konstanz and the maintenance of good relations between the city and the Confederation. Therefore, they offer the people of Konstanz a secret, interest-free loan of 15,000 florins. However, the people of Konstanz should commit in writing that as long as they have not repaid the money, they will not allow anyone to pass through their city or territory against Basel, Bern, Zurich, and in general against the Confederation, nor help the enemies in any way, but rather repel them should they try to force a passage with violence.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] However, should the case arise that the people of Konstanz have not yet repaid the money and need to maintain stronger guards with the citizens for their better protection or accept foreign auxiliary troops, Basel, Bern, and Zurich would again advance them 1,000 to 10,000 guilders. What the city of Konstanz uses for defense will not have to be repaid. The rest, however, must be repaid within a month after the auxiliary troops are dismissed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">[20] Konstanz should inform whether this would be helpful to them. If not, they should know that this proposal is made for their sake and is well-intentioned.</p>

      <p>Friendly, dear lord and brother, I wanted to send you the enclosed letter yesterday, but the messenger was gone. Now it happens that I want to send you this with my own courier.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>On the night of December 28, some envoys from Lindau arrived. They were let in. They brought a letter from the people of Ulm, stating that they have been pardoned by the Emperor, and the same will happen to my lords (because the messenger was delayed). The content of the letter from Ulm is that they report being received into the grace of the Emperor (though it does not state under what terms and conditions, only that it is without detriment to their religion - as matters concerning this should be clarified at a free Christian council), and that they have paid a fine to the Emperor. They have also sought earnestly that such grace might be extended to all Protestants, but have not been able to obtain it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As for the southern German cities, they have achieved that if they come immediately and submit like Ulm, they will also be received in the same way. Therefore, they should send all their envoys to Ulm on the coming Sunday with full authority, dressed in black clothes, to show humility. The people of Ulm will instruct them on how to conduct themselves and what must be done in the matter. Otherwise, the Emperor will immediately send up to 2000 Dutch and fresh horsemen against these cities to their detriment and ruin until further negotiations can be held with them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>However, my lords have not decided further than to send envoys to Ulm on Sunday to learn exactly what the articles and conditions of this reconciliation (as they call it) are, so that they can act accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>My dear cousin Konrad Zwick has informed me of this in confidence. We have both talked about it for a long time, and truly, truly (I swear by the God of heaven), no other person knows about it; not even my dear brother! And we still consider it best that your lords write such a letter, as indicated in the enclosed letter, to our lords without delay. But you should not mention my cousin or my name for various reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>And since the Emperor's intention is to win over the cities with kind words, to better secure and expand the House of Austria, and to prevent any other alliances (as we know, all those he has taken in are ensnared), and we both truly believe that the common Confederation is as much concerned as we are that Konstanz does not fall into such matters (as it is to be feared that this will happen if no other way is found, as we do not doubt it has already happened with the other southern German cities), we consider it very fruitful if your lords immediately write to the other Confederates and inform them of this, explaining what is at stake for the common Confederation. And although it is likely that the papists will not act against the Emperor, if the evangelical places could only get approval from the others to write to my lords, etc., if they do not let anyone pass through their city to the detriment of the Confederates within a year (so that one is not burdened by the length of time), nor provide any other assistance, they would in turn, if something unjust were to be inflicted on a city like Konstanz, protect and shield them with the approval of their other allies, also with a proper addition, etc. This could lead to a good outcome for the matter, and that we may still remain in good neighborliness with each other and be helped on both sides as far as this matter is concerned.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>But my dear cousin (if it also seems good to you - as it truly appears to me to be the best) would be willing to speak with you personally about all this, if you decide on a place where he would have to pass through Stein, whether it be to Stammheim or just to a place that is closer to Zurich and therefore more convenient for you. Or if you cannot, then someone else skilled and trustworthy could come there. But he would prefer to have you. Therefore, please inform through this courier quickly where he should come and when, if you also consider it good otherwise, as it is truly not only good for me, but also necessary for a more skillful handling of all things; for not everything can be written down in this way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Therefore, consider this quickly and discuss it with the most trusted, so that the matter is not mocked in any way! For by the highest truth, and as I can swear to you, no other person knows about this matter except for the two of us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>However, if perhaps the day could not be set immediately by your lords, then they are nevertheless working on it, so that such a letter, as mentioned in the enclosed letter, is promptly sent to my lords by yours, etc. That would be good; and that my dear cousin and you meet without delay.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Praying to Almighty God that He may lead and bring these difficult matters to a good end. How heavy are these trials and great punishments of our sins and ingratitude!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Forgive my sudden writing. The time demands that one does not delay in this matter. God be with you temporally and eternally! Amen. Dated December 30 at 10 o'clock before noon. You know me well.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my especially trusted dear lord, to his own hands.</p>

    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Copy, how some may write to the secret councils in Zurich, etc.:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>We have received credible information that various dealings are being conducted with our neighbors, the people of Konstanz, which may soon, and perhaps even immediately, cause significant harm to us and the common Confederation. Therefore, we ask you to address the people of Konstanz in writing or verbally in a neighborly and comforting manner, and to ask them not to engage in anything against the Confederation, but to report to you if anything burdensome happens to them; so they are of good hope that your lords and superiors, as well as other Confederates, will gladly provide them with as much honorable advice as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>We have also intended to write this to our secret councils with the request that you only inform the secret councils of Konstanz of this intention, so that it remains quieter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>We also consider it good and not displeasing to our lords if you know of other suitable means that would serve to maintain good neighborly relations between us and the city of Konstanz, that you do not neglect them. To this end, we will also gladly help on our part, and we are writing the same intention to our Confederates in Bern and Basel. Dated.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>To the secret councils in Zurich. Copy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Indication of how the secret councils in Basel, Zurich, and Bern might write to the secret councils in Konstanz.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>You, the secret councils, have now often understood the danger in which the people of Konstanz stand, etc. Since your lords and you are inclined from the heart to promote the benefit of the city of Konstanz and to consider the means by which the old good neighborliness and friendship between them and a praiseworthy Confederation can be maintained, you have not wanted to refrain from offering them the following means from a good friendly heart, namely, if it serves them, you are willing to lend them 15,000 florins secretly without any annual interest. In return, you ask that they commit in writing that as long as they have not repaid such money, they will not allow anyone to pass through their city and territory against you and the common Confederation, nor provide any assistance or support to their public enemies, but shall be obliged to defend to the best of their ability those who would try to force a passage with violence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>And so that they can provide for this and protect themselves better, if the danger arises that they have not yet repaid the mentioned sum, and it happens that they must maintain stronger guards with their citizens or accept a foreign addition, you are willing to advance them again from one to ten thousand guilders, and what they spend on the addition or necessary guard and watch in times of danger, they shall not be obliged to repay to you, but the remainder, which is not spent on the addition, guard, and watch from the other ten thousand guilders, they shall repay within a month's time after the addition is dismissed or the danger ceases, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>If they now think that this means is useful and acceptable to them, they may inform you of their mind. If not, they should still recognize that you have meant the matter truly and well for their sake.</p>
