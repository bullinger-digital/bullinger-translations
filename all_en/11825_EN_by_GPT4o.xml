      <p>Bullinger to the most distinguished man, Philipp Melanchthon, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Our young men, who returned to us from Wittenberg last summer, could never sufficiently praise your, most illustrious Philipp, goodwill and humanity towards all the people of Zurich. They also brought letters from you addressed to the overseers of the College, which are most ample witnesses of your favor and zeal towards us. For these, I give you the greatest thanks, and in return, we offer all our services and ourselves entirely to you and yours, praying that you may persevere in that goodwill towards us. For we love that piety, learning, and humanity which is singular in you, and we desire to show our favor to you by some token. I certainly send you these books of commentaries on John with no other intention than to approve my zeal towards you. I would gladly give greater things if I could, but now I offer what I have with a sincere mind. You, in your humanity, will consider these things kindly. For I love you and desired to gratify your mind with this small gift, knowing that you delight in the diligence and studies of scholars. I labored in writing and publishing these for nine continuous months, and in the whole work, I aimed at nothing else than that Christ, true God and Man, and what the heavenly Father has granted us through Him, may be rightly understood and received by faith. Moreover, I have explained the mysteries of the eagle flying very high to the students in such a way that no one, I think, can accuse me of stirring up envy, as if I were urging new, thorny, or contentious matters more than those received and defended by the ancient church, which all call Catholic, with great consensus through the spirit of truth. Meanwhile, I frequently oppose and refute the new and harmful doctrine of Schwenckfeld, which afflicts the minds of many, especially when I discuss the true humanity of Christ and the truth of His resurrected body in chapters I, II, III, IX, XVI, XVII, and XX. Since that blasphemous Servetus from Spain and a certain babbler Campensis and the insane Anabaptists have spread perverse opinions about the Divinity of Christ, the worship of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, and the ineffable union, connection, or strengthening of both natures of Christ into the hearts of many, I have endeavored, with the utmost faith, care, and diligence, whenever the occasion allowed, while omitting the names of those men, to assert the orthodox sense of the holy Church and abolish the heretical. I hope, however, that I have not done an ungrateful thing to the pious and studious. Indeed, with all the desire of my heart, in this whole work of mine, I have strived to defend the catholic truth, to overthrow perverse opinions, and to serve all the saints: which is known by Him who knows the hearts of all, our Lord Jesus. Therefore, receive this gift from one most devoted to piety and your name. I commend myself to your piety and prayers, most illustrious man, who has deserved so well of letters and piety. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for His Church and for all of us for a long time. Dr. Megander, Dr. Pellicanus, Dr. Bibliander, and Erasmus Fabricius, the ministers of our Church, greet you: as well as the professors of your school: Dr. Ammianus, Collinus, Gessner, Werdm√ºller, and others. May the most distinguished man Dr. Martin Luther be safe together with that choir of most pious and learned men there with you, to whom you will diligently commend me. Zurich.</p>
