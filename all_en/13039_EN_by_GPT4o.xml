    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Certainly, Bullinger will have learned how cruelly King Ferdinand is dealing with the Bohemian [estates] to turn a free kingdom into a subject territory. All esteemed rulers should do something against it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Emperor Charles V is undergoing a wood cure in Augsburg. There are no negotiations yet because they are waiting for King Ferdinand. He would proceed as usual in a very slippery manner. The Emperor and the King want all Austrian hereditary lands to become part of the [planned] Swabian League.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Because the Viceroy of Naples, Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, did not draft a contract, which was concluded with imperial permission, as agreed in writing, a greater uprising has occurred in Naples than before. Three significant personalities from Naples, who were summoned to the castle, were forced under threat of death to sign the contract. Two complied. However, one [Giovanni Domenico Grasso] did not yield. When he later returned home from a banquet, he died. To suppress the ensuing uprising, the Emperor is said to send 100 cannons on wheels to Italy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] There are reports of military advances from the Hanseatic cities and Count Albrecht of Mansfeld. What the Emperor has taken, those are now reclaiming. The people of Bremen have conquered land from their Archbishop, Christoph of Brunswick.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] After his return, Duke Henry the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel is once again harassing the cities located in his territory. The latter will likely not allow him to exercise his comital power again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The current situation is so uncertain that the Confederates would do well to be united and to communicate with other rulers [such as Henry II]. It is rightly said that a protective hand is worth gold. Greetings to the mayors Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater, to whom Bullinger should convey this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bullinger should forward the enclosed letter to its destination.</p>

      <p>My willing service and all the best beforehand. Gracious, dear lord, you have undoubtedly heard how the Roman king is dealing so cruelly (gruesomely) with the Bohemians, turning a free kingdom into a possession. All potentates and honorable hearts should act against this!</p>

      <p>The Emperor is in Augsburg undergoing a wood cure. Nothing is being negotiated until the king from Bohemia arrives. He will conduct very slippery affairs, as is his custom. They persist in bringing all Austrian hereditary lands into the league.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In Naples, there is a greater uprising than before, because the Viceroy there, with the approval of the imperial majesty, has established and concluded a contract, but not as agreed in writing. Of the three prominent persons he summoned to the castle, forced to sign and seal it (when they resisted, he reportedly answered they must do it or die), two complied, but one answered he would rather die. After being given food, he went home and died. This is the cause of an even greater uprising than before. The imperial majesty is said to send 100 cannons on wheels into Italy.</p>

      <p>The war is to be resumed by the Hanseatic cities and Count Albrecht of Mansfeld. What the Emperor had previously taken, they are reclaiming. The people of Bremen have taken land and people from their bishop.</p>

      <p>As soon as Duke Henry of Brunswick returned to his land, he once again began his old ways against the neighboring cities, causing them to not allow him to enter.</p>

      <p>All matters are still uncertain, therefore your Confederates do very well and rightly to remain united and to reconcile with other potentates. For a protective hand is worth gold. This I also wish to convey to the mayors, along with the offering of my willing service.</p>

      <p>Dated Constance, the 14th day of August in the year 1547. I ask you to forward the enclosed letter to its destination. S. Schertlin von Burtenbach, knight, has signed.</p>
