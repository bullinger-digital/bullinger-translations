      <p>S. I responded briefly to your last letter, venerable Mr. Compater, for the reasons I mentioned at the time. Now, having more time, I will be more detailed. First, regarding Felk, do not think that anything has been spread here about him that could be detrimental or disgraceful to him; for besides the fact that I trusted he would not flee, I easily suspected the matter to be as it was. He was with Christoph Nikolaus or Clewi, a man known to you, with whom he spent several weeks fishing and hunting, neglecting letters and money out of negligence, not malice. I received everything intact. The only thing that aroused suspicion in Mr. Jacob and me was that he did not return all the money he had received from Rordorff to deliver to Jodocus, as he should have; but I think this has also been corrected. We could not help him at present, as he might be ashamed to receive the daily alms given to other poor students. However, it is not possible to obtain another stipend for him. To entrust him with a position, either ecclesiastical or scholastic, seems unworthy and against our conscience, as he is a boy in learning and very foolish in manners.</p>
      <p>We dismissed him with the hope that if a lower scholastic position becomes available in Burgdorf, Zofingen, or Thun, we will not forget him. It is hardly possible to act otherwise with Mr. Jacob Zorn; you know what he is like, and so do we, and it is difficult to promote those whom the Zurich church has rejected. It is no small task to promote those commended by piety, learning, and holiness of life, let alone those in whom we face the danger that if they maintain their old ways and continue as usual, we will be blamed for our recommendations, and they will become worthless before the senate. For if Horace's rule is to be observed anywhere, it is certainly here: "Look again and again at the kind of person you recommend, lest the sins of others soon bring you shame." I must act cautiously, as I am criticized everywhere in the city and countryside for promoting only Swabians, and if not for the skill of some of those I promoted, I would be torn apart in various ways. I pity his misery, but I do not see how I can help. I had given him advice a few months ago, which he neglected, namely, to obtain letters of promotion from the Zurich senate to the abbot of St. Urban; for there was a vacancy at that time, the collation or right of patronage of which belonged to him. But then he either could not or would not. Now he comes with no vacancy except the deaconry in Burgdorf, for which another has already been assigned, though not yet confirmed.</p>
      <p>I advised him not to ask for anything now; for even if he is accepted as a candidate, which is uncertain whether he can obtain, he will not be accepted unless he has a testimony of his departure from you. If he asks for that from you, the benefit he enjoys as a candidate will be denied him, and there is a risk that he will be forced to wait here without a stipend longer than with you with a stipend. Therefore, we send him back, with the same hope as with Felk, that if so many positions become vacant that the shortage of ministers forces the senate to accept foreigners, as sometimes happens, we will call him. This for the next time.</p>
      <p>As for the previous matters, I still see these to be answered: First, I cannot inquire about the Bachofin; I have asked at the Lion and other places; no one wants to know anything about her. I still inquire daily; if I find her, I will carry out your command with her faithfully.</p>
      <p>Regarding Calvin, I have not yet received anything from Alterius, although I have recently written about it. I also have nothing from him that belongs to you; whatever I receive, I will send as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Musculus's wife will recover in about a month; I will carry out everything as you have instructed me. But nothing would be more pleasing to me than if you could come here yourself; I hope it would bring much good if you could speak with our acquaintances. There are some who are so morose that they do not want to hear anything about your declaration with Calvin. They envy, as I conjecture, the peace that would follow for the churches. Therefore, if possible, if something comes from Calvin, do not send it to us in letters, but come yourself or send Gwalther, if it suits him.</p>
      <p>The Losner affair is still ongoing; they recently sent two from the class who made a great complaint before the council about Zebedee, how he is negligent in all his duties, laid out in 16 articles in writing, where the majority had neither hands nor feet, so that one can easily perceive that it is a petty envy and grudge, except that he cannot excuse himself. He, in turn, wrote us a common letter, in which he, however, disparaged some of their words; I send it to you here.</p>
      <p>We presented it to those he wrote about; they deny everything. We examined MÃ¶llin and Vincent, found them upright; but his writing indicates otherwise, which makes us suspicious of the matter. In return, I send you some letters, not letters, but booklets, of Viret; if you have time, you can see what troubles we have with these people. Please send the letters back to me with the next messenger.</p>
      <p>Finally, a respectable council recently instructed us to endure their affair and report it to their grace. Among us, the votes were unequal, many were displeased. However, it was decided, as we thought best, that Zebedee should be transferred to the schoolmastery in Yverdon; also that their way of holding colloquia, from which the essence comes, should be rejected; also that four stipendiaries should always be kept here, who could also notice if any innovation were to arise. This was again rejected by a respectable council for the schoolmasters, preachers, and readers; tomorrow we will meet and decide something about it. It is unlikely that only Zebedee will be changed; the others would also like Viret, Ribitt, and others more; but this seems to be completely ruinous for both the school and the church. I hope that if Zebedee came from them, it would be better.</p>
      <p>As for my own affairs, it is as follows: My lords were willing to write further to Zurich, which is why I caused my lords to write something to you as well. However, since the letters were returned to me and the matter was settled here in the meantime, I have decided to let it be a good thing for now.</p>
      <p>Perhaps I will come in the autumn; then I will see how I will handle my affairs.</p>
      <p>I am curious to see what will arise from the murder in Monterys. I am sorry for the honorable people who were killed; the rascals are starting to cause so much mischief in our lands that it is almost unbearable. It is written here as if without any inquiry, and it was written on a garden house outside the gate: "Today Bern and in over 8 years Spanger gladly;" it is a French writing; the writer cannot be found. The intrigue and treachery are great. God protect us from unrest!</p>
      <p>I am very concerned that we will also be measured with the measure with which we have long measured others. The mischief, tyranny, and all vices are gross and great among us. May God forgive us and keep us in blessed peace, amen.</p>
      <p>My wife, Musculus, and his family send you and yours, along with all your household, warm greetings. Greet all the brothers for us.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern on August 22, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Musculus intends to send this letter soon to St. Gallen, so that he may receive a reply from the messenger who is now going there.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, his venerable lord and compater. Zurich.</p>
