      <p> My friendly, willing service along with all good things is always ready for you, noble, steadfast, especially gracious young lord. I have received your letter concerning Maximilian Seeman and understood its content, and since the matter touches upon the examination, I have also brought it before others appointed for the examination, where we are all inclined to assist you and in everything possible, willing to serve. However, since the aforementioned Maximilian is as much our son as he is with those who have raised him from youth and whose actions and conduct are known to us, we have felt obliged to remind him, as a pious, simple young man, of the difficulty of the office that would be imposed on him, as well as the great danger he would place himself in, the good time of youth, which he would pass without solid teaching and proper studies. We have also pointed out to him his youth, and that he, being inexperienced and unpracticed, and without any reputation, would come to such a divine created office, where it would not only concern his own, but the salvation of many honest people's souls, therefore, in these his young years, in his inexperience and at this time, it would be better for him to learn more himself, than to be a teacher or pastor, so that he could later serve you and other honorable people with greater fruit. To this, he indicates to us that the matter itself is very burdensome for him, and he would rather continue and study better, than to let himself be placed in such a difficult office so young, with the desire that we would send a letter to you, hoping that he would be released in grace. Which we cannot refuse him; we offer ourselves willingly and with diligence to serve you, where possible, whether it be with examining someone whom you would like to appoint and set in this parish, or in another way, whatever would be pleasing to you and possible for us to prove to you at all times. Kindly asking that you would take this our letter in good part from us. </p>
      <p> May God graciously keep you and all yours in His grace at all times. </p>
      <p> Dated in Zurich, the 20th of June in the year of our Lord 1554. Your willing servant at all times, Heinrich Bullinger, of the church in Zurich. </p>
