      <p>Greetings. I do not cease to think well of you and feel kindly towards you, therefore I wish to briefly touch upon matters of the empire for you, for you, I say, my friend. The King, along with the group of papists, has spent many months in Augsburg, turning every stone to see how they might ruin the rest of Germany; they were especially intent on this, to restore the papacy with Christ Jesus being outlawed.</p>
      <p>However, by the mercy of God, it has finally happened that the adversaries, frightened by the Turk and other impending evils, have come to terms with the Protestants (as it is said), namely among other things thus:</p>
      <p>There shall be a common peace among the orders of the empire, perpetual and inviolable under the penalty of perjury and broken peace.</p>
      <p>Religion, both evangelical and Roman, shall be free and unpunished for each individual.</p>
      <p>Archbishops, bishops, abbots, and that kind of distinguished persons, if they defect to the Augsburg Confession because of wealth, shall renounce immovable ecclesiastical goods, be participants in the rest, and this shall last until the ordinary determination.</p>
      <p>It shall be free for princes, barons, and the nobility of the empire to establish either the Augsburg or papist religion in their dominions, notwithstanding even if the right of patronage of certain churches belongs to other princes or bishops. The judgment of the imperial chamber shall be constituted with fair assessors from each religion.</p>
      <p>As much of the ecclesiastical goods as anyone now possesses, so much shall yield to him and remain.</p>
      <p>There are more chapters, which I will send to you hereafter, when the public treaty shall have been published, which they say will happen within eight days.</p>
      <p>The Lutherans and papists wanted to exclude the Zwinglians, Schwenckfeldians, Anabaptists, etc., by name from the peace made, but some sensible people resisted them and obtained the omission of such hateful exclusion.</p>
      <p>Farewell and commend me to your prayers.</p>
      <p>I have now withdrawn myself from the office of chancellorship hoping to obtain a more tranquil life; but, deceived in my opinion, I am burdened with many labors both at home and abroad. Give my greetings to our friends and brothers in Zürich and those acting elsewhere.</p>
      <p>I wish our Musculus to be safe, to whom business has now forbidden me to respond to his letters. September 15, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Georg Frölich (Laetus) from Lemnicz, etc. To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, incomparable friend.</p>
