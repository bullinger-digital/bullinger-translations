      <p>Greetings. So that you are not unaware of what is happening here: Comander and his entire household are now healthy and strong; for three people from his household were taken by the plague. For several days now, no one has died or fallen ill. Frost in these days has caused great damage to our grapes, and also to the vines themselves for the coming year; otherwise, we are rich in hay and grain in all the Confederations. In the Valtellina Valley, the wine yield is mediocre, in the Milanese region there is almost no wine, little wheat, which is devoured by soldiers; many others perish from hunger. The royalists say with great certainty that Ulpianus was captured by the king; the imperialists, who pass through here from Italy, deny it. - As for what you wonder about, I do not wonder at all. Who will grant that either diligence is practiced here, with sleepiness cast aside (so that I do not say anything more serious), or that we have another who is vigilant, diligent, does the work of the Lord without deceit, constantly looking to private gain, and when it is time to preach seriously, does not paint us that picture, of which Horace speaks in his art: "A human head to a horse's neck," etc., a poem known to you. For it is fitting for me to speak freely before you indeed; otherwise, no one has ever heard anything of this kind from me. He occupies the place; we have a shortage of preachers, not of those who speak German, we do not need them, but of those who can speak Romansh and be understood by everyone. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most excellent man, and do not cease to love your Philippus. From Chur, on the 24th of September, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your devoted Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>Please make sure to let me know if you have received this letter.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord in all good things.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
