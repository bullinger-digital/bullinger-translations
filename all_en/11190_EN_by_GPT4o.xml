      <p>Greetings. Melchior complains that his brother is upset about having been left out of a decision without consultation, and he asks me to excuse this action to his brother and to reconcile them. I beg you to do this diligently. The young man acted honestly; he gave up a position, which he himself did not seem to need, to someone who was in great need. Then, overwhelmed by his duties, he wanted to better devote himself to his studies. For this is indeed the most opportune time for learning, and certainly, if he wishes to learn any particular discipline, he should now apply himself to it most earnestly. I beg you to excuse all these matters to his brother diligently.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your brother in the Lord, Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To his friend Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
