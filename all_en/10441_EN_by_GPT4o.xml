      <p>To Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, his gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Illustrious high-born prince and lord, my willing obedient service is always ready for your princely grace.</p>
      <p>I give God, our heavenly Father, eternal praise and thanks that He has heard our call and has given your princely grace victory, honor, and praise, and has removed the disgrace from us, with which all adversaries (enemies) have made the eternal truth hated, by which they have neither victory, fortune, nor salvation. May Almighty God grant your princely grace wisdom, strength, and humility, so that you may bring your endeavors to a blessed end, that through it divine truth and common justice may arise. I am also without doubt that all victory, fortune, and salvation will be given to your princely grace by God alone, because you promote God's word and common justice. And when such honor is granted to you by God, it is fitting that you seek God's honor above all things, and when the opportunity arises and the circumstances allow, help bring the truth, which is obscured by false appearances and manifold false teachings, to light. For all pious and God-loving people have great hope in your princely grace, as you have always been found faithful to the truth. Therefore, I earnestly ask your princely grace to be committed to the spread of the Gospel of Christ and not to heed the accusations of our envious detractors, who call us fanatics, rebels, and despisers of the holy sacraments. For we teach nothing that is not founded in Scripture and that all friends of God have always held and believed.</p>
      <p>May God faithfully preserve your princely grace in His divine protection for the comfort of all His servants.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, July 4, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's humble, willing</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the Church of Zurich.</p>
