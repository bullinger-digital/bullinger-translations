      <p>Grace from the Lord, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>The latter things are always worse than the former, which we hear from Zurich, our homeland. For it is said everywhere with constant rumor that not many days ago it was reported to the senate and people of your city and acted upon with votes, whether you wish the Mass to be abolished or restored among you. This we have certainly received today from the Basel brothers urging us to Constance. But if this has happened in Zurich, as I hardly believe, where Christ has been proclaimed with such faith and truth for almost fifteen years now, what do you expect will happen among us, who have scarcely tasted Christ and His word and among whom the fruit of the sown seed perishes more easily? Oh gods and men, to whom does this not cause labor or trouble, indeed tears? But if these things are not true, as I am held by great hope, and this by many arguments not to be written here, it will be yours, dearest brothers, to strive with all your might and effort that the state of your affairs in Zurich be made known to all and that this vain rumor and the stain with which Zurich is unjustly marked be defeated and wiped away. I pray, I beseech, I also contend for this alone from you, dearest brothers. You will indeed prepare great praise for yourselves from here, fruit for the word and work of the Lord, and spirit and convenience for all the pious. For you will restore spirit to all the supporters of Christ in our field (Bernbiet, countryside), and you will shut the mouths of the impious from slandering or reviling. So that you may have a sufficiently suitable occasion, the letters, which were recently sent to your senate as exhortations, and the written apology which I submit to you here, if it will be allowed with the consent of the senate, may be committed to the press. If this seems good to you, you will examine my rash writings more diligently by amplifying them. Help the falling church (if Christ and His word are still in the world with you), I beseech you, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, the first of April in the year 32.</p>
      <p>Your C. Megander.</p>
      <p>To Utinger, Leo Jud, D. Engelhart, and Bullinger, his dearest brothers in Zurich.</p>
