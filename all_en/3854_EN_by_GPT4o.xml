      <p>Most illustrious Lord Bullinger, most revered Lord, greetings.</p>
      <p>While I was in Samedan, I wrote letters to be sent to your kindness; however, I am only now sending them through the servant of Lord Peter Perna, whom I found here. If there had been any news here, I would certainly have informed you of it, as I promised in my other letters. But there is absolutely nothing at hand that you ought to know, and if indeed there is anything, you will learn it from our Lord Fabricius, whose return to us I am very pleased about, etc. You will have my brothers who are present there commended to you, as well as my absent son, and you will greet all your household in my name.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur during the fair of Saint Paul on the 2nd of February, 1559, in the dead of night. My father, who is there, also sends you many greetings and offers himself entirely to your kindness, etc. He also commends his sons to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, most revered and esteemed Lord. Friedrich von Salis, most devoted to you and yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Lord Bullinger, my most revered and esteemed Lord. In ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.</p>
