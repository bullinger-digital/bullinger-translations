      <p>Greetings. Mr. Sigismund Zollikofer has just sent me these things, which I wanted to quickly write down and send to you, honorable godfather. There are rumors here, but we receive nothing certain. If they were true, I have no doubt that they would fill everyone's ears with their ambition. Some say that the siege and attack on La Rochelle are therefore suspended until this election falls upon him; but what is true, the Lord knows. While I write this, a very fast courier appears at Baellevre. Our relatives and yours, Heinrich Brugensis with his son, the minister, who are also at the waters of the Stade court, greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live well.</p>
      <p>Very quickly from Baden, June 11, 1573.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the first session of the 13 Cantons was held; I think the assembly will be shorter, unless the French and Spanish prolong it.</p>
      <p>Yours in all respects, most devotedly, Wolfgang Haller. To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, honorable lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
