      <p>Greetings. The few news I had, I communicated to Mr. Fabritius, so that he could share them with your piety, as I have always done before. Now it remains for me to thank him for his services, which I do as much as I can, and for the booklet, which I kept for reading for myself and Mr. Fabritius for a few days; for I received it only a few hours ago.</p>
      <p>At the first opportunity, I will return it or perhaps I will bring it myself shortly. In the meantime, I am sending images of the island of Zerle and the city of Tripoli, all of which I recently received from Rome. Your piety should keep them until my arrival there and in the meantime, believe me to be your most devoted admirer. Given in Haldenstein on the 22nd of July, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your piety's most devoted, Jean Jacques de Cambray.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in piety and condition, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the church of Zürich and his honorable friend. In Zürich.</p>
