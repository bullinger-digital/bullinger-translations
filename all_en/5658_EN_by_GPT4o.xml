      <p>Greetings. Brother is a living letter; through him, you will learn all about us.</p>
      <p>I give you and your sons and sons-in-law the greatest thanks for the most splendid gifts sent to my daughter; but how can I repay this generosity and magnificence of yours? I pray to the Lord that He may repay you and continue to bless you perpetually, as He does.</p>
      <p>About the rest, soon through LÃ¶ffelsperger; for now, I am very busy, so I cannot say more.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 23, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
