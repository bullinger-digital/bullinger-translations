      <p>Greetings. Your sermons, which you sent as a gift, most esteemed man, please me greatly; I have no doubt that they will be as necessary for this calamitous time as they will be most welcome to all the pious who are tossed about with the church in such storms of tyrants. I also gave to our Myconius and Hospinianus what you sent, and they join me in giving great thanks for such a gift.</p>
      <p>The people of Frankfurt have long been freed from siege, and they have placed military garrisons in locations near the city to prevent the citizens from being infected by the plague, and they have retained no soldiers in the city, from which we hope there will be a safe passage for foreign merchants to frequent the city for the fairs. The Duke of Württemberg, after the peace was declared at Augsburg, abolished the papal mass throughout his duchy (as we have learned from the letters of Peter Toussaint, the ecclesiast of Montbéliard, in recent days) and dismissed several military units, who have gone directly to the Margrave of Brandenburg, now serving in his pay in the bishopric of Trier, gathering a new army at Speyer and Worms. He plundered the Archbishop of Mainz, the canons, and the priests, intending to do the same to those in Trier and Cologne, who shouted their alleluia before the Passion in a disorderly manner. We hear that the Emperor's fleet in the Ligurian Sea was attacked by the Turks, who are said to have sunk nine galleys and scattered all the others, capturing Madruzzo with his brother. Otto Henry, Count Palatine, recalls the ministers of the gospel, so that in his principality, with the interimists expelled and papal suspicions abolished, they may preach the gospel of Christ. Among those called is Lord Michael Diller from the Basel region, a man most learned in every kind of doctrine and language, who, four years ago, was expelled from Speyer by the Emperor for the gospel and has until now presided over the church in the city of Lauffen.</p>
      <p>I do not have time to write more at the moment.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man, long may you survive for the church of Zürich and for us.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the first of September, in the year 1552. Yours, Konrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant preacher of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich</p>
