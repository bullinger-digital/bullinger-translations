      <p>Grace and peace in Christ. Besides those two letters, the last of which you mention in your letter, which is very pleasing to me for many reasons, most illustrious father and most respected teacher, I also wrote to you and sent them to Basel, which I am very sorry were not delivered to you. Perhaps you have received them in the meantime, but if not, it must be attributed to the injuries of the times and the negligence of the messengers. As for Bartholomäus Momer, he returned to me and confirmed all the best things about the Zürich republic and church, and more confirmed than before, he returned to Breda, intending to transfer all his affairs as much as possible to the Duchy of Kleve. Meanwhile, however, the things reported to us from the Netherlands are horrendous and utterly tragic. The Spanish soldiers, besides committing countless insolences and impieties daily with impunity, also violently took the keys of the city from the consul of Ghent, a man otherwise not unfavorable to the cause of Christ, and occupied the fortress that Charles V had ordered to be built. Not content with these actions, they dared even greater things. On the ninth of September, they imprisoned Count Egmond and Horn, the admiral of the Belgian sea, and other Antwerp consuls, treasurers, and royal counselors and nobles. They attempted at the same time to seize Count Karl von Mansfeld: but he saved himself by flight, although many confirm that he was captured while fleeing. Furthermore, they took the son of Prince Wilhelm von Oranien, who was studying the humanities in Leuven (since his father is now absent), to Brussels.</p>
      <p>All these 500 Spaniards are kept and carefully guarded in Brussels. However, those three nobles of the first rank, as many believe, will be taken to Spain, to drink the hemlock with Baron von Bergh and the brother of Count Horn, who had been sent away in May 1566. Finally, they say that a Spanish fleet is expected in the Netherlands, which, besides the Spaniards who have arrived, will bring 4000 more Spaniards. The Duke of Alba is expected in Antwerp at any moment to completely overthrow and destroy this most famous trading city. Do you want more? What will be the outcome of these matters? The old tyranny of the papists is not only restored but increased and doubled. But when the bricks were doubled, Moses came. May the Lord, having mercy on us, also send us a savior, which we will not cease to pray for diligently, and we still trust that He will do so. All is silent about the king's arrival, and those ships about which I wrote to you in August seem to be armed and equipped for this purpose, to watch the sea routes and prevent the pious from crossing to England or Friesland, so that no one may escape the hands of the bloodthirsty by land or sea. Who, hearing these things, would not shudder and be astonished? But the Lord lives, against whose church the gates of hell will not prevail. Here, otherwise, there is nothing new that I thought you should be informed about. In the town of Vilvoorde, located midway between Mechelen and Brussels, on the 13th of this month, 14 nobles were beheaded. On the same day in Antwerp, 4 Anabaptists were burned alive. Help us, as you do, with your prayers, and do not hesitate to pray for all happiness for me and my colleagues. 18th of September 1566 (sic) in Frankfurt. Yours entirely, Petrus Dathenus.</p>
