    <p xml:id="regest1">Medmann's compatriot and friend Gerhard Westerburg delivered Bullinger's letter [not received] seven months ago on his [return] journey [from Zurich via Bonn]. Medmann, who came to know and appreciate Bullinger through his writings, is pleased that he can now express his admiration in a letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The enthusiasm for Medmann, repeatedly expressed by Westerburg, certainly stems from his affection that has lasted for several years. However, Medmann is not a great scholar. Although he devotes himself to the study of the Holy Scriptures as much as possible, whenever he can be of use to the Cologne Elector [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] and the public, he is ready to further promote the church reformation [in Cologne] under God's guidance, even if it leaves him with less time for study. The restoration of the church would have made further progress if Emperor Charles [V] did not have such an aversion to it, as Bullinger may have already learned from writings and will likely continue to learn in the future.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- So much for Bullinger's letter. On occasion, Medmann will write more about the attitude of Emperor Charles [V] and the intrigues of the Cologne clergy and will also report other noteworthy matters. And if Bullinger wishes to write, he can have letters forwarded via Strasbourg to [Martin] Bucer, [Kaspar] Hedio, or others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our only Savior Jesus Christ be multiplied to you, my reverend Mr. Bullinger. Mr. Gerhard Westerburg, my compatriot, a very pious man with whom I have a constant and long-standing friendship, delivered your letters seven months ago when he returned from you to us, and also explained your benevolence towards me in his speech, which I later clearly perceived in your pious and elegant letter; I do not know if I have received anything more pleasing or delightful for a long time. For, having previously begun to both love and admire you greatly from your writings, some of which I have read with diligence, most honorable man, I was very glad for the opportunity so kindly offered by you, by which I could declare in writing my conceived and certain respect, which, inflamed by admiration of your doctrine, I will always preserve towards you. I earnestly pray and beseech you, most excellent man, to continue to hold me among your own as you have begun. I, in turn, with God's inspiration, will conduct myself in such a way that you will easily grant me some place among your number.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>What Westerburg has mentioned about me to you and is accustomed to attribute to others certainly proceeds from the abundance of love with which he has pursued me for several years. Indeed, as far as I am concerned, I understand well enough how lightly I have touched upon the studies of letters; but in the meantime, I am accustomed to gladly confess that nothing is more august to me than studies, especially sacred ones, if only as much leisure as I require and feel is necessary for my studies were granted, even though I am not engaged in the public office of teaching. However, since I understand that this very thing, which the most reverend Elector of Cologne sometimes executes through me, benefits both the nascent church here and the republic, I bear more equitably that I am exercised in certain affairs (even if it is done at the expense of my studies), and I will always continue to promote the reformation of the churches begun in these places under the guidance of the Almighty, as indeed I trust, with me directing. And in this our dominion, the restoration of the churches would have been better established and received greater increase if Emperor Charles, believe me in this, my Bullinger, had not declared a singular aversion against our elector, lest I say anything harsher, on account of the established reformation of the churches, of which certain public testimonies are circulated, and perhaps in due time others will be brought forth, which you and others conspicuous in piety will read not without great admiration, as I know well enough.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>So much at this time in response to your letter, most illustrious man. At another time, when I have obtained more leisure, I will write more copiously about the affection of Emperor Charles towards us and about the endeavors of my fellow Cologne ecclesiastics, as they are called, and if anything happens in these places that I wish you to know from me or that it would be worthwhile to know. Whatever you send to Strasbourg either to Mr. Bucer or to Mr. Hedio or to others, it is certainly delivered to me; which I wanted to add, in case you might wish to respond sometime.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Be so kind as to convey my most respectful greetings to your colleagues in ecclesiastical function. Farewell well and happily, my most distinguished Mr. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>From the forest of Buschhoven, April 10, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Medmann of Cologne.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in piety and learning, the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent doctor of sacred letters in the church of Zurich, to be observed by him in Zurich.</p>
