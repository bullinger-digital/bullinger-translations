      <p>Greetings and Peace. Valentin Mentzer returns to you, honored by our most distinguished council with a calling and condition not to be rejected. I hope he will be the kind of person you proclaim and the kind that such a calling requires. Regarding the other exiled brothers, whom I have no doubt you are very concerned about, I think it would be most advisable that those who are free from suspicion of Lutheranism be sent here, and we will make every effort and work diligently for them to be received.</p>
      <p>For I see that nothing is achieved while those for whom we act are not present. I do not think anyone, especially one recommended by you, should be rejected, but easily, even if the conditions are not present, they should be supported elsewhere until better provision can be made for them. However, regarding those who have been stained even once with the mark of Lutheranism or Buceranism (for we are compelled, alas, to use such seditious terms), I can promise nothing at all; the minds of all, both the fellow believers and the leaders, have become so inflamed against them that anyone who even speaks a word in their recommendation can easily become suspect. For everyone fears that those in whom such a virus still lies dormant might again raise their crests through the opportunity of such men, and the latter error might become worse than the former.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, certainly, this people here, as you know, abhors foreigners too much, and now even more so, since there is a danger that foreigners might bring errors.</p>
      <p>However, those who are free from this suspicion will be treated better. I have heard such things about Mr. Gervasius here that I do not dare to recommend him to anyone; for many know what he has written and what kind of person he has been, among whom he would have no place. It displeases them (as we are always suspicious) that with changed fortune, they also change their minds and that harmony which they previously extolled so much. They also know that Gervasius was involved in that Lutheran surrender at Württemberg, and this does not help him here. I fear that we might labor in vain for him here until he, staying with you for some time, shows a proof of his constancy. The same judgment is held by many about Musculus, whom I, however, do not doubt to be sincere; I wish that he, if it could be convenient, would come here sometime, if perhaps his presence would be more effective than the recommendation of an absent person. I believe I could achieve that even a temporary position of teaching theology might be imposed on him, so that, having been tested in this way, he could later be appointed to the ministry. If this plan pleases you, write back to me, and I will write to him. Many good men here are already speaking about Blaurer; they would like him to leave Constance, as he has nothing more to hope for there. If it seems convenient to you, I can easily arrange for him to be called by our council; for I am very concerned about his safety; either he should leave or he will be struck down. A rumor came here from Constance that the Emperor had granted our confederates that they too might have a governor there, through whom they could be safe from the incursions of their own people; but these appear to be false.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that the Duke of Savoy is plotting something; for it is easily inferred from his writings. There are various discussions here about this matter; many debates are held, different opinions and plans are heard: some think that the land should be restored to the prince under fair conditions; others refuse this, thinking that this region should be retained for this reason alone, so that neither the Swiss to the French nor the French to us might be blocked from access; for the Emperor is plotting nothing else than to separate us, so that he might more easily prevail over both parties. And I see that this matter will be the occasion for any new confederation with the French. The French frequently write here to our leaders; but what, I do not know. Our people experience that they will have neither counsel nor aid from the rest of the Swiss; therefore, they are considering French aid, since even the Duke of Savoy now holds the greater part of Savoy. Oh, if only this province could be conveniently restored to its lord, and we would be so secluded from the French that we would finally learn that all hope is to be placed not in princes, but in God alone, and all trust! However, I fear, father, that this will not happen; for I see that the Lord wants to visit our iniquities, but the elect of God will be saved, yet as through fire; for through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God, to which I prepare my mind and place all my plans, all my help, and indeed my life in the Lord, knowing that he can keep my deposit until that day, etc.</p>
      <p>I write to our students, both Samuel and Abel, by decree of the school authorities, that having settled their affairs, they should return home to be examined and soon, if it seems good to the Lord, to be appointed to some ecclesiastical functions. I advise that they receive a testimony of their conduct and studies from you. I would have gladly retained Schnevelin in Zürich; but since it appears that he has pledged himself to a certain maiden, he is therefore completely impatient of staying there. Two or three parishes are still vacant in the countryside; for Heinrich Fischer from Zürich has died in these days, who still has brothers with you, who were also once on the stipend of the Zürich lords, and therefore it could easily be provided for some exiled brothers.</p>
      <p>I have again discussed the Dictionary with Artopaeus; he insists vehemently that it be printed here; he promises to correct it and to make every effort that it be published corrected and printed in beautiful type. If this also pleases you, I would like to apply all my care to it. All these things also hastily; it will be yours to consider them well; for I still have many letters to write.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and children in my name and that of my family, and also all the brothers and fellow believers, especially my dear Gwalther and Mr. Gervasius. I would like to have Gwalther's judgment on Viret's booklet.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 30, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours forever most devoted, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>This had slipped my mind: The school authorities have decided to send 4 more students to you; they would like them all to be with some learned person who would take care of them and diligently restrain their petulance. They have therefore enjoined me to write to you about this matter and to ask you to deign to provide them with such a host, either in the college with Benedict or with someone else. They will give each one 40 florins a year, no more, and will pay whatever they themselves have spent, so that excessive expenses may be avoided. I commend this matter to you, I beseech you. They will be sent as soon as we are informed about the lodging.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
