      <p>S. Regarding the declaration of Mr. Calvin, Farell, and yours, there is no need for me to respond extensively in private, as we express our views in public letters. I do not think our freedom will displease you, as we neither wish to prescribe anything to you nor set limits, but when asked, we did not want to conceal our judgment.</p>
      <p>We have moderated as much as we could. There were those who would soon malign, but we have suppressed their fervor with this moderation. Seriously, it does not seem advisable to us to publish it, much less for us to subscribe to it. You can do whatever seems right to you. We rejoice and give thanks to the Lord, who has granted such agreement among you in simple truth. Certainly, as you write, Calvin is great, to whom much deference is due. All of France depends on him, and nothing could be more desirable for me than if he continues to moderate his writings according to this declaration. There will be no danger from our church. I wonder if he will not also try to bring the people of Basel here. Let us continue to pray to the Lord, that He may vindicate His truth from all the dark ones who have hitherto tried to obscure it.</p>
      <p>Your consensus gives me no small hope of other good things here. May the Lord confirm it.</p>
      <p>As for their attempt to persuade that a French alliance should be made for the sake of those afflicted by the king, I am surprised they think that by this means the ways of the Antichrist and the priests can be broken. I am surprised at this method of helping, that by casting ourselves into eternal punishments, we might free them from temporal and blessed martyrdom. Indeed, we must labor for them, but in a far different way than this: with devout and unceasing prayers to our King Jesus, who is at the right hand of the Father and knows how to deliver His own from temptation.</p>
      <p>As for the extension of my vocation, I have no objection. On the same day in the evening, the Zurich courier arrived, when ours had left in the morning, and I would not have refused to serve here for another year even without any part of the Zurich stipend following me; but it seemed difficult, indeed harmful, to bind myself permanently to the ministry of this church.</p>
      <p>To receive a handwritten document from BÃ¤ler, if I could not achieve it by other means, I would wish to go to him myself; I will see to it that the matter is accomplished for you. I will retain a copy of the document until it is transcribed. If you wish it to be sent to Biel, just let me know and I will send it; if not, I will keep it with me. This is in response to yours. I cannot write more now; I am so exhausted today from preaching, reading, writing, etc. I will write more in the future. May the Lord be with you, who blesses you eternally with your wife, children, and entire household!</p>
      <p>Greet them from me. All the brothers send their greetings to you and the other brothers, our lords and brothers to be eternally honored. Everything is in haste. I have not re-read; take it in good part. June 2, 1549. Bern.</p>
      <p>Yours in all obedience, Johannes Haller.</p>
