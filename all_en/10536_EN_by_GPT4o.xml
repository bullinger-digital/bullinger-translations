    <p xml:id="regest1">Applied all possible diligence in the matter of Konrad [Lüthard]. Thomas Bucher can report on how it turned out. Further proceedings [in the matter of the monks] are to be discussed after New Year. Bullinger has obtained the release of the pastor [Johannes Wagner] of Pfäffikon from the council. Together with some pastors expelled from Solothurn, he was called to Württemberg. A warning to be cautious. The times are bad.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace, and mercy from God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Beloved brother in the Lord, with Mr. Konrad [Lüthard] I have applied all my possible diligence. What is desired and how it has gone, Thomas Bucher, the pious, faithful, honest man, can well report to you.</p>
      <p>After the New Year, we intend to deliberate whether we should wait until the synod, or act sooner, so that our knowledge does not become too burdensome, but that our knowledge is as well heard as that of the opposition, and that we are always personally heard, summoned, and questioned.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new to report, except that today I have obtained leave from my lords for the pastor of Pfäffikon. He is called to Württemberg along with some other poor brothers expelled from Solothurn out of piety.</p>
      <p>What I have instructed you to inquire about in secret, I believe, is mere gossip brought to me, not worth much attention. Always be honest, simple as doves, and wise as serpents. The times are bad.</p>
      <p>Greet all beloved brothers for me. The weary foot treads more firmly.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullingerus.</p>
      <p>To Johannes Stumpf, preacher at Bubikon, his beloved brother.</p>
