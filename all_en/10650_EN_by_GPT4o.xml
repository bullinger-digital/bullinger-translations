    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports that [Heinrich] Lavater went for a swim in the nearby Ill river on the evening of [July 4] - due to the summer heat, but also because of the skin irritations he was suffering from. He crossed the river together with two other students, but on the way back he was seized by a cramp and drowned under the eyes of the head of the college [Melchior Cumanus] and other spectators; his body was not found and buried until the following day.</p>

      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed father, greetings and peace.</p>
      <p>I do not think there is much need for circumlocution with you, partly because you have learned not only to endure all the vicissitudes of fortune bravely but also to overcome them happily, and partly because these letters have perhaps been preceded by many other messengers and finally by the very speed of rumor itself, which has reported that Lavater, dedicated to every kind of virtue and the most sacred studies of letters, has lived. He went to bathe in the cold again and again with one or two companions, with whom we all live together in one house. The intense summer heat drove him to such madness, and the remnants of the scabies, from which he hoped to be completely freed by this means, also urged him on, refusing to apply any other medicine in the past winter, although he was tormented by scabies in various ways. Therefore, he returned to the river near the city, which he had entered two or three times before, but now more confidently, not content to bathe unless he also crossed it. And would that, O immortal God, he had emerged with the same happiness with which he crossed with two other students. He stood on the bank with many others, who were all under the supervision of the college head. But why say more? No one could, even if they had risked their life to the utmost, rescue Lavater from the danger of death as he struggled (alas) in the great depth of the river. The crossing is not so difficult at that place, but he was suddenly seized by a cramp, and although he could swim, he did not have the strength to swim out. For he complained that he feared such an illness, as he had often suffered from it, not only at other times but also in the meantime, while he was undressing. A dreadful spectacle. For when he had struggled more than laboriously and for a long time, fighting strenuously to escape, and when no hope of safety appeared, with his hands alone raised and joined for a while and lifted to heaven, he was shortly after overwhelmed by the lower violence of the torrent. Nor could he be found dead that day, but the next day his body was finally found and honorably buried. You have the whole matter faithfully written down, although I myself was by no means present nor would I have wished to be, unless I could have been there to help. Those who bathed with him were the only witnesses of that calamitous bath; the other companions from the college and the head of the college happened to intervene by chance. Why should I now pour out complaints to you? Indeed, I restrain myself unwillingly. For what consolation could be greater than such grief, when (to pass over his virtues and his utmost dedication to good letters, known to you domestically) I have been miserably deprived of the most closely connected of all my companions in many respects and almost the solace of my life. But rather listen to Mr. Bedrotus, who will diligently explain all these things to you in writing.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily with the whole church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Written in Strasbourg in the house of Mr. Bedrotus in the year 1535, July 9.</p>
      <p>Otto Werdm√ºller, your most obedient servant.</p>
      <p>To the solid and true doctrine and proven faith of Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most outstanding minister of the word of the church of Zurich, my ever venerable father.</p>
