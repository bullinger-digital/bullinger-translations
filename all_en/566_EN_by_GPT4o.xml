      <p>S[alutation] from Him who is our salvation, etc. Although in previous days we have declared our opinion, as we were requested by you, most esteemed and venerable brothers, regarding that writing which you sent to us about your reconciliation with the brothers in Geneva concerning the matter of the sacraments, yet because you were not content with our response, and furthermore demand that we declare our opinion anew, and freely and maturely communicate it to you, we cannot deny this to you, whom we honor and love exceedingly in the Lord, as our most united and necessary brothers. We ask that you consider with fairness and goodwill the freedom which you request and we provide, weighing what moves us that we cannot diverge from our previous writing and opinion. You hoped (as your words sound) that you had rendered us a service far more pleasing than we seem to acknowledge or receive. But, dearest brothers, we had hoped that you could not gather this from our letters, since we expressly testified that we have nothing to criticize here, but that everything seems to be said well, learnedly, and Christianly, especially since all errors are excluded, which hitherto seemed to have supplied material for this contention.</p>
      <p>We think nothing could have been said more clearly by us. We added that we congratulate both you and them on this concord. We declared that there was never a public dissension between us and the church of Geneva that would merit a public reconciliation. And we still testify to this with clear words, and confess that we have nothing to criticize or disparage in this your declaration.</p>
      <p>By no means: but we would wish that such had always been the doctrine of those who have now agreed to this declaration. We think that such a dissension would never have arisen in our churches.</p>
      <p>We wish with all our heart that they may continue thus. We will continue likewise. We will love them. If there was any obscurity in the preface, it has now been sufficiently clarified by you in the latter writing: with which declaration we are very content, and will be even more so if they also hereafter use such clarity in teaching and writing. Therefore, we do not wish to appear as those who would dissent from you or separate ourselves. Yet we say this as before, with our conscience bearing witness, by which we are bound to watch over our churches throughout the city and countryside, that it does not seem to us to be in the interest of our churches if this concord is made public.</p>
      <p>We have ministers everywhere in great numbers, among them diverse judgments. There still lie hidden in them sparks of dissension and old conflict, which would marvelously quickly flare up and break out again if any, however small, material were applied. Yet we do not wish to prescribe anything to you here. You request our opinion.</p>
      <p>You do not wish to prescribe to us either. Therefore, you will surely take it well if we have explained it to you simply and with a good conscience. We also grant and embrace your freedom from the heart. However, regarding the subscription, we cannot at all agree to it. Not because we are ashamed of the truth, or because these things do not suffice for us, but because this could not be done without the greatest disturbance to our churches. We speak freely to you. D. Calvin and Farel are known and suspect to many of our senators, and a pernicious wasp's nest would be stirred if we referred anything about this to the senate. Therefore, we prefer to prudently enjoy pious concord by dissembling rather than imprudently exchange it for the greatest discord by making it public. Therefore, most esteemed brothers, regarding the publication, we leave it to your discretion. We do not wish to prescribe.</p>
      <p>Yet we say for our churches what seems to us. As for our subscription, we know this cannot be done without great disturbance to our republic, and therefore we ask that you do not force us violently, but consider that whatever we do, we do not from emotions but for our duty, and the care which we especially owe to our churches. We have once all subscribed to our disputation and your confession published against Luther. If others subscribe to it, there will be no need for us to subscribe to a new confession. But let us, confessing and teaching in concord what we have once confessed, love one another and serve the Lord to the end. Farewell, most esteemed brothers, and receive this from us with the spirit in which it is written. We attribute much to you as is deserved, and we have no church which we respect and venerate more, nor will we ever separate from you. Yet we cannot but declare our mind in this matter. We hope you will interpret everything candidly. Farewell again and diligently invoke the Lord for us. We will do the same for you.</p>
      <p>In Bern, June 27, in the year of the incarnation of Christ Jesus 1549. Johannes Haller subscribed in his own name and in the name of all the fellow ministers, pastors, and readers in the church of Bern.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men and most faithful ministers of Christ and the church, pastors and readers of the church of ZÃ¼rich, venerable and dearest brothers and fellow ministers.</p>
