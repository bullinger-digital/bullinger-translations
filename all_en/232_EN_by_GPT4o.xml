      <p>D[ear] Master Heinrich, this message is sent by some of us to all of you for the following reason: We understand that among the Confederates there is an opinion that the majority will not handle our matter amicably, as we previously agreed to the Interim. Now, the situation with our community is such that they will agree to it. From this, another significant temporal burden will follow, namely that those who cannot accept the Interim will either be banned from the city or will be considered outlaws outside, so that they are safe nowhere. Therefore, some of us ask you, for God's sake, to be quick about it when others want to impose the Interim on us, as has now happened in Kreuzlingen through the one from Ure against ours. This should remain confidential, so that your lords and the Bernese help to ensure that this article is attached: "and those who cannot accept the Interim, that they may be allowed to leave unhindered by virtue of free passage. If it could also be included in the report that they should be free from the ban, that would be a beneficial thing for all true believers. Help and advise yourselves and us for the good. Oh, let this point be important to you; we want to earn it.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated August 17, early in the morning.</p>
      <p>Konrad Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, my kind, dear lord in Zurich.</p>
