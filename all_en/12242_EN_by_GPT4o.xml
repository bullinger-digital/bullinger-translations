    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich thanks Bullinger for his friendship and for sending his writings "Der alt gloub" (The Old Faith), "Bericht der krancken" (Report of the Sick), and "Hoffnung der Glöubigen" (Hope of the Believers). Upon first review, Frölich noticed many things previously unknown to him. He will let Bullinger's books guide him in his faith and will give them to his wife [Anna, née Lochner] and his children [Jonas, Katharina, Anna, Afra, Caritas, Theodora, and Georg the Younger] to read. Perhaps the volume is also available for purchase in Augsburg; otherwise, he would ask Bullinger for additional copies. - While Luther and his brood bark, the [“Warhaffte Bekanntnuß”] (True Confession) of the Zurichers bears rich fruit. Frölich never agreed with Luther. Therefore, he left his good position in Nuremberg and turned to Augsburg, where the zealous Michael Keller defends the purity of the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, while others are slipping into Papism. This [aversion to Luther] also explains [why Frölich asks the Zurichers for a preacher for Augsburg]. - He sends the biting [“Speculum Osiandri”], which was written because Osiander attacked Zwingli and Oekolampad in his "Coniecturae de ultimis temporibus" (Conjectures on the Last Times). Bullinger should not take offense at it and can keep it a secret that he received it from Frölich. - Frölich is trying to secure an honorable position for Matthias Erb; if he succeeds, he will inform Bullinger. He should provide him with Erb's address. - Recommendations to the brothers.</p>

      <p>Greetings and grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>What you promised in your previous letters, namely the pledge of the friendship established between us, you have recently fulfilled so abundantly that I am at a loss as to how to repay you. You have given me a book more precious than all the treasures of the world: first, it encompasses the antiquity of our Christian religion, secondly, the preparations for those who are about to depart, and thirdly, the hope of believers, and it is not compiled from the teachings of philosophers, but from the oracles of the divine scriptures, not by some wise pagan, not by some stranger, but by my most intimate and well-known constant friend Heinrich Bullinger, written piously, faithfully, and learnedly; although I have not yet had the time to read it thoroughly, by glancing here and there, I have discovered many things previously unknown to me and necessary and most beneficial to know. It will therefore be a perpetual reminder and pledge of friendship towards you, which, I swear, no forgetfulness of things, not even death itself, will erase. For I firmly believe it will endure even to the heavenly homeland and without end. I will also make sure that your book is not only read by me but also by my wife and my children, of whom I have seven, and that it is well impressed upon them, and with it as my guide, I will believe in God, live for Him, and die for Him. That I may reap this fruit, you must diligently intercede for me with the Father of all things. I will inquire whether this book is sold here among us, so that I may make it available to some of my own. If it is not available here, I will scarcely refrain from asking you for one or two more copies.</p>
      <p>Your confession sails with full sails and produces the most abundant fruits, even as Luther and his entire brood acknowledge. You know, my dearest Heinrich, how much trouble the sacramental matter has hitherto caused the churches. You also know that the papacy is uniquely supported by that crude and literal understanding of the words of Christ.</p>
      <p>Therefore, for twenty years now, I have never agreed with Luther. Wherever I have lived, I have always been disliked by people of that kind. For this reason, I left Nuremberg and the splendid position I held there for a decade, transferring myself to Augsburg solely for the sake of a purer religion; and indeed, I was not mistaken. Here we have Michael Keller, an excellent man and the primary instrument through which the Lord wished to make His gospel known in Augsburg. He, like a strong and experienced athlete, has hitherto vigorously defended the purity of the Lord's Supper and still defends it manfully against some who are almost relapsing into Papism in this matter. Hence, among other things, I wrote to you in my previous letters, etc.</p>
      <p>Here is a biting, yet very true poem published by the author for this reason, that Osiander, in his conjectures about the Last Judgment, counted the divine Zwingli and Oecolampadius among the false prophets. Please take it in good part and do not be offended, I pray. You can also keep it a secret that it was sent to you by me.</p>
      <p>I am now preparing an honorable position for Matthias Erb, which I will inform you of once it has been secured. I also ask that you write back to me as soon as possible, letting me know where that man can be found.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your most pious and excellent brothers, to whom I wish to be commended.</p>
      <p>Sent hastily, July 11, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Georg Frölich, chief scribe of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most deserving pastor of the Church of Zurich, lord, friend, and brother.</p>
