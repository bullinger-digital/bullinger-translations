      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received two letters at the same time and gave a third to Mr. Caelius, who said he had nothing to reply; if he receives any news from Italy, he wishes to share it with you shortly. I also thank you for the news, which we also received; but you write more clearly and add certain things that were not written to us. We are expecting letters from Saxony at any moment. I have shared this with Schertlin and Baron Georg.</p>
      <p>The Emperor recently attended mass, I believe on the feast of the Three Kings, and when the priest was reading the Gospel about Herod, he collapsed in the Fugger chapel; the attendants rushed to him, and the priest left the altar in this commotion, running to the Emperor and shouting: "Lord Emperor, invoke Jesus the Savior."</p>
      <p>He was lifted up and carried back to his chamber. He immediately ordered his sister Maria, who was then in Ulm, to be summoned to him.</p>
      <p>Some think he was struck by an angel of God, as Herod was in the Acts. May the Lord have mercy on him.</p>
      <p>You mock me nicely for sending a small gift and receiving a large one. I am a fortunate merchant if I continue to trade this way; soon I will be able to gain more than the Fuggers have.</p>
      <p>But this is in jest. Farewell. More soon. You will receive more from the Lord Treasurer. January 19, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Minster in Zurich, my kind lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
