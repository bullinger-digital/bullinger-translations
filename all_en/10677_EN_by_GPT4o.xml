      <p>The grace of Christ be with you, most excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have indeed received your gift and with such great joy of spirit, as if a heavenly treasure had been sent to me by God, not by man. I quickly sat down and reviewed your writings and your Pauline mind, especially in certain more difficult passages of the Epistle to the Ephesians. And I candidly confess that you alone have provided me with more than all those I have read. Pomeranus is brief, Bucer is very verbose, and I consider Megander as nothing. What then shall I return to Bullinger for all that he has given me? I will take the cup of gratitude and call upon the name of the Lord, so that He, who is rich to all, may also be rich to you and enrich you on my behalf with all good things, so that you may benefit both the Church of Christ and me not so much with a long life as with your writings, although I cannot repay you equally.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily with your domestic church.</p>
      <p>Yours, LÃ¼thard, formerly a preacher of the Minorite faction in Basel.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his father in Christ, etc.</p>
