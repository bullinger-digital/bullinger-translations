    <p xml:id="regest1">The prohibition of so-called "Lutheran" literature in Venice has led to the tripling of prices for books now sold secretly; the hunger for God's Word is growing ever larger, as there are hardly any clergy who could satisfy it; [those of evangelical disposition] therefore ask for help. The letter carrier, a bookseller [Maturinus Virginius?], risks being thrown into prison due to his recklessness; Bullinger should influence him so that he no longer spurns the protection that Altieri, as the secretary of the English envoy [Edmund Harvell], can grant him; he should also give him four copies each of the "Institutio" [Calvin's], the Bible revised by Leo Jud, Calvin's writing against Albert Pigge, and other new publications, and communicate the price for them in writing. Bullinger is already familiar to Altieri through various books as well as through his letter to Count Collaltino [di Collalto]. Despite persecution, the Kingdom of Christ is growing; he asks for a letter and for intercession.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Just as from the supreme kindness and innocence of Christ all kinds of good come to us, most excellent Bullinger, so there is no evil that does not proceed and pour out upon us from the cruelty and savagery of the Antichrist himself. Among other things, the ministers of Satan have tried with all their might to ensure that the holy word of God is completely banned from us; they have decreed by a public and most impious edict that no one should buy or sell your books or those of others, which they call Lutheran. This situation has provided an opportunity to greatly increase the greed and wickedness of booksellers; for since it was not allowed publicly, they began to sell secretly, but at a much higher price than elsewhere, and this practice has so quickly spread and has now reached the point that what is valued at one gold pound with you, they recklessly sell for three gold coins. Therefore, many, either because they do not have money readily available or because they are too timid to proclaim the glory of Christ, are easily deterred from buying books, preferring to live securely in disgraceful idleness without books rather than be drawn into danger with such a scarcity and high cost of books. This brings about an ever more bitter hunger for the word of God among us, and, what is more serious, we can in no way avoid it unless God drives it away with His Spirit. This was the only watchtower left in this wickedness of the times, and as it is gradually being taken from us, we are greatly tormented. For there are no pastors to feed the sheep of Christ, except wolves who devour them, no teachers except enemies of the truth, many ministers who are promoters of impiety and public idolaters; the prophets who exist are all liars and adulterators of the word of God. Where then should we go, or what should we do in this matter? We will turn to you, members of Christ and our co-heirs according to the hope of eternal life, so that if you can help in any way, you will offer your assistance.</p>
      <p>A bookseller was recently here with us, bringing some books; but as soon as he spoke with the other booksellers, he raised the price and will return here again loaded with many books; however, I fear, because he acts too recklessly, that he may lose the books and money at the same time and be thrown into prison, from which he will not be able to leave at his own discretion; for he has many who watch him. I have often warned him to be careful; but he has raised his neck, either because he does not trust us or because he is very simple. I also offered him my assistance, so that he might use me as himself, especially since there is no one here who is free from the tyranny of the Antichrist except myself, not because I am of such importance, but because I serve as the secretary to the English envoy, whom you know has long been an enemy of the Roman pontiff. I wish you would also advise him not to refuse my effort and diligence; for I have taken pity on him, lest any harm should befall him. If you wish, you can give him four copies of the "Institutes of the Christian Religion," which are of the latest edition, four portable Bibles, namely those revised by Leo Jud, also four booklets of Calvin on predestination against Albert Pigge, if they are printed, and anything else that is new with you and exudes the highest piety, but from all four. You should write about the price so that we know what we are to pay him when he returns there.</p>
      <p>Do not be surprised that I speak with you so familiarly; for although no acquaintance has existed between us before, yet, because I have read many of your booklets and that most splendid letter sent by you to Count Collaltino, whom I uniquely respect, I have become so intimate with you that nothing is dearer and more familiar to me than you yourself. Moreover, what can be added to that union with you in Christ, which is eternal and always the same? Just as it can never be diminished at any time, so it cannot be increased by any human action. I am a friend to you, indeed, and one flesh in Christ.</p>
      <p>Here we are wickedly harassed by the impious; yet the kingdom of Christ is growing daily. When you have some leisure, write to us sometime; your letters or those of the brothers will greatly alleviate our troubles, whom you will greet both in my name and in the name of others, and especially yourself, and you will pray for us, as we do mutually and diligently for you. Farewell in the Lord and love us.</p>
      <p>Given in Venice, on the third day before the Ides of August 1543. Your servant and brother in the Lord,</p>
      <p>Balthassar Altieri, secretary of the English envoy.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned, and most upright minister of Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, to be observed as a lord and brother. Zurich.</p>
