      <p>I would write more to you about my affairs and give a more detailed account of everything, Father Bullinger, so that you might better judge that all the things you learned from the letters recently sent to you were done by us due to the modesty of our circumstances and resources, lest we commit something most unpleasant to you and our other lords, and most disgraceful to our name, by having exhausted all resources.</p>
      <p>For I have always wanted to be approved by you no less than to be loved. But two things make me brief: one, that I have pursued all those matters in previous letters, the other, that I believe Rodolph Gwalther, my close friend and most sincere companion, has encompassed all the rest in his letters. By no means would I be affected by moderate pain if I were to lose possession of my former praise; but I will restrain myself so that I may bring the matter to such a point that I accomplish something worthy both of my calling and of your expectation. I hope, if hope does not deceive me, to achieve this. Therefore, I ask you in the greatest way, that you wish me to be as commendable as possible to my other lords through you, and that you consider my diligence in the pursuit of studies and in other matters, if there is any in me, to be commended to you. If you do this, a great addition will be made to your former efforts towards me.</p>
      <p>Farewell, with greetings to your mother, wife, and entire family. Marburg, 1540, on the Ides of November.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johann Wolf.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his uniquely esteemed lord.</p>
