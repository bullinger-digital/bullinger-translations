      <p>Most illustrious man, may you be well.</p>
      <p>I think it is not necessary to express what my feelings are towards you; God knows, and Aurelius knows. Therefore, there is no need for me to write more.</p>
      <p>Aurelius is departing for the Court of the Rhetoricians by order of the most illustrious prince.</p>
      <p>However, I wanted to visit you with my letters as a father, whom I love and value more each day; love me in return.</p>
      <p>Greet the family and the school for me and pray to God for me, which is most important. Tübingen, May 13, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
