    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] It is true, Bullinger has been silent for a long time. However, Myconius should not hold this against him. In light of so many different rumors from letters by otherwise trustworthy people, it is better to write nothing at all!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is said that Emperor Charles V will shift the war from Germany to the Swiss Confederation. This seems plausible! If it does not happen, it will probably only be because he lacked a suitable opportunity, which would again be interpreted as an additional opportunity granted by God to repent. Allegedly, the Emperor is also planning the siege and subjugation of Constance. But now something completely unexpected has happened in "Belgium" [correct: Northern Germany], which could cause the Emperor to change his plans.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In "Belgium" [Northern Germany], the Emperor's "Belgian" [Dutch] legion was defeated! First, the Hanseatic cities near Bremen destroyed the army of Duke Eric of Brunswick-Calenberg, the nephew [correct: cousin] of the captured Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. After the forces of the Saxon cities joined with the rest of the electoral army and the troops of the Hanseatic cities, this united army defeated the remaining imperial army, which had been besieging Bremen under the leadership of Martin von Rossem, and put it to flight. The Saxon Colonel Wilhelm von Thumshirn intercepted the 1500 cavalrymen and 16 companies of foot soldiers that the Emperor had sent to the besiegers of Bremen and killed almost all of them. When the Emperor learned of this, he abandoned the siege of Magdeburg (which he had undertaken after his departure from Wittenberg) and moved to Halle, because all the [Protestant] troops were heading for Magdeburg. Perhaps they will now pursue the Emperor, who has been left alone by his brother King Ferdinand (who had to hurry to Bohemia), all the way to Halle. All this is considered verified.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] All of Naples is said to be in arms and rising against Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, the Emperor's viceroy, because he wanted to introduce the Spanish Inquisition there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] So the cause [of the Protestants] is by no means lost, for God sends unexpected help! Now everyone must be admonished to repent and have faith. If the godless continue their sinful lives, they can expect God's punishment! But what luck for the pious! Think of Lot, whom the Lord saved from the fire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] So far, the Swiss Confederates are getting along quite well at the [assembly that began on June 20] in Baden. Bullinger will report more details as soon as possible. From Zurich, Hans Rudolf Lavater and Itelhans Thumysen were sent there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] May the Lord grant his assistance. Greetings, also to Johannes Gast. Has he received the money [for the wool] sent through John Burcher? Greetings to Francisco de Enzinas.</p>

      <p>Dear Brother, I have indeed remained silent, as you say, but in the face of such a diversity of not only rumors but also letters, even those written by trustworthy people, what can one write with certainty? Therefore, I preferred to remain silent rather than to say even a little that might be connected with falsehood. Please consider my silence as a good thing.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It is indeed said that the Emperor will transfer the war from Germany to Switzerland, and I do not doubt this so much that if he does not do what he is said to be planning, I would think that only a suitable opportunity is lacking for him. But if something hinders him, the Lord has undoubtedly given us time for repentance. It is already said that there was a consultation on how he could besiege Constance. But something unexpected happened in Northern Germany, which I believe has changed his plans.</p>

      <p>In Northern Germany, the Emperor's Dutch legion was defeated. First, the Hanseatic cities near Bremen destroyed the army of Duke Eric, the cousin of the captured Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. When the Saxon cities and the remnants of the electoral forces joined their troops with the Hanseatic cities, they also routed the remaining army, which was still besieging Bremen under Martin von Rossem, and inflicted a defeat on them. Saxon Colonel Wilhelm von Thumshirn intercepted the 1500 cavalry and 16 companies of foot soldiers that the Emperor had sent to the besiegers of Bremen and nearly wiped them out. When the Emperor learned that his forces had fought unsuccessfully, he left Magdeburg, which he had besieged after departing from Wittenberg, and moved to Halle. For all our forces hastened to Magdeburg. Perhaps they will pursue the Emperor to Halle, especially since Ferdinand, having left his brother, is heading to Bohemia. All this is written to me by many as the absolute truth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is added that all of Naples is in arms against the Emperor's viceroy, who wanted to establish and exercise the Spanish Inquisition there.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Therefore, while we think the matter is lost somewhere, and where we least expected it, the Lord raises help. Let us trust in Him, who can deliver us from all evils. Let us do our duty by urging everyone to repentance and faith. But if people continue in their impious lives and God's judgment comes: Woe to the wicked! But good fortune again to the pious! The Lord knows how to deliver Lot from the fire, but to terrify the wicked with the fires of this and the future age.</p>

      <p>I hear that things are not going badly for the Swiss in Baden so far. But when I have more certain information, I will share it. Our delegates are Mr. Lavater and Mr. Dumysius.</p>

      <p>Let us pray diligently to the Lord to be with us. Farewell eternally with all the brothers. Greet Mr. Gast, from whom I wish to know whether he has received the money sent through Burckher. Greet Mr. Dryander and all friends. Zurich, June 29, 1547. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, first minister of the church in Basel, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Basel.</p>
