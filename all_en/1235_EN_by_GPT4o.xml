      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your letters these days, in which you write various things about various matters; most are very true, but I doubt some due to the uncertain rumors spread by the Milanese merchants. If the French have taken Parma by treachery, this will be the spark of a future war, although Mr. Celius does not yet believe it; for he says he knows the plans of the Emperor, who does not easily relinquish what he has once taken. But perhaps we will soon receive more certain information on this matter.</p>
      <p>Pacęus writes to me from Saxony these words: "The situation of the people of Magdeburg is very bad; they almost fight daily, and there is a miserable and indeed bloody slaughter of brothers among brothers. Whoever is the cause and author of this evil will not escape the deserved and most just judgment of God. It is said that Amsdorf has fled to Prussia; there are also those who say Illyricum is with him. The situation has indeed been brought to the utmost danger. Many things are said about the Turk, but the rumors are not so authentic and lack certain authors.</p>
      <p>Recently, it was deliberated in our court in the presence of Philipp Melanchthon and our Camerarius about the whole business of the council, and Philipp was instructed to put in writing certain things pertaining to this matter and to prepare, if necessary, and to advance the council there in Trento as much as possible, all by our people.</p>
      <p>Osiander with his followers in Prussia is also said to be plotting I know not what singular and marvelous things, no less than before the siege and Saxon war, Illyricus or anyone else."</p>
      <p>Consider from this writing where the mind of our Pacęus leans. We easily change into other people according to the blowing of the wind.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us. The people of Strasbourg have been called to the council; they are consulting on what they should do. You will find more cheerful things in the letters of Mr. Theodor.</p>
      <p>I am also sending an index with the Mandates of the people of Constance, which you should share with Mr. Theodor; shortly, after seeing the books brought from the fair, I will send another index.</p>
      <p>Be steadfast in the Lord. Satan has regained strength due to our ingratitude, who has been silent for a long time and pretended to want to rest; but now, given the opportunity, he erupts with the greatest harm to some. We are in danger from false brothers, whom the Lord will eventually destroy.</p>
      <p>Mr. von Heideck, the captain of Magdeburg, defected to Maurice with soldiers; so say the people of Ferdinand, and it seems likely because he called his wife to him, who can now safely hide in Ferdinand's domain and who has so far hidden with us and beautifully pretended everything. See what kind of people we receive as guests among us. Farewell. April 8, 1551. Basel.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, at the church in Zurich, his perpetual teacher to be honored.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
