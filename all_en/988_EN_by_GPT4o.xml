      <p>Greetings. I thank you for the faithful admonition in the letter written on August 2nd.</p>
      <p>If only the person who spread those threats of the Emperor had been thrown into chains and interrogated through torture; there were also many others who spread the same, but I hope they will prove to be the most vain prophets. Our people are diligently vigilant. The Emperor has left Augsburg for Munich; it is said he is lying ill there from his illness, which he contracted from the persecution of the gospel (note: I do not know how true it is that he is lying ill; it is certain that he is currently in Bavaria); however, he is not far from the city, residing in a castle or house recently built by the Bavarian for pleasure. For such people rightly fear they will not reach paradise; therefore, they build the most delightful paradises here to enjoy some pleasure at least.</p>
      <p>Come, let the Emperor remain and never leave that Bavarian paradise; I will not envy him this pleasure or happiness; a pig cannot be absent from Bavarian delights. They say Philip is preparing to return to Spain; thus, the Portuguese are harassed by the Moors and Zaripha Dragut; the merciful and compassionate Lord will perhaps prepare the Palestinians for his David, groaning under Saul's oppression. For the Emperor has certainly decided to continue the council in Trent and under this pretext, first to sow discord in Germany, then to oppress their freedom, and we will not be free from this evil in Switzerland, as there will be those who want us to go to that council to dispute. I send to your kindness what remains of the Fourth Decade. I discuss in it the most important mysteries of our religion, hopefully in a holy and successful manner. Accept this gift from a friend with a friendly mind and freely judge and write back about these and all my other matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell eternally with your family. Zurich, August 15, 1550. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
