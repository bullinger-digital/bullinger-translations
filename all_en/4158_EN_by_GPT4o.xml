      <p>Grace of the Son of God be with you.</p>
      <p>Do not take it badly, most learned Bullinger, that I have neglected the duty of writing for some time, as if it were done out of negligence or rashness, since I have never held anything more dear than your friendship. The reason I have not replied to your last letters is the daily infirmity of my aging body. For what more can you expect from someone who is now entering his sixty-sixth year and whose hands are almost trembling and senses are dull? But now that I am breathing again by the usual clemency of God, although the harsh winter still opposes me, I wanted to write to you briefly, etc.</p>
      <p>We all indeed approve of your advice, in which you admonish us to constancy, so that foreign customs and ceremonies are not admitted by us into the church. We therefore give you great thanks, entrusting to your holy prayers the little church in that true freedom, in which it has hitherto persisted, asserted by the work of the late Erasmus Fabricius, of good memory, etc.</p>
      <p>The adversaries do not cease, with the authority of the guardian princes, to impose their trifles. They publish new pamphlets, according to the prescriptions of which they wish the offices of the church to be administered.</p>
      <p>We are indeed in agreement with those absent visitors; but I fear that some of our own, who nurture the monster, upon hearing the authority of the princes, God forbid, may waver. I would write more to you about these things, but in a small volume I can hardly do so.</p>
      <p>But you yourself, with your singular prudence, understand these matters. Pray to the Lord for me, that He may finally either free me from evils or rescue me from the stormy sea of this age and transfer me hence to the port of tranquility of eternal life.</p>
      <p>This hastily. December 18, 1559. Amen.</p>
      <p>Yours, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and highest learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, theologian of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, etc., brother.</p>
