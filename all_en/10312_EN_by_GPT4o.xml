    <p xml:id="regest1">From Haller's last two letters, Bullinger will have learned of his wishes; finally, he can send a reliable messenger through whom Bullinger could send him parts of his commentary on further Pauline letters as well as Theodor Bibliander's lectures on the prophets. After Bullinger has personally been in Constance, Haller would like to have him at least in his writings in Bern. Otto Brunfels became the city physician in Bern. Simon Sulzer will return from Basel. Request for news. The Bullinger manuscript "De ratione studii," which Christian Danmatter has meanwhile copied, he intends to send back to Zurich soon. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt, dearest brother, that upon returning from Constance, you found at home two letters in which you understood what I wish from you and earnestly request again today. I was expecting a response with our archers, but none of them deemed me worthy of a word. Therefore, you have this messenger of ours, who could not praise your kindness enough. To him, you can safely entrust anything you can. Most of all, I wanted either your works on the remaining letters of Paul or those compiled from the lectures of Theodor on some prophets. I now request your commentaries on the Acts. So, since Constance has had you present, I should not be without your writings.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, our city has accepted Otto Brunfels as a physician. He has now arrived from Strasbourg. From Basel, we will receive a fairly learned young man, Simon Sulzer from Interlaken, at our Martinmas fair.</p>
      <p>There is no news with us. If you have received any in Constance, share them with us and respond to my previous letters filled with my affections. Christian Danmatter will complete the booklet "De ratione studii," so that you may have it at the fair, provided that Burckard the cloth maker is present.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live most happily with my Pellican.</p>
      <p>30th of October, year 33.</p>
      <p>Yours, Berchtold H.</p>
      <p>I am glad you did not accept the money, although you could have done so with the best right, from the people of Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>To his far dearest brother Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
