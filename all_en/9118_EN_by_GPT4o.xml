      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, I have received your letter with this one; however, it was in such a hurry that I did not have time to write to Doctor Burgowern, but I will, God willing, write to him with the next message.</p>
      <p>However, I have already responded to the matter he brought to me, previously through Hans Heinrich, Josua's boy, and yesterday through the enclosed letter, and I have shown my judgment to Mr. Hans Conrad(?). I request that you promptly forward the letter to Mr. H. Conrad(?) in Schaffhausen; make sure he communicates it with Doctor. Greet him faithfully for me; I would have gladly written to him right now; it is not possible.</p>
      <p>God be with you and Susanna and the children. All our people greet you; greet Mr. Hans Peyer for me. May God grant him good times.</p>
      <p>Given the day after St. Andrew's, December 1, 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The song is essentially made. I ask, who is the author?</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
