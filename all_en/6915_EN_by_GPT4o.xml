      <p>S. D. Today Froschauer returned and brought me many letters. Victorinus Strigel, professor of theology in Leipzig, writes very friendly letters to me and highly praises our Confession. The same is done by the English and various other learned men. The plague is raging quite cruelly through Saxony and neighboring peoples. The Elector of Saxony has gathered 3000 horsemen and is fully armed. Johann Friedrich the Younger of Weimar, against the protest of his brother, supports Grumbach, to whom he has also handed over Gotha. The Saxon wishes to suppress him along with Grumbach, and there is a danger that a great war may arise. The Diet of Erfurt made no progress. The Elector Palatine had his envoys there, so as not to appear to distrust his cause; other princes also had their envoys there; however, the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse refuse to hear of any diets in which others are condemned and in which the evangelicals are more odiously involved. Thus, nothing came of it, and as I understand, nothing will come of it soon. The Elector Palatine orders all his people to be armed and has a very willing populace, especially the spontaneous nobility. The very prudent prince sees the seeds of unfortunate wars being spread everywhere, and therefore wants to take care of himself, his people, and all the pious in time. Flanders, Holland, Brabant, and almost all of Belgium have received the gospel. In The Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, and other famous cities, they have broken and destroyed all the altars and images after the missal altars were ejected. Wonderful things are written and said about this by those who were eyewitnesses and saw the wonders of the Lord; for truly the Lord is wonderful and works incredible and unexpected things. There is a booklet written and printed in German about how in Antwerp the idols were removed from all the temples along with the altars. I often remember the blessed memory of the elder Froschauer, who often told me 20 years ago: "I sell none of your and Zurich's books anywhere but in the Netherlands, and I think you will still live to see that great changes will happen there and this teaching will not be without fruit." May the Lord be praised and may He increase His grace more and more; for otherwise, great dangers open up everywhere, so the Lord must be prayed to diligently, lest the pious be exercised with much bloodshed through severe persecution. For Granvelle and the Spaniards do not rest; the people of Leuven and the bishops with the monks and the anointed ones are raging. The princes and the entire nobility of Lower Germany have joined very closely with the evangelicals, etc. Orange, Nassau, BÃ¼ren, and Egmond, Brederode, Berg, etc. In Cologne, too, they are greatly afraid of being shaved. Recently, when an innocent man was being dragged to slaughter, the entire tribe of the victors erupted and rescued him with armed hand; the president of executions and the executioner barely escaped alive. The people cry out that enough and more than enough cruelty has been done so far, and they do not want to endure any more what they have suffered. Therefore, guards are stationed at the gates and throughout the city. They do not want to reform with love and reason, they always want to kill innocent people; so it must go on like this. In the kingdom of England, all is peaceful; only those dissensions arising from the matter of vestments are still being exercised. In the Irish, which they call Ireland, a rebellion has arisen against the Queen of England; therefore, the queen sent an equipped army against the barbarians; they fought and the queen won; however, they are regrouping from the flight and are equipping themselves with new reinforcements, hence the queen is also equipping her army with new troops.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Scotland has given birth to a son to the great joy of the whole kingdom; the King of France, the Queen of England, and the Duchess of Savoy are invited to receive the king from the holy font in Edinburgh. The churches in Scotland are peaceful and the gospel is preached purely. Peace has been made between the queen, the princes, and the nobility, thanks be to God.</p>
      <p>From Krakow, it is written to me on the first of August: That kingdom of Poland is in quite significant danger; for the Muscovite is said to be about to invade Lithuania with a very well-equipped army. The Tatars in recent days have given us irreparable damage by plundering and devastating many places on the borders of Podolia. Everyone is very afraid for themselves because of the Turk, who himself is moving into Hungary with an innumerable army; although our king is allied with the emperor of the Turks, our people will hardly escape the incursions and raids of the wandering Turkish soldiers, who occupy everything far and wide. Our king has sent a very large delegation to Prussia; for Prussia is also said to be somewhat separating from our prince. Arians and Anabaptists have recently been proscribed from the entire kingdom. The state of affairs is miserable. May the Lord have mercy on us. October 1, 1566.</p>
      <p>I have compiled this summary from several letters given to me.</p>
      <p>Please return the reading.</p>
