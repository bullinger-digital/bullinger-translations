      <p>Greetings. Who would ever have imagined that the once steadfast Konstanz could finally fall apart and be torn by such lamentable discord, that it would place all hope of salvation in those who were the authors of its complete destruction and ruin? And not only from that miserable discord, but they seem to be about to impose far more atrocious things upon themselves than they have suffered so far from the illustrious downfall of a few citizens. Therefore, our Musculus rightly said he was amazed that a church so well and sacredly established, and for such a long time professing Christ in both the purity of doctrine and discipline, did not rather meet that blessing of our God, to perish willingly and gladly in unanimous consent in the name of Christ, than to lend a hand to an enemy seeking nothing more than the death of souls? But from there we learn, indeed the Lord commands, what simulated concord usually brings about and what a slightly harsher rigor of a good magistrate produces, which civil polity's moderation can hardly bear in neophytes; for many who were rightly established in that city murmur, many were drawn to the profession of religion more than led. I attribute that entire affliction to the Lord, who is justly angry, who will not abandon those turned to Him by His mercy. I am sending to you, so that I may not let you lack new books, a booklet on the sacrament of the altar and the Lord's Supper, which a merchant related to me by a close line sent from Leipzig. You will understand whose it is from the inscription itself, bearing the author's name, if indeed the inscription is genuine. I was thinking of Philipp, but the style is a bit too bold for me to dare to attribute it to him; for Philipp is gentle and calm.</p>
      <p>But whoever it is, it is certainly the work of a man neither unlearned nor careless, with whom, I believe, a greater and more closely fought battle will be engaged with the infamous and outdated adverb INTERIM. Farewell, and I pray you warmly welcome our most candid and learned proclaimer of Christ, Musculus, with his excellent and well-established family, as you are accustomed to do with all good people, with cheerfulness.</p>
      <p>From St. Gallen, the 7th.</p>
      <p>Vadianus.</p>
      <p>Return Ziegler when you have read it.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the most illustrious city of ZÃ¼rich, lord and uniquely beloved as a brother.</p>
