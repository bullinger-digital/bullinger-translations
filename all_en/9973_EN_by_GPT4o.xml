      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>For a long time now, most venerable lord father, I have not received letters more sorrowful and piercing my soul with heavier and more bitter pain and grief than those which my most venerable lords and most excellent men, Mr. Gwalther and your illustrious son-in-law, Mr. Josias Simler, have sent to me these days. Behold, what my mind had long foreseen, receiving no letters from you, I now, alas, with sorrow, find out in reality and not without groans do I receive these pains and more than immense and prolonged torments of your most holy body. Or who among men, in whom there is still any trace of piety left, any zeal for divine glory and evangelical truth remaining, learning of such pains of such an instrument of God, such a minister of Christ, such an athlete of truth, such an ornament and star of the Christian nation spread throughout the world, would not grieve, mourn, lament, and almost wail? O miserable life of mortals, o valley of tears, o unhappy desire for the forbidden fruit. But it is well: this life is short, it will soon end, it will end most joyfully and happily. A harsh and rough winter will be followed by a blooming and most pleasant spring and a most luxuriant summer with the sweetest fruits. Meanwhile, we have a good Lord, tempted in all things without sin, not leaving us orphans, being with us in affliction, merciful, kind, faithful, compassionate, sympathetic, not imposing more than we can bear, granting the most abundant and sufficient grace, wise and setting the best and most desirable limit, thus conforming us to Himself on the cross, so that there too He may have companions of glory and eternal life. To Him be praise and glory forever and ever, who also, for His immense goodness and invincible power, may strengthen your spirit, grant unbroken strength, alleviate pains, if not remove them entirely, and restore you as soon as possible to the church and to all of us. Amen.</p>
      <p>As I have never doubted your benevolence and paternal affection towards me, so I abundantly gather from it that you have deigned to reveal to me the outcome of our French mission according to my wishes. I had hoped for a more fortunate one, I would wish for a more favorable one; but since it has seemed so to the just and holy will of God, who most powerfully governs all things, let it indeed please us as well.</p>
      <p>He who said: Do not fear, little flock, for it pleased the Father to give you the kingdom, does not allow the little sheep to be snatched away. I have immortal thanks for your services to me, both in this and in other matters, certainly innumerable and most excellent, and I ask nothing more ardently from the Lord than that He may someday grant the time and opportunity to declare my grateful mind. I received a bundle of news today from Mr. Lentulus, which I will explain to you in order, and I hope within two days to recognize the state of France from my letters, which have now been delivered to the courier.</p>
      <p>Genoa, May 25, 1575. Letters have been brought, which the envoy Saulius sends from Spain, and in them it is announced that it greatly pleases the king that the laws of Genoa be preserved and the liberty of the city be maintained, and he declares that he will consider all those as enemies who would attempt anything against it, which greatly cheered all those citizens who still remained in the city and defend it and urge liberty. The cardinal's envoy invited all the citizens to the sacred rites he performed during these festive days, and to receive from him the enchanted bread, which they falsely call the Eucharist. He is also entirely engaged in conducting processions and promoting religion, so that in this way, if possible, he may soften the minds of the citizens and incline them to concord and peace. But unless those who have left the city return within 15 days, he will depart towards Pavia. He will be in Caliniani for eight days, to enlist whatever he has from the parties there, and he will leave a written record of what he has done for the benefit of the republic. On the feast of St. George, a great council was convened to restore the full number of officials of St. George, and also to collect money and abolish newly introduced taxes. Meanwhile, letters brought by a certain courier from Spain were intercepted by unknown men, except those sent to the cardinal and the Spanish envoy.</p>
      <p>Malta, May 4. Knight Honofrius Belvetus returned from the East, where he had gone to explore Turkish affairs, and reports that the Turk will by no means send a fleet this year except for 50 galleys to guard and protect the maritime coasts of his kingdom; also, the Turk has 200 galleys drawn up on land and 100 at sea, of which fifteen were armed to be sent to Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli, to keep those peoples in the faith of the Turkish king. Eight galleys are also sent to Cyprus for the defense of the island. While Ochialinus was advising the Turk not to let slip the opportunity to invade either Malta or Corfu, as it would be very easy for his power to take possession of those islands, he received such a response from the Turk: that everything would be done in its time and measure, and all would turn out happily. Those who belong to the Turkish military appear daily in Constantinople to be enlisted and bound by oath, and immediately after this is done, each will return to his home, as there is great suffering from plague and famine in that city. Neither in the Peloponnese nor in all of Greece was any war preparation being made.</p>
      <p>Naples, 21st of the same month. Peter Pardillia and Corilius Chesada, along with some other noble Spanish men, are traveling on four galleys to inspect all the fortresses built on the maritime coast of the Kingdom of Naples, namely Taranto, Brindisi, and others, and they will take care to strengthen them if necessary. With the greatest diligence, all kinds of provisions and munitions are being prepared for the Spanish fleet.</p>
      <p>John de Cardona is sent with Sicilian galleys to transport the Germans who are in the city of Spezia.</p>
      <p>Rome, May 28. Letters have been brought from Spain by the king to the Genoese senate, in which the king's good will towards that city is expressed, from which all had conceived the greatest hope and joy. It was enjoined upon the deputies from both sides to inform the cardinal of their disputes, so that he would not be troubled by others who approached him importunately and variously instructed him about controversial matters. There are six from each side, although only two of the old nobility remain in Genoa, with four others having left, fearing the incited populace. Letters from the cardinal dated the 16th of this month announce that he has brought the matter to the beginning of pacification, with both parties content that new laws be established, removing those enacted in the year 28 and those in the year 47, so that a single body may be formed from those citizens who seem most suitable for governing the republic, without regard to nobility, wishing that all be equal, which greatly pleased and soothed the common people, especially since it was also added that some taxes be reduced.</p>
      <p>With letters brought to Genoa on the 21st of this month, it is written that the envoy, having devised a certain new form of government for the republic, which does not displease the people, sent Bishop Odiscalco to Finale and another bishop to Carrara, to negotiate with the old nobility, who have mostly gone there, so that they too may finally accept some terms of peace. On Tuesday, Commissioner Grimaldus arrived here in Genoa, completely despairing that any peace could be made in Genoa, as most have sworn on the salvation of their sons that they will not accept any other terms of peace than if the laws for governing the republic enacted in the year 28 are retained. But on the other hand, it was reported that the envoy is loved by all and therefore will remain in Genoa for some time yet, not without hope that peace will finally be made. - From Piedmont, they write that the wife of the former admiral of France has renounced the evangelical religion, which she previously professed, and has shown great contrition with a flood of tears, and has also betrothed her daughter to the son of the marquis, the son-in-law of the Duke of Savoy, to whom the King of France sent Lord Bone to request a loan of two hundred thousand gold coins, which has now been ordered to be counted. - The Pope is angry with Paul Jordan because he allowed Balionus and Saulius to decide in a duel in a certain place of his jurisdiction about some of their disputes and lawsuits, and he cannot be appeased by any means, although requested by several cardinals. Lord Birago has returned to France, and the Pope does not admit Lord Foys as an envoy to him for the King of France. Ninety-four thousand foreigners who came for the jubilee have been accommodated in the hospice of the Trinity.</p>
      <p>Venice, June 4. The Emperor ordered his envoy to this republic to go to Genoa and in his name take care of matters related to peace, and not to leave until the matter is settled.</p>
      <p>In Constantinople on the 8th of the previous month, it was announced that only forty galleys had been sent out, then Ochialium took care to build a long ship, which has forty-two benches or yokes, on each of which nine rowers sit, and when the Turk went to see it, he was received with great joy, with many cannons fired, by which some soldiers and leaders were accidentally killed, and it was almost the case that the Turk himself was killed.</p>
      <p>Constantinople is suffering from plague and famine. To these news, Mr. Lentulus added the letters of the papal process, which you will receive together. Mr. Lentulus, the most honorable consuls Wyllius and Ambrosius Martini greet you very much. Farewell in the Lord, most reverend father, and may God, the Father of mercies and all grace, grant that we may soon receive you restored to the most desired health through Jesus Christ, our Lord. I earnestly beseech you, and in my name, greet Mr. Josias Simler.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur, June 20, in the year of the virgin's salutary birth</p>
      <p>1575.</p>
      <p>Your most observant servant, Caspar Hubenschmid, minister of the church of Chur.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his lord and father in Christ, always to be honored.</p>
