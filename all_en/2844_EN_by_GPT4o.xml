      <p>The booklet of Bertram on the sacrament of the body, etc., of Christ is highly recommended to me. If you can send it to me in both the vernacular and Latin languages, I pray; for I will indeed attempt something against the sacramentarians, who make the things of the sacraments out of the sacraments. If it should happen that I win over our prince, I would consider myself to have accomplished much.</p>
      <p>I will compensate you for the copies.</p>
