      <p>S. D. You see, brother, and experience daily how much the Lord values you and your ministry, who blesses you in all things and subdues your adversaries to you, all for the glory of His name and the salvation of the church. You will not claim anything here for yourself, but will instead give all glory to God with increasing humility, give thanks to Him, and strive in every way to serve Him faithfully and diligently care for the affairs of the church, knowing that the Lord is with you and will never forsake you.</p>
      <p>I also give thanks to our God, who thwarts the wicked plans of our adversaries and frees us from their snares. And you rightly feel that we must beware of seditions or tumults, as these have always brought more harm than benefit. God has other means by which He disperses the efforts of His enemies; to Him be the glory. I return everything you sent to me in good faith, as you requested, and I thank you as much as I can... (a. R.:...!)</p>
      <p>Give our thanks to Mr. Campello for the translation of the new matters and diligently greet him from me. May the Lord grant him the fulfillment of his wishes and protect his wife, or, if He has decided something better for her, comfort him and protect him from evil; indeed, I pray for the Lord's blessing upon all of you and your families, that the coming year may be happy and prosperous for you.</p>
      <p>I defer the rest until your arrival, which may the Lord bless. It seems to me, my brother, that new dangers and struggles are looming for us. For the Pope, the instigator of all evils and the son of perdition, is trying to draw everyone into the alliance made against the Turks. He sends envoys to the Emperor; he urges, and it would be surprising if he has not already sent something of this to the Five Cantons and to that Lussium of his, the knightly creature. The cause of waging war against the Turks is plausible. Charity and poverty will advise seeking better things, and may they indeed be better! The Pope seeks his own interests in this war; so do the others. If we involve ourselves in this war, we will encounter a most severe enemy and lose our homeland; for here Nebuchadnezzar is sent by the Lord to chastise us. You know what Jeremiah did in such a case. Therefore, what does not burn me, I would not blow on, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell. December 21, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet the councilors, Pontisella, Karl, Bonet, and the others.</p>
      <p>For God's sake, may you ensure that Mr. Sax is not troubled by this intrigue; for I have rightly understood that a letter has already been sent from your bishop regarding the matter of Bender, that he should let the people of Bender remain in their laughter. I do not know the reason; but I do know well that something is brewing, though I cannot say precisely what.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful and most vigilant minister of the church in Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
