      <p>Greetings in the Lord. The books you requested will be sent in good faith as soon as the rainy weather ceases; the books from Sturm in Strasbourg, which you requested, have not yet arrived. I will send the book on war to the fair; for someone is adding certain things to it, so that the history is continued up to our times. There are other small booklets, all of which you will receive shortly.</p>
      <p>Gilbert's brother is delivering letters to you, from whom you will be able to learn in detail what is happening in Burgundy.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Vienna in Pannonia is in Freiburg im Breisgau, what he intends to do there, the Lord knows; he has been elected as provost in Waldkirch, whom the other canons do not want to accept because they have elected another; but King Ferdinand is trying to force him into this position and will undoubtedly succeed. However, I will be informed shortly about what he has done in Freiburg.</p>
      <p>You know the rumors about the new king of Morocco in Africa; they say he is proceeding excellently in the business he has undertaken and has already defeated another king of Persia and invaded the borders of Mauritania. The King of Portugal is in arms, either to destroy a new people or to lose everything.</p>
      <p>In Alsace, a certain nobleman, following the Emperor's mandate, established the Interim and deposed a pious and learned pastor; the name of the place escapes me. Meanwhile, he proposed to his peasants with pompous words and added threats, reading out the penalty for neglectors; he declared he would defecate on Luther's gospel and the doctrine not approved by the Emperor. However, preparing to leave, he became insane, so that he did not know what he was doing. Other nobles wanted to retain him, but he did not want to stay, saying he would spend the night at home to avoid being captured by enemies who were plotting against his life. Thus, mounting his horse, he bid farewell to everyone; but soon, the wretched man, I believe struck by an angel of God, fell to the ground and broke his neck, and thus the insane Interimist felt the present blow,... and it seems that one should not fight against God. This is the true story, which I learned from someone who was in that village on that day. However, the nobleman's wife and relatives asked the priest, whom the nobleman had deposed, to stay and not abandon the office he had so diligently performed, and to pray for the whole family, so that they might not fall into a similar punishment, into which they had heard the insane nobleman had fallen. Did not the Interim kill that insane man?</p>
      <p>They say the firstborn son of the captive Duke of Saxony has fled to the maritime cities, of which he has become the chief captain; for he did not want to accept the Interim and feared that, by opposing the Emperor's edicts, he would be captured and taken to his father.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Strasbourg has now for the fourth time sent envoys to the senate, requesting that they administer the oath to all preachers and other clergy and have them swear it; otherwise, the mass priests will not remain. The senate has taken a delay until after the fair, so that they can more conveniently celebrate the upcoming market.</p>
      <p>The cities of the Netherlands swear allegiance to the son of the Emperor as the son of the Emperor, and the empire has become hereditary, with the cities and princes of the empire opposing it. No one dares to mutter against the Emperor's edict, and the bishops remain silent because of the restitution of external matters.</p>
      <p>You know Lord Granvelle in all his disguises... Thus it seemed to the superiors. Someone wrote: you will be able to submit the eagle, alluding to his insignia given by the Emperor; for he bears a sow's head on his coat of arms, in the coat of arms an eagle; this means, the sow shall rule the eagle. And indeed, the Emperor said that Granvelle is his soul. Farewell. You will greet Lord Theodor and Pellican and the others in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 30, 1549.</p>
      <p>I am now about to write about the state of our city; for our people want to swear the old Swiss Confederation oath: that God and all saints help. The pastors disagree. I fear a new tragedy is arising.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius, in haste.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor Lord Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the church in Zurich, his dearest in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
