      <p>Greetings. This good brother sought a position among us, which he did not find; for our people are remarkably averse to a foreign language. I predicted the same would happen in Zürich; nevertheless, he wished to proceed to you, from there intending to head to Augsburg, I believe.</p>
      <p>He has a wife and two children. He received two crowns from our people for travel expenses. He asked me to commend him to you; although I do this reluctantly, because I know you are already burdened enough with such people, I could not entirely refuse this, because he seems to be good and pious and one of those whom the Lord commends to us. I have nothing else to write now. I received yours along with the Italian booklet and I thank you. The Orb case succeeded well. Now there is another parish seeking reformation. The people of Freiburg have been summoned for the 20th of August; they are furious and do not know how they can hinder this course of the gospel; our people proceed vigorously. May the Lord strengthen His work. Sultzer was here these days, and he will also come to you on this journey, which he has undertaken through the people of Unterwalden and Lucerne. Our people greet you and all yours, especially Musculus and Schlatter, as well as our families. Farewell. August 11, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
