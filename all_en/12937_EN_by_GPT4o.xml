    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller writes only briefly, as in an hour Hans Wilpert Zoller the Younger will set off for Zurich to escape the imperial pursuits in Augsburg. He will take the present letter with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] There is no reliable news about Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. Emperor Charles V is said to already be in Zwickau. Some claim that the Bohemians have again defected [from the Elector] and returned home. Hopefully, that is not true!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Some Augsburgers observed on the morning of April 20th how two swords fought each other near the rising sun, one defeating the other, and the sun emitted black balls. May this be a sign of victory for the Church of Christ!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Musterings were conducted yesterday. The imperial soldiers are owed two months' pay, but they could only be paid for one month. Dissatisfied mercenaries then banded together, so that Colonel Bernhard of Schaumburg, the muster masters, and the captains had to hide in fear. Thus, the Lord makes the godless a mockery for the pious!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Augsburg merchants have received letters from Constantinople reporting the advance of the Turk, Sultan Suleiman. In Vienna, it is forbidden under penalty of death to speak of his arrival. God has so hardened the hearts that the Turkish threat is neglected in order to suppress Christ instead!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] In Italy, there are disturbances due to the introduction of the Inquisition against the so-called "heretical depravity" in the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily. The Sicilians have already killed 13 inquisitors, and the Neapolitans have obtained the abolition of the Inquisition from Viceroy Pedro Álvarez de Toledo by force.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] What the new French King Henry II intends is uncertain.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The imperial soldiers in Augsburg are greatly afraid of Sebastian Schertlin. Haller is sure that he would conquer all of Swabia if he had 10,000 mercenaries. He is so feared that all cities would surrender to him voluntarily!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] About Landgrave Philip of Hesse, it is only heard that he is gathering an army. Many suspect that he will invade the Netherlands with it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Yet the most important news is this: A new clerical league is to be established! With it, the Emperor, King Ferdinand, princes, bishops, and clerics, even some cities, are to join forces! Numerous envoys have gathered in Ulm. This is the worst news of this war for Haller! Nothing is heard from the [Schmalkaldic allies]. Some Augsburgers are still trying to resist, but it is feared that the allies will follow the example of the majority of the [southern German] cities. What else remains but the trampling of evangelical freedom? Some evil demon has ensured that the evangelical alliance is abandoned, joining the Antichrist, taking their mark on the forehead, and thus sealing their own earthly and eternal ruin! Bullinger and his followers should pray that the Lord thwarts such plans.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] So much for now! Haller must now attend the wedding of the daughter [Anna] of Georg Frölich. Sebastian Lepusculus has married the daughter [...] of Leonhard Burtenbach, known to Christoph Froschauer. However, this has caused offense, as the bride is still so young and the marriage came about very quickly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Greetings to the members and leaders of the Zurich church, also from Marius.</p>

      <p>S. I write briefly because Zollerus, through whom I send this, is leaving within the hour. He is compelled to leave due to the imperial plots.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We have no reliable news about the Elector. They say the Emperor is already in Zwickau. Some spread the rumor that the Bohemians have defected again and returned home, but I hope this is false.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>On April 20th, some of our citizens saw at sunrise two swords fighting near the sun's body, with one eventually succumbing, and the sun emitted black spheres. May this portend victory for the Church of Christ!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Yesterday, April 24th, there was a muster, and they wanted to pay the soldiers only one month's wages, which did not satisfy them, as they are now owed two months. Some soldiers banded together, so the colonel, along with the muster masters and captains, had to hide. Thus, God confounds the wicked, making them a laughingstock to all the pious.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Letters from Constantinople sent to our merchants testify to the Turk's advance. In Vienna, it is forbidden under penalty of death to speak of the Turk's arrival. Thus, God has hardened their hearts to neglect the Turkish threat, yet suppress Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In Italy, new disturbances arise. They have instituted an inquisition against heretical depravity (as they call it) in the Kingdom of Sicily and Naples. The Sicilians have killed 13 of these inquisitors. The Neapolitans have obtained from the viceroy, by force, the cessation of it.</p>
    </div>

      <p>What the new King of France intends is uncertain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Our soldiers fear Schertlium excessively. I do not doubt that if he had at least ten thousand soldiers with him, he would compel all of Swabia. All cities would offer themselves to him voluntarily, so great is the fear of him among all!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>About the Landgrave, we hear only that he is gathering an army, as many suspect, to invade Lower Germany.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>But what I most want you to know is that I hear a new clerical league is being formed, in which the Emperor, King, princes, with bishops and clerics, even cities, are convening. Many envoys have already gathered in Ulm. Nothing in this war has ever been so troubling to me! I hear nothing about what our allies will do. We resist as much as we can, but I fear they will follow the majority of the cities. Then what remains but the destruction of the gospel and all liberty. I do not know what evil demon has invaded us, that having abandoned the holy alliance of the gospels, we now mix with the antichristian company and allow their marks to be painted on our foreheads, from which the most certain destruction of both bodies and souls will follow! May the Lord break such plans for the glory of His name, which you, dear brothers, should also pray for with us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I cannot write more now. I am going to the wedding of Laeti's daughter, which takes place today. Lepusculus has married the daughter of Leonhard Burtenbach, known to Froschauer, hopefully not with such offense to the church, partly because she is so young, partly because it happened so quickly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Farewell with all yours! I wish all members of your church well, especially the leaders! Marius greets you. From Augsburg, April 25th. Yours, whom you know, J. H.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Mr. Bullinger, his esteemed father. M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
