    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer sent a letter to Bullinger [on January 7] [No. 2328] along with a letter from [Georg] Frölich [HBBW XV, No. 2313] through the butchers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- There is no other news, except that congratulations are in order for the people of Augsburg on the [appointment of Johannes] Haller, whose excellent character traits are praised by the most outstanding men. Bullinger will encourage Haller to patiently endure any hatred and envy and to be uplifted by the praise of the best.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The opinion of Luther, Philipp [Melanchthon], and [Johannes] Bugenhagen [on the extension of the Schmalkaldic League] has not yet been read before the [Konstanz] council; Blarer will report on this later.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger should pray for the [Konstanz] church. Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther, and [Konrad] Pellikan. Blarer recommends [Konrad] Curio [Hofherr] and [Jakob] Metzler.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you, my venerable and dearest brother, three days ago through our butchers and sent those letters, which Georg Frölich gave, through them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now, I have nothing else but to heartily congratulate my people of Augsburg on our Johannes Haller, who is so commendable to me for his clarity in teaching and doctrine, his modesty, innocence of character, and singular piety, and this from the best men of no ordinary judgment, that neither you will ever regret this excellent gift nor the people of Augsburg regret receiving him. You will encourage him to bear and overcome with an unbroken spirit and high courage the hatred and envy of some, which perpetually follow excellent virtues like a shadow follows the body, and to consider it abundantly sufficient for himself if he pleases the best and the children of God, although the young man's mind seems to me to be so well disposed that he will proceed beautifully of his own accord without any spurs.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Our senate's troublesome occupations are now such that the opinion of Luther, Philipp Melanchthon, and Johannes Bugenhagen has not yet been read, about which I will write to you as soon as I find out what it is.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and best Bullinger, with all yours. Pray to the Lord for me and our church, that He may never cease to protect and support us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Greet the brothers and friends, especially Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and Konrad Pellikan. I commend to you diligently our Konrad Curio Hofherr and Jakob Metzler.</p>
      <p>Farewell. January 9, 1546. Konrad Zwick sends his regards and commends himself to you. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable friend and brother.</p>
