      <p>Fr[anziskus] Hotmanus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter is a young man known to me for quite some time; he lived with Beza for four years and attended my lectures in Lausanne for a considerable period. Therefore, I commend him to you, esteemed father. Master Martyr has taken him away, as he has many others. You bring this calamity upon our school, as you not only take away an outstanding teacher but also a large part of our audience. I began to bear this more reluctantly after I was asked by the most honorable senate to undertake the interpretation of law, having been reminded of the will of the Duke of Prussia. In this duty, you will see what I can offer to you and yours. If your son is to remain here, I believe he would not be poorly advised to first learn the basics of our law, almost as if through play and jest. In your public library, there is an old manuscript of the Institutions without glosses, to which is attached a treatise, if I remember correctly, on the rules of law. I have long told Master Gesner that these institutions would be greatly necessary for me; if it pleases you to lend them to me for a few weeks, you would oblige me with a great favor. I ask you to gratify me in this matter; the book will be returned to you safe and sound. But I do not ask this of you with many words; I trust in your benevolence and kindness towards me. Farewell, esteemed father, and continue to love me as you do.</p>
      <p>Strassburg, July 8, 1556.</p>
