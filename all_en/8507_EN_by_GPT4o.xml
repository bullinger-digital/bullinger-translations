      <p> Greetings. I can easily believe, most reverend lord, that you are distracted by countless affairs, especially at this time when everything is full of evils, for which it is necessary to bring a remedy from the word of God. As for me, I see that I must hold on, although exposed to all the arrows of fortune, I do not know if I can hold on. Some corner elsewhere would suffice for me, as I am such a burden to this church with the message of truth. I will await your advice on ejection; however, I would not want such a catastrophe of ejection as I felt not lightly twelve years ago to my greatest harm and that of my people. - It cannot be said how great the scarcity is among us due to the high price of grain and the beastly stinginess of the wealthier people, who would rather let stored grain perish than offer it for sale, as long as the prices of such things become higher and more profitable day by day. Most families in this city have seen no bread for several days, not even the women in childbirth, to say nothing of the pagans and peasants, who were forced to leave the city with empty sacks, weeping. Knowing that all the blame lay with our magistrate and grain merchants, I sharply rebuked them from the pulpit, and the sermon was not without its fruit. For immediately on Monday, the granaries and storehouses of some were opened by order of the magistrate; meanwhile, I receive the envy and plots of the greedy as my reward. - Gantner, having spoken with Mr. Campello, persists in his opinion and says that an oath is not commanded in the New Testament, nor should the conscience be burdened with the gravity of this matter. However, he now minimizes his fault and earnestly labors to transfer all blame to me alone. </p>
      <p> He affirms that he does not deny the magistrate has no right over heretics if they break out into sedition; however, Frell has not yet incited any sedition; therefore, that path should not have been taken with him. He prefers to feel the fire and conflagration rather than prevent it. What certain Italians are plotting in a similar matter, you will abundantly learn from the letters and response given to Sylvio, a restless man, by Mr. Lentulus. However, so that those quarrelsome shouters do not lend their hands and efforts to Gantner, we have obtained from the lords of the Three Leagues that through the commissioners, who are now on their journey and settling accounts in the Valtellina, all Arians who are manifest, along with Sylvio, who dared to improperly attack the peaceful decree of the lords in writing, be expelled without any excuse. We have, however, tempered the matter so that this reformation may not be a fraud and harm to the pious ministers (such as Paolo Gadio, etc., who send you their most cordial greetings). I do not know, however, what I can sufficiently judge from these effects, which accompany the excommunication of the Italians, especially since even after the funerals, the spirits of the brothers are exacerbated by it. I will await what you judge about this case and the death of the one Mr. Lentulus mentions in his letters. It would be most pleasing to me if you would send me that German booklet transcribed, by which I may help against this impious doctrine, just as I learn daily from Mr. Beza's book, which (if only with your peace) I can hardly return to you yet, but I will restore it as soon as possible. The death of your most excellent relative, who could have been so useful and necessary to the church, has singularly increased all my cares and sorrows. However, I now think that these are the times, so that it has gone well with him... </p>
