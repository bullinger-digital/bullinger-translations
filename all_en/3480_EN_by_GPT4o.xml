      <p>Reverend father, while I was in sorrow due to the illness of my wife, who gave birth to a little daughter for me the previous night, behold, Mr. Zanchi showed me that part of your letter to him in which you requested the return of the book of Institutions that your eminence had lent to me. I was very surprised by this and wondered whether Mr. Wolff had not informed you that it had been returned to him three months ago by Mr. Bernhard Bertram from Gallien, who, having traveled there in October, was received by you with hospitality: furthermore, whether two jurists had not delivered my letters to you and Mr. Peter Martyr from Italy the same number of months ago, in which I announced that I would shortly return the book. - - - Tomorrow I will make sure that Mr. Bernhard provides me with a testimony in his own hand. Today, news has arrived that Calais has been captured by the French.</p>
      <p>Our senate has decreed that, after consulting the German princes, they will summon the Swiss theologians to some assembly, in which the matter of the sacrament will be settled. The Anabaptists are gradually being expelled by our people.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Münster has resigned his bishopric into the hands of his canons, as he could no longer endure their impiety. They created another on the same day. - - -</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, January 17, 1558.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, an excellent theologian and the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my venerable father.</p>
