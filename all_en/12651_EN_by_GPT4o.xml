    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has examined his son Heinrich [the Younger] and found that he has learned well with Simler. Bullinger would like to reciprocate for this with Simler, his wife Simler [Verena, née Huser], and son Josias.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He will keep his son with him because he is now able to continue his studies in Zürich. Moreover, Bullinger does not want to burden Simler and his wife further, now that winter is approaching. Heinrich will have it stricter with him, but he needs that too.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Simler should calculate the maintenance costs for Heinrich for the period extending beyond Josias' stay with Bullinger. He should also account for the money lent to Heinrich and other expenses. However, this should not end the relationship between him and Bullinger. Rather, their friendship should last until death!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Wolfgang [Haller] will share news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings. To say goodbye and collect his things, Heinrich will come to Kappel once more.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings from Anna [née Adlischwyler] to Simler and his wife. Heinrich and his siblings thank Simler.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God. Friendly, dearly beloved sir and godfather, I have examined my son Heinrich and found that he has learned well, which pleases me, and I have also noticed your great loyalty, effort, and work in other ways! Therefore, I offer you my highest thanks and assure you that if I can do anything for you, your dear wife, and Josias, our son, I will do so willingly and diligently.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, I inform you in a very friendly manner that I intend to keep Heinrich here with me at home for the following reasons: I believe the school here is now good for him; winter is upon us, and I want to relieve you and your esteemed wife of this burden, and I do not want to overburden a willing horse. He will indeed have it stricter with me; however, it is necessary for him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Furthermore, it is my earnest desire that you now calculate the expenses and inform me of what I owe you and what needs to be done, whether it be for the table, as he stayed with you longer than Josias stayed with me, or for anything else you have lent or spent on him. Please send me a brief summary of this. I want to compensate and satisfy you honorably and willingly, God willing. With this, we should not be divided, but rather maintain and increase our old love and friendship until our grave.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>God be with you and your dear wife. Heinrich must come back to say goodbye and collect his belongings.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Dated October 1st. My dear wife sends her greetings to you and your wife. Heinrich and all the children also thank you for everything good. Yours always, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his friendly, dearly beloved sir and godfather, Mr. Peter Simler, preacher at Kappel.</p>
