      <p>Greetings. I am very glad that the letters I sent are pleasing to you, my dear Mr. Bullinger, and there is no need for you to thank me so earnestly, as I still acknowledge that I owe you much more and I am not ashamed to admit it. I will also make an effort in the future, if I think anything from us would not be displeasing to you, to declare my feelings towards you. There were also strange things being said about the Davidists among us, before the body of David Joris was exhumed and publicly burned (along with a considerable heap of his books, both manuscripts and printed, and a very elegantly painted portrait), as a conclusion was put to this story and at the same time a bridle was put on his remaining followers and the rumors were deprived of fuel like a fire. Certainly, my domestic occupations give me so much business that I could not attend the public reading of his articles, nor the act when that kind of punishment was taken on the body, and I do not doubt that you can understand these things better from others. However, I will urge Mr. Junius to write something to you about these matters during his leisure.</p>
      <p>We are gradually progressing in your Apocalypse and at the same time we are taking care of having the history of the martyrs of our time, described by Foxe, printed at Brilinger's; but we are missing quite a few things. Therefore, if you could help us with this matter, it would be most appreciated if you would share it with us when the opportunity arises. I could barely respond to your letters; therefore, I beg you to forgive me and to take it in good part.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May 19, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
