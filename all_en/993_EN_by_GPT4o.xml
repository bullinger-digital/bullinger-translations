      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I am sending to you Glareanus for a penny. You will easily be able to judge what he has accomplished in that little book; the book is small, but of great value; for he sells it for 3 Constance pennies. Perhaps you have seen the Emperor's mandate, which he left behind, in which he completely condemns and rejects our doctrine. The priests of Strasbourg are triumphant; some, who fought little with the priests, have been thrown into chains. The Lord will soon work wonders against our thoughts and plans; it is His work, which He will complete in a miraculous way and will undoubtedly not allow His kingdom to be destroyed by these scoundrels. The Turk threatens our necks and will undoubtedly inflict great damage. Maurice is arming his nobility and... is heading to the assembly in Torgau; he wants to plot something against the people of Magdeburg and intends to show that he promised this to the Emperor before he assumed the dignity of elector; he has disobedient nobles, whom he tries to persuade with amazing skills.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever. Basel, 18th August 1550. Yours, Gastius from the heart, in haste.</p>
      <p>Vienna has received Spanish soldiers as reinforcements; the wealthy are fleeing and taking their belongings with them. Soon more about Nausea, the Bishop of Vienna, who is about to come to us, whom they will receive as the most pontifical.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
