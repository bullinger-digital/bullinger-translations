      <p>Greetings. Regarding those five individuals who are involved in everything and then deliberate on it, I would like to be informed whether they still exist, who they are, and what they are attempting. It is necessary. Therefore, see to it that you inquire as much as you can. Your effort will not be in vain. You understand what I mean: certainly nothing other than what you entrusted to Dasipodius to convey to me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, what you wrote about Rome is not insignificant. There was unrest due to the Pope's voyage, during which cardinals favoring the French perished, although one by poison. Then the district was completely plundered. It is resolved among the imperialists that the Pope will never be received again. This will be the case unless the Emperor is persuaded by the Pope that he is working towards peace between himself and the King of the French by leaving Italy. This was reported by a certain nobleman who followed the Pope to the fleet.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your wife and Utinger. Write back as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Basel, November 23, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his dear and kind brother.</p>
