      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, your letters were delivered to me, which you sent to the ministers of our church and to me, along with the supplication and articles of reconciliation with their prince of the afflicted brothers of the Piedmont region, which I immediately handed over to be read by the convoked college of ministers. They, affected with the utmost compassion, have taken up their cause with us, and we are diligently and studiously preparing to present it before the next senate, having already explained the case to the leading men of the republic, so that they may be better informed and able to establish their consultation more certainly and gravely.</p>
      <p>We have no doubt about the liberality and munificence of the senate, especially in a matter so worthy and greatly necessary. Moreover, for the departure of Mr. Peter Martyr and the exceedingly grave undertaking of the kings of France, we flee to God with our prayers that they may be most auspicious. It is a difficult matter, and contrary to the rash endeavors of many, exposed to the insults of many. However, the Lord directs the steps of all.</p>
      <p>Mr. Conrad Sömli, because he went to Konstanz, was not at home; but from his wife, I learned that he received the money you sent and that it was sent to the stable master. I have not yet received your books on councils, revised and augmented in Latin and German, which you mention in your letters; I do not know where they are delayed, but I expect them at any moment. We have no information about Peter Martyr's dialogue.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most excellent and venerable Bullinger, you add more to the innumerable benefits to me daily; meanwhile, I return nothing but a most grateful and mindful heart of your benefits.</p>
      <p>I congratulate the church for your given gifts and pour out prayers to God that you may receive a reward from the Lord and that the progress in evangelical truth may advance more and more each day. These things, with the messenger hurrying too much, I could not help but write to you with the opportunity presented.</p>
      <p>Therefore, may your kindness consider this favorably and continue to love me; I pursue you with love, as I cannot with greater. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>The ministers send their greetings, and my son Joshua reverently returns the greeting. At the end, my son sent me this note, as you see; but because there is no time to write this sentence with the messenger urging, I add it so that you may understand what he wishes to know in the name of good men. St. Gallen, September 13.</p>
      <p>1561.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and learned Antistes of the Zürich church, his most venerable lord.</p>
