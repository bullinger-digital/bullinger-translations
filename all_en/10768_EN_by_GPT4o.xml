    <p xml:id="regest1">As the people of Strasbourg urge him to gain a hearing for them with the people of Zurich, he advises, despite doubts about the usefulness of such discussions, to invite Bucer [to the upcoming meeting] in Basel. Further conventions, where there is always a danger that people place themselves above the Gospel, could thus be avoided. He still knows nothing about the results of the Bundestag in Schmalkalden and the negotiations of the envoys [of Francis I] and [Henry VIII]. Pope [Paul III] has offered a council without preconditions, but he was told that this was not his place. It is said that [Francis I] attributes more authority to the Pope than [Henry VIII] and has supported this opinion to the English envoy [Stephen Gardiner] with the opinions of Philipp [Melanchthon] and other German theologians, whereupon the envoy thwarted the latter's [appointment to Paris]. Frankfurt is to be included in the alliance on the condition that it no longer allows the Mass. Philipp [Melanchthon] was in Schmalkalden and exchanged letters with Thomas [Blarer]. [Martin] Frecht asked Zwick on behalf of Bucer to influence the people of Zurich; furthermore, he writes that the French envoy Guillaume [du Bellay], who is well-disposed towards the Gospel, presented the [Ulm] council with articles on controversial doctrines. Bucer should at least be heard in Basel; an open conversation can serve the truth, as the example of Paphnutius shows, and besides, Bucer could no longer complain. That the people of Basel are sending a delegation to [King] Ferdinand seems questionable to Zwick; it would be better if they turned to the evangelical princes. The people of Geneva, too, should have turned to the Schmalkaldic League in their distress [through Savoy]; even now they could reach Strasbourg with the support of Bern.

      <p>Grace and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>Dearest brother, the people of Strasbourg do not cease to ask a hundred times that I obtain from you that you make yourselves available to them, and they write not letters, but books without number, listing reasons and benefits. However, I understand well what you replied to me in your last letters, and I fear that such meetings will not be beneficial, where we will torment each other more than comfort. But since they loudly proclaim that they have what they desire in you, and cannot obtain any conversation, you must consider how to avoid occasions for slander. They promise all the best, and certainly they urge me so much (to speak freely), although I have many fears, yet I believe it should not be allowed that they are not heard by you. And the more you fear that they might undertake something inconsistent, the more they should not only be heard, but also resisted, so that the conversation may be beneficial in two ways: first, to remove their occasion for complaint, and then, so that simple truth may have its defenders and darkness may prevail less. They will not cease and always cry out, you do not want to hear them. This very thing I wanted to repeat to you, having been adjured by them in a few words. When I write to them that you will do what is right, they reply that I should not cease to try and move every stone, so that they may be heard by you and you agree to nothing else than what is based on the word of God.</p>
      <p>The main reason why I would like Bucer to be called to you in Basel is that I believe any other meeting could be more easily hindered. But I have nothing more to say about this at the moment, except that God the Lord may preserve His simple holy gospel pure and clean from human additions; for if the devil cannot destroy it with persecution, he cannot completely tear it down, but he would like it very much, as he has previously managed, that one does not believe the only true gospel unless it is first decided that it is the right gospel, and as the pope says, we would not know what the gospel is if it were not accepted by the church, etc. That will be the first fruit of general councils, etc.</p>
      <p>In the Schmalkaldic assembly, nothing has yet been broken out, what has been negotiated and decided; for something may perhaps be brought behind. The Frenchman was there with 30 horses, the Englishman with 40. What their recruitment was, I do not know. The pope has offered, like his predecessor, Clement, not to consent to any unconditional council, but he wants to do it and a free Christian council without any condition, so that one may perceive his inclined will towards the unity of the holy Christian church. But he was answered that it was not his concern, nor did it belong to him to convene councils. If something concerning religion is important to the country, and necessity requires that a council be held, it is up to the estates of the empire and the regular authority and not the pope.</p>
      <p>I also hear that the Englishman contends that the pope has no authority over divine or human law and that he has no authority over human or divine matters. The Frenchman is said not to be far from this opinion, but he attributes something to the long possession and consent of so many centuries. A dispute arose over this matter (as some assert) between the king of France and the English envoy. When he was recently in France and the king asserted that this opinion of his about the pope's authority was also approved by some of the more learned in Germany, the English envoy, the bishop of Winchester, firmly denied this, and those councils of Philipp and others were produced. Soon the king took care to summon Philipp, perhaps to make the English envoy deal with him. However, the envoy, sensing the tricks, anticipated the king's plan by ensuring that Philipp did not come. From this, you understand how false we have been about the given councils of the prophets. This limping zeal for concord is seized for this purpose, and thus the gospel is imposed on foreign nations.</p>
      <p>Regarding the people of Frankfurt being received into the alliance of our religion, they say there is agreement, but on the condition that on the day they reinstate the mass (for there are some suspicions about this), they are also excluded from the alliance.</p>
      <p>Philipp was in Schmalkalden; he wrote friendly letters to our Thomas, in which he does not attribute much to the meetings and considers the main benefit of them to be that old friends come together. Thomas has already written to him explicitly what he thinks about the words of the supper and all kinds of efforts for concord.</p>
      <p>Today I received letters from Frecht, from which I add here: "Bucer provides the occasion for writing, urging that I write to you, so that you may insist with the people of Zurich to not deny the promised meeting, to which he wishes to incite you, who are already running willingly, through me, a lazy encourager," etc.</p>
      <p>Also: "The day before yesterday, the French envoy, Guillaume Langy, spoke here in the senate and urged our people with many words to strive for Christian concord with all evangelical allies. He proposed forms of moderation in controversial doctrines, which you may have understood were also written to the French after Melanchthon's advice. This man, as it appears, sincerely favors the gospel and certainly testifies to this with his piety and learned eloquence."</p>
      <p>From these, you understand how Bucer urges me from all sides and what he wants me to do. Therefore, although I would not want you to agree with Bucer in everything, and this varied zeal for concord is entirely and for many reasons suspect to me, yet I would like him to be heard at least once fully, so that an end may be made to complaints. Who is that spirit who does not want to converse with brothers? If you fear being imposed upon, they think you are so firmly based on the rock of Christ that no one can easily impose upon you. Thus he. Therefore, you fear that in the conversation the truth may be obscured; therefore, it is all the more necessary to converse, so that darkness may prevail less. Even Paphnutius could have fled the synod, but by resisting, he strongly supported the truth. And I firmly believe, if Bucer were called by you to Basel for your current assembly, it would be much better than for him to continue further to convene a meeting and call you. If you do not come, then you have even more to answer for. But if I were in your place, I would write to him: He complained, first, how I had promised him much that I did not want to keep; second, that we had things in our churches that should and must be improved; third, that I did not want to hear him. So he might come to Basel for the time being and talk with you about those matters, etc. If he then came, I would not consent to any dark, hidden matter and would also talk enough with him about concord and holding synods, and whatever concerned me about this, I would speak freely with him, whether he departed with love or sorrow. And everything you then fear because of his departure, you will otherwise find doubly.</p>
      <p>Forgive me my miserable and bad writing. I make my account; if you understand me, it is enough.</p>
      <p>We have heard that the people of Basel have prepared a delegation to Ferdinand. We do not wish to know the reasons; however, we suspect something and fear that it is not safe to negotiate anything in this way. Perhaps, having consulted the princes of our religion, they would have expected something more fortunate, if indeed it is about what our mind foresees.</p>
      <p>Regarding the people of Geneva, I will add a word or two. We hear that they are frequently harassed by enemies, whom you know, and that for no other reason than the cause of truth. Hence, all of us who support this cause of truth should mutually grieve for the sake of faith and charity. There are those who say that the people of Bern will not abandon them. May it be true and fortunate! May there also be others who would extend a hand to them in faith! But no one willingly offers help or promises assistance without being asked. But what, dearest brother, if the people of Geneva had presented their cause and persecution for righteousness to the princes and cities of the Christian alliance? At least they would have tested what their minds were like. Oh, if this had been done at the convention already held in Schmalkalden! Or what if even now, by sending a delegation to the people of Strasbourg, they had explained the whole matter to them? And first, they would ask for advice on how they might handle their affairs; second, they would also ask for help in times of need, and that they be considered in their serious concerns as fellow members of the empire and faith. With this, they might perhaps obtain a faithful counsel or even help, whether with people or with money, or they would learn what they might expect from people. To promote this matter, it would be most convenient if the people of Bern confirmed this petition of the people of Geneva with commendatory letters to the confederates of the Christian religion and requested the same in the name of the people of Geneva.</p>
      <p>I wanted to inform you of this thought, born of compassion, if perhaps the Lord might give you something further for the consolation of the afflicted.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the dearest brothers, especially my Pellican.</p>
      <p>In Constance, January 19, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>I send the letter you requested.</p>
      <p>For God's sake, forgive me my bad writing.</p>
