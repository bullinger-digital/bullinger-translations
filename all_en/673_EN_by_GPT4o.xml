      <p>Greetings in our solid and only salvation, Christ. Although there is nothing at this time, as far as I know, that you are unaware of, and therefore it is necessary to write with my usual diligence, I have nevertheless decided to send this little letter to you through our Hieronymus, so that you might write back to me, if nothing else, about what your recent assembly has brought forth, about which we have not received a single word here, except for what is carried to us by the uncertain rumors of the people. I wish that this new alliance is not the cause of new evils, as I greatly fear it might be after such unfortunate beginnings, about which you recently wrote. It pains me beyond measure that the people of Basel and Mulhouse, along with those of Schaffhausen, have allowed themselves to be dragged into this snare of servitude; for this is what some reliable people consistently affirm. I greatly fear that these are the surest signs of impending evils. You, as I know you do, with all the vigilance and diligence you can muster, continually keep your people from betraying the freedom of the fatherland in this way and selling it for a very low price, so that you may save your soul, regardless of what they do. At the same time, pray to the Lord with faithful prayers for us, that He, having mercy on us, may faithfully resolve our cause, continually making us more and more secure with the pledge of His Spirit towards us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my heart and soul in the Lord. May your household be well with all the brothers and friends. My wife, sister, and Zviccius, who is now with me, send you very dutiful greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Griesenberg, September 10, 1549.</p>
      <p>I commend to you, as diligently as I can, our Hieronymus, a truly pious and prudent man and a very dear friend to me.</p>
      <p>Return to me the papal commission, which I recently sent to you, through him, if you have read it.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Jacob Funck, who has always been like a son to me and still is, if he passes through there on his way to Bern, make sure he feels that he also has some influence with you on my behalf, especially in obtaining letters of recommendation to Haller and the people of Bern. He is a learned and pious young man, diligent in the service of the church both to the pious and beyond the common ministers of the church, for whom I wish well as much as for myself. However, he would prefer to be appointed to some literary school rather than the church; I, on the other hand, would like him to be in the ministry of the word, to which he has always seemed to me to be suited. Every effort must be made; he is urged by many troubles to leave Tegervillen even against his will. You, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, be present to him as a certain divine presence; you will never regret, I am absolutely certain, this recommendation.</p>
      <p>To his very venerable and dearest brother, D. Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
