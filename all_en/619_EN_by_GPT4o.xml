      <p>Greetings. Today, the people of Lausanne are once again present, bringing a very serious accusation against Zebedee. They almost drive me to madness. I will write what will happen next. A messenger is about to leave within the hour, so I cannot write more. I ask only this one thing, that you finally reply to my letters sent recently through Felk, for I am uncertain whether you have received them or not. I wrote to the council through the same messenger, letters which I would not want to have been lost, as I have disclosed to them what has been done with me here. I also sent 12 crowns to our students from Bern, who have not responded either, whether they have received them or not, which makes me not only doubtful but also anxious and worried. Please respond, I implore you; for I have not yet replied to our people, even though the time has already passed by which I promised to respond.</p>
      <p>Farewell. My wife, who has been bedridden for three days with a sore throat, sends her greetings to you, your wife, and your children. Musculus also sends his greetings to you with his family.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 7, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
