      <p>I received your letter dated October 19. Believe me, the crime committed in France... affects me no less continuously than it does you... Various conclusions can be drawn from this, namely that with so many thousands taken away, the Lord has decided to enter into a much more severe reckoning with the remaining ones, that He wanted to declare through this event that the final coming of the Lord is near, and that the church, which began with the blood of the faithful, will now be ended with blood, or certainly that another state of the republic is to be introduced throughout the Christian world, and that something significant is to be sent, the idea of which no one could now conceive in their mind any more than they could have ever thought of this monstrous crime. It is certainly fitting, as you say, that we should be prepared to endure temptations and nonetheless remain vigilant in our calling. May the Lord our God deign to grant us the grace to be able to accomplish this. I can easily surmise that not everything is peaceful with you. The state of affairs throughout Germany is such that in many places people promise themselves hope or some solace in the arrival of the Turks; a miserable hope. I truly believe that the measure of the impious is complete and that soon just punishments will be exacted from them.</p>
      <p>I gladly read the writings about French affairs that you sent and thank you for sending them; I now return the same to you. I have taken care to consign some information about the state of our affairs in the enclosed note. I also add this, that the Margrave of Ansbach and the Bishop of Eichst√§tt have ordered their peasants and subjects to acquire arms and to be soon trained in their use.</p>
      <p>The King of Poland is said to be the designated brother of the Elector of Brandenburg. The young King of Scotland died not without suspicion of poison. I often think about a suitable place to which I might send my family if necessity demands; many examples come to mind of those who are suddenly expelled by those who had received them kindly just a short time before, which makes me hesitant.</p>
      <p>But God knows how to provide both counsel and timely help to His own.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given at Bocksberg, November 18, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Georg von Stetten. To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
