    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger is very concerned, as he had to gather from Erb's letter [No. 2149] that he did not receive the shipment he arranged via Basel at Easter with Erb's dedicatory letter to [Bullinger's] "Resurrectio". - In the accompanying letter [not received], Bullinger explained why Froschauer did not print the writing and why Bullinger kept it with him for so long. Froschauer repeatedly gave him hope for a print, only to finally admit that he, overwhelmed with business, could not print it. So Bullinger sent the print templates back to Erb, so that he could have them printed in Basel by [Bartholom√§us] Westheimer or another. Even though Bullinger is not to blame for this loss, he still asks for an apology. Should he receive the templates back (which he will now endeavor to do), he will send them to Erb. - He recommends the promising young bearer Gerold Meyer [von Knonau the Younger] from a good family. Erb should be a father to him, admonish him, and notify the [Zurichers] if the boy should stray from the right path.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I can hardly express, my dearest Erb, how troubled and distressed I am by your book, that is, the dedicatory letter and the division of the book on the resurrection. I sent it to Basel around the Easter festival through a certain brother, thinking it would be safely and quickly delivered to you from there. But now, from your letters, I understand that you have not yet received anything. I suspect, therefore, that this useful and pious work has been lost. However, I will inquire more diligently.</p>
      <p>I explained to you in the accompanying letters what prevented Froschauer from printing it, and why I kept it for so long. For he kept giving me hope of printing it, only to finally, overwhelmed with business, solemnly declare that he could not print it. And, although I did not receive this response with a very patient mind, because I saw the man overwhelmed with business, as was claimed, I considered it well and thought it best to send it back to you in time, so that you could ensure it is printed in Basel by Westheimer or another. Now, contrary to my expectations, I find that you have not yet received anything. But truly, this fault does not rest with me, but with those to whom I entrusted the letters; nevertheless, I humbly beg pardon for the fault as much as I can. As soon as I find out what faith or treachery those who undertook it have used, and I have recovered the book, I will send it in good faith. In the meantime, since I can do nothing else, I will grieve over this misfortune.</p>
      <p>The one who offers this to you is Gerold Meyer, born of very honest parents, a young man of great promise. I commend him to your trust as a son to a father.</p>
      <p>What you do for him, I will consider done for me. Admonish him faithfully, and if you see him stray from the right path due to youthful age, write to us promptly.</p>
      <p>I, in turn, will be and am entirely yours. Love me in Christ. Live and farewell. Most hastily. Zurich, June 3, 1545.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Matthias Erb, minister of Christ and the church in Richenwil, his dearest brother.</p>
