      <p>S. I do not doubt that there are various rumors among you about our people and especially about the recent selection. But in short, the matter stands thus: As soon as my lords learned that the Bollweiler had moved towards Burgundy, they well considered what might come of it, and therefore made a fairly strong expedition, about 10,000 men. Meanwhile, the Duke of Savoy sent a delegation here, which, however, did not want to make any agreement, but referred solely to the Count of Chalon, who is my lords' citizen and the duke's bailiff; he will come in a few days and make the agreement. However, he has indicated that his lord desires nothing else than to amicably settle the matter of the land with my lords; he is also not concerned about the land, and means of a friendly agreement could well be found. Meanwhile, the Bollweiler has moved towards Bourg-en-Bresse, whereupon my lords, together with Fribourg and Valais, have advanced the expedition, which this legate is exceedingly anxious about.</p>
      <p>However, the one from Chalon has not yet come, and people are considering what might be behind it, that after the Bollweiler has succeeded, an agreement would then be reached. The legate has gone to Fribourg these days; he is supposed to return these days.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Bollweiler, we now have this information, that he has moved towards Bourg-en-Bresse, changed the camp there, that some banners of the Confederates and Gascons are inside; they leave the city open in two places and are courageous.</p>
      <p>He has now moved away from the city for a while. Many would like to be involved, thinking that one should pursue him to get into Burgundy; but I do not think anything will come of it; honest people are straightforward. However, some reinforcements will be sent to the French-speaking region these days, to Geneva, Yverdon, etc. I hope it will remain at that.</p>
      <p>Thus it stands here.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the emperor's delegation regarding Milan has also been here; I suppose also with you. Two of them, who escaped from Paris and came to Dijon, were burned there, despite my lords having earnestly written for them. There is also a report that 16 prominent ones, who were captured in Paris, have been burned. From Italy, all of ours are coming home, except for David Tillger, the treasurer's son; the father is exceedingly worried about him. What kind of flood there was in Rome and Florence, I assume you have already learned from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>I wanted to write this to you now, so that you have some certainty about our affairs.</p>
      <p>I expect yours daily.</p>
      <p>May all yours be well; ours also greet you, and especially Musculus.</p>
      <p>Bern, 28th September 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed and dear lord and compatriot.</p>
