      <p>My willing service, friendly greetings, and all good things to you beforehand.</p>
      <p>Friendly, dear Mr. Bullinger, you know my and all my family's good fortune; likewise, I hope to God that all is well with you and all yours. Now, I have not written to you for a long time, indeed since I came from Chur from St. Paul's market, I have never written anything, because I had nothing special to report to you, even though I am otherwise quite busy, I would not have failed to write to you more often.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you to excuse me for being so slow with writing. Here with us, there is a great scarcity of all things.</p>
      <p>May God the Lord improve it! As for the war affairs, it is all quiet, except that at our borders, like in Chur and nearby there (daselbsthuber), there are some Spaniards who were recently sent there; but one does not know what they are needed for. Many things are reported about the great generosity with which the Pope treats everyone, and therefore they also report that he is very pleasing to the Romans. From the Duchy of Milan and especially from the jurisdiction of the Three Leagues, places adjacent to our dominion, they have flocked to Rome to greet the Pope himself; all of whom, having been showered with countless benefits, returned home cheerfully. However, no matter how much he is praised now, he will still be similar to his predecessors, etc. Regarding the Duke of Sinuessa, the governor of the Duchy of Milan, it is said that he will soon leave and in his place, the Marquis of Pescara will succeed. The Venetians are acting quietly, as I perceive; but I hear that soldiers are being recruited everywhere in Germany or at least in many places, and it is unknown where they are to be led.</p>
      <p>I ask you, however, not to disdain to write to me if you understand anything of this kind; what these new movements of affairs mean. It was also reported here that negotiations are taking place between the Duke of Savoy and the Bernese about the restitution of the territory previously occupied by the Bernese, and if they do not agree among themselves, the danger of war is imminent, and likewise, there are also those who believe that the Spaniards, who are in Como and elsewhere in the entire Duchy of Milan, are being kept in readiness so that if the occasion arises, the Duke of Savoy may use their services.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing to report to you. My son Hans goes here to the school of Franciscus Niger, who came here and performs the duty of teaching 12 boys, among whom is also my son, and I tell you this because I know you are concerned that my son does not waste time. He, my son, as well as my wife and all mine, send you and your entire household many greetings. Since I came from St. Paul's market, I have not received any writing from you; let this be shown to you in the best way.</p>
      <p>Greet all good gentlemen and friends for me, especially your honorable wife, sons, and daughters along with their husbands, and whoever wishes us well. I also ask you to commend my two brothers Hector and Josue to their schoolmaster in trust and also to convey my friendly greetings and service to the schoolmaster, should the occasion arise. With this, they are commended to God the Lord.</p>
      <p>Given at Chiavenna on the 17th of March, 1560.</p>
      <p>I have written in haste, so please take it in good part.</p>
      <p>Please greet for me the reverend elders Vermilius and Occhino, and also commend me to the distinguished man and my very dear friend Mr. Rodolphus Walther and Mr. Frisius, my equally esteemed friend. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Friedrich von Salis. To the most distinguished and illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed and revered lord. In Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my especially dear lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
