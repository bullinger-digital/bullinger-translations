    <p xml:id="regest1">In order to respond to the request made at the meeting in Basel by the people of Strasbourg and Constance to amend the [First Helvetic] Confession or to join the [Four Cities] Confession, prior consultation would have been necessary, but Myconius also did not write anything about it; although it has now been declared that nothing in the Confession will be changed without the knowledge of the other churches, the question of agreement with the Strasbourg doctrine of the Lord's Supper was not clearly answered. [The people of Freiburg] are causing difficulties for Bern, as they disapprove of the subjugation of Lausanne, but Bern knows it is in the right against the bishop [SÃ©bastien de Montfalcon]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Since at the recent assembly in Basel, dearest Bullinger, it was requested by the people of Strasbourg and Constance that we either change the wording of our confession or fully align with the one presented to the Emperor at Augsburg, it was indeed quite negligent on our part that we did not first confirm among ourselves what we would respond before the assembly in Basel reconvened, so that we would be of one voice and mind. Myconius also did not mention a word about this in all his writings to me in the meantime. We are questioned on two matters: one, whether the substance of the matter - I speak of the Lord's Supper - agrees between us and the people of Strasbourg or not, and the other, whether the wording of our confession can be changed without the loss of our church or not. Wouldn't a warning have been necessary here, brothers? - what should I say? A prejudice. Do you not know that the people of Strasbourg are in consultation with us? But no one says anything. But what about us? We responded that we would change nothing without the knowledge of the other churches, and as for the agreement on the matter, it remains ambiguous, with both sides' names intact.</p>
      <p>Our neighbors are constantly plotting something, I don't know what, to cause trouble for us or themselves. It bothers them that the people of Lausanne, who have been under episcopal rule until now, have surrendered to us. However, this was not done by our people without reason. For they say that the bishop is largely the cause of the war undertaken. Otherwise, by the grace of God, we are so eager for peace that we would hardly undertake war against anyone unless repeatedly offended and provoked by injustice. So far from it, that having gained victory or, to put it more favorably, having a successful outcome of the war, we become arrogant. For no one does not humbly recognize that the matter and hand of the Lord were involved.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, 16th of April, year 36.</p>
      <p>Greet the guardian, Deodorus, Pellican, Steiner, all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Your Megander.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich, his dearest brother in the Lord. Bullinger.</p>
