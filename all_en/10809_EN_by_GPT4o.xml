      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>We commend to you, dearest brothers, the cause of this excellent man, which he himself will explain to you. He is worthy of receiving a favor. He is the scribe of Winterthur, pious and a friend to the good. He has a just and good cause. Whatever you do for him, I will consider it done for me. For I love the man sincerely for his unique integrity. You have senators known to you; to them, you will commend his cause. If in any way I can repay the favor, I am entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 22, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the lords Oswald Myconius and Markus BÃ¤r, dearest brothers, doctors of the church of Basel.</p>
