      <p>Dear son. When you write to our Hans Rudolf, thank him sincerely for the seedlings and greet him and his people from me and all of us. No one has come from Strasbourg yet who has brought me a letter; I have no news. However, if I send him news, he should take better care. The previous one was copied by St√§heli's hand. But I still have nothing else to know than that the last one is my hand and namely a sheet therein about the king's death, precedents and consequences, etc.</p>
      <p>The other document, also in my hand, was about Rome and Venice. So there are two documents, on which he may reflect, whether he received them; I would like them to be returned to me, etc. If not, then it is nothing. Remind him about our tenant, that Lorenz should not become a cellarer; he is a man of much wine and a costly worker regarding expenses, etc. If you wish, send him the note.</p>
