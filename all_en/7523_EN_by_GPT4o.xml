      <p>Greetings. At last, I am sending the theses on excommunication, revised by the author himself, reverend and most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, so that they may be joined with their defense. Recently, our doctor Sulcerus told me that Beza, in his letters to him, threatened to attack the theses in a publicly published writing. If he does so, the die will be cast.</p>
      <p>I am amazed that a man takes so much upon himself and sharpens his pen against those who, without insult, dissent from him in a single point of heavenly doctrine and propose their ideas to others for approval so many times. Your excellence will find the history of this dissension described in the preface. Although I see that truth is often obscured or lost through excessive argument, I hope that this diversity and contention of minds and plans will lead to the glory of God and the assertion of truth, and I pray that it may be so.</p>
      <p>I pray for the salvation of your excellence and all your colleagues from Christ the Savior.</p>
      <p>Written in Rötteln, July 8.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Johann Jakob Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in wisdom, virtue, and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Zürich church, his lord and esteemed friend.</p>
