    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Schuler could not gather from Bullinger's last letter of September 25 [not received] how kindly the latter is disposed towards him and his family. He is grateful to God (who has never abandoned him in his fears) for this. He is also grateful to Bullinger, but this time he can only express his thanks in a limited and inadequate way. Bullinger (who has thereby fulfilled the will of God) has rendered him (who is grateful to God for this) an important service [with his treatise "Contra scandala ex bello infeliciter gesto oborta Apologia"], through which God has done him good. He has heard the pleas of his distressed church in Memmingen [by preventing the stationing of an imperial troop in the city] and has also greatly encouraged him through Bullinger's [treatise].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Schuler's wife [..., née Lübegger] as well as his whole family are doing well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The church entrusted to him prays incessantly and counts on God's help. The Papists envy the Memmingen [Protestants] greatly for the (in their opinion uncertain) fortune that God grants them in these turbulent times. They try by all means to impose the mass trade on the Memmingen people, while they pray to God with all their might to avert this. The letter carrier [...] will convey everything that has been entrusted to him by Schuler.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Schuler's wife wishes Bullinger and his family all the best. She intends to reciprocate for the kindness shown.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings from Mayor Balthasar Funk, from the doctor and Schuler's patron Ulrich Wolfhart, and from all the pastoral colleagues, to whom Bullinger's treatise is very useful. God protect Bullinger and his loved ones! He should continue to be touched by Schuler's distress and pray for him and the Memmingen church.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus, our Savior. Venerable brother, I received your recent letter dated September 25, in which you expressed your most favorable disposition towards me and my entire family. For this, I thank my God, who has never abandoned me in such anxieties, and then I thank you, not as much as I owe, but as much as I can for the time being, for the obedience (support) you have shown me, who, by the grace given to you by God, have served me so well, that you have obeyed Him who has favored me through your ministry. The Lord here in Memmingen has heard the prayers of His afflicted church. Through your ministry, He has greatly consoled me.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As for my wife and family, everything is well by God's grace.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The church entrusted to me is in constant prayer, awaiting the Lord's help. The Papists greatly envy us for this uncertain (in the opinion of the enemy) happiness, which we enjoy through the Lord in such turbulent times. Hence, they direct all their efforts to impose at least the mass trade on us. We pray against it with all our might. You will receive the rest from the bearer of this letter, to whom I have entrusted my report.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>My wife prays for all happiness in the Lord for you and your family and expresses her deepest gratitude for your kindness towards us. She intends to reciprocate this readiness of spirit towards us, if ever possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Mayor Balthasar Funk, Doctor and Patron Ulrich Wolfhart, and the entire assembly of pastoral colleagues greet you, who rejoice greatly in being aided by your writings in the service of the church. May the dear God protect you and yours, dear brother. Let my tears go to your heart with this letter, and pray for the church in Memmingen and me, your dear brother, etc. Given in Memmingen, the first of October, in the year 1547. Yours, Gervasius, your friend indeed.</p>
      <p>To my most illustrious and old friend and lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, etc.</p>
