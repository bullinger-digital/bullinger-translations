    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller has been ready to leave [Augsburg] for some time. However, there has not yet been a suitable opportunity to be bid farewell [by the Augsburg authorities]. He does not know what the hold-up is this time. Hans Welser had promised him so much, as Haller had already reported in the letter [No. 2978] delivered by the official [Zurich] messenger [Andreas Müller]. Given the current situation, he will insist on his release. Even the city clerk Georg Frölich no longer advises against it. Therefore, Haller will depart at the first opportunity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Last Sunday [September 18], Emperor Charles V, with a splendid entourage and accompanied by the imperial estates, especially the electors, went to the Cathedral of Our Lady. Elector Palatine Frederick II, Elector Maurice of Saxony, and the young Margrave [Johann Georg] of Brandenburg (the older Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg is not present) were forced to attend the mass after having attended the evangelical sermon. How far these miserable princes have come! And if they have given in, people of lesser status will follow their example. Haller is completely discouraged!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] At the Imperial Diet, the princes and estates are still debating the question of faith. However, the envoys of the imperial cities are hardly consulted. Only when the princes have made a decision will they present it to the cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Emperor has written to Pope Paul III regarding a new council to be held in Trent. He himself wants to preside over it and hear both sides. The Pope will probably never give him his consent! And if he did, nothing good could be expected from the Emperor, even though many foolish people have high hopes for him [for the Protestants], as he has so far tried to create this false impression. But Haller is not misled, especially since the Emperor is always surrounded by 6, 8, 12, and even more bishops (not to mention the lower-ranking priests), whose evil nature is not hidden from him. Nevertheless, he entrusts them with his soul and his frail, half-dead body, so that they do not harm him and continue to revere him. Moreover, his confessor [Pedro de Soto], to whom he is completely devoted, is a very wicked scoundrel. And can anything good be expected from Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, from Fernando Álvarez, Duke of Alba, and the others? Yesterday, the Emperor went hunting in Bavaria for 14 days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Since he wrote to the Pope, something unprecedented has happened that could ignite a new war. On September 10, the illegitimate son of the Pope, Pier Luigi Farnese, was murdered in Piacenza by nobles who had conspired against him due to his cruel tyranny (this powerful and well-fortified city lies on the border with the Duchy of Milan). When the murder became known, the citizens shouted: "Rule! Rule!" and a messenger [...] was sent to Ferrante Gonzaga, the governor of Milan, who took the city for the Emperor with 3000 men on the third (others say the second) day thereafter. When the papal forces learned of this, they stationed a garrison in the city of Parma (which had also been under the rule of the murdered man). On September 14, the news was delivered to the Emperor. Everyone believes that the consequences of the Schmalkaldic War will be the downfall of the Pope, the mastermind of this war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The maritime and Hanseatic cities, with the exception of Hamburg, have not surrendered. They are said to have allied again and repelled Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who wanted to reclaim his territory, in a battle. This was reported yesterday by a trustworthy man [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Myconius wrote from Basel that an envoy [...] of the Emperor was in Zurich, but the entirety of the Confederates has not yet been informed about the purpose of this embassy. Doctor Wolfgang [Wissenburg] wrote to Sixt Birck that the Emperor wants to form an alliance with the Confederates. There lurks hidden danger, especially since there is much talk in Augsburg about war preparations against the Confederates! The Emperor is said to be moving artillery close to them. Hopefully, the Confederates do not trust him, but God alone! For it is certain that all the Emperor's men take offense at the freedom of the Confederates, just as they do at the freedom of everyone else.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Therefore, Haller no longer wants to stay in Augsburg, where he is forced to swallow sharp hostilities!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] As he heard, the people of Constance are trying to achieve such a fair peace that the haughty Emperor will certainly never grant them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Haller wanted to share this with this opportune messenger [...], especially since he knows that Bullinger enjoys his long letters. Haller also finds it pleasant to converse with him in this way. Hopefully, this will soon be possible in person. If a good opportunity for a messenger arises, Bullinger should write again. Haller will not leave Augsburg before October 6.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Greetings, also to the family and colleagues. Birck and Sebastian Lepusculus also send their regards.</p>

      <p>S. Although I have often prepared to leave now, I have not yet found a suitable opportunity. Welser had promised many things, as I wrote through the public messenger, but I do not know what new obstacle has arisen. I see what the situation is; therefore, I will urge them to let me go. Even the city clerk, who had previously resisted somewhat, no longer advises against it. I will seize an honorable opportunity.</p>

      <p>On the last Sunday, the Emperor, with the most magnificent imperial pomp, went to the Marian church, accompanied by all the estates of the empire, especially the electors. The Elector Palatine, Maurice, and the young Margrave of Brandenburg (for the elder is not present) were forced to attend the mass, having previously heard evangelical sermons. How miserable they have become! All other lesser ones will do the same if the princes do it, provided they are commanded. This act has taken away all my hope!</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The article of religion is still being debated. There is much discussion among the estates and princes. The envoys of the cities are not consulted at all. If anything is decided among the princes, it will eventually be referred to them.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Emperor has written to the Pope about holding a new council in Trent, which he himself wants to preside over and hear both sides; something the Pope will never do, nor, if he did, could anything good be expected with him presiding, although many imprudent people promise themselves much from the Emperor's benevolence towards our side, because he has so far dissimulated. But I place no faith in these opinions. For I see how he is surrounded on all sides by priests, whose wickedness he senses, yet, to avoid suffering anything from them or diminishing his reputation, he entrusts his soul and frail, half-dead body to them for care. For I have never seen him without 6, 8, or even 12 bishops with him - I say nothing of the lower ones. Moreover, he has a most wicked scoundrel as a confessor, by whose judgment he is entirely governed. I say nothing of Granvelle, the Duke of Alba, and others, so that I can promise nothing of his goodwill. Yesterday he went hunting in Bavaria. They say he will return within 14 days.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, while he writes to the Pope, something remarkable and a new great foment of war has happened. In Piacenza, Italy, Aloysius, the Pope's illegitimate son, was stabbed on September 10 by some nobles due to his most cruel tyranny. This city is very large and fortified and contiguous to the Duchy of Milan. As soon as the deed was revealed, the citizens shouted: "To the Empire, to the Empire!" A messenger was sent to the governor of Milan, who, on the third day after the deed (others say the second), took this city into the Emperor's faith with three thousand men. Upon learning of this, the papal forces immediately fortified Parma, which was also under the power of the murdered man, with a garrison. On September 14, the news was brought to the Emperor. Everyone now believes that the catastrophe of this war will turn against the Pope, who was its first author.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Cimbrian cities, except for Hamburg, have not surrendered. They are said to have conspired anew and repelled Henry of Brunswick, who was reclaiming his province, in a conflict. A man of good faith told me this yesterday.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Myconius writes to me from Basel that the Emperor's envoy is with you in Zurich, but what he is doing has not yet been reported to the Swiss as a whole. Doctor Wolfgang Xysto writes that he desires to form an alliance with the Swiss. I fear there is a snake hidden in the grass. For many things are commonly spread here about some war preparations against the Swiss; he is said to be moving many cannons to places near the Swiss. I wish the Swiss would not trust him, but trust God alone! For indeed, all the Emperor's men envy their freedom, as they do everyone's.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>This makes me want to stay here less, as I am forced to swallow such bitter insults.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The people of Constance, as I hear, are seeking peace on fair terms, which they will never obtain from that insolent arrogance.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I did not want to keep this from you, as I had an opportune messenger. For I know it is not unpleasant for you if I write much. Indeed, it is also a pleasure for me to converse with you in many ways, which, as I hope, will soon happen in person. I would like you, if you could, to write back conveniently. For I will not leave here before October 6.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Farewell with your family and all the brothers. Xystus and our Lepusculus greet you. Augsburg, September 20, 1547. Yours most devotedly, J. H.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Bullinger, as to his venerable father. Zürich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
