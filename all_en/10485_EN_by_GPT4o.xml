    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to Karlstadt's concerned inquiry, Bullinger assures him: 1. that Ambrosius Blarer is not the author of the WÃ¼rttemberg Concord on the Lord's Supper, but merely brought out the old text to appease Erhard Schnepf, and 2. that he, Bullinger, certainly does not recommend this syncretism to the Church of Zurich. None of the Zurich preachers mention this; rather, they continue to adhere to Zwingli's doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Blarer has also never renounced this doctrine, as his letters show; otherwise, he would not have praised Bullinger's commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians, especially the section on the Lord's Supper, so highly. Someone seems to want to slander the people of Zurich in Basel. He thanks Karlstadt for his friendly admonition and sends him his newly published work "Assertio utriusque in Christo naturae." Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Regarding Blaurer, I cannot help but think well of him, a man in the Lord whom I hold in high regard, as he is both pious and learned, and who has solemnly testified in his most eloquent letters to us that he has not changed his original opinion. He is not the first author of this confession, but he has brought forth a text that was composed long ago by others with a certain plan and has calmed the turbulent nature of Schnepf with this holy art. Now, although I may be somewhat dull, I am not so insane as to publicly promote this syncretism, the occasion and plan of which I am not unaware, and commend it to our church. Believe me, dearest brother, not a word of this has been mentioned by any of us. There are other things that we must instill in our people than imaginary substantialities and quantities. However, when the occasion requires us to discuss the sacred Eucharist, we pass on to our church what was handed down to it from the beginning by the man of holy memory, Huldrych Zwingli, and what I have believed and taught for almost ten years now. Therefore, there is no reason for you or others to fear that we will recant what we have taught well so far. Nor has Blaurer, unless he is completely deceiving and lying in his own letters, retracted anything. Indeed, he recently almost approved our commentaries on Paul to the Corinthians, especially what we have taught about the Eucharist in chapter II. There seems to be some turbulent spirit among you who continually spreads some unfortunate things about the Zurich brothers in Basel. I pray that you do not rashly believe anything about us. In the meantime, I am greatly thankful to you for kindly warning us. I implore you by our common faith to always continue to be of such a mind towards us. For we are yours.</p>
      <p>As a token of our never-dying friendship, I send you what we published on the true divinity and humanity of Christ on October 1st. At the end, you will find some things about the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>Live, farewell, most beloved brother and highly esteemed in Christ by us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with Grynaeus, our Marcus, and your family. My wife, mother, and neighbors wish you well.</p>
      <p>October 4, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger</p>
      <p>To Doctor Andreas Karlstadt, minister of the word among the people of Basel, brother in the Lord, and most venerable and dearly beloved.</p>
