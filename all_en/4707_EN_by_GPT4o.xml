      <p>Greetings. I had written these letters recently, intending to send them through a certain woman; but before I could arrange it, she had already left. Now, however, I am sending them as I had sealed them then; for I have nothing to add to them, except that in the meantime I received yours sent through Samuel Hauser, the minister of our region, along with others sent from Glarus. Our senate also received letters from the faithful of Glarus through the same person.</p>
      <p>They are being responded to through this messenger who carries these letters; I do not fully know what the response will be, but I do know that they are waiting for a response, not wanting to rush, until they can know what the other regions will answer, so that the displeasure may fall less upon them. Moreover, my lords of the middle are also very dissatisfied, and they hear the messengers with much displeasure. Young Lord Niklaus worries about war if they are not accepted; but we worry, I fear, far too much, where we need not worry half as much, and where we should indeed be concerned, there is no one at home. I also hear indirectly that the people of Glarus are being advised not to accept mediation; I think the same is being done by yours. Let us pray to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I expect you to write about the assembly of the princes through this messenger. We have some things that Blaurer wrote, which I also think you have, since you are much closer to him; otherwise, I would send them to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 13.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially Samuel Zehender, who was present with me while I was writing this. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
