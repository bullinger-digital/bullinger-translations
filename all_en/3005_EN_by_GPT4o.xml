      <p>Greetings. Furthermore, excellent men, I do not wish to hide from you that I have sent the present letters along with those enclosed in a sealed... to Frankfurt to Mr. Agninus, my agent there, not through Worms; for I feared that what happened to me at the Easter fair might occur again. There are indeed not a few among us who are pained that I am more inclined towards your church, which is more like mine, than towards their Lutheran church. Therefore, neglecting them, I have chosen a certain pious English exile of Christ (his name is Thomas Cholor), a man learned in Greek and Latin and a preacher of the divine word among the other English exiles with us, not publicly, in a temple assigned to them, as among...; for our Lutherans do not tolerate this, but in private houses, where they gather to hear the words of truth. Few among us are also exiled. This Thomas Cholon, Gualther, esteems and loves you greatly, not without proclaiming your name, asserting that he gained knowledge of your humanity while in England, his native land, and you would not act inhumanely if, when writing to me hereafter (if it happens that I remain in this mortal life for some time), you would add a brief letter to him, indicating that I have been his advocate or recommender with you in this matter. If you do this, it will be most pleasing to me. He, I hope, will be (for he has promised when asked) the one who will stand by me as a comforter when the time comes for me to depart from here. Indeed, my spirit is more inclined towards him than towards our current churchmen, professed disciples of Luther.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, excellent men, my teachers in divine matters to be honored until my last breath, most happily in Christ Jesus. For why should I not uniquely honor you, who labor so faithfully and perseveringly in the Lord's vineyard, despite those who everywhere grumble, who are too sworn to Luther's words in the mystery of the Lord's Supper.</p>
      <p>From Worms, August 31, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours, wholly devoted to your church from the heart, Wolfgang Waidner.</p>
      <p>To the most learned, pious, and distinguished men, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, principal ministers and doctors of the church in Zürich, my lords and divine teachers, to be honored continually and perpetually, etc. In Zürich.</p>
