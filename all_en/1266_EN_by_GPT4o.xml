      <p>I had scarcely closed my previous letters and arranged for them to be delivered to that Italian from Cremona, when yours were delivered to me by this messenger, most esteemed brother Calvin, and indeed they were expected and most welcome. I had expected no other response from you, my brother, than what you have given. For I know that in matters of this kind, which do little to promote piety but much to stir up envy, you have never been difficult. Indeed, in these matters, I desire that the freedom be preserved which I see has flourished in the churches since the very times of the apostles. Our church, if I am not mistaken, had more feast days 12 years ago: but after abolishing these, it retained only the Lord's Day and the feasts of Christ, namely, the Nativity, Circumcision, and Ascension of the Lord. It also added the sending of the Holy Spirit in the previous years for the celebration of the Lord's Supper. However, it abolished other feast days because the neighbors interpreted us as celebrating holidays for the saints. Therefore, to openly profess that we do not worship saints with the worship due only to God, we abolished all of them altogether. There was indeed much debate at the beginning of this innovation, but now there is the utmost tranquility among us.</p>
      <p>It is certain that Mr. Bucer has departed to the Lord in England, and Mr. Hooper has been restored to his bishopric, about which I wrote to you some time ago, if the letters have been delivered to you. I add to this another not joyful news, that our Mr. Vadianus passed away on April 6th, to the great sorrow of the entire city and church of St. Gallen. We are preserved, my brother, for a more severe struggle, which if the Lord involves us in, He will certainly not forsake us. May He provide men so that we may always glorify Him both in confession and doctrine and in our body. If ever the occasion arises, please write. For nothing is more pleasing to me than your letters. Farewell eternally with Gallasius and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 29, 1551.</p>
