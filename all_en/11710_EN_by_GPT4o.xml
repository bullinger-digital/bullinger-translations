    <p xml:id="regest1">Is surprised not to have received a letter from Blarer recently. Therefore, he should send a letter with the messenger upon his return; the messenger is on his way to Memmingen, the reason for which Blarer can gather from the enclosed letter [to Balthasar Funk, No. 1668], which he should forward to Gervasius [Schuler], to whom he should also write, as well as to [Balthasar] Funk regarding this matter; a dispute between [Peter] Kunz and Erasmus [Ritter] about the doctrine of the sacraments was settled by the Bernese, but now the devil has sparked a new conflict; the blasphemer [Adam Heinricher] is a housemate of Kunz, so some suspect that these statements were made with his knowledge; will try to convince Ritter of Kunzâ€™s innocence; encloses the judgment [of the council] about their [Eucharistic] dispute, which Blarer should return. Requests news from the [Imperial Diet at] Nuremberg and the [City Assembly at] Ulm as well as from the war against the Turks, from [Charles V] and [Francis I]; no news from the Swiss troops; a day is set for [October 2] in Baden, where Zurich wants to warn the Swiss Confederates once more [before the military campaign]; fewer soldiers have left Zurich than expected, the people are war-weary; may God help. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am surprised, dearest Ambrosius and most esteemed brother, that I have not received any letters from you for such a long time. Perhaps you are overwhelmed by a multitude of affairs.</p>
      <p>I am sending this messenger to you, who will instruct you to prepare some letters, so that when he returns, he will find them written. He is going to Memmingen; you will understand the reason from the attached copy, which, once you have read it, you should send sealed through this same messenger to our Gervasius. I would also like you to add your letters addressed either to Mr. Gervasius or to Consul Funck, to encourage them to diligently pursue our cause. However, make sure that no one learns anything about this matter. It is certain that a slander is being constructed against an innocent person out of malice and satanic art. There was a certain dispute between Kunz and Erasmus about the sacramental matter; but thanks to the prudence of the senate and the steadfastness of the people of Bern, the disagreement was beautifully resolved and the ministers are in good agreement.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Satan stirs up a new disturbance; for that blasphemer is a housemate of Kunz, hence there are those who suspect that the slander against Erasmus was instigated by the housemate with Kunz's knowledge. I am trying to persuade Erasmus that Kunz is innocent, so that their recently reconciled spirits do not fall back into discord. You have the judgment on their controversy attached to my letters, but make sure to return it through this same messenger.</p>
      <p>If you have any certain news about the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg, the City Assembly at Ulm, the army fighting in Pannonia against the Turks, or about the affairs of the Emperor and the French, let me know. We have not heard a word about the Swiss soldiers. On the Monday after Michaelmas, there will again be a day in Baden; my lords have written out again to negotiate with the Confederates, that they desist, etc. By the grace of God, fewer people have deserted us in all three campaigns than anyone could believe. Our people everywhere are very dissatisfied with the war of the Confederates. May God come to our aid and deliver us from all evil.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours. Bibliander, Megander, Gwalther, Erasmus Fabritius, Pellicanus, and the others send you their most dutiful greetings.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 29, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
