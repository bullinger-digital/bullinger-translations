      <p>S. I have sent you a copy of your advice and opinion through Vergerius along with my letters written to you. The other copy, namely the one from Basel, I immediately gave to a certain messenger to deliver to you as soon as I transcribed it; but behold, he returned it to me these days, asserting and excusing many things; therefore, I am sending it now. We give thanks that you have so kindly informed us of everything.</p>
      <p>We also know that the pestilent Cacus has been consumed by his own smoke and fire; we praise the deed. That Riccius diligently attempts to influence our people; but he has done nothing yet, nor will he accomplish anything (as far as we can see). The Duke of Florence also has an envoy here, as does the Roman Pontiff; however, neither has achieved their desire. Both the papists and those who are ours seem to abhor such envoys. - Furthermore, since shame is said to be useless to a needy man: I have five sons and four daughters; the annual salary is one hundred or slightly less Rhenish gold coins, according to the exact account. Four of my sons are diligently studying under my guidance quite successfully; the fifth is too young to be taught.</p>
      <p>I can barely support everyone at home; at least the eldest must now be sent somewhere, so that he may also hear another teacher at some point, however I can manage it. Certainly, I do not intend to send him to beg, nor is it fitting; for he is over twenty years old. His mother continues to ruin him here, forcing him to act as both servant and maid, in which way he could never freely devote himself to books. Therefore, I beg you, most humane man, to assist me in this matter and see if he can obtain some part of his sustenance there, for I would provide part along with clothing, or modestly recommend him to someone in Basel, when I send him to you in a few weeks; otherwise, I am not so importunate as to wish you to become a troublesome petitioner for me. If anything can be easily done, I ask. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most esteemed man by all good people, and do not cease to love your Philippus. Father Comander, Haimius worn out by age, Tschernerus, and Pontisella greet you. From Chur, on the 20th of November, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your humane Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most esteemed by all good people.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
