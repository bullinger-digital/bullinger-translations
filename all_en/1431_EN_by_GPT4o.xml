      <p>Most illustrious man, I received yesterday your letter, in which you extensively thanked me for that most vile book, which I had sent. What would you have done if it had been a good one? But I know the disposition of your mind. Now I cannot write more and respond to other matters; but I will do this shortly. I am expecting the messenger, whom I sent, etc. I hear that Parma is again under a more severe siege with three thousand foot soldiers sent by the Duke of the Florentines and that Mirandola is also under pressure. Wars, dreadful wars, and I see Italy, indeed all of Europe, foaming with much blood. Read the king's protestation regarding the council; for I am sending it. It was more pleasant to me than I can write, what you wrote about Morosino.</p>
      <p>I commend my nephews to you. Farewell and expect a personal messenger from me shortly. Greetings to you and all the brothers. Vicosoprano, 10th of October, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>[To] H[einrich] Bullinger.</p>
