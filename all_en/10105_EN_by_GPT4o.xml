      <p>Greetings. I am sending back what you had entrusted, dearest Huldrych [Zwingli], through our most faithful messenger Rhellikan, to whom I beseech you by Christ, if you have compiled anything on the Epistle to the Romans, as I have no doubt, to entrust and commend it to my care for one month. Everything will return to you safely without recall.</p>
      <p>Moreover, when you come across the responses on predestination, also add your judgment on the salvation of children from Christian parents, which I find most certain in Zwingli's treatise "On Providence." There I confess either my ignorance, in which I do not understand what the man of God left behind, or my disbelief, as I see that it does not satisfy me or other brothers. For I do not consider the salvation of all of them as certain, without falling under predestination, which Paul seems to prove by the example of Jacob and Esau, Romans 9 [11-13]. Even if they die before reaching adulthood and have not transgressed the law in deed, yet the source and origin of all rebellion is inherent in them, so that they are no less called children of wrath than adults, already gathering the wrath of the Lord upon themselves. That this is washed away by the merit of Christ can only happen through predestination, and indeed it is free for all. For salvation obtained through Christ is dispensed only to the elect; but that all children of Christians, even believers, are saved without any distinction when they are absorbed by death before adulthood, I do not hold as true, or I do not understand, or I believe wrongly. I would rather, if I encountered such a matter in a sermon, be less wise than more than necessary and commit it to the judgment and goodness of the Lord. Therefore, do not leave me in suspense on this matter, dearest brother, and while it is possible, send sealed letters through our Rhellikan returning from his to us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, never forgetful of me, and continue with the Epistle to the Hebrews as you have begun. Certainly, without flattery, I will tell you: What comes from your workshop pleases our ministers so much that it will not be long before it is sold by Christoph. However, I would advise, for those unskilled in languages, to render any inserted words explained in Latin, and not to do anything rashly, that is, at any importunate insistence of the printer, lest your youth, already known and celebrated throughout the world for God's gifts, be made more contemptible by your own fault. For you see how anxiously the printers urge and care for their own, however one may consider what is offered to the judgment of the world.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell. And how long will we wait for the Hebrews? Spur on Pellican to continue returning his own, as he has begun, and greet the man, Leo, Karlstadt, whose company I would greatly desire. But scarcely is it permitted to leave the city due to the bulk of my body, though I greatly desire to visit you.</p>
      <p>March 16.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>When I wrote this, I thought Rhellikan would visit you, but he postponed his journey due to the stormy weather until the Easter holidays. However, the rumor that a papist Mass has already been obtained in your city to be observed, which our people would not have obtained so quickly if it were so, but would have maintained. Therefore, our council advises yours never to admit it. I did not want to believe it, nor did many of us, but we urged friends to send letters, so that on whatever occasion these matters might return to themselves. If such a thing ever happened, as Satan leaves nothing untried, I beseech you, write with your own messenger, and I will urge what I can. Meanwhile, act with your private ones, so that they may also respond more heartily and demand that nothing be changed on either side in the matters of religion without the knowledge and conversation of the other. If you make a big bet on both sides: before a year passes, there must be a Mass again in Zurich and Bern.</p>
      <p>Regarding a certain pamphlet from Lucerne about the war composed in rhymes, the magistrate wrote to Lucerne. He also sent to Bremgarten to investigate whether they are compelled by fine or command to confess, hear Mass, etc. If even a few of yours would support themselves, it would be a comfort to the citizens of your homeland.</p>
      <p>March 17.</p>
      <p>Having read, I began to lie down with gout and have not yet recovered; I await God. Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>March 22.</p>
      <p>Write and console me, the sick one.</p>
      <p>The same, your most devoted Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
