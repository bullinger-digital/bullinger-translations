      <p>To Peter Simler, dearest brother, Heinrich Bullinger sends grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>After I had long deliberated with myself to whom I should dedicate this little work of ours, which is about the weeks of Daniel, your singular friendship towards me, dearest Peter, and your pious spirit, so thirsty for sacred matters, finally commanded that I offer this endeavor of ours to you alone, as a token of gratitude and mutual service. Therefore, read our effort in this arduous matter more diligently, and you will understand the mystery of our Lord Jesus Christ much more clearly and much more evidently than ever before.</p>
      <p>For this passage of the prophet is so clearly explained and firm that I do not know if any other can be compared to it. You will understand and confess yourself that what has been handed down by the apostles about faith in the Lord Jesus, the true God and man, is most certain. Therefore, read with a pious spirit in Christ Jesus, and together with Wolfgang Joner and Werner Steiner, and indeed with other brothers in the Lord, enjoy this labor of ours, live and farewell.</p>
      <p>In Bremgarten, February 18, in the year of the world's redemption 1530.</p>
