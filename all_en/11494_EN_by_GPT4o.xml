    <p xml:id="regest1">Denies that Bucer, in a letter to him [BucerDS VIII, No. 8], spoke ill of Bullinger, as he heard from the Chur treasurer, who was with Bullinger in the autumn; Bucer only complained that Bullinger had attacked him in the [dedication] letter to Johannes Travers [No. 1303]. The letter bearer, a baptized Jew, a modest, poor man, stayed in Chur for a month but could not find a livelihood here; Comander asks Bullinger to assist him further. Johannes Blasius and Nikolaus [Pfister, known as] Baling send greetings and, together with him, request news about the religious discussion in Worms.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. The treasurer of our city recently told me, most esteemed Bullinger, that when he was in Zurich last autumn, he was treated with great kindness by you, and during the conversation, you also remembered me, specifically in the context that Bucer had sent me some letters in which he somewhat criticized you, etc. It is true, he sent me letters in which he described at length the obscurities of Luther and his own regarding the Eucharist, evidently trying to bring me over to their opinion. In those letters, he mentions Bullinger only to the extent that he complains that in the letter to Lord Johannes Travers, you criticized him more harshly than he had hoped. Beyond that, he does not harm you or your writings with any word; for if he had written such a thing to me, I would not have concealed it from you. Moreover, the bearer of the present letter, a Jew by birth but converted to Christ, a man of humble and patient mind as it seems to me, indeed worthy in my judgment of receiving benefits according to his need, who is now pressed by extreme poverty, is coming to you with my letters of recommendation, so that he might at least have the opportunity to approach you. He was with us in Chur for one month; but when it became clear to him that he could not live or earn a living with us, he decided to come to you. May you assist him for Christ's sake or promote him with your recommendation. Farewell. From the ancient court of Rhaetia, on the Nones of January 41. Johannes Blasius and Nikolaus Balingius, my fellow brothers, greet you very much, and together with me, they request that you deign to inform us about the Worms assembly and its proceedings. Yours sincerely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the most illustrious church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed friend.</p>
