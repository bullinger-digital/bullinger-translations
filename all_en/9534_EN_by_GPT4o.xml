      <p>To Scipione Lentolo, minister of the church in Chiavenna, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>You ask me, dearest Lentolo, what I think of that book of yours, which you recently wrote against a certain critic, and whether I consider it worthy to be printed and presented to the church for reading. Indeed, I have read your book, and what I found in it is certainly such that it seems entirely worthy of the light and should be shared with many. For certain chapters are discussed in it, which are as useful as they are necessary for our age to know: and they are discussed by you skillfully and clearly, plainly and with no inappropriate order. I touch on this sparingly, lest I seem to speak out of favor due to my affection for you, whom I love greatly.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May God bless you and your family. Zürich, in the month of January, in the year of our Lord 1574.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich. The End.</p>
