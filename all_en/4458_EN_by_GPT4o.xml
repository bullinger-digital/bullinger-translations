      <p>[...] peace and treaties.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I received your letter yesterday, illustrious and most esteemed sir, which you wrote from Baden during the public assembly of the Swiss, from which I understood that serious disturbances have arisen in the kingdom of France, and that they are directly aimed at the destruction of the most Christian king himself and all his princes. Certainly, I read this not without pain, believe me: especially since here too the rumor spreads that the disturbances there are mainly caused by those who are called evangelicals. Added to this is what I also gather from your letters: that leading men suspect that such disturbances were first stirred up in the Genevan church by ministers, and then inspired into the neighboring kingdom of France. Indeed, I heard something of this even a few months ago: for which reason I then wrote to Mr. Johannes Calvin and Mr. Theodor Beza, my dearest brothers, that it did not seem credible to me what the rumor spreads, that the Genevan preachers incite the minds of some in France, otherwise perhaps too prone to stir up movements, since I hope far better things of them. For I am very displeased with disturbances in the matter of religion, since the true religion of Christ is neither established by disturbances nor preserved by them, but rather is dissipated and rendered infamous. Indeed, true religion prohibits disturbances, but commands holy obedience and tranquility, according to those most excellent sayings of the blessed apostles of Christ, of whom blessed Peter says: Be subject to every human ordinance for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as supreme, or to governors as those sent by him, for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good: for this is the will of God, that by doing good you may silence the ignorance of foolish men, as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as servants of God. And Saint Paul: I exhort first of all, he says, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty, etc. Moreover, a few days ago, and in this very month, Calvin, my beloved brother, wrote to me from Geneva among other things: About the disturbances in France, he says, I do not doubt that many and various rumors are circulating there as almost everywhere. What the majority are doing, I do not know; what many hope for, it is not worth writing, lest I involve myself in their foolishness. Would I incite anyone in France to seditions against the king? On the contrary, unless I had intervened, many regions would be burning with a horrible fire. Believe me, our efforts are directed towards ensuring that our people, that is, the people of the Christian religion, do not cause disturbances.</p>
      <p>So far we have made some progress; the events of future times are in the hand of God. Meanwhile, excessive confidence carries everyone away; for what we have always forbidden, they occupy temples or preach in public places. Our brothers excuse this to us, saying they are dragged unwillingly or compelled by necessity, since no private house can accommodate four thousand people. So far I have faithfully recounted Calvin's words; indeed, I am sending you a copy of the letter, but on the condition that it is certainly returned. From which you can easily gather that the Genevans are unjustly burdened with that grave suspicion of some, as if they are the instigators of the disturbances, who are the authors of these French movements. It happens perhaps to the Genevan republic, as it now also happens to the most honorable magistracy of the city of Zürich, which, although it is most observant of peace, tranquility, and all honesty, cannot avoid that virulent and slanderous tongues try to persuade even the highest princes of very different things about it. What do you want, my lord! If some complain to the most Christian king of France or to other princes that the most honorable magistracy of the Zürich republic is making a clandestine expedition, by which it suddenly attacks any nations, let alone its allies or confederates, and forces them to accept its, that is, the evangelical religion, they report things as false as those who most impudently invent the most vain things.</p>
      <p>For you, illustrious sir, must be most convinced that nothing is more alien to the most honorable magistracy of the Zürich republic than wars; it most sacredly cultivates and preserves both peace and treaties; and there are no schisms in the church. There is the greatest concord among all and more abundant peace than ever was, while our people followed the Roman religion. It abhors treacherous plans and clandestine attempts with all its heart; its integrity is known to all neighboring regions.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it reformed the church, but in such a way that it inflicted no injury on anyone; ecclesiastical goods are still intact, they have not been plundered and are justly dispensed, as I once explained to your piety. Furthermore, it clearly understands with its prudence that the matter of religion is not to be promoted by arms, unjust arms, so that it may proceed successfully, please God, and be stable or enduring. It endures many unworthy things even from its own people for no other purpose than to keep peace whole and entire, and to cut off all occasions for disturbances and movements.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I cannot deny that all things pertaining to waging war are most well-prepared by them, and indeed not for waging war on anyone, but if it is unjustly waged by others, to justly repel it. For there are those who behave most insolently and continually threaten that, with aid gathered from everywhere, they will wage war on our people, so that they may suddenly oppress them and root out our religion, which they contemptuously call heretical.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, our people always and seriously seek the things that are of peace, constantly affirming that they are willing to give an account of their religion wherever it is fair, and thus they submit themselves to God, their only protector, and commend all events to Him, praying without ceasing that He may bless them. But why do I explain these things to you, my most esteemed lord, at such length, since you yourself, taught by long experience (for you have long served as an orator and envoy to the Swiss), know all these things more correctly and are well aware that there is no other republic among all the Swiss orders that is more devoted to peace, tranquility, and all honesty than Zürich. Therefore, it will be your duty of integrity to testify freely to those among whom you know these things to be most necessary, so that they are not ignorant, and to testify nothing other than what you know to be most certain, lest the shameless malice of slanderers cause harm to those who have deserved no ill. May your humanity take these things in good part, I pray, and hold me in your commendation.</p>
      <p>Farewell, illustrious sir and most esteemed lord. May the Lord Jesus bless you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 16th September 1560.</p>
      <p>Devoted to your humanity, Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich, etc. So that T... may see how we are alien to sects and heresies, behold, I send to you a book written by me against heresies, etc. To the illustrious man Mr. Matthieu Coignet, orator and envoy of the most Christian king of the French to the Swiss, his most esteemed lord. Solothurn.</p>
