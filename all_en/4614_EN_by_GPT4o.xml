      <p>Greetings. There is nothing for me to write to you except the wish for a most prosperous year and the abundance of the Lord's gifts. The assembly of all of France has been postponed to the month of May.</p>
      <p>The bull seems to be an illusion and the continuation is not pleasing. I pray that you send me a copy of what you wrote to the Bishop of Rennes and what you intended to write more extensively when I was in Zürich.</p>
      <p>I do not think that those whom you fear will become what is called "do-it-all"; for it seems to me that the Lord wishes to be present in France and to illuminate it and spread His light more widely. When it pleases Him, He awakens the lazy, the inert, and the sleeping, so that His power may be more fully exerted.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that Philip wanted to send Spaniards into the territories of the King of Navarre. All the soldiers have been dismissed from the retinue of the King of France.</p>
      <p>We will soon hear what the Lord, speaking peace to His own, will do. If you have any news, please write.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends, especially the most honorable council. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, January 3rd.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
