    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] When the servant [...] of Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard [from Konstanz] returned to Zürich, the Count had already departed the day before. He had been urgently recalled to Basel by Duke Christoph of Württemberg. Count Georg had an extensive conversation with Bullinger about the reconciliation in the contentious religious matters. He also mentioned that Melanchthon would be coming to Tübingen, and he hoped for good things from him, especially since the latter has always disapproved of Luther's quarrelsome spirit. He also expressed hope for a reconciliation between Melanchthon and the people of Zürich. Due to the Count's premature departure, Bullinger does not know what news Blarer conveyed to the Count, as the absent one could no longer inform him about it. Therefore, Blarer should also convey to Bullinger what he has learned from friends.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] There is a strange rumor that Spaniards can ride through Konstanz unhindered! Particularly one [...] is said to have galloped through the city when Jakob Zorn grabbed the horse's bridle, which, however, remained in his hands. Bullinger can hardly believe that the people of Konstanz are not more vigilant!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He has nothing further to report, except that righteous people fear that the cunning Emperor Charles V might eventually smuggle soldiers into the city to launch a night attack. So, be cautious!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger does not know why Count Georg departed so quickly. He was treated very kindly. Some suspect that he might have reconciled with the Emperor again. Others, however, suspect another reason. As soon as Bullinger learns something verified about it, he will report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings. In haste.</p>

      <p>Greetings. When the servant of the Count returned here, dearest Ambrosius, the Count had already departed the day before. He was urgently recalled to Basel by Duke Christoph. He discussed many things with me about the agreement in doctrine. He indicated that Melanchthon would be coming to Tübingen. He hopes well of him, especially since he has always disapproved of that quarrelsome spirit of Mr. Luther. He hopes that he will return to grace with us. Therefore, I do not know what new things you have written to him. Nothing could be communicated by the absent one. I therefore ask that you also share with me what you have from friends.</p>

      <p>There is a strange rumor about how the Spaniards ride into the city, especially one who galloped through the city, when Jakob Zorn grabbed the bridle, a piece of the bridle remained in his hands. I can hardly believe that people are not more vigilant, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I cannot inform you further, except that righteous people are concerned. How quickly the Emperor might secretly bring people into the city and launch a night attack. Therefore, I urge you to be diligently watchful.</p>

      <p>Why the Count departed so hastily, we do not know. He was treated very kindly here. Some suspect that he might be reconciled with the Emperor again; others suspect another reason. When I have something certain, I will write diligently.</p>

      <p>Farewell with all good things. Zürich, very quickly, 16th of September, 1547. Your Bullinger.</p>
