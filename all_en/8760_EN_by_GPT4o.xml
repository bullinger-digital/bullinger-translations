      <p>S. Although our Telamonian Samuel can inform you about all our affairs, both public and private, I did not want to miss the opportunity to write something myself through him, at least so that I do not seem to have neglected my duty. Indeed, I am once again troubled by both gout and hand pain, making it difficult for me to write; but the strength of my love for you easily overcomes these pains, which, although sometimes quite severe, have not yet confined me to bed by the grace of the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am indeed expecting your letters and am surprised that you have not written for such a long time; however, I suspect this is due to a shortage of messengers. I recently wrote about some rumors we had received from France; however, these have subsided, as I hear, with the king asserting his authority everywhere to maintain peace.</p>
      <p>Since then, other rumors have spread, which, however, do not deserve belief and therefore not writing. It is certain that the Duke of Savoy fears the Admiral, lest he should plot something against him with the Genevans, and he could not hide this fear from our people; but it is typical of tyrants to always be afraid. However, it would not be surprising if the patience of the Genevans, having been offended so many times, finally erupts into fury, so that he does not seem to fear in vain. There is nothing to write about Swiss affairs, as they are better known to you. Why is it not allowed for the people of the Unterwalden to devour the Turk? I hear assemblies have been convened for this purpose; we will wait to see what they bring.</p>
      <p>We are still dealing with the high cost of grain; I wish it would end soon. If there is anything else, you can ask our messenger here, who, being with me daily, can report everything.</p>
      <p>The consuls, treasurers, Diesbach, my father-in-law, wife, and all friends send you many greetings; extend my greetings to yours as well, among whom I also count all the brothers, most dutifully from me.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 29, 1572.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and beloved man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
