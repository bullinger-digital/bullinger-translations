      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>This man is faithful, our singular friend, to whom you can safely entrust anything you have.</p>
      <p>Our delegates, sent to Baden, were diligently instructed to sincerely accept anything offered by you or the Bernese. I hope a strong friendship will develop between them, provided your people are not deterred by the deceit of certain impious individuals.</p>
      <p>Our affairs otherwise are not in a bad state. If you have any certain news from Strasbourg or Augsburg, or from the French or Italian front, let me know, if it is worth knowing.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and remember us in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 17, 1534.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the people of Basel, dearest brother.</p>
