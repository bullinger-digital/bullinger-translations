    <p xml:id="regest1">Greetings for the New Year. Writes to both together, as [Johann] Walder is about to depart shortly. He has only come to truly appreciate the unity that prevails among the Zurich pastors since he himself has suffered under discord. From his colleague [Karlstadt]'s refusal to publicly rebuke vices, a deep division has arisen in the congregation, as Karlstadt managed to make himself popular while Myconius fell into disrepute. The people of Zurich are only partially informed; even if they may have learned more about the conflict with the university through [Georg Müller], they do not know what is currently happening in the Basel church. All these evils have the same source: For example, when Myconius warned in a sermon against the mixing of spiritual and secular office, his opponent immediately granted the authorities the right to make prescriptions to the clergy - citing the kings of Judah; through this stance, which appeals to the council, he has enabled the change of the synodal and ban order; Johannes [Lüthard] has reported this to Pellikan. He asks for their intercession; the letter is to be burned. Greetings.</p>

      <p>May this new year be happy and prosperous for you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dearest brothers, I wanted to greet you both with one letter, as there was no time to write to each of you individually. It was announced in the evening that Walder is about to leave for you, intending to set out on his journey the day after tomorrow after lunch.</p>
      <p>I often think about the happiness of your church, because those who lead it so greatly foster harmony that there is not even the slightest appearance of discord. As a result, the entire church is maintained in such a happy state that neither the force nor the multitude of the impious can disturb it. What advantages, what tranquility of pious minds, what fruits of piety, what progress of letters, I dare say I know better in these times than you, who enjoy those benefits. The reason is that, not so long ago, I was in a similar state, but now I am forced to endure the opposite, from which I now better understand what sweetness of life and of my entire fortune and church was then. Hence, nothing but pain, groans, complaints, no joy of life, no studies, no doctrine, as even a small beginning of discord has devastated everything. I will tell you, as to my closest friends, what happened.</p>
      <p>You know how necessary it is to correct vices in the church, where there are both good and bad. While we wanted to impose this same duty, as was fitting, on one of us, he resisted so much that he shouted he did not want to be taught by us. Therefore, he pursued so diligently what he refused, as he is naturally inclined to seek the favor of the people.</p>
      <p>He soon achieved that he obtained the name of good, gentle, and peaceful among all, while I, on the other hand, was seen as harsh, cruel, and almost tumultuous, as if nothing was right, nothing was straightforward for me. In this way, the people were divided no differently than schoolboys, while one follows the gentle teacher, another prefers the one using the rod. Now, when my colleague sensed the favor, the gathering, the praise prepared from the sweetness of his sermons, he flatters so much that you would believe he swore to speak pleasing things henceforth. This was indeed the beginning; how many evils then arose cannot be briefly told.</p>
      <p>You know part of it, my dear Bullinger, from me, but in such a way that you do not know; part you all know from Mr. Grynaeus. But I know you still do not know the whole matter, unless you have received from the old abbot of Wettingen what has been done between us and the university; for I hear someone from here sent him everything, even what we still do not know. Meanwhile, however, you do not know what has overthrown the church, you do not know the appearance of the church, you do not know that some would gladly bind the word, about which I would prefer to speak in person, if I could, rather than through letters.</p>
      <p>All these things, and whatever displeases me, have that one as their defender. An example: A few days ago, I spoke about the distinction between ecclesiastical power and secular power. Among other things, I explained that it is not permissible for offices to be mixed; otherwise, what we saw in the papacy and what the Anabaptists attempted would happen. He immediately shouted from the pulpit that it is permissible for the senate to prescribe to the priests; for even the kings of Judah prescribed to their priests, not noticing that they did not prescribe but commended them to act according to the law of the Lord, just as our magistrates commend us to preach the gospel, etc. From this claw, recognize the lion. Because what he says pertains to the council's advice, I succumb, and all my people with me. Hence the change of the synod, the prescription of excommunication, and all that has been published against us by public decree. Brother Johannes Minorita wrote about these things to Pellican.</p>
      <p>You see the source of the evils, which I have indicated more willingly, so that you may see by example what you have long known abundantly. Understanding, therefore, how miserable we are, you will pray to the Lord for us, I ask, and dedicate letters to Vulcan.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your wives and children. In Basel, hastily, on the calends of January, in the year 40.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger and Mr. Theodor Bibliander, his in the Lord.</p>
