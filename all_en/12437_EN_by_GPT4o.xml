    <p xml:id="regest1">A Lasco feels compelled, due to his heavy workload, to respond to both recipients with a single letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He has been forced to resign from his bishopric due to the [Emden] authorities and the godlessness of some brothers. The authorities refused to recognize him with the title of Inspector and prohibited him from applying any form of church discipline to "non-pastors." Since a Lasco could not exercise his episcopal office according to the prescriptions of Christ, he resigned from it. However, he retained his city parish office, which he would only give up in the event of his expulsion. At present, it seems very likely! For the Burgundian [imperial] court is doing everything to expel him, especially as a Sacramentarian, since he can no longer be suspected of Anabaptism.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Unfortunately, he did not meet Bucer in Heidelberg. However, both had repeatedly exchanged letters about the Lord's Supper. There is no great disagreement between them. While a Lasco regards all sacraments as [expressions of God's] confirmation [towards humans] (obsignatio), Bucer adds the offering (exhibitio) of heavenly [gifts]. Since these are received by faith in Bucer's view anyway, a Lasco can agree with Bucer. He further recognizes in the Lord's Supper a sacramental communion with Christ's body and blood, created through faith. Now that Luther has died, it is expected that an agreement will be reached in the remaining [disagreements] as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- It is astonishing that Luther, who was highly deserving of the church, went so astray in the matter of the [Lord's Supper]! This reminds us that we are only [erring] humans who must not rely on human power but solely on the foundation [of Christ], as Luther did.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Certainly, he was the first in our century to highlight the doctrine of justification through Christ in a wonderful and excellent way. Even children were made aware of the confused [worship] invented by the Antichrist and recognized by almost the entire world. Luther also restored countless churches and opposed the opponents of the Gospel so bravely that he certainly deserves praise above all others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Nevertheless, he was only a human! Whether he wrote something against the Zurichers again, a Lasco does not know. If so, perhaps such a writing will be suppressed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- A Lasco wishes that the Zurichers would express their love for Luther with a small laudation, omitting the dispute over the Lord's Supper. This would silence many opponents of the Gospel and earn them respect among the faithful. They would also bear witness to their honesty before the entire church. Perhaps then there would be a greater effort than before to resolve the dispute. If the Zurichers and their magistrate are interested in this proposal, a Lasco would advocate for a scholarly colloquium involving the Zurichers with Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse, Count Palatine [Friedrich II], and the Elector of Cologne [Hermann von Wied]. But he must first learn what the Zurichers think of it. However, he believes that now is a good opportunity to settle the dispute.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings to Vadian, whose advice he will follow and to whom he will write shortly.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ, most esteemed brothers. I am compelled to respond to both of you with a single letter due to my overwhelming workload, as I am no longer able to write to each of you individually.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have reluctantly done what I did not want to do for so long, and I have renounced the ministry of the bishop due to the impiety of our magistrates and certain false brothers. The magistrates did not want me to retain the title of Inspector and did not allow me any use of ecclesiastical discipline against the openly impious and blasphemous devourers of the churches, not to mention pastors. Therefore, I thought that the authority of Christ the Lord in my ministry should no longer be exposed to public contempt, and I voluntarily laid down the ministry which I could not legitimately fulfill. However, I have not laid down the ministry of pastor in this town of ours, nor will I, unless I am expelled, which seems almost inevitable to me. I truly entrust myself entirely to God here and, by God's grace, I will not yield to the furies of Satan and the world. The Burgundian court is doing everything to expel me, and since they see that I have dispelled the suspicion of Anabaptism, they contend that I am a Sacramentarian.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I did not see Bucer when I was in Heidelberg, and I regret not having seen him. He desires a conversation with me, and I likewise with him. He has engaged with me on the sacramental cause through his letters once and again, and I have responded to him in turn, and there is not much difference between us. I conclude all sacraments within the bounds of confirmation; he adds the offering, but in such a way that what is heavenly in the sacraments is perceived only by the pious, lifted to heaven by faith. I agree here and confess that in the Lord's Supper, with our souls lifted to heaven by faith through the Holy Spirit, we truly receive there the communion of the body and blood of Christ according to the nature of the sacrament, that is, by way of confirmation. And thus far we have progressed, and I do not doubt that in the remaining matters, things will succeed well, now that Luther has passed away.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is astonishing that such a most holy man, worthy of eternal praises in the church of Christ, was so mistaken in this matter of the signs. Indeed, this matter serves as a lesson to us that we are all humans, that is, liars, as far as it is in us, so that we do not rely on the authority of any man on earth, but know that the wood, hay, and stubble of our human error must indeed be consumed by the fire of the divine word. But we, nevertheless, will undoubtedly be saved as long as we rely on our foundation; which indeed no one can deny that Luther relied on with all his heart, while I remain silent about the gold, gems, and silver in his doctrine.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Certainly, he was the first in our century to wonderfully illustrate the cause of our justification through Christ. He exposed the hidden iniquities of the Antichrist so that even children know them, which were previously almost worshipped as God himself throughout nearly the entire world. He restored countless churches according to the gift entrusted to him, resisted the adversaries of the Gospel of Christ with such spirit and constancy unto death, that he can rightly be seen to have seized this praise above all others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>But in all these things, he was nevertheless a man, which indeed we, admonished by his example, must perpetually think about ourselves. Whether he has prepared anything against you again, I do not know; for I have heard nothing of this. But even if there were something of this kind, it might perhaps be suppressed, so that it does not come out.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Meanwhile, whether such a thing is suppressed or comes out, I wish that you would testify to your candor and Christian love towards such a great man with some small laudation, with some exception for the modesty of this sacramental cause. You would silence the mouths of many adversaries of the Gospel with this singular example of your modesty. Among all the pious, you would undoubtedly gain great favor, and, most importantly, you would give an uncommon testimony of your integrity to the entire church of Christ; indeed, you might also effect that some reason for reconciling this sacramental controversy would be sought with greater zeal than ever before. This matter alone should suffice to stir your minds to this. For what could happen more desirably than that this controversy be settled? To which, if I saw your minds inclined, especially together with your magistrate, I would indeed labor in every way either with the Landgrave of Hesse or with the Count Palatine Elector, both of whom I am known to, or with my Prince Elector of Cologne, that some colloquium of scholars be instituted, to which you also would be invited. However, I do not think I should do this before I am certain of your mind. If you are of this mind, it would not be out of place, as I said, to publish some small laudation of Luther with an exception for the sacramental cause, in which you would testify that you desire concord and do not refuse a friendly, free, and Christian colloquium on this matter. I wanted to remind you of these few things, most beloved brothers in the Lord, after we see that an opportunity to handle this matter well has been somewhat offered to us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I cannot say more now, I only ask you to greet our Vadian most diligently and officiously with my words through your letters. I could not write to him now, but I will write shortly, and I will do what he asked of me, if the Lord wills. Greet all the other brothers as well. And may the God of peace guide us all together through His Spirit, so that we may do and speak what is worthy of Him. Amen.</p>
      <p>Emden, March 23, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, as much as I am, Johannes a Lasco with my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the most beloved brothers in the Lord and most faithful doctors of the church of Zurich in the Gospel of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger and Conrad Pellican, to their hands, etc.</p>
