      <p>I am grieved that our churches are being disturbed by the ill-advised counsel of some, and I know well that your writings have also contributed to this matter.</p>
      <p>I had previously admonished you in two letters to examine this matter more closely, but I perceive that I have achieved nothing, since the truth of God is condemned by you.</p>
      <p>My table, which I published, drawn from the pure sources of the word of God, is accused of Arianism, but you will see with what merit.</p>
      <p>I am certain and believe before God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ that there is nothing Arian in it.</p>
      <p>For it relies on no other foundation than the certain and infallible word of God, and I have compiled it from the scriptures, excerpted word for word.</p>
      <p>The heresy of Arius was that he denied that the one God was truly the Father of Jesus Christ, because that one God did not beget the Son from Himself, but made Him from non-being, and thus the Father was truly denied by him.</p>
      <p>Hence, the Nicene Creed was issued against him, where it is said: "We believe in one God, the Father Almighty," and when he denied this foundation of faith, he simultaneously abolished the one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, true God from true God.</p>
      <p>For how could He truly be the Son of God, when God the Father was denied to have truly begotten Him? And how could He be believed to be true God from true God by him who refused to concede that God the Father truly begot Him? Hence, against the same Arius, it was concluded in the Nicene Creed that not only should one believe in one God the Father, but also in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, true God from true God, of the same nature as His Father.</p>
      <p>Who indeed will establish a diversity of nature in God the Father and His Son, who truly confesses the Son of God begotten from God the Father and not from elsewhere? If the Son of God, born from true man, is of the same nature with us, can Christ, born from God, be of a different nature?</p>
      <p>There are three of one nature or deity, and these three are never one, but always three.</p>
      <p>The nature or deity, which is one, is in three, not in one only, and thus one is not of one nature, which, since it is one, we never divide or make three, but we always say and believe these three, who are of the same nature, to be three and count them with Paul: "One God the Father, one Son of God and God begotten from God, one Holy Spirit." The one deity or nature of them is not one God, but is of one God the Father, one Son of God, and one Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>One God is the Father, and deity is not the Father, but is of the Father, thus one deity is of the Son, which is also of the Father, but deity is not the Son, just as the humanity of Christ is not man.</p>
      <p>The Father has deity, but is not said to have God.</p>
      <p>Christ is the Son of God, not of deity, which even Simler denies to generate and thus neither to be the Father nor the Son.</p>
      <p>For God the Father did not beget deity from Himself, but the Son God, not deity, which the Son is not.</p>
      <p>One deity is of the three, yet none of the three is God.</p>
      <p>Thus the Son of God has humanity in common with us, yet is not said to have man.</p>
      <p>As He is of the same nature with the Father, by which He is one with Him, so He is of the same nature with us, by which He is also united with us.</p>
      <p>Hence, we are content with this mediator as perfect, who reaches from earth to heaven from us humans to God the Father.</p>
      <p>Deity or divine nature and humanity are contained and possessed, they are not themselves, who has them, but they are of Him.</p>
      <p>But God exists by Himself, He has deity or divine nature, as also the Son of God has deity and humanity or both natures.</p>
      <p>However, He is neither deity nor humanity.</p>
      <p>Here Stancar errs, and those who follow him, for by establishing one deity of the three, they abolish the one God the Father proclaimed by the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, and also the one Son of God, God begotten from God, neither of whom is that deity.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they have no mediator, except a man to this their God, they deny the incarnation and attribute all other offices only to man, fearing that a plurality of gods might follow or that this one God of theirs, fictitious, might be believed to be incarnate and also a mediator.</p>
      <p>For it is difficult to agree in one and the same, who begot and who is begotten and who mediates and to whom he mediates and who became man and who sent him to this, yet himself not made man.</p>
      <p>This one God of the sophists, unknown to the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, who is said to be triune in essence, never begot anything, has no son, and thus no mediator.</p>
      <p>He did not create us nor redeem us.</p>
      <p>For one God the Father accomplished this through the only-begotten Son in the Holy Spirit, only one God the Father sent us the Son and gave Him, who begot Him. The Son of God did not say He was a mediator except to God the Father.</p>
      <p>He invoked only one God the Father and commanded us to be inscribed in the same prayer.</p>
      <p>This God, who never spoke or acted, is not needed by us, we are content with one God the Father, creator of all, and one Son of God, through whom all things were created, and one Holy Spirit, by whose power all things are animated and sustained.</p>
      <p>We have no testimonies of scripture about one God in essence or triune, but only about one God the Father, who was heard in voice, and one Son of God, who was seen in the flesh and baptized, and one Holy Spirit, who descended in the form of a dove.</p>
      <p>God in essence or indefinite, etc., was neither heard nor seen there, nor did He say or do anything, He was not manifested through any of the prophets.</p>
      <p>For that one God of the Israelites interpreted His Christ to be the Father (John 8) and Paul, who was an Israelite and knew Hebrew, interprets that one Jehovah of the law and the prophets to be one God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and also His only-begotten eternal Son of the eternal God, etc. (1 Cor., 8. Eph. 2.) Therefore, this new God is of the antichrist and his sophists, whom our fathers neither knew nor worshipped, as Daniel says.</p>
      <p>We are content with this unique foundation of salvation laid by Christ. The Father is (1) eternal life, that they may know you (2) the only true God and whom you have sent (3) Jesus Christ" (John 17), to which the Apostles' Creed corresponds, "I believe in God (2) the Father Almighty" etc. "and in Jesus (3) Christ His Son". "I believe in eternal (1) life." These differ from each other only in that Christ speaks of eternal life at the beginning, this symbol of faith places it at the end, but they agree in one and only God the Father and in one also Christ the Son of God, the Word that descended from heaven and was made flesh.</p>
      <p>Thus all other places of scripture agree with these two, as my table demonstrates.</p>
      <p>"You believe in God and believe in me." "The God of Abraham, Isaac, our fathers glorified His Son Jesus," that we may know the true God and remain in His Son in the name of the Father and the Son, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, whoever holds this foundation laid and commended by Christ and the apostles, that there is one God the Father, who is not the Son, but has the Son, the Word God, whom He sent to us in the world, should not doubt that he has eternal life.</p>
      <p>For whoever, rejecting the blasphemies of the antichrist, simply believes the scripture and acknowledges one God the Father of Jesus Christ, is necessarily compelled to acknowledge also one Son of God, God begotten from God, otherwise that God would not be the Father, who did not beget, and hence it is also concluded that both the begetter and the begotten are of one nature, since God begotten is from God and not from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>But with the one God the Father overturned, now the Son of God cannot be God from God, because for Him to be the Son of God, it was necessary for Him to be begotten from that one God the Father, and to make this manifest, it is easy to demonstrate with living examples.</p>
      <p>After Satan overturned this foundation among the Jews and Turks, who deny that the one God they confess is the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, behold, they also do not wish to acknowledge or believe in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, as God from God in any way.</p>
      <p>He overturned this foundation with Arius, with whom, since that one God was not truly the Father, that is, did not beget Himself, behold, the Son of God is not true God from God, but a creation and creature according to his opinion.</p>
      <p>Satan overturned this foundation with Sabellius, for whom one God is triune or trinomious, who certainly is not the Father of Christ.</p>
      <p>Behold, he no longer acknowledges the Son of God, who is God from God (lest there be two gods).</p>
      <p>This saying is hard for him, but this should also be no less hard, since the same Christ is said to be the Son of Man, that is, man born from man.</p>
      <p>Thus the papacy, having abolished the one true God the Father, received various other gods and various mediators, among whom, as there was not that one God, so neither was the mediator the Son of God, the Word made flesh.</p>
      <p>The Apostles' Creed, in which all things necessary for faith and salvation are summarily contained.</p>
      <p>1. The foundation of the church of God and salvation: I believe in God the Father Almighty And in Jesus Christ His Son, I believe and in the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>2. The house of God, the church: I believe in the catholic church.</p>
      <p>3. The privilege of the house and liberties: I believe in the forgiveness of sins, The resurrection of the flesh, Eternal life.</p>
      <p>Wherever this foundation is intact, inviolate, one God the Father with His only-begotten is not abolished, there is that house of God, which is the church standing on this firm prophetic and apostolic foundation, there also is the certainty of all things pertaining both to the body and the soul.</p>
      <p>The cause and source of all our consolations: I believe in Jesus Christ Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born, suffered, died, descended into hell.</p>
      <p>On the third day He rose again.</p>
      <p>He ascended into heaven, sits at the right hand... From there He will come to judge.</p>
      <p>Consolations flowing from this source: Hence: I believe in the forgiveness of sins.</p>
      <p>The resurrection of the flesh.</p>
      <p>Eternal life.</p>
      <p>The perfection of all and the certainty for the soul and body in life, in death, after death.</p>
      <p>Dead: The perfection of all is the Son of God given to us by the Father, the Word incarnate, who by His conception, birth, and death removed our sin, satisfied the wrath of God.</p>
      <p>Hence we believe, as long as we live, in the forgiveness of sins.</p>
      <p>He rose again: And since sin was the cause of double death, namely of the body and soul, for Adam sinned in both and received the sentence of both deaths, "you will surely die," now with sin removed by Christ, we are freed from both deaths, of the body, against which we believe we will not perish but will rise again in the flesh, since Christ in our flesh, with sin dissolved, rose again.</p>
      <p>He ascended into heaven: And against the death of the soul, which would have been eternal, we believe in eternal life, and this from Christ, who by His ascension into heaven in our flesh possessed this eternal life for us in our name.</p>
      <p>Since we do not need more consolations, for all things are perfect for both soul and body and present life and future from this faith, we determine to stand on this foundation of faith until the end. Certainly, they lie who report otherwise about us to you.</p>
      <p>We do not even dream of three deities, we do not acknowledge Christ as essenced or circumscribed, and other deliriums, of whoever they may be.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more as the courier is hurrying. I urge and beseech you in the name of God and His Son, to examine more diligently those things which the Lord has not yet revealed to you.</p>
      <p>He did not give everything to Luther, more to Zwingli, after Zwingli He gave more to others, and He gives now, to whom He wills.</p>
      <p>The antichrist did not establish his kingdom in one century of years, he corrupted all articles of faith, and would we think that the foundation of all remained unscathed by him?</p>
      <p>I love you, God is my witness, I acknowledge you as teachers, I give due praise, I delight in your writings.</p>
      <p>Beware, lest you condemn the truth out of hatred for some.</p>
      <p>Encourage our people here to peace and concord.</p>
      <p>Do not be among those spies whom God sent into the land of Canaan, who later, themselves terrified, turned the people back to Egypt.</p>
      <p>Heal those bitten by serpents in this our desert. For they are venomous, who remove that one serpent exalted by Moses, Christ the Son of God, true God from true God, the Word incarnate, our only mediator to God the Father, abolished by this one false god, who is not the Father of Christ, as Stancar and those who follow him do.</p>
      <p>Beware of the Gibeonites, who deceived the people of God with torn clothes and moldy bread, even claiming to come in the name of our God and deceiving the people of God.</p>
      <p>Let not the fathers, antiquity, councils, etc., deceive us.</p>
      <p>Let Christ alone be the teacher, in other articles the fathers and councils were of no value.</p>
      <p>There are also many Gibeonites here, who profess themselves to be your friends and attempt nothing else than to lead the people of God back to Egypt with the Augsburg Confession.</p>
      <p>May the Lord later reveal them to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, honorable brothers, if you wish to criticize anything in me, admonish me privately, as I have written to you privately.</p>
      <p>I am being publicly slandered in your writings printed in Poland, I am compelled to respond to the writings of Calvin and Simler, which before I do, I write to you and send my confession.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell, pray for our churches, which are disturbed here by the Stancarian doctrine.</p>
      <p>I would also wish that Mr. Calvin sees this my writing, to whom I could not write now.</p>
      <p>In Kraków, July 20, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your brother in the Lord, sincerely wishing all good for you, Gregor Pauli, minister of God and His Son Jesus Christ in the congregation of Kraków.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, faithful ministers of the church of Jesus Christ in Zürich, Heinrich Bullinger, Rudolf Gwalther, Josias Simler, Wolfgang, etc., brothers to be revered in the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
