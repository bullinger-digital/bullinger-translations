    <p xml:id="regest1">It is due to Musculus that Peutinger did not respond to Bullinger's letter [not received] and did not express thanks for the [“Orthodox Confession of the Zurich Church”]. Peutinger is also very troubled by the harmful [Communion] dispute that has broken out again. However, he does not blame the [Zurichers] at all, especially since he has also read Luther's spiteful [“Short Confession”]. He believes that silence would have been the best defense, especially since friends already have access to the previously published writings and in this way, no weakness would have been shown to the [Roman] enemy. - By the way, he gladly accepts Bullinger's offered friendship. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Our Musculus will ensure that I have not yet responded to your letters nor expressed thanks for the little gift sent, which was most pleasing to me, thanks to you, most learned man. However, I am greatly troubled by the fact that I see the wound of this dissension reopening to the great detriment of public affairs; which I would not say is your fault, having read Martin's bitter writings, but nevertheless, on both sides, silence would have been the best defense, as among friends there is no longer a need for it, since previous writings can sufficiently establish judgments. Among enemies, however, we achieve nothing more than exposing ourselves and the public cause of the Gospel to their whims; which I do not say, my dear Bullinger, to blame your side for this evil, but because I would like to be a monitor to pious and good men for concord and the interests of public affairs, according to my faith in God and religion.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, know that your most welcome friendship is very dear to me, which I, when I should have sought it, accept from you, offered kindly, with the most eager spirit, and will observe sincerely and candidly.</p>
      <p>Farewell. From Augsburg, November 20, 1545. Yours, Claudius Pius Peutinger, legal consultant.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, professor of Christian piety and truth, his dearest friend. Zurich.</p>
