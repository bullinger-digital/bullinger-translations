      <p>Greetings. When I was with you in Zurich last summer, (reverend man,) the fact that you, a man of such stature, received me, an obscure man with no public testimony to recommend me to you, so graciously that you even shared your table with me, was indeed an act of singular humanity and hospitality on your part, for which I acknowledge I owe you a great deal. However, because I was hindered by your health, I was unable to discuss freely and extensively with you about our affairs, that is, the state and condition of the church here, as I wished; although this troubled me greatly while I was still in your city, as I was deprived of a significant benefit of my journey, I later realized that it happened for the best, not without the counsel and providence of divine will.</p>
      <p>You remember, if I am not mistaken, (most serious man,) the day you called me from my lodging through your son, and instructed me to bring forth what I wished to discuss, with Mr. Gwalther also present at the time, that I did not complain much about the calamity and misery of our church here, partly because you seemed to already understand our affairs sufficiently, and partly because you had been made aware of everything here through the letters of certain brothers, particularly those of Mr. Beza at that time, so that it was unnecessary to add anything to those. After handing over two notes, which were mentioned in Mr. Beza's letters to you, I was dismissed to my lodging without having spoken a word about any particular point of religion. Even during the two days I awaited your letters, it is well known that I engaged in nothing with you or others, except that I proposed some questions about vestments and ceremonies in general to one or two of your assembly. Yet, (most learned father,) when I returned home to my people, it was as if I had come to you with the intention of slandering and detracting from others, which was most unbecoming, or had deliberately sought to fabricate falsehoods about this church, so the charge of slander and calumny is laid against me. While I diligently sought the cause and source of this matter, I discovered that all this trouble arose from your letters to the bishops, which, as I had received them sealed, being entirely ignorant of their contents, I had already carefully ensured were delivered into their hands. What more can I say? Conscious of my innocence in this matter, I immediately approached the Bishop of Winchester, who was then in London, and seriously (as was proper) discussed this very matter with him: eventually, letters written in your own hand were produced, which revealed that rumors had reached you about a foreign language, mud, spittle, candles, and I know not what other things used in the sacred rites here: for I was only allowed to inspect one or two sentences at that time: but they want me to be the author of this rumor. Although this fabrication is utterly trivial and perishes by its own vanity; yet, because it has gained such strength and credibility, whether by the instigation of the devil himself, or by the hatred and malevolence of men, or by the excessive credulity of some, that I meanwhile suffer under grave suspicion among those whom I have embraced for several years now as friends and brothers in Christ, with whom I also wish to live peacefully henceforth, as far as it depends on me; therefore, I am compelled to seek refuge in your faith at this time, so that (endowed as you are with piety and sanctity) you may vindicate my innocence from slander with your testimony. You cannot easily forget, (venerable man) the points on which I complained in the articles; so there was no need to scrape together a foreign language, mud, spittle, candles, and other trivialities to augment this evil. Would that this church were as free from other burdens and stains as it is, by the grace of God, alien to these evils! Then indeed the complaint of the pious would not be as just as it is today, alas! most just.</p>
      <p>May you take my freedom in this petition in good part, if you consider first, that my testimony about myself in this matter (however simple and true) is not easily accepted; then, that the rashness and thoughtlessness of some have progressed to the point that the matter has been disclosed to some of the highest magistrates of this kingdom; finally, that the cause of the ministers, otherwise good and holy, is being discredited among many under this pretext; so that abuses are today clung to and retained more stubbornly, and all hope of reformation is almost cut off. For (besides the fact that ancestral superstitions and papal remnants are too pleasing to many here, there are also found among our own those who are patrons of them, who twist the writings of the most learned men, and yours especially, to this end,) if falsifiers are once discovered, how much zeal and effort the remaining ministers will subsequently achieve even in the best matters, it is not difficult for you to conjecture. Therefore, both my private danger and the common cause, which is certainly not of men but of Jesus Christ, especially demand your help and assistance. Therefore, I have no doubt that you will promptly and eagerly extend your hand in such an honest and necessary cause. Indeed, I do not ask that you censure or criticize others, (which perhaps would be useful, although not so safe for me, unless it is done generally and prudently,) but I solely seek that you defend and protect me, who am in danger, with a just defense; and that you do so with your private letters to me, if you please, so that no greater disturbance arises from this if it becomes known to some; but if they remain quiet, I ask for nothing else, if not, I wish to have something from you that may respond to them on my behalf. And although I could have undertaken this, whatever it is, sooner and perhaps even should have, I have so far refrained from writing, to spare you, both elderly and infirm, and already more than sufficiently troubled in this very cause, and I wish it had been possible and entirely! However, since not long ago the chief counselor of this kingdom privately and amicably summoned me to him and advised me about this matter and suggested that I have at least two or three words prepared from you on my behalf, if necessary, I have finally dared something (as you see) relying on your (most illustrious man) fairness. In this matter, I earnestly pray and beseech that I do not suffer rejection from you, and at the same time, that you do not provoke those against me, whom I already have as sufficiently harsh and adverse. If you choose to send what you write to Geneva to Mr. Beza or Mr. Raymond, so that they may send it to the minister of the French church in London (which they frequently do and often), it will be most safely done. In this way, your letters will reach my hands, if the address is directed to me by name.</p>
      <p>From this, it is easy for you to gather, (my father), that I now expect a response from you not so much ardently and seriously as anxiously and solicitously. Meanwhile, I will console and sustain myself with the testimony of my conscience as best I can. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for a long time for His church and continually pursue you with His favor more and more!</p>
      <p>Please convey my greetings to the excellent servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Rodolph Gwalther, and his wife; if you also thank them on my behalf or rather in my name, you will do me a great favor.</p>
      <p>Please also greet your other colleagues known to me, Mr. Simler, Mr. Wolph, both your sons, especially the younger, to whom I owe much for the acts of kindness he showed me in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, most reverend father, and remember this wavering church in your prayers to God, I pray. Farewell again. London, February 25, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Percival Wiburne.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the Zurich church, a father to be greatly revered by him.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
