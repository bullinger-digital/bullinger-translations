      <p>S. In recent days, dear godfather, I wrote to you about how I discussed the Wedischwyler matter with some of my lords, and what intentions I found among them.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, at my urging, the matter has been brought before the council; some are of the opinion that we should immediately send a delegation to Zürich, Schwyz, and Glarus, while others think we should write only to Zürich. However, the majority decided to remain silent until further information arrives and we hear what response is given on both sides. Since no reports have been received from any place, they cannot yet engage in negotiations. I am also informed that my lords would not mind if they were secretly informed about this matter from Zürich; they would then contribute their part faithfully. Meanwhile, I received another letter from you via Melchior Bucher, in which you pursue the matter even more vigorously. I have also reported this to those who usually inform me, especially Treasurer Haller, who advises me to suggest that either my lords in Zürich be informed of this or that you write privately to my lord Mayor Nägeli; if neither happens, it will be seen that action is taken on the matter.</p>
      <p>Treasurer Haller instructs me to also respond in his name to the last letter he received from you, first of all thanking you for all your words; that he has not written back to you should not be taken amiss, as he was prevented by illness (he has not left the house for 2 months). However, in recent days he has written to you as much as he could; he hopes you have already received the letter. Regarding the boy from Lenzburg, his illness has also prevented any dealings; but he will be sent here, and then we will see what can be done with him. Furthermore, I am to send you his warm greetings, and he will keep in mind the matter you wrote to him about; but he has not disclosed to me what that is.</p>
      <p>Bucher has been informed that he may study here; once we see his actions and conduct, we can deal with him according to the situation. He thinks he has been completely rejected because no immediate help was promised to him, but that is not the case. If he could stay here for a while, I believe he would be well assisted.</p>
      <p>Burgdorf is already provided with an honorable man. Jungius has also been called there as a deacon. If Gervasius cannot go to Aarau, I know no other advice than for him to come here himself and present himself, bringing recommendations and acquaintances from you and others to my lords; I hope he will be helped, although Weberus and others are not well disposed towards him. However, he could be well received; if he waits in Zürich for a call, I see that it is in vain.</p>
      <p>Curio has leave in Burgdorf and has started a strange quarrel with the mayor, which caused the people of Burgdorf to grant him leave; how or where he will be helped again, I do not yet know. He does not let go of his ways, I fear. Biel wants to keep the school closed, not to lease it, but to let the widow of Leopold use it this winter until spring.</p>
      <p>The Latin boys are currently being taught by Master Michael, the German ones by the German schoolmaster. They lack a preacher; it would not have hurt if you had written to Michael about Gervasius; they are otherwise considering Jungius; but since he is already provided for, Gervasius could be best helped there. Write soon and send it to me, and I will also act on it to the best of my ability. That's all for now. Greet yours and mine from me and mine. I am surprised that I understand my letters have not yet been received by you, which I sent long ago. December 5, 1549. Bern.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful minister of Christ and the church among the people of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his ever-honored and revered godfather. Zürich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
