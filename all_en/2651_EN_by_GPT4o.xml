      <p>Strasbourg, 14th June 1555.</p>
      <p>I am sure, dear father, that you are expecting the treatise by Mr. Zanchi on auspices, which I promised to send several months ago, and I certainly would have sent it if Mr. Zanchi had not been delayed from reading due to a serious illness for a long time; for he, along with his wife, has been gravely ill for more than two months. Now, by the grace of God, he is somewhat recovering from the illness and has instructed me to send you his warmest greetings in his name and to offer the excuse of his illness for the interruption of his letters. Furthermore, in the letters you recently sent me, you instructed me to consult good and learned men about a place cultivated with good literature, so that if you decided to send me to Strasbourg, I could move there conveniently. Now, therefore, learn what they have advised. Mr. Peter Martyr, along with Mr. Zanchi, although they do not have certain knowledge of the state of the universities in Marburg, Wittenberg, and elsewhere, nevertheless, because Wittenberg has always been well-regarded among all pious and learned men, not so much for its piety as for the excellent and cultivated studies there, they advised that I should go there rather than to Marburg. For no one advises going to Marburg, especially because, besides other inconveniences, the plague is rampant there and, more importantly, the school is completely disrupted. Additionally, two of my English roommates, who are now coming from Wittenberg, learned and pious men, strongly advise that I transfer there, attesting that, besides other conveniences, one can live there at a low cost. I, dear father, offer myself to you in all things, so that I am ready for everything you wish, and even consider myself able to do what I cannot, in honor of you.</p>
      <p>However, I pray, my father, that if it can be done according to your will, I may now be allowed to go elsewhere than to Marburg. Finally, I commend to you the young man who bears this letter as good, pious, and learned, and I pray that, if it can be done in any way, you may assist him in his misery. Now farewell forever with mother and the whole family, whom you will greet most dutifully in my name.</p>
      <p>Mr. Johannes Garnerius and all of ours greet you. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your beloved son, in Strasbourg.</p>
