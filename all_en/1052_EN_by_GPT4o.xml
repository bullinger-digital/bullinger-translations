      <p>Greetings. From many renowned friends, we have no doubt that you have more certain information about the Diet of Augsburg than I could possibly convey to you.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I wanted to send you a letter from an honest man, written to me from there eight days ago; from which you will certainly understand more about how things have happened. The day before yesterday, Granvelle's disemboweled corpse was brought to Constance with a large entourage and from there, I do not know whether by the Rhine or by beasts of burden, it will be transported to Basel, so that it can soon be carried to Montbéliard and finally to Besançon. For he wanted his bones to rest there, where the treasure of his wealth is hidden; where his soul rests and whether it rests, only the Lord knows. They say the Emperor has again departed to Munich from the Diet, very ill and now deprived of one eye due to Granvelle's death; for they think only the Duke of Alba remains, who recommends an artificial vision to him. What happened to him in Africa, you will understand from the note enclosed with my letter. The author who wrote these things is not at all unreliable. A pious man from Augsburg has reported here to St. Gallen that the envoys of the princes have informed the Emperor today that they do not know how to implement the Interim, that they are not inclined to continue the Council of Trent, as it encompasses all the Pope's plans, in which they do not know how to agree; also hoping that His Imperial Majesty will uphold for the common estates of the empire what has been so thoroughly promised and assured to them at so many imperial diets.</p>
      <p>They also do not know how to wage war against the so-called rebels, as they submit to a free council. Farewell. St. Gallen, 16th October, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>[Joachim] Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster, Zurich.</p>
