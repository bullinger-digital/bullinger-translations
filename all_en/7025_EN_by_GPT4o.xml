      <p>Revered Father, Greetings. I am sorry that my letters have reached you so late, but better late than never. I am very glad to hear that Dr. Tobias has been elected and appointed in place of our blessed memory Fabricius; for he is well regarded here. It was also pleasing to hear, indeed to see in your letters, how the matter was handled with that rascal Gentilis. Various rumors are spread here about those Spaniards and about the soldiers that the Duke of Savoy is gathering, and there are those who say he will make an expedition against Geneva, and therefore they should be warned more diligently.</p>
      <p>In Bologna, five most steadfast brothers were burned for the gospel, and it is reported that about five hundred are in prison; therefore, they should be commended to the prayers of the church.</p>
      <p>However, others in many places sing the most disgraceful recantations, and recently someone who was acting as a singer here in our church returned to monasticism, a treacherous rascal. The Turk is seeking peace with the Emperor because he is forced to resist the King of Persia who is attacking him. The sons of Lord Hercules from Saluzzo write from Transylvania that things are going well for them.</p>
      <p>Hercules sends his regards. Isabella has now passed away to the Lord on February 8th. I wish I could be with you for a few days and communicate much with you; but at this time I cannot do what I desire. For there are matters that should not or even cannot be entrusted to letters. In the meantime, I ask you to commend me to the Lord; for I am almost overwhelmed by the most severe temptations of Satan, which I would easily endure if only they did not redound to the detriment of the church. May the Lord at least be present to His church.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and I ask you to greet the brothers in my name. Our Count Ulysses sends greetings to you and the brothers.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, February 17, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, H[ieronymus] Zanchus.</p>
      <p>If you wish to know anything about my condition and the church, ask my relative Lord Laurentius and Nicolaus. Just know this: as much as I, or rather the Lord through me, builds up, so much does Satan destroy through others.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord H[einrich] Bullinger, most revered father of the Zurich church.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
