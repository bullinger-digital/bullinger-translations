    <p xml:id="regest1">The communication from the people of Zurich regarding the rapprochement of the Strasbourg church with Luther is considered by them to be a hasty and unkind assumption. They want to clarify the situation in Strasbourg and ask the people of Zurich for restraint and silence. The Turks are a scourge of God, therefore, instead of providing military aid to the Emperor against them, one should first achieve repentance and improvement within one's own people. The immediate danger is likely to be overestimated anyway.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace through the Lord.</p>
      <p>We have read your letters, dearest brothers, which indeed seemed quite lengthy and more inflammatory to us than befitting the spirit of charity. For here, it is gentler and not as suspicious as it seems to be from which you have written. From many things we know openly, regarding the people of Strasbourg, the matter seems to be entirely different than you suspect. For we can observe nowhere that they have defected from us or subscribed to Luther. If in previous letters to you they have indicated something of this kind, it is not known to us, as they have not been read by those from whom they were not. In the latter ones, however, which some of us have seen, we have discovered a free judgment about your booklet or preface to Bertram, nothing more. Whether this pleases or not, it is not the place to write about it now. Certainly, what has been published by you cannot plainly displease. Among other things, however, we have found that it was added that they completely agree with you on the Lord's Supper, which satisfied us so much that we thought of nothing else. It certainly seems to be something far different that they are said to have approved in Luther. However, since this is not clearly established at present, we will take care to be more certain. Then we will judge all matters of the present business more diligently. Meanwhile, we ask with a brotherly spirit, be careful as much as possible, that the suspicion conceived does not go out to the public. For if what you suspect is true (which God forbid), it will be established sooner than it would be beneficial to either us or the word. But if otherwise, I do not doubt that you will carefully consider what bad words would be about us. It is certain, whether it is true or not, that the matter should be concealed. We have agreed among ourselves to ask the people of Strasbourg for certainty about the whole business, so that, I say, they may tell what their matter is with Luther, or if there is anything that pertains to this present business in which they agree with him. After we have learned that it is as you suspect, we, following the right path, will rather abandon men than the truth of God.</p>
      <p>But if their mind is, as we hope, solid and firm in that confession which they have held until now, we will then examine the writings of both more precisely and act in a manner befitting Christian men. What we say, you will not refer to the method of judging (for we do not think highly), but to piety, through which we will admonish which of the parties seems to have deviated from the goal. Through the Lord Jesus, we pray you, most beloved brothers, to carefully consider the rule of charity, so that according to it, whatever you are or are going to do or write, you may accomplish, and then weigh the evil of suspicions, which can be nothing worse among men, lest in this you may be precipitated and harm both yourselves and the gospel irreparably. For we indeed will pray to God that he may keep us from this evil forever.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Turk, we judge thus: It is our duty, if he indeed bears arms against the Emperor, as it is said, to lead the people to amend their lives through teaching. For it is futile to incite resistance while we are perpetually such as those against whom God sends this scourge. Then if it seems good to the magistrate to resist even with arms, let him resist in the name of the Lord. It will not be ours to resist. Meanwhile, let him be careful that the evil does not lie hidden. For although in this our city we have been warned twice by the Emperor, yet we have not heard anyone for whom it is certain that the Turk is in arms. Indeed, not only are we uncertain, but also those who are in these places where the army of the Turk is said to be threatening. For Sturmius of Strasbourg wrote a few days ago from Regensburg that there is a rumor among them that the Turk is growing more and more every day, etc. Here he says there is a rumor, we are summoned, as if he had already invaded the cities of the Emperor. Therefore, we think it should be prayed to God that he may kill the "Turk" who is in the flesh. Then without a doubt, there will be one who will overthrow with a sling, if anyone tries to destroy the inheritance of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, brothers, and receive these writings as from brothers. For in the matter of the Eucharist and all other things, in which we have hitherto steadfastly adhered as to the truth of God, you will feel us to be such through the power of the Lord until the end. Pray to God for us mutually.</p>
      <p>Basel, 17th of July, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Preachers of the divine word in Basel, yours.</p>
      <p>To the ministers of the word in ZÃ¼rich, dearest brothers in the Lord.</p>
