      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Today, letters have arrived from Heidelberg from Mr. Christoph Ehem, the chief advisor to the Elector Palatine, who explains matters that I do not want to keep from you. First, he indicates that it has been announced with the utmost certainty that Angusola will come to Switzerland and will arrange for a Swiss legion to be stationed in the County of Burgundy under the pretext of providing a garrison, but it will serve, if necessary, the purposes of Alba in Brabant. For this reason, many thousands of crowns have been sent to the governor of Burgundy. Ehem therefore advises us to be vigilant and to resist, so that no soldiers are granted to him. For he will attack us ourselves. For they have planned everything for the oppression and destruction of us and all the faithful. And behold, while this warning is being sent here, Angusola arrives two days earlier. For the scoundrel came here breathless the day before yesterday. Yesterday he was heard by the council. In it, he proposed: because the agreement provides that one should have trust in one another, and Burgundy, which is in the agreement, is in danger, whether the agreement does not have the understanding that one should place a reinforcement in Burgundy, etc. To which he received no answer, except that at the meeting in Baden, one would discuss with others, etc. So he goes straight from here to Lucerne, where he will first lay out the real cards. He is the worst of all men, from whom Switzerland, if it were wise, would particularly guard itself. For he will be the leader of the Italian and Spanish army, if we are ever to be conquered. In the meantime, he observes all the routes, learns the customs of everyone, and understands how we are to be undermined. A viper and hydra, which is nurtured in our bosom. But all this is hidden from our eyes. For I fear the day of our most bitter visitation is at hand, which we have despised as a gracious visitation. Therefore, while these admonitory letters are being brought, while the scoundrel is still in our city, I believe this is done by divine providence with God watching over us. If only we would recognize it! You will know this before he reaches you. And Ehem specifically orders in his letters that I suggest the same to the Bernese, which I am now doing. He goes on to openly indicate that everything in France, Italy, Spain, and part of Germany is being arranged to oppress and destroy our true religion. Emperor Maximilian indeed pretends not to be aware, but he is collecting a large sum of money, perhaps for that very purpose. Therefore, all prudent people in France, England, and Germany who are of our religion unanimously feel that our affairs will not be safe unless all of us who are of the same religion in Switzerland, France, Germany, and England are united in one alliance among ourselves for the assertion of true religion and our freedom. If there is any hope of this, the prince will send a delegation to us. The same prince has now written through the same messenger to our [your?] council about this matter. And although I have little hope for our people (which I tell you alone), I do not want you to be ignorant of what Ehem, who is the eye and hand of the prince, has written, and through you, the best among you, whom you know to be trustworthy. Farewell together with your household.</p>
