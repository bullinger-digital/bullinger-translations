      <p>Noble, steadfast, especially gracious young lord, our willing service and all good things are prepared for you beforehand. We have received your letter along with the books you sent and understood the letter's contents, but we kindly ask you not to take it amiss that we hereby return the books to you as we received them; for there are very many of them, and our circumstances are such that we have not been able to accept them to read, much less to judge. [We know very well that the printers here at this time are not very eager to print such things.] [We] have, due to our office and duties, some daily ordinary lectures, some in other ways with appointed sermons, and also otherwise with church services and school duties to attend to, and our work increases daily in such a way that we reasonably excuse ourselves from these and similar additional tasks. May God grant that we can fulfill our office well and faithfully carry out the necessary duties that are incumbent upon us and which we are obliged to perform. May you take our response in the best way from us. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, 15th of May, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Pastor, preacher, and reader, servant of the Church of Zurich.</p>
