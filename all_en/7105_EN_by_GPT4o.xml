      <p>Upon returning to Chur, venerable Father Bullinger, I waited for ten days to be asked what the learned men, with whom I stayed, thought about our questions and what advice they gave. I intended to explain this matter and, if they were willing to reconsider, to embrace them and accept any Christian reconciliation. However, apart from the innocent among them who sinned, no one approached me; barely one or two greeted me in return; it was far from any word being spoken about controversy or reconciliation.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I went to the Valtellina to deliberate with the brothers on what I should do. I received the same advice from them as I did from you, namely to await the synod, to which both parties willingly committed the knowledge and reconciliation of the case. Since no letters have yet been written by the brothers in Chur to summon the other brothers to the synod, as is customary, and the time for summoning them seemed to be slipping away, I came to Chur on the tenth of this month and arranged with the brothers that the remaining pastors were immediately summoned to the synod by written letters. However, I received letters from friends stating that neither my colleague would come nor would the church send anyone; they entirely refuse the judgment of the synod in this controversy of ours. And indeed, I fear that my people will not come, as I have long seen them seeking many evasions. Now, therefore, we seek your advice on what we should do, that is, the synod, if the opposing party does not appear. We know what is customary and permissible in political judgments; but in this ecclesiastical matter, especially at this time, we wish to hear your opinion on not only what is permissible but also what is expedient and how we should proceed. I beseech you, excellent father, not to hesitate to respond freely.</p>
      <p>Philipp is expected in Italy at the end of May to come to a discussion with the Roman pontiff, which is to take place in Bologna. New Spaniards arrive daily. The Venetians fear for themselves and are fortifying their towns and cities with new garrisons. It is also reported (but this is not confirmed and certain) that they are recalling all exiles, so they may fear them less; for many are exiled, and they are noble and powerful.</p>
      <p>The old rumor of an expedition against Geneva is confirmed. I have heard what outcome the affairs in Flanders and Gotha have had, but I would gladly hear a more precise and certain explanation of these matters from you, if your health allows. May the Lord Jesus keep you for a long time.</p>
      <p>Chur, from the house of our Tobias, with whom I am staying, 16th of May 1567.</p>
      <p>Always your most observant H[ieronymus] Zanchi.</p>
      <p>I also ask you to remember to write those letters you promised to the consul of this city and to commend me and my cause and the dignity of the ministry. Farewell again. Both of these brothers promised to write to you. I also greet all the brothers.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church and ever-revered father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
