      <p>S. D. We have received your letters, most esteemed father, in which we understood that both ours and others have been delivered. Today, however, since Mr. Pontisella, a very dear friend of mine, has some private business and is somewhat distracted from school and studies by haymaking, he has entrusted me with the duty of responding. First of all, we give you the greatest thanks for such remarkable and paternal benevolence towards us, which always compels you to the mutual duty of correspondence, even though we are not unaware of how much you are perpetually overwhelmed by the storms of business. If only we had the means to repay this kindness appropriately. I will write in your name to Mr. Friedrich with the utmost diligence and all the more diligently, as he eagerly awaits your letters. We regret that new disturbers of peace arise daily. If the French are not yet sufficiently intoxicated with internal bloodshed, let them listen to Crucianus, the enemy of the cross of Christ; however, we hope that they have received such a wound from these carnal ones that it will not be pleasant for them to enter the arena again with the most good and great God, especially since this wound has not only formed a callus, but the sedition can easily break out again.</p>
      <p>These days, Mr. Zanchi, a cousin, a pastor from Plurs, a learned and pious man, has come to us from Italy, who affirms, and it is also confirmed by others, that the Turk is very severely demanding the kingdom of Cyprus from the Venetians, claiming some right and the convenience and protection of Christians against him and his people in this kingdom.</p>
      <p>He also believes that the Venetians will seek an alliance with the neighboring Rhaetians. He further reported a certain story of the Cardinal of Milan, which I ordered to be written down so that it may be sent to you. As for the matter of our bishop, I do not think anything is hidden from you, but that you have been fully informed by Mr. Friedrich about how it stands. But the bishop is ill-spoken of among many because of his cunning and secret writings, with which he daily fills and aggravates the Swiss without the knowledge of the other parties. He will not subjugate the Rhaetian colonists in this way; rather, in the manner he has begun, he will soon incite all the peasants against him, so that there is a danger that he may be unexpectedly overwhelmed by them. Certainly, the lords consuls, and especially Ambrosius, ordered that I write this to you, so that you may kindly intercede with your authority with the most esteemed lords consuls of your city and advise them not to embrace the bishop's partisan letters, which he sends recklessly without the knowledge and against the will of the opposing parties, with such favor that a harsher response from the magistrate is always to be expected. Indeed, our princes promise themselves little good from some. It is strange, however, if there are any who would threaten war and some unknown force because of one monk. In other matters concerning religion, the bishop seems to us quite tolerable; he always hides, studies much, and by his generosity, he does not draw anyone away from us. May he not change his hair only and not his mind! He is especially kind to me and offers every benefit, provided I ask, through his people.</p>
      <p>But it must be seen who and to whom, etc.</p>
      <p>All those whom you instructed to be greeted, namely the lords consuls, Mr. Karl, etc., who were all with us at dinner yesterday, send you their most dutiful greetings. Farewell, most humane father and the most splendid pillar of the whole church.</p>
      <p>Quickly from Chur, September 23, 1567.</p>
      <p>I ask, if Mr. Leonard Erni ever comes to you, that you would deign to greet him in my name; for he has always been a very dear friend to me above others, and indeed I would encourage him to the duty of writing if my memory of him had not withered.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and always keep us poor ones recommended to you paternally, I ask. Yours, always ready for everything, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most illustrious and faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his most revered lord and dearest father. Zürich.</p>
