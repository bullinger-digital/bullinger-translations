    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter through [Christoph] Froschauer along with a bundle of letters and books intended for leading men in England; [Partridge and his companions] appreciate the benefits of their teacher Bullinger and are sincerely attached to him. They hope that his little daughter Elisabeth has recovered and send greetings to Bullinger's wife and mother. Froschauer will bring a letter from Reyner [Wolfe] with news from England, which [John] Butler and [Bartholomew] Traheron, who are with [Johannes] Sapidus in Strasbourg, as well as [Simon] Grynäus, should read first; Partridge has not yet seen an Englishman in Frankfurt who, according to Wolfe, could provide further information. A German merchant from London reported that the crucifix "The Rood of Grace" and other statues brought to London appeared to show human emotions during a sermon by the Bishop of Rochester [John Hilsey] against the veneration of images, thus exposing the manipulations of the monks; similar things are soon to happen with [the images] of the Virgin of Walsingham and Thomas [Becket] of Canterbury. Together with [William] Woodroffe, [William] Peterson, and [John] Finch, who will accompany him to England, Partridge sends greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Leo [Jud], and especially Theodor [Bibliander], from whom they could not say goodbye.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes. We have received your most courteous letters written to us by Froschauer, along with the bundle (as you call it) of letters and books for the leaders of our kingdom, most gracious teacher, from which we easily understand how much you have endeavored to make us even more indebted to you. Certainly, these bonds have long been tighter than we could hope to break even in this life of ours; however, be assured that we can never forget you here, nor do we gladly accept this parenthesis of yours (if it deserves to be called so); for unless we wish to be ungrateful and impious, we cannot but regard your great and greatest benefits as invaluable. For who, unless impious, would consider it of little value to be rightly instructed in piety (to say nothing of other infinite benefits)? It would be impiety not to always wish to respond with all our hearts, let alone to hold them in high regard. What you write, you write with the utmost humanity dictating. We, in turn, much more justly pray the same from you and your most upright family; and we also promise from the heart that as long as we live, we will be entirely yours, and we will always be able to use you as our own. What you write about your little daughter Elisabeth, we read with your dearest ones almost without tears: we hope she has recovered. Please diligently greet your chaste wife and your pious mother along with your whole family in our name.</p>
      <p>What you have enjoined, that we should inform you about the state of our kingdom from the fair and about our affairs, we always undertake to do with the most willing mind. Our Rainer did not come to this fair, because, as I hear, his wife recently passed away. He wrote to us; Froschauer will give you those letters: I did not want to include them here, because I would first like them to be read by Mr. Butler and Mr. Traheron, who are in Strasbourg with Mr. Sapidus; especially by Mr. Grynäus, because he particularly requested this from us, namely to be informed about the state of our kingdom or our affairs or those of others. Rainer mentions in his letters to us and also written to Froschauer about a certain Englishman, from whom he wanted us to learn everything more fully; but no such person has come here as far as we know. A certain German, from the fellowship of those merchants who are in London, told us amazing things about some saints who previously had fixed and immovable seats far from London; now they have ridden to London, and there they have performed astonishing things in the largest assembly. About the bearded image of the Kantian crucifix (in our language it is called The Rood of Grace near Maidstone), he reported to us as follows: it, while the Bishop of Rochester was preaching at the cross of St. Paul in London, in the most crowded assembly of nobles and others, with some of the most famous wooden and stone gods present, turned its head, rolled its eyes, foamed at the mouth, and shed tears down its cheeks, because the bishop had thundered so against these images: the attendants of the Kantian image of the saint did not do much differently. They hope that soon the Virgin of Walsingham, and St. Thomas of Canterbury, as well as other images, will also perform their miracles in the same place, which I suppose you understand well enough what kind they are; for the art of the worst impostors was so publicly exposed in that image of the crucifix, that all raged against these monks and such impostors, that they cursed the images and the worshippers of images. May God grant that we truly cast out all idols from our hearts!</p>
      <p>Always remember us, especially in prayers to God.</p>
      <p>Our companions Woodroffe, Peterson, and Finch, who are going to England with us, greet you and your family. Please greet Mr. Pellikan, Mr. Leo, and Mr. Theodor in our name: excuse us, if necessary, that we did not say goodbye to them; certainly, we cannot but wish them all the best and most fortunate, who have always deserved so well of us. May you fare well in the Lord, together with all yours. In Frankfurt, on the 12th day of April.</p>
      <p>Yours, NICHOLAS PARTRIDGE To the most vigilant bishop of the people of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, let these be delivered.</p>
