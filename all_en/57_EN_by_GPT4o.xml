    <p xml:id="regest1">It would be remarkable if the fleet of Philip II of Spain, the son of Emperor Charles V, [actually] entered Genoa, especially since a recently arrived letter from Italy to Celio Secondo Curione claimed the opposite.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">King Henry II of France will probably not hold [the throne] for long due to the numerous persecutions of Christians since his coronation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">What kind of a massive catastrophe do the presumptuous undertakings of the manslayer, Charles V, hint at? He plans to reinstate the imprisoned Christian II of Denmark as king and Charles III of Savoy as duke, as well as make his son Philip II the king of Italy and his nephew Maximilian the Roman-German king. Additionally, he wants to hand over the Duchy of Württemberg to his brother, King Ferdinand I, subdue the Swiss Confederates and Henry II, and triumph over Sultan Suleiman I and even over God! For he wants to decide on the religious question alone, regardless of what the [interim committee] will decide, which he himself set up with the imperial estates. This committee met for the first time on February 10, 1548, and consists, to avoid disputes, of theologians and also laymen like the [Mayor of Strasbourg] Jakob Sturm and the Mayor of Ulm [Georg Besserer]. Myconius has no knowledge of the others or the committee's plans. The ambitious emperor has convinced the simple-minded people that God is on his side. In reality, however, he is godless, as he lacks [faith in] Christ! Some of the Augsburg parish colleagues [N.N.] even dare to hope. But for what? Charles V is not God! And one should only hope in God. The ruler of the world [Charles V] should just be careful!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The people of Constance also place their hope in the emperor. But he has deceived all who hoped in him. The learned and the unlearned, the significant and the insignificant: They are all blind [to the truth]! Myconius can find no other reason for this than godlessness. Everyone prefers to live in the greatest misfortune on earth rather than in the greatest and infinite joy with the Lord! So little has years of preaching achieved! Even the pastors align themselves more with their disposition than with the word of God! The people of Constance behave similarly, and it seems that through their actions they want to provoke an attack on the Swiss Confederation or even its downfall! Therefore, it is not surprising that the Swiss Confederates disdain them. May God's will be done!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Konrad Wedenschwiler works as a typesetter for Christoph Froschauer the Elder. His wife [N.N.] will fully align herself with him; Bullinger can inform him of this if he happens to meet him. However, Wedenschwiler should arrange for a shared accommodation, as spouses should not live apart. Myconius agrees with this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Bullinger, who has already spoken with [Heinrich Messikommer] about his son, the letter carrier [Kaspar Messikommer], should, if possible, support [the education] of the latter. However, if he is to remain in his learned profession, Myconius is also fine with that.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Greetings, also to Rudolf Gwalther and Theodor Bibliander, from whom Myconius has heard nothing [more].</p>

      <p>Greetings. It would be remarkable if the ships of the emperor's son had indeed reached Genoa. Recently, letters arrived from Italy to Celio containing the opposite.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The French king, due to the frequent persecutions of Christians since the beginning of his reign, seems to foresee that he will not last long.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>What do you think the vain and grand efforts of the emperor indicate, if not some grave downfall? He wants to restore the captured Dane, restore the Duke of Savoy, make his son king in Italy, his brother's son king of Germany, return Württemberg to Ferdinand, subdue the Swiss, subdue the French, conquer the Turk, and conquer God! For he wants to reserve the judgment of religion to himself, regardless of what those appointed by him and the estates to reconcile it decide. On February 10th, they first convened, not only the learned but also laymen, to avoid disputes. Sturm is among them, as well as the consul of Ulm. I do not know the others. What they attempt is nothing to me. The emperor's ambitious mind is so set that he is judged by the simple to even have God, yet he is vacant of Him, because he is vacant of Christ. Some from the Augsburg brethren dare to say: I hope. Good God, from where do you hope? The emperor is not God, in whom alone all hope should be placed. Let the ruler of the world see!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Constance likewise hopes. But in him, who has so far deceived all who hoped thus. Men are blind, learned and unlearned, great and small. I cannot find a cause except impiety. We all prefer to live here in utmost unhappiness than with the Lord in utmost and perpetual joys. For we do not love the Lord, we love earthly things. So little has the doctrine of Christ, preached for so many years, advanced! We listen to our affections, not the word, even those of us who have placed ourselves in the line of battle. It is no wonder, therefore, that the confederates hold that city in such contempt, as most lack the word and are governed by mere affections. They act as if they want our confederation violated, indeed ended. Let what is good in the eyes of the Lord be done.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Wedenschwiler is working with Froschauer. If by chance you meet him, I would like you to tell him in one word that his wife will both send and do what she wants, provided there is a place where they can live together. For it is not fitting that married couples live apart. Let him see, therefore, how he can satisfy his wife in this matter. For he seems to me to think rightly.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Furthermore, the one who delivers this letter is the one about whom Mesicumerus, his father, spoke with you. If you can do anything for him in the Lord, I ask you to do so. However, if it pleases you that he returns to the art he learned, it will not be against me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell with yours in the Lord. Greet Gwalther and Theodor, who are silent towards me. Basel, the last day of February, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Os. Myc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of Christ, brother and most venerable colleague in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
