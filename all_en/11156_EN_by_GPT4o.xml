    <p xml:id="regest1">At a meeting of the [Reformed Swiss] cities on April 28 in Zurich - an invitation will follow - the response to Luther is to be discussed; fears disputes, as some, especially the people of Strasbourg, find the concessions in Zurich's draft do not go far enough. Signs do not accomplish what they signify, neither through words nor through their own power or the power of the officeholder. Wishes that Vadian would come.</p>

      <p> There will be a meeting here in ZÃ¼rich on Quasimodo Sunday of all the cities that are in dealings with Luther - you will be informed - to discuss what response to give to Luther. May God prevent greater tension and discord. Some are not pleased with the response proposed by my lords. For we are still not accommodating enough for some, especially the people of Strasbourg, regarding the sacraments. However, we will not fail to elevate it to the glory of the Lord. Signs signify and testify; they do not bring about what they signify, neither through the word nor through their own power or the power of the minister. Farewell. I wish you would come, etc. March 26, 1538. </p>
      <p> Your Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, most esteemed lord. </p>
