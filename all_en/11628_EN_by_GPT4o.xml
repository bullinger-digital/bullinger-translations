    <p xml:id="regest1">They are distressed that the devil has sown discord in the Neuchâtel church, but this can be overcome if all parties act according to their duty. [1.] It is up to Farel, as the shepherd of Christ's flock, to preach repentance and, like John the Baptist, to clearly name the vices, even if this brings hatred upon him, as Christ and the apostles have already predicted. Just as Paul and Athanasius were initially hated but later loved, it could also happen to him; above all, for the sake of those who listen to him, he should persevere in his office, pray for his sheep, and attend to them, then Christ will grant him victory over Satan. [2.] The pastors will recognize that the presence of the exceptionally gifted Farel is also important for the other congregations; he founded the Neuchâtel church, and because of his reputation, it is highly esteemed even in German lands. The pastors should bring the dispute between him and his accusers before a synod of pastors, councilors, and the best from the people and not allow his expulsion as long as no offense is proven against him. At the same time, they should ask God for assistance and admonish their congregations, but above all, prevent a pastor elected with their participation from being deprived of his office. [3.] The council is - like Jeroboam once was - called upon to listen to what God commands them and to keep His statutes [1 Kings 11:38]. The former means listening to the preachers and allowing them to preach as God commands them; otherwise, this authority is also subject to the accusation of Isaiah 30 [9f]. Keeping God's statutes means protecting the ecclesiastical order; it is the council's task to support the pastors in enforcing them. In the election of pastors, the proposal should come from the pastors, after which the council or the elders give their approval, and the elected is presented to his congregation by the leaders of the whole church; this, as well as the installation by laying on of hands, corresponds to the testimony of the Acts of the Apostles, the still uncorrupted canonical as well as the imperial law, and it is also practiced in Zurich; accordingly, the dismissal of a pastor must not occur without the consent of the clergy. The damage caused in Neuchâtel can be remedied if the council handles the matter dutifully according to the word of God and the example of the early church. [4.] The people should consider how much they sin if they rebel against God-given and proven shepherds like the fathers in the wilderness against Moses - Christ also threatened Jerusalem with disaster because of the persecution of the apostles -; ingratitude and disobedience call for God's judgment, and the rejection of faithful teachers does not remain without consequences for the people and the church. If Farel rebukes those entrusted to him in fatherly anger, they should not take offense but consider that the church is better served by this than by flattery. The people of Zurich therefore ask them to set aside their emotions and reconcile with each other and with Farel [Philippians 2:1-4]. They write this out of love for them and hope that Christ will lead them back to harmony; they also ask for intercession for the Zurich church.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. We are deeply saddened, dearest and most esteemed brothers in the Lord, that your church is somewhat divided, for it is certain that there is no other poison more pestilent to the church than schism. Indeed, our Lord Jesus Christ emphasized nothing more to His followers than the concord of brothers and the unity of the church, distinguishing His family by love as the most certain mark from all others. But also the chosen vessel, Paul, calls everyone to this and uniquely desires that all may be of one mind in Christ. For, I beseech you, brothers, he says, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</p>
      <p>However, the enemy of our salvation strives all the more diligently to dissolve this bond of concord, understanding clearly that the essence of true religion lies in the unity and concord of brothers, which he always desires to be undermined and overthrown. This is undoubtedly what he has attempted among you, and to some extent achieved, but he will not retain it for long if you turn to Christ our King and Lord, who has conquered him for us, each standing firmly in his own order, fighting bravely against him, and performing the duty assigned to each by the supreme commander. For it is not said in vain by the apostle: Submit yourselves therefore to God, resist the devil, and he will flee from you; draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.</p>
      <p>These are the things, dearest and most revered brother Farel in the Lord, that the Lord requires of you, as the first pastor of the Neuchâtel church: that you feed the flock of Christ which He purchased with His own blood, feeding them with the word of truth and life, according to the institution of Christ the supreme shepherd, who said to His apostles: Thus it was necessary for Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name. Moreover, he who truly teaches repentance certainly urges conversion to God and aversion from all evil and crimes most steadfastly, as we see John the Baptist was the forerunner of the Lord. Therefore, it is necessary for anyone who truly preaches repentance according to the rule of Christ to accurately describe and openly accuse and condemn sins, whatever and however great they may be. For where vices are given the names of virtues, there crimes reign instead of virtues, and where the foulness of crimes is not recognized, there is a slower departure from crimes. For the wicked do not understand how filthy their life is in the sight of the Lord. How can they understand from civil and veiled language unless the minister speaks plainly, calling a spade a spade, as the proverb celebrates?</p>
      <p>We therefore conclude that it is your duty, dearest Farel, to clearly and without veils, yet with prudence and gravity, according to the quality of the place and time, designate, accuse, and finally pursue the sins and crimes of the people fearlessly. We could demonstrate what we have proposed so far with the precepts and examples of Christ, the prophets, and the apostles, were it not that we knew we would be drawing water to the ocean with you, most skilled in sacred matters. However, the same master of life commanded that a remedy be applied to the inflicted wound, the merit of Christ, with all other methods of healing set aside. Although this is the most present and precious, various temptations arise from the ministry itself and the ministers, the hatred of the world, and severe persecution. The Lord Himself predicted this would happen in the gospel, and the apostolic examples confirm that it has happened, which undoubtedly console you if you endure similar hatred for the truth, thinking that nothing new has happened to you from the Lord. Indeed, the Spirit of the Lord and the examples of the apostles promise that those who once hated most fiercely will soon love most ardently.</p>
      <p>You know what happened to the Galatians and Paul, to Athanasius and the Alexandrians, and to many other leaders of the churches with their congregations. Therefore, we do not think, venerable brother in the Lord, that you should leave the church because of the stirred-up crowd and the hatred of many. For we hope that those who now pursue you with more than Vatinian hatred, carried away by their passions, will someday love you soberly. Moreover, the Lord in the gospel says: Whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.</p>
      <p>Therefore, whoever receives and hears you preaching the word of Christ should not be abandoned. The apostle came to Corinth, preached the word of salvation, but there were those who refused to hear, and there were those who sincerely desired the word of the gospel, whom such a great apostle did not think should be abandoned because of the more insolent ones, leaving the city. Therefore, you too should persevere in your ministry, to which you have been called. Pray to the Lord, the author and lover of peace, that He may restore to Himself the sheep somewhat snatched away from you, that they may return to the fold, not flee discipline and correction. Meanwhile, with Paul, transform yourself into all forms to bring back the erring to the way of salvation. These, I say, and similar things we consider to be your duty, O good shepherd: which if you execute with utmost faith and diligence, religion, and prudence, we have no doubt that Satan, now somewhat triumphant, will be overthrown, and now again led captive by the power of Christ through you.</p>
      <p>May Christ the victor grant this to you. Amen.</p>
      <p>To you, however, O fellow ministers, pastors, and preachers of the gospel, sons of God, through the churches of the city and the county of Neuchâtel, our Savior Himself said in the gospel: You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has lost its savor, with what shall it be salted? It is then good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden underfoot by men. You understand, by your learning and piety, what you should expect and what you should fear in the present affair of Farel, if you are tasteless, imprudent, and lazy. Salt preserves from decay and corruption by its sharpness. Therefore, preserve your churches and the ministries entrusted by the Lord with piety, counsel, prudence, and diligence. Your ministry will indeed be dislocated if Farel is expelled because of his frankness, and indeed your churches cannot be safe without a suitable and heroically gifted and distinguished minister, who in your primary city takes care of both the urban church and all your churches in the countryside. But whom will you find, I ask, more suitable for such a great matter than our Farel (may the word be without envy!)? Farel is pious, holy, prudent, temperate, brave, fearless, most learned, and most eloquent: in short, the divine goodness has most liberally poured into this one all the best gifts required of a faithful bishop. But he has also learned much through the same grace of God by long use and various exercises, moreover, he is old and has seen much in his aging. Through his ministry, the first rudiments and foundations of true religion were laid among you.</p>
      <p>The Lord has used his ministry for the greatest things, and there are many outstanding testimonies of his apostleship everywhere. He has endured persecutions and beatings in his body for the Lord.</p>
      <p>He has persevered invincible in the proclamation and confession of the truth in the greatest dangers until now. Hence, Farel's fame and glory in Christ are great and illustrious among the Germans, who have hitherto judged the Neuchâtel church to be most blessed for having received such a minister from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you should not easily allow such a great man to be expelled without merit and without a cause being stated. You are the salt of your churches: therefore, be prudent and steadfast, ensure that laws and rights prevail. Do what the church of Christ has always done since the times of the apostles. Therefore, let a synod be convened from pastors, senators, and even from the best and most holy of the people. Let Farel's accusers be summoned. Let the case be heard, known, and examined most diligently, justly, and equitably. But if anything is found to be a sin by Farel, remember the words of the apostle saying: Do not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses: those who sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. But if Farel has committed no sin, do not allow him to be expelled from the church, which still confesses the name of Christ and in which laws and rights still seem to prevail. Otherwise, this most wicked deed will set a bad example for all other churches. But even our papist enemies will condemn this levity, which they would never admit.</p>
      <p>Now, such great injustice and wantonness will provide no small offense to the weak. Meanwhile, while you act with utmost faith, also pray to the Lord God that He may shine favorably on all your counsels and deeds, teach everyone the judgment of God, exhort everyone to repentance, propose the threats and wrath of the Lord: above all, be careful that he is not deprived of his ministry without your consent, who was inaugurated into the ministry not without your votes, and initiated into this mystery. But may the Lord grant you, through His Son, our Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit, who may guide you in this matter.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>And you, most holy senate, most esteemed fathers and lords, hear the voice of the Lord your God through the prophet crying: If you will listen to all that I command you and walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes, keep my statutes and my commandments, I will be with you and build you up. For these words were not only spoken to Jeroboam but to all those in positions of eminence. Moreover, you hear what the Lord commands you when you hear the ministers preaching the word of the gospel in the name of Christ. And as He Himself commanded to teach, so allow, I pray, the ministers to teach, with no other rule of teaching prescribed to them: lest the Lord thunder those grave words against you which are read in Isaiah 30: This is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear the law of the Lord. For they say to the seers, Do not see! and to the prophets, Do not prophesy to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits. But you, most esteemed lords and brothers, are not those upon whom these dire words fall. Only be careful that they never find any place among you. Now, the statutes of the Lord are ecclesiastical rites instituted to exercise religion and faith, and to preserve the church in peace. In these, it is fitting to walk as instituted, and not to be elevated above the lawgiver and the decrees of God. The apostles of the Lord did not want the church to be without discipline: therefore, ecclesiastical discipline is a statute of God. When the ministers of the churches desire it to be restored, it is the duty of the holy magistrate to extend a helping hand and assist so that there is a certain method of admonishing sinners and restraining the wicked. For who would tolerate excessive petulance in a private household? And will the pastors of the people ordained by God tolerate the licentiousness of anyone in the church? It is an apostolic statute that bishops, that is, pastors or preachers, are not excluded from the ordination of bishops. For who, I ask, will judge better and more rightly about the doctrine and life of pastors than the pastors themselves? Therefore, the first counsel for choosing a pastor is rightly made by the pastors. Rightly, the vote of the senate or the elders is added. Most rightly, the elected is proposed to the whole people, to whom he is to be appointed, by those who are the leaders of the whole church, so that all things are done in the church by common votes. Thus it was done in the past, and in this manner, pastors were ordained by the laying on of hands, as testified by the Acts of the Apostles, the more sincere canons, and even the imperial law, as can be seen in some constitutions 1 2 3. Thus today also the ordination of pastors and ministers is observed and sacredly kept in our church in Zurich. However, whom you receive not without the counsel of pastors, you will remove from office in the same manner not without the judgment and consent of the bishops, if you wish to walk in the statutes of the Lord. And certainly, the Lord requires of you not only to know and hear His word and statutes, but rather to walk in His precepts and do His statutes. For to such He promises to be present, to such He promises to build up. Although Satan has somewhat shaken the holy building of God among you with his arts, you will easily repair the ruins even more closely if you do not fail in your duty, but according to the word of God and the example of the early church, you sustain Farel's cause, and defend the innocent, meanwhile asserting useful laws for the church. May the Lord increase your strength and virtue. Amen.</p>
      <p>But you, people, flock of Christ's sheep, consider, I pray, with your emotions set aside for a moment, what kind of pastors divine goodness has set over you, wise, pious, faithful, truthful, and everywhere the best and most praiseworthy men. Consider, I pray, how great a sin it is before the Lord to rebel against such. Consider what happened to the fathers in the desert who murmured and rose up against Moses and the elders. Our Lord Jesus said the gravest things to the Jerusalemites because the leaders of religion and teachers of piety persecuted the apostles and apostolic men. All the righteous blood shed on the earth will come upon you, He said, and your house will be left desolate. Beware, beware, dearest brothers, lest you be of the number of those who provoke divine judgment upon themselves by ingratitude and rebellion: rather love your leaders and obey them. You are not unaware that there are grave examples everywhere testifying that when faithful teachers are expelled without merit, the great happiness of the people and the peace of the church are simultaneously repelled and dissipated. If there is no other cause of your dissension than Farel's freer and more severe rebuke, consider what are the examples of the prophets and apostles, consider what the prince of pastors commands every pastor, consider what the morals of the world are and what common corruption deserves.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we are persuaded that you will be most unfortunate unless Farel is such as many would not want him to be. Believe us, Farel is a father who burns with holy zeal for his children, who knows how to act candidly, and has never learned to flatter and caress. And oh, if only we had more pastors of this kind today: for then ecclesiastical matters would be better and more rightly managed.</p>
      <p>There were among the Gentiles those who preferred to be relegated to ravens rather than to flatterers: therefore, your piety should be less offended by Farel's candor. Therefore, if anything has been conceived or designated against Farel by any of you out of passion through indignation and anger, we pray through the most ardent love of Christ and His most bitter death that, with passion set aside, you give no further place to the devil, but each forgiving the faults and sins of one another, first among yourselves all, then with Farel, your faithful pastor, return to grace. Indeed, if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill our joy, that you be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind, let nothing be done through strife or vainglory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves, let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.</p>
      <p>We write these things to you, most esteemed lords and brothers, plainly, candidly, sincerely, and without any pretense, because we love you and wish you well: so may Christ preserve us. We have loved your candor for several years now, we have gladly heard of your prompt obedience and liberal zeal for piety, and of your firm constancy. Therefore, we have now grieved more over that dissension of yours.</p>
      <p>But we hope that the little cloud, which for a short time disturbed your eyes, will now immediately disappear through divine grace. May the Lord Jesus bring you all back into the closest and most stable harmony with His Holy Spirit. We pray you, brothers, and be mindful of us and our churches in your prayers before the Lord. Zurich, 15th November, in the year of our Lord 1541.</p>
      <p>Your most loving and devoted Leo Jud, Caspar Megander, Erasmus Fabricius, Conrad Pellican, Theodor Bibliander, Heinrich Bullinger, and the other ministers of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful ministers of the churches, the Prefect, both Senates, and the entire people at Neuchâtel, dearest and most esteemed brothers and lords.</p>
