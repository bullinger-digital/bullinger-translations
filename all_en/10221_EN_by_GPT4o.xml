    <p xml:id="regest1">Informs that the manuscript of Bullinger's Lucretia drama, which Bullinger wanted to review and improve based on an oral agreement with Oporin in Bremgarten in 1531 before its publication, was stolen in Basel. Oporin could not prevent the publication; he apologizes for the incident. Bullinger should inform whether he has received the copy of his "Lucretia" made by Balthasar Lasius, which was sent to him by Gervasius Schuler. The manuscript should only be returned to him, Oporin himself, or Lasius.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The audacity, not to say recklessness, of certain individuals compels me, despite being very busy, to write to you, whom I know to be equally busy. You may still remember, dear Heinrich, my most esteemed friend, when I was with you in Bremgarten after our unfortunate defeat, among other things, we discussed your "Lucretia." You were surprised that we had a copy, and you expressed a desire to correct it in several places. You said it was more poured out than written, given the circumstances of the time and place. Therefore, I promised to send you a copy, as you complained that the original had been taken from you. And while I delayed, as I often do, the same thing happened to me as it did to you. Without my knowledge or consent, some of our people took the copied manuscript and began to publish it publicly. When I found out, I tried to prevent it, not without reason, until I could send you a copy, have it reviewed, and then returned to us with your permission and approval. We handed the received copy to Gervasius, both I and the one who wrote it, Balthasar Lasius, a man of exceptional integrity and faith, highly regarded by me and a friend, earnestly recommending that he send it to you. For he said he had a messenger going to you and seemed to agree with us. Whether you have received our copy or not, we wish to know from you as soon as possible. Furthermore, we wanted to excuse ourselves to you if you might be angry, as you rightfully could be, that it is being published without your review and correction, and perhaps even against your will as well as ours. We resisted as much as we could, as keeping faith with a friend was far more important to us than the favor of all those people. But they persist nonetheless. Thus, where we once hoped to gain favor with our fellow citizens, we have instead incurred a not insignificant amount of animosity from some. But I do not care, as long as I do not appear to have neglected my duty to you as well. Therefore, I wish to be freed from this concern as soon as possible. Lastly, we ask you not to send the copy to anyone else—if you have received it, which I doubt, as the trust of some in this matter has already failed me—but to return it to us, that is, to me or Balthasar. You will be doing us a great favor, and we will be ready to repay it with any service.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>February 11, 1533.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Oporinus.</p>
      <p>Greet most diligently in my name Pellican, Theodor, Fabricius, Collin, Binder, and finally your family.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest and most esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
