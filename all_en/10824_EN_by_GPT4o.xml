    <p xml:id="regest1">He has only skimmed Bullinger's speech on predestination and free will, which Bullinger sent to him and Matthias [Hirschgartner], but considers it the best thing ever written on this topic, as it leaves no room for wrongdoers to excuse their sins with the necessity of fate; Zwingli's "De providentia," on the other hand, would have been better left unpublished. Despite his concerns, Bullinger owes it to the truth to publish this speech. This is to be understood not as flattery, but as encouragement.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace of conscience through Christ.</p>
      <p>We have read the speech on divine providence, grace, and free will, which you delivered to the congregation of brothers some months ago, with great admiration and applause from all, and which was recently sent to us. Both Matthias and I have read it, as you instructed. I, indeed, as soon as it was delivered, skimmed through the main points, as we usually do, which greatly delight us and hold our strong admiration. The taste of the book, seen as if through a lattice, pleases us wonderfully, which invites me, when I have more leisure the next day, to devote myself entirely and solely to this discourse, reading it with judgment, and then, even for my smallness, to cut it to the quick (as they say), lingering longer, examining each point more precisely and carefully. By the immortal God, it cannot be said how much everything pleases. Oh, happy man and truly divine genius! May I perish if anything has been produced in this kind of debate and the almost inexplicable labyrinth of human industry by anyone that can be compared even a little to what your fertile and fruitful field of genius has produced for the use of the pious in this difficulty, whether you consider the truth itself, simplicity, clarity, order, the manner of discussion, the moderation of the matter, or the arguments of the writing, by which you clearly and firmly corroborate everything. We have heard so far that the worst of people flatter themselves and cover their misdeeds with that eternal and unchangeable series of things, which we call providence, and the Greeks call πεπρωμένην or εἱμαρμένην, by which it is necessary for whatever is to happen to happen, as this has been spread among the people by many, I do not know whether more imprudently or perniciously. As a result, those bound by sins flee to the necessity of providence as if to some sanctuary, and what they do most wickedly, they think should be attributed not to their own rashness but to fate. Thus, indeed, we see this matter of providence being handled without any moderation even by great men, so that they have made no one better by their obscure and indeed ambiguous discussion. Moreover, there are those who have written about the servitude of human will with equal thoughtlessness, so that they seem almost to take away all effort and the pursuit of living well and happily from man. But now let someone come forward who says here or in anyone that the power of the deity is diminished or the divine majesty is taken away even a little, or again complains that through your discourse anyone is given a more licentious occasion for sinning, so beautifully, truly, and with a certain pious prudence you seem to have moderated this intricate matter. This subject has long troubled the minds of philosophers, and then also of theologians, both ancient and recent, but with more trouble, if I am not mistaken, than fruit. I would like at least one to be produced from many who has not stumbled somewhere here, let alone been grossly mistaken. Therefore, it will seem unworthy to no truly learned and pious person if they understand that you openly dissent from great men known for their name and learning. I would wish that Zwingli's "De providentia" had either not been written or not published. For the examples - if no other causes - too foul and obscure, which he uses here, deserved obscurity rather than light. I speak with a faithful man; for I would not blurt this out among just anyone, as indeed they seem too Zwinglian.</p>
      <p>But to return to you, I urge your humanity, I pray and beseech you through Christ, to deign to communicate to the world what you have shown us. Believe me, this clear, simple, and lucid discourse of yours on such an obscure and almost inexplicable matter will deserve great praise and gratitude, as no work before this, elaborated by your industry, has been brought to light. However, I am not unaware of what you fear, that you suppress for so long a work so useful and plainly necessary in this time and complete in all respects. But I bid you to be at ease, for indeed here there is no danger that you should so greatly shrink from publication. You will have all truly pious people favorable, who will defend you from certain morose men, who can hardly bear to be torn away from the opinion they have once emancipated. And so you have the truth itself standing on your side, fighting vigorously for you. I consider it a great spirit if someone is not ashamed to dissent even from the greatest men, if the truth itself, which must be preferred to all things, suggests it, for indeed one should care more for the truth than for fame. Remember also how much greater the fruit of honesty is in conscience than in fame; for glory should follow, not be sought.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and may you be healthy and safe for a long time, most excellent and dearest of men. Do not persuade yourself that these things were written by me with a flattering mind, from which vice I have always naturally recoiled. Indeed, I could have attributed something greater to you if I did not fear to offend you greatly and to come into suspicion of flattery, which by my conscience I hate worse than a snake. But it seemed right to testify to what the matter was, to encourage you to publish what is prepared, which will be wonderfully beneficial to both the pious and the impious. The pious, if they do anything good, should ascribe it all to divine kindness, to which we owe even this, that we are; the impious and sinners should attribute their impiety to themselves. Once again, farewell and love your Lucius in return, who loves you most effusively.</p>
      <p>In the year 1536, on the eighth of the Ides of April.</p>
      <p>H. Lüthi.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Zurich church, dearest brother.</p>
