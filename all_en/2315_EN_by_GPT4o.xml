      <p>My friendly willing service to you always with ready diligence beforehand, venerable, gracious lord. Regarding Herr Martis, the preacher at Güttingen, taking and drawing up the original document, also making the preacher's face, this letter is to show this in many ways and to inform honorable people that I have been asked to accept the preaching, and I still do not want to perceive or see anything else, than that it has been assured by him with all diligence until now, and there is no complaint about it, is my entire dutiful request to your reverence, to promote it, also to assist and advise according to his desire. To earn such from your reverence, I want to offer myself entirely willingly at any time. Dated the 18th day of the month of June, in the year 54.</p>
      <p>Your Reverence's servant Wilhelm von Bernhausen, bailiff at Güttingen.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned lord, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at Zurich, my gracious lord.</p>
