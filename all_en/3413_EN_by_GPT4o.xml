      <p>S. D. We are indeed all in good health by the grace of our Lord God, and we give thanks to Him, for we understand that you and your entire family are in excellent health. Certainly, I have been without your letters for a long time, my most esteemed Friedrich, and not without discomfort, as I love you and take great delight in your letters, which is why I am not without discomfort for a long time without your most desired letters. However, I do not wish to cause you inconvenience in writing.</p>
      <p>I will consider it sufficient if you send brief letters occasionally, from which I can understand that you are well. Indeed, within the last two months, I have written extensive letters to Mr. Fabricius about various matters, with the condition that he immediately shares them with you once read. I also included a copy of my 26 sermons on the first discourse of Jeremiah, a newly published work, which he was to send to you. Since you make no mention of these in your letters, I am uncertain whether you have seen them or if they have been delivered to you. Perhaps, being distracted by business, you could not remember them; however, I would not want these to be lost or destroyed due to the negligence of messengers on the journey. I easily forgive that you have not visited us, especially with your affairs demanding so much attention.</p>
      <p>Therefore, no excuse would have been necessary. Our son Johannes is in good health by God's grace and is progressing well for his age. Due to my various affairs and recurring bodily weaknesses, I am unable to teach him at home as often as I would like, but I do examine him occasionally. Every day, he goes to the tutor for an hour, where he is taught along with others and is exercised in grammatical precepts. I keep him at home to prevent him from losing much good time by wandering; however, I often allow him time for recreation, knowing that excessive strictness can be as much a fault as excessive leniency or indulgence. In other respects, I care for him as I do for my own children.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, if he wants anything or is in need of something, I instruct him to inform me; for just as I abhor unnecessary expenses, I do not allow useful and necessary things to be lacking or scarcely available. He is provided with clothing as much as is sufficient; since he requested a tunic lined with fur, I will gladly do this as well.</p>
      <p>He still has the money you sent him; for I do not allow him to spend it at his own discretion or to buy things secretly. I have seen this very thing cause young men of great promise to lose their way several times.</p>
      <p>Again, I repeatedly urge him, if he wants anything, not to conceal it. It is never good for young boys to have secret money and to be able to buy and do what they want with it. He indeed has his money in his possession and in his chest; but if I ask, he must account for his expenses, so that he does not evade this.</p>
      <p>But he is frugal, and if he spends anything, he does so with my knowledge, although he still has most of your money intact. In short: I do not want you to be worried; I will not allow him to lack anything necessary; if you wish for anything else, you will let me know. Regarding the baths at Bromeis, I ask that you send the book to Mr. Gessner or bring it yourself, as time and opportunity permit. We have not received any news for a long time, except that the Burgundians have sent a delegation to Switzerland, which excuses the magistrate of the County of Burgundy, who, against his will (if what they say is true), allowed Bolvyler to lead an army through Burgundy. They fear that they may be attacked by the king in war, as they seem to have violated the neutrality, as they call it, obtained through the Swiss envoys. For it is said that the Burgundians did not fail Bolvyler against the French.</p>
      <p>For this reason, a Swiss diet has been convened at Baden. There are also those from the Swiss cantons and cities who are very displeased with the recent expedition of the Bernese, Fribourgers, and Valaisans against Bolvyler. "Since we are allies," they say, "should we not have been informed of this matter beforehand?" They are indignant that the expedition was undertaken without anything being communicated to them in the meantime. Therefore, this matter and some others will be discussed, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the French army and their plans, everything is silent. Rumor has it that there are attempts at peace among those monarchs.</p>
      <p>Would that a solid peace would eventually come together! It is certain that Philip is now burdening the Belgian region with unbearable exactions, not to mention tributes. We expect news daily from England, Poland, France, from where our envoys have not yet returned, and from Worms. If we receive any certain news, you will not be unaware.</p>
      <p>The book by Aegidius Tschudi is not available for sale here. It was published in Rhaetia some time ago, I believe in Basel; if you wish, I will arrange for it to be sent here from Basel, provided there are still some copies available.</p>
      <p>I have written in great haste and, when I began, I did not think I would write so extensively. Therefore, take it in good part.</p>
      <p>My entire family greets you; good men greet you. You will greet our friends, especially the excellent old man Mr. Travers, Mr. Peter Bergomate, and his colleague, who was recently here and was Johannes's tutor. I almost forgot to mention that I have been informed from Bern that there is great hope that the alliance between the Bernese and the Genevans will be renewed and that it has almost come together; may Christ grant that they settle it happily! Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 25, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Friedrich von Salis, residing in Samaden, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother. To the young lord Friedrich von Salis.</p>
