      <p>S. I have already written once about how the Freiburg matter turned out. Now they write back and are surprised that such a response was given to them; they also regret the conditions they had proposed, and thus the matter is prompted to a new meeting; when that will be, I do not yet know. As of today, 200 are supposed to march off to Freiburg; the captain of Cleri, who succeeded Fr√∂lich, has arranged this. They are heading to Lyon to a guard under the command there. I hear that some will also march from Solothurn. Yesterday, the Count of Angeschola, governor of Chur, as I hear, arrived here; he requests from my lord the passage, since the alliance with the House of Burgundy is in place, that he be allowed to lead his troops through Savoy alongside my lord's land without harm; he is willing to stay here as a hostage until the passage is granted, with 20 noblemen. Today, it will first be negotiated. I think nothing should be done without the advice of other Confederates. In Antwerp, we hear from the Basel merchants, things are bad.</p>
      <p>There are supposed to be 4 parties, the 1st papist, the 2nd Lutheran, the 3rd Martinist (different from the Lutherans), I believe, distinguished because of the ubiquity, the 4th Calvinist. The first three have joined forces and want to suppress these; they have sent help from the nearest cities; about 600 of them were killed by the others when they became aware of the matter. It is not known if it is true; it would be a bad affair. But I trust the Lutheran spirit as much as the papist.</p>
      <p>I suppose you now have certain news from Frankfurt; please share it with us. The people of Strasbourg have recently written to my lord about Gothic matters; I have extracted the summary, which I send to you here. You would find wonderful mysteries if they were true.</p>
      <p>Zanchi has not come to us; however, he wrote to me from Lausanne that he will come here after he has done his business in Geneva. Our people are averse to his name; his homeland is suspect to them; his past actions do not please them entirely. Hence, I think, no matter how much Beza has long since rolled this stone, that he may be called to Lausanne, no hope will shine for him here.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing. Steiger greets you much, as does Manuel; the same do the Zehenders, my father-in-law, and also my Blasius, who is here with me now along with his wife, his daughter. Diesbach himself writes. Greet all yours in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 2, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>If you please, send the Saxon to Beldi in Glarus in my name; for I have given him some hope about these matters in my letters.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his lord and compatriot, to be respected in many ways.</p>
