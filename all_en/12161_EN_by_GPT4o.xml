    <p xml:id="regest1">No distinguished person is pleased with Luther's "Short Confession," especially since Luther attacks the deceased and uses his God-given gifts for cursing. This reveals Luther's weakness, and one is admonished to humility and to recognize the talents of others. In contrast to Luther, who endangers the construction that God has begun to build with his servants, the response [of the Zurichers] is characterized by moderation. One should not consider Luther's current virulence, but rather his past merits. - Borrhaus declares himself ready to assist [the Zurichers]. - Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, [Kaspar] Megander, [Rudolf] Gwalther, and others.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The insults of Luther, most distinguished man, are, as is fitting, greatly displeasing to good men, both to those whom it should, and even to those whom we never thought it would, partly because he has armed the virulence of his tongue more petulantly against the dead, whom the common sense of nature spares, and partly because he has declared such arrogance in cursing by abusing so many and such excellent gifts of God, which neither age nor sacred profession and least of all the glory of God, who looks upon the humble, casts down the exalted, and exalts the humble, can bear. Therefore, he seems to have proposed in Luther an example of human frailty for us, by which we are admonished to learn how humbly each one should think of himself and to judge more fairly about the gifts and ornaments of others, and to strive to help, as we are members of that one most ample body, the gifts and talents of others, which the Lord grants to us according to the measure of the gift of Christ the head, by which the admirable structure of the church will be completed. But indeed, when Luther strives to tear down this building, which God the architect has begun to erect through his ministers, your response, because it cannot be omitted without the danger of piety and the mark of disgrace which he has cast, it is right that this very response of yours be considered good by good judges and patiently borne by the unjust. For I think that you have applied such moderation in defending, which befits professors of the gospel and does not offend modest men and convicts the immodest. For it is not what Luther's vehemence in slandering deserves at present that should be considered, but what gratitude is owed for the benefits previously conferred by him.</p>
      <p>As for me, if I can do anything that pertains to the benefit of the church and to adorning the dignity of the word of God, I will strive with my zeal and effort, as much as is in me, not to fail, and I will take care that in this part the pious understand that the will to do well is present in me.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man, with the most illustrious Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Kaspar Megander, Rudolf Gwalther, and other dear friends and brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Martin Borrhaus, yours.</p>
