      <p>Greetings. It has been a long time (most illustrious man and reverend father in Christ) since I last wrote to your piety. But what should I write, when I have nothing that could delight it?</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I send these few notes of the royal envoy, which you, if you are still unaware, can know and perhaps even desire. Please return this document if you can do so conveniently.</p>
      <p>The Venetian delegation is expected on the day of Saul and Paul, when a smaller assembly is to be held here, yet sufficiently attended given the nature of the matter (as I hear so far). We wish to know from you about that Glarus agreement.</p>
      <p>I recently purchased the library of Wolfgang Salet, to whom I learned you once wrote from letters. I found certain documents that contain things which a man ought not to speak.</p>
      <p>I sometimes send some of these to the lord orator, which contain French matters to be investigated, and in return, he himself sends others, which may be useful at some point. This Salet was the chief steward of the Bishop of Chur (a court master) and at the same time a secretary; but he was also the secretary of the Bayonne royal envoy. These are the documents (as you know) that this envoy mentions here.</p>
      <p>I now experience how dangerous it is to entrust everything to letters and documents. Therefore, I ask you, if I wrote certain things to you in those early years or even later, which, if made public, could inconvenience me at some point, that you would be willing to burn or tear them up. I cannot say more.</p>
      <p>I write this in great haste, now exhausted by so many sermons, with which I have been occupied these days. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>I wish that this year may begin happily for you and end most happily. Chur, on the first of January, 1560.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. You are the current new world pope, who is the brother of the old castellan of Müß, who waged war on the Bündner, and has a sister married to Unterems, which is why the post goes to Unterems, to win the bread of supplication. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, and his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
