      <p>S. D. Finally, I am sending the response of a certain good man to those questions of yours; however, I ask that you return to me the handwriting of this, that is, these letters, or tear them up and destroy them.</p>
      <p>If the Gugelbergs saw the handwriting, they would easily recognize it.</p>
      <p>For a long time, he did not want to respond, fearing that it might someday be a disadvantage to him.</p>
      <p>From France, we have nothing new, except that the Lyon fairs are said to have been crowded and everything quite peaceful.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it is written from Rome on November 2nd in this sense: "The Pope last week dispatched the most reverend Lord Beria to the Emperor, the most reverend of the Holy Cross to the French, and the most reverend Viscount to the Spanish as envoys to request that they meet in a certain place to conclude what needs to be concluded for the termination and execution of the Council of Trent against all princes and republics declared heretical by the council, etc.</p>
      <p>The Cardinal of Lorraine was here in Rome, who is thought to be the architect of these plans. The same obtained the illustrious Lord Francesco d'Este, uncle of the Duke of Ferrara, to set out on behalf of all the princes of Italy to the King of France to demand vengeance against the harmful men in France, especially against those by whose counsel and instigation Guise was killed" etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, just as from ancient times murders, wars, fires, treacheries, and parricides have emerged from this den of wolves in Rome, so now also the harlot, drunk with the blood of the saints, offers the scarlet cup to all princes.</p>
      <p>Come, Lord Jesus, and finally cast down this beast! A movement has arisen in Calabria.</p>
      <p>It is reported that due to heavy exactions by Philip, about 6000 have defected and are being aided by certain nobles.</p>
      <p>The Spaniards are being gathered against them; having clashed several times, the defectors have emerged superior.</p>
      <p>Now it is said that over 2000 Spaniards have landed in Genoa; it is uncertain, however, whether they will also set out for Calabria.</p>
      <p>A new tax has been imposed on the Milanese, because of which everyone is complaining, etc. On the 22nd of this month, Bernardino Ochino, minister of the Italian church, was deposed from his office and expelled from the city and territory by the most honorable senate of our city because of his 30 dialogues published and printed in Basel, containing many wrong and harmful things; hence there are offenses and complaints.</p>
      <p>Thus we are continually exercised by both enemies and false brothers.</p>
      <p>The same cause is being dealt with in Basel, where Castellio translates into Latin, etc.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for us continually.</p>
      <p>May all yours be safe! Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 29, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Leutmerken in Thurgau, my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Leutmerken.</p>
