    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks for the letters [No. 2384] and [No. 2385] from Ambrosius Blarer and his brother [Thomas].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger has seen the four-page mourning poem about Luther's death. He deserved better, for despite his faults, he was a significant and capable [servant] of God. Bullinger expects more appropriate [tributes] to the deceased. [In his letter No. 2376] he did not express his own opinion about Luther's death, but that of others. He is well aware that now many writers will further worsen the negative views [of Luther]. However, the purity of the doctrine cannot be trampled in the filth of impure people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- What Bullinger wrote about B[ucer], he truly meant. He also knows how Blarer would judge this if he could express himself freely. Of course, what he wrote about [Bucer] is not meant for everyone. It pains him to see how many supporters [Bucer] has. However, this shows how the truth could once be obscured in the old church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Theodor [Bibliander] and [Konrad] Hofherr will write.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger does not doubt Blarer's loyalty.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- He sends back the [document] about the "Pseudo-Frederick". It is a similar case to that of [Tile Kolup], whom Count Rudolf of Habsburg had burned [in the year 1285]. If only Germany would accept Christ and not others!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [P.S.:] If Bullinger's letter [to Johannes Haller] [No. 2377] has not yet been sent to Augsburg, Blarer should give it to the bearer [...] [of the present letter]. He will soon travel there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Bullinger awaits Blarer's judgment on his writing [“De sacramentis”].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Blarer should report whether the [Constance] doctor [Johann] Menlishofer is still alive, as [Hans Rudolf] Lavater holds him in high regard and would like to ask for his advice.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I received the very welcome letter from your brother, my most esteemed lord, and also yours, Ambrosius, my dearest brother, and I thank you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have seen the printed four-page poem about the fate of Luther of blessed memory, and I do not begrudge him such an epitaph. Whoever wrote it, let them not execute the deaths of the weak and delicate with a pen so feeble and soft.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Luther deserved other and more powerful and serious tributes, for although he had his flaws, he was nevertheless great, faithful, diligent, and strong in the house of the Lord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But I expect more precise and worthy tributes from the more prudent. Certainly not because I expect better from some after Luther's death, I wrote this, but I mentioned what others hope for. I know, I know there are many ignorant and reckless writers who will now leap forth and make the worst of their bad cause. This must be allowed to happen in its time and measure. Meanwhile, the sincerity of the doctrine must not be betrayed or left under the feet of some who do not ruminate in filth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>What I wrote about B[ucer], I certainly wrote from the heart. I cannot feel otherwise. I have serious reasons, and I am not unaware of what you would judge if your mind were to be freely and fully examined; but what I say to you, I do not say to everyone. However, I add here: I am deeply saddened that he has so many supporters. From this, I gather how the truth was once obscured among many learned men in the old church, etc. May the Lord enlighten us with His illustrious and truly holy spirit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Theodor [Bibliander] and Curio himself will write about Curio. I do not doubt your loyalty. Continue to be as you have been until now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I send back the nonsense about the "Pseudo-Frederick", whom I consider to be exactly like the one whom King Rudolf, Count of Habsburg, burned not far from Cologne. If only Germany would frequently remember the Lord's words: "I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him" [John 5:43]! May the Lord keep you and all yours. Zurich, March 22, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>If you have not yet sent my letters written to Augsburg, give them to this bearer; he will soon go to Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I eagerly await your judgment on my book. Dear friend, inform me whether Doctor Menlishofer is still alive. My lord Mayor Lavater has great faith in him. If he is still around, could he perhaps write some advice? Let me know an answer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Ambrosius Blarer, his incomparable brother. Constance.</p>
