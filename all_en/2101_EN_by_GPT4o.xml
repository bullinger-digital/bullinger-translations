      <p>I received your letter today, my always esteemed and dearest B[ullinger]. To let you know, I wanted to ensure this promptly through the woman from your area who sells cloth. I sent your letter to Vulpius, also advising him that if he wishes to reply or send anything, he should do so as soon as possible; for I will ensure that you receive his letters along with mine. Therefore, I am waiting to see what he will do. - As you write that you owe me everything, I consider myself most fortunate in this regard, not undeservedly, for I have exchanged my bronze for your gold. You see how much you have bound yourself to me for such trifles, to your own great profit. I truly wish that what you write is valid, and that we both owe each other everything, although in countless ways your condition is worse than mine. I earnestly pray to the Lord for better health worthy of your brother Gor... </p>
      <p>The Sch[wenckfeldian] doctrines, which I thought had long been uprooted from the hearts of many, are remarkably sprouting again, causing me no small trouble, since, apart from others, some of my dearest are corrupted by this leaven. I am working diligently, as you advise, and I am glad that you support me with your holy prayers, and I know you remind your own in time, as you do.</p>
      <p>It is not indeed but plainly a present poison, first... those who have once unwittingly imbibed it, scarcely or at least not without great difficulty, ever return to health.</p>
      <p>JESUS CHRIST, who is also our king, seated at the right hand of majesty on high, may he promptly restrain the blasphemies of these people, who... obscure his glory in an execrable manner... and full of consolation in him... without the miserable schism of the churches of God, which are otherwise shaken by many evils in these times. From these disturbances, may he sharpen our studies and prayers and persistently pray. May he make us always successful in our ministry, abundantly instructing us with his spirit... that through us gloriously soon...</p>
      <p>As for my brother, I am very glad that he dealt with you so familiarly and closely, but not for you, who could have spent your time better. - Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother, with all yours, whom I ask to always favor...</p>
      <p>Our people greet you both lovingly and reverently... Greetings to the brothers and friends who are there... with the others, whose pious wishes I am helped by. Farewell again. In Biel/Bienne, December 7, 153... of your relative, do not doubt, always dutifully...</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
