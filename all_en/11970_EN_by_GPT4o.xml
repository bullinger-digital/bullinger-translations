    <p xml:id="regest1">A citizen of Basel reported from the Diet of Speyer that Emperor [Charles V] had demanded from the Catholics to implement the articles discussed in Regensburg [1541] concerning the doctrine of justification, communion under both kinds, and the marriage of priests into practice. However, the Bavarian [Duke Wilhelm IV or Duke Ludwig X] and the Salzburg [Administrator Ernst of Bavaria] had rejected this, while the Bishop of Mainz [Albrecht of Brandenburg] demonstrated his [negative] stance by his departure, and the remaining cities and bishops were uncertain; perhaps the Emperor would completely free the faith. Near Entzheim, ten soldiers on their way to France were captured by [imperial] horsemen; in Strasbourg, an uprising threatens as a French and an imperial party stand opposed and many have been arrested; a comet has appeared. Gast thanks for considering his recommendation for Leodegar [Hirsgarter], who seems suitable to him for a school position. Oporin sends as a gift through Leodegar [Guillaume] Postel's "De orbis [terrae] concordia"; Gast sends a writing of Luther along with a catechism; if it is not the desired book, Bullinger should return it.</p>

      <p>S. Furthermore, it should be absolutely certain, I heard from a certain citizen of ours, who was at the Diet of Speyer, that the Emperor had summoned all the Catholics, that is, the papists, and admonished them to allow the ministers of the word to freely disseminate these articles, which were sufficiently debated in Regensburg, so that Germany might finally come to concord. This means that preachers should be instructed to solidly present the article of justification to the people, to administer communion to the people under both kinds, and to allow the marriage of priests. They deliberated for three days. The Bavarian, along with the Bishop of Salzburg, said they had already been instructed otherwise, previously misled by scholars, but now they know better and are informed about what kind of poison lies hidden in these articles; therefore, they will not admit these articles at all.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Mainz gave no response, but his departure indicated his opinion. The remaining bishops and cities do not know which way to turn.</p>
      <p>Those who do not fully understand the Emperor's mind fear the deceptions laid for them. Perhaps the Emperor will allow everyone to believe whatever they want by some mandate.</p>
      <p>Not far from Entzheim, ten soldiers were captured; wanting to travel to France through Lorraine, they were hanged (wurden aufgeh√§ngt) by horsemen who roam around because of the French soldiers. In Strasbourg, everything is escalating into sedition. They have factions in the city; one extols the Emperor's name, the other adheres to the French, many have been captured. Everything is full of fear. A comet appeared in the sky these days. I have this from trustworthy men who saw it with their own eyes. It extended its tail to the south and was seen at 2 o'clock at night. What it portends, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>Moreover, because my letters have benefited Leodegar in some way, I thank you greatly in both my name and his. Certainly, the young man is worthy of a scholastic position due to his gentle nature and other gifts with which he is endowed.</p>
      <p>Oporinus has long wanted to send the book "De orbis concordia" by Postel, if a courier had presented himself; he sends it through Leodegar and asks you to accept this little gift with the spirit in which it is sent. I send Luther's book along with a catechism and still doubt whether you wanted that book; if I erred, return it.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 6, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the city of Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
