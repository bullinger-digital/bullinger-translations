    <p xml:id="regest1">In recent days, Kilchmeyer received two letters from Bullinger [not received]. One was delivered by Benedikt Schürmeister, the other by an Italian [Petrus Franciscus Rizardus], who served as a pastor in Thusis for three years. Bullinger should know how happy Kilchmeyer is because of both letters: For he has now learned, on the one hand, that the receipt issued by [Benedikt Bähler], which he had taken care of, has arrived safely with Bullinger. On the other hand, he now knows that with his last letter [18022 from January 31, 1548], he was not only able to alleviate Bullinger's sorrow over his infrequent letters but also to reaffirm their old friendship. Bullinger had already imagined the worst in this regard, suffering more than necessary (as people often do). But far from it! It would never have occurred to Kilchmeyer to no longer consider Bullinger as one of his confidants. It would be completely absurd to turn away from his old, always highly reliable friend. But enough of that! Such things must be proven more by deeds than by words.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Kilchmeyer recently handed over [his announced] letter for Kaspar Seidensticker to Nikolaus Pfister for delivery [to Thunstetten], which contains Bullinger's request to Seidensticker to return the [receipt] mistakenly sent to him back to Zurich. If Seidensticker has this document, Bullinger will undoubtedly receive it back soon. The mistake happened only due to his workload!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Kilchmeyer read and explained the part from Bullinger's letter about the disobedience of the Bernese students in Zurich to the [other] Bernese schoolmasters with the utmost care. Here, the proverbial shoe pinches him very much! For hardly had Kilchmeyer managed with great effort to ensure that the Bernese students were sent not to the Bucerian school [in Strasbourg] but to Zurich, when they nullified all his efforts! [With their behavior] they not only undermine his tireless and exhausting efforts for the reputation of the Bernese Church but also raise the suspicion that Kilchmeyer acted out of envy towards the Bucerian school. Yet the Bernese Church and the Confederation are better served in their turbulent circumstances with [orientation towards] Zurich! What ingratitude! What can one expect from these people, who have behaved in such a manner in their youth, when they are old? The statement [of the Bernese Council] is still pending. If the students are not completely foolish, they will already be able to anticipate the punishment threatening them. As Kilchmeyer believes, after Easter not only a messenger [authorized by the Bernese Council] should be sent [to Zurich] to pay off the creditors [N.N.] of the students, but also their punishment for their disobedience and ingratitude should be imposed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The Bernese [schoolmasters] have, as Bullinger requested, decided to only accept Zurich [students] with a letter of recommendation. They now intend to strictly adhere to this decision, which has long been overdue. If Kilchmeyer is not mistaken, the two young men, Adam [Frey] from Dietlikon and Ezechiel [Ramp], the son of the Wildberg pastor [Johannes Ramp], can confirm this: For when they came to him last week and asked for his support [for admission to the Bernese school], he dismissed them in such a way that they will probably not return soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">A certain Joachim Forrer from Winterthur is also hanging around in Bern. When he very eloquently asked Kilchmeyer [for a position], he proved to be (like many young people!) conceited and could not present a letter of recommendation from the Zurichers. Therefore, Kilchmeyer advised him to try his luck elsewhere.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Bullinger can learn about the situation of Johannes Gisling from Junker Jakob Rordorf.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Finally, Bullinger should learn from Rordorf and Rizardus, the bearer of the present letter, what Kilchmeyer is currently occupied with and struggling with by God's command, namely the difficulties caused by the French [Johannes Calvin and Pierre Viret], for which Simon Sulzer and Beat Gering are undoubtedly responsible! Since Kilchmeyer's means and strength are not sufficient to withstand this disastrous discord, and Johannes Haller's [transfer] to Bern [by the Zurichers] was rejected, he has decided to request his resignation after the negotiation (the successful conclusion of which he does not doubt!).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Greetings, also to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and family as well as to all colleagues, especially to Augustin Fries. Also, greetings from Eberhard von Rümlang, Johannes Wäber, and Nikolaus Pfister, who reliably support the Kilchmeyer exhausted by his old age and diverse life experiences.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Another greeting. The Zurichers should never forget to pray for the Bernese Church and the common good of the Confederation.</p>

      <p>S. In recent days, I received two letters from you, dearest brother, one through Benedikt Schürmeister, the other through a certain Roman, who served as a preacher in Thusis for three years. I want you to know how greatly these letters have delighted me, partly because I learned from them that the receipt I had taken care of, as you wrote, was faithfully delivered to you, and partly because the sorrow caused by the infrequency and rarity of my letters was not only dispelled by a single letter of mine but also our old friendship was renewed and confirmed. You had imagined, more in thought than in reality (as often happens among mortals), that something had diminished between us. For it would never be possible for me to think of you in such a way, as I have never considered removing even the slightest from the number of brothers. So far from it, I have never decided to renounce an old friend, whom I have always found most faithful in loyalty and duty. Since I believe that such matters should be testified more by deeds than by words, enough has been said on this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In recent days, I arranged for certain letters to be delivered to Kaspar Seidensticker through the efforts of our Artopaeus, concerning the error in the receipt committed by you due to the diversity of your occupations. I have no doubt that if he has it, you will soon have it as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Furthermore, regarding the shameful obstinacy of our students (oh shame!), I read and explained your letters with the utmost diligence to our schoolmasters. For here, as the proverb says, the shoe pinches me not a little, because after many labors and all my efforts, it has hardly come to pass that our students were sent to Zurich instead of the Bucerian school, and now they nullify all my efforts! They not only undermine the zeal, which, taking away all my rest, exhausts my strength daily for the promotion of the Bernese Church, but also make me suspect as if I had acted more out of envy towards the Bucerian school than to better serve our church and the troubled affairs of the Swiss through Zurich. Oh, ingratitude! If they do such things in their youth, what, I ask, is to be expected from them in their dry old age? The punishment they will bear (unless they are completely foolish!) can easily be anticipated by the delay in response. I believe that after the Easter festival, a delegate will be sent, by whose efforts and mandate satisfaction will be given, not only to those to whom our students owe, but also they will bear the deserved punishment for their disobedience and ingratitude.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>As you advise that none of yours should be accepted by us without presenting letters, we have long since deemed this most necessary and will firmly adhere to it. If I am not mistaken, those two young men, Adam von Dietlikon and Ezechiel, the son of the pastor in Wildberg, who came to me last week and implored my help, can best pronounce and testify this about me, as they were dismissed in such a way that I easily believe they will not return immediately.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>A certain Joachim Forrer from Winterthur is also wandering among us, who recently approached me with many elegant words. However, since he appeared arrogant, as our young men often are, having no letters from you, I advised him to shake another tree.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Inquire about the state of our Gislinger from our compadre Junker Rordorf.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Finally, how the Lord guides me, in what He wants me to be engaged, recognized, and exercised, and what recent business has arisen and been imposed on me, namely by the French undoubtedly through the machinations of Sulzer and Batti, partly explore from our aforementioned compadre, partly from that Roman, the bearer of the present letter. Once the business is successfully completed, as I do not doubt, I intend to request permission and leave to depart. For my resources and strength are too meager, especially with Haller denied to us, to withstand this most pestilent discord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell with your wife, entire family. Greet all the brothers in Christ, especially my Fries. All greet you, Mr. Eberhard von Rümlang, Textor, Artopaeus, extending their hands to me with the utmost faith through the grace given to them, worn out by old age and various experiences.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Again, farewell to all in the Lord and never forget in your prayers to God the church of ours and the common salvation of our Switzerland! Bern, March 11, 1548.</p>
      <p>I. K., always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most renowned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor at the provostry of Zurich, always to be respected as his lord and brother.</p>
