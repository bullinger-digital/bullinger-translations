      <p>Greetings. You see (reverend father in Christ) with what cunning our enemies are once again attacking us. By the grace of God, we had escaped one evil, but behold, another looms from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Without a doubt, the monster that these men have long nurtured is now finally breaking out. This is the worst scheme of the adversaries.</p>
      <p>For those who are ill-disposed towards the cause of Glarus are plotting such things: they will claim that unless those Papists in Valtellina are appeased, there is a danger of rebellion, and therefore either something must be conceded to them and the Jesuits admitted, or both must be expelled together; if neither is done, sedition is to be feared, for which our men must be kept at home, etc. Be assured of this: all those who support the bishop's side openly oppose the cause of Glarus, including the old Achitophel and his other accomplices; they would have done more if we had not driven the bishop into such straits. You see to what arts they turn, and therefore, if there is any hope of a settlement at Baden, you will also commend this matter along with our delegates from Beccaria, or ensure it is commended by your senate. If there is no hope of settlement and the matter entirely points to arms, I do not think much effort should be expended in this cause, since the outcome of the war, whether joyful or (God forbid) sad, will bring much weight to this cause as well, in either direction. You will return the letters of the brothers in Valtellina, and inform us at your leisure of what is happening at Baden. For that delay torments us greatly.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I see and hear in our parts what I would not wish to see and hear. Satan does not rest with his Antichrist, and therefore our delegates must be urged by yours. A meeting has been set for a prominent man from the Upper League to go to Ragatz in the house of the abbot, which was visited by both parties. There, the Tschudis have dared to suggest to the man from the Upper League that he should ensure that his lords from the Leagues respond in writing to the Five Places; for they have come under suspicion from them, as if they were willing to help the new believers in Glarus. What else was handled there, I cannot know.</p>
      <p>But I know that this man from the Upper League, who has been good and evangelical until now, and to whom the landammann Beldi writes much and considers him the best in the Upper League, now also begins to use the words that in the Upper League they are not of one mind, and one cannot easily leave the land; a foreign people might also settle by the lake, etc., and other things.</p>
      <p>For the Tschudis have openly said to him: "If you remain quiet in the Leagues, you are safe; but if you break out, see that no foreign guests come into the land." I also know that the Tschudis have behaved so bitterly that when the man from the Upper League pointed out peace and unity and made them understand what was at stake if it should lead to an internal war, they have shown themselves in such a way that no lasting peace can be hoped for from them.</p>
      <p>This I have learned from the very one who was part of it. Hundreds of such things happen that do not come to us.</p>
      <p>Surely, vain are the sons of men, deceitful are the sons of men; if they are weighed in the scales, they are altogether lighter than vanity. Therefore, what I said at the beginning, I repeat: our delegates must be urged.</p>
      <p>But in the meantime, all hope must be placed in one God, for whom it is equally easy to conquer with a small hand as with a great one. It is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in man.</p>
      <p>Your booklets have been returned to us; a note was attached, written on January 4th. Many are your labors, which we pray with utmost wishes that God may prosper and preserve you for us for a long time. We know well how much you can contribute to these afflicted matters.</p>
      <p>We give you immense thanks for those books of yours with which you gift us. I have received no letters since that time; our merchants have not returned; for due to the scarcity of water, they are delayed longer on the road. I have given this to your citizen Sp√∂nli and hope he will take good care of it.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, with all yours, as happily as possible. Our people wish you well.</p>
      <p>Chur, January 20, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, whom you know.</p>
      <p>After brother Guido explained the matter of the Valtellina, I understood there was no need to join it with the matter of Beccaria.</p>
      <p>For the main issue is the cause of the Jesuits, and we (if God wills to help us) will not fail ourselves and the church. This brother says that the Papists of that place expect war and are not secretly rejoicing, while our people in turn fear, not the enemies, but our sins. From each community, Papist leaders will be sent with a great weight of gold, which they have collected, to advocate for the cause of the Jesuits at the next assembly.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Florence is believed to be alive.</p>
      <p>The servant of Ems (the one from Ems is not yet a cardinal; for the other cardinals impede, claiming a declared council) has come from Rome, has not lingered here, and rides away by night. He says there was a terrifying storm in Rome during the Christmas holidays, with thunder and lightning, as if it were the middle of August. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and much-respected patron.</p>
