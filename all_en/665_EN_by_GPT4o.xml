      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. We have offered our service to this brother, most beloved Lord and brother in Christ, Lingkius and I. Our council has decided to instruct the envoy, whom it is going to send to Baden, to act in a way that will be for the glory of Christ, for their duty, and for the benefit of the people of Lucerne. Three gold coins have been given for travel expenses. I am compelled to report to you things that cannot be written without the greatest sorrow: Finally, the faction of the Franco-Germans has prevailed so much, and with such strange practices, which will eventually burst forth, that, [Greek], the greater part has defeated the better. I hear (which I tell you in confidence) that more than twenty were absent from this council decision.</p>
      <p>It was obtained by the same five votes that, with the freedom of the country prostituted and Christ set aside, a treaty was entered into with the impious king. We did not fail in the business of Christ, so much so that even shouting to the point of hoarseness, both the Sylvanians and Transsylvanians heard us. Pray to the Lord for us. Please also greet for us D. Theodor, D. Pellicanus, D. Gualtherus. Sebastian and Lingkius and the other brothers wish you well.</p>
      <p>In haste, from Schaffhausen, on the 30th of August, in the year 1549. Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in doctrine and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich, his most beloved Lord and brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
