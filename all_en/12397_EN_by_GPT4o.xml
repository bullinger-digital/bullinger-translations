    <p xml:id="regest1">Hindermann found in [Marburg] a copy of Martin [Luther's] [„Contra 32 articulos Lovaniensium theologistarum“] and wanted to send a self-made copy of it to Bullinger. Since the printer [Christian Egenolff the Elder or Andreas Kolbe] intended to reprint the writing, Hindermann postponed his plan. Only now does he send it through a compatriot [...], especially since Bullinger, who already has the Leuven articles (Hindermann once copied them for him), probably does not yet possess [Luther's] recently published refutation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Emperor [Charles V] is allegedly raising an army against the Evangelicals. On January 18, the wedding of Wigand Happel with Johann Eisermann's daughter [Katharina] took place, in which [the Zurich students] were allowed to participate. Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] sent his daughter [Anna of Hesse] on January 13, accompanied by her mother [Christine of Saxony], the midwife [Elschen von Löwenstein], and some nobles to his son-in-law, [Count] Wolfgang of [Palatinate]-Zweibrücken. On February 6, [Christine] returned to Marburg. On January 26, [Philip] came to Marburg, traveled from there to Frankfurt for the [Schmalkaldic] League meeting, and returned on February 9. In Marburg, he listened to the long-pending trials regarding the land on the Lahn, as well as the cases of some students who were mistreated by citizens. Theobald Thamer has begun [lectures on the] Revelation and intends to finish them in three or four weeks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Due to the widespread hardship and high prices, the university writes daily petitions for food to the Landgrave, who helps as much as he can. In Wittenberg and Leipzig, everything is cheaper. In [Marburg], however, many [students], though fortunately not yet the [Zurich ones], have to pay 30 guilders for board. The messenger [...] can report more on the astonishing fact that such high prices prevail in such a fertile area; he was present when there was a commotion before the court because of the grain. Bullinger should continue to care for the students, who will follow his instructions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings to the family, to his relative Theodor [Bibliander], and among others to [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>S. P. D. I unexpectedly found here (most learned man) the refutation by Lord Martin [Luther] of the articles that are plainly contrary to our doctrine, which the theologians of Leuven recently dared to publish quite impiously. Therefore, I wanted to copy and send it to you, because only one copy was found here. But since our printer promised to print it, I postponed it for the present, and now I send it to you through the present messenger, our compatriot, especially for this reason, because I knew you had the previous articles of the Leuven theologians, as you gave them to me to copy when I was at home, and also because I was fully convinced that this refutation of the articles had not reached you, as it has only just been published. You (as you are accustomed) for your humanity, if you have these articles of Lord Martin before, kindly regard them from me and consider them fairly and favorably; for I think it sufficient that I wanted to send these to you.</p>

      <p>There is nothing new besides, except that it is said that the Emperor [Charles V] is raising a great army against the Evangelicals. Whether this is true or not, I do not declare. Then Master Wigand celebrated a most splendid wedding on January 18 with the daughter of Lord Ferrarius, in which we were also deemed worthy to participate. Good gods, how much preparation you would have seen for 3 days, how great a crown of learned men! The third thing I want you to know: On January 13, the Prince sent his daughter, accompanied by her mother and some ladies-in-waiting and nobles, to her son-in-law, Duke Wolfgang of Zweibrücken. On February 6, the mother returned to Marburg and stayed there for a few days. Then the Prince himself came to Marburg on January 26 to go to Frankfurt, where the assembly is. On February 9, he returned to us in Marburg. There he stayed for a few days with his whole court and heard the cases that had been pending for a long time around the Lahn tract, as well as those of some students who were greatly wronged by the citizens, wounded and torn in strange ways. I also want you to know that Lord Theobald has now begun the Apocalypse, briefly touching on everything, intending to finish in 3 or 4 weeks.</p>

      <p>There is nothing new with us besides, except that the same with us (alas!) is the greatest scarcity and dearness of all things. Daily supplicatory letters are sent from the academy to the Prince for grain, who helps as much as he can. In Wittenberg and Leipzig, everything is bought at a lower price. Many among us are obliged to pay 30 guilders for board; which, however, we (praise be to God!) are not yet compelled to do. But you may wonder why there is such great dearness in a region of grain; we ourselves wonder, and all others. However, the present messenger will be able to tell you the whole matter. He saw how great the rush to the court for grain was recently. These things I wanted to inform you of, most merciful father, so that you might know the state of us all. You, as you have always looked out for the church and our welfare, do not cease to do so further. We will do what is fair and just.</p>

      <p>Kindly regard my uncultivated letters and greet all patrons in our name. Farewell. In the name of all, greet your whole family, Lord Theodor, my most esteemed relative, and others, Lord Pellican, etc.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Opisander of Zurich, your most observant. Marburg, 1546, February 10.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and faithful minister of the Zurich church, Lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
