      <p>The grace of God be with us. True, beloved father, know that today at 9 I arrived well in Kappel and found our dear cousin very frail and weak, but in true faith, patience, and steadfastness, very comforting; for he still recognized me well and understood well what I spoke with him and gave good indications. This lasted until about two in the afternoon; but then the swelling broke in him and the phlegm passed over his heart, so that he immediately peacefully departed from this time and was taken by God from this vale of tears into eternal joy and blessedness.</p>
      <p>God Almighty be praised, that He has delivered him in the time of tribulation and taken him into the number of His chosen, and grant us all that we may be found at all times in the same true faith. Tomorrow, if it is God's will, we intend to honorably bury him in the earth around 9 before noon. And here is our friendly request to our dear brother-in-law Bagharten, to whom you may also read this letter, that he may lend us his black cloth, which he bought for his dear late wife and still keeps, so that we can lay it over the tree, etc., and the good cousin may be carried to the grave more honorably. The city is always ready to deserve him. The messenger shall stay overnight in cousin Josue's house and set out early in the morning, so that he may be back here before nine. We do not consider it necessary for anyone to come out in this wild weather, but we wanted to inform you of this tonight, so that you know that he has been graciously redeemed by God. May He keep us all in His grace at all times.</p>
      <p>Your obedient dear son Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his honored beloved father, to respond.</p>
      <p>My brother Mr. Hans Bullinger's blessed illness and passing on August 15, in the evening around 3, in the year 1570.</p>
