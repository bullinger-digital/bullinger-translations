    <p xml:id="regest1">As Grynäus may have already written, [at the Regensburg Religious Colloquy] there is a fierce struggle over transubstantiation, the invocation of saints, intercession for the dead, and the mass, while the opponents have unexpectedly made significant concessions on the doctrine of justification. Duke [Wilhelm] of Cleves has gone to France with 300 horses to bring home his bride [Jeanne d’Albret]; his mounted army is unmatched in Germany, and his marriage will pain Emperor [Charles V]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If Grynäus has not written, we have finally received this: The matter, because it is in the hands of a few, almost overwhelms them due to its magnitude. Transubstantiation, the intercession of saints, prayers for the dead, and the mass are the main obstacles.</p>
      <p>The opponents have conceded on the matter of justification, which they thought everyone would attack them on most fiercely. None of the scholastics ever reached this point.</p>
      <p>They ask that the brothers implore the Lord in prayers to send help. The rest is: Duke Wilhelm of Cleves has gone to France to bring back his bride with three hundred horses. There is no cavalry in Germany like the one he has. The marriage will grieve Emperor Charles V, although he himself is the reason why the Duke has taken a French bride. I cannot write more due to business.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours. I wish Theodore and Pellicanus well. Basel, 27th of May, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
