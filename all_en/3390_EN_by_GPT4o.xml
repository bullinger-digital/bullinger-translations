      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, reverend father, I had to write in the utmost haste, so much so that there is a risk you may not be able to read it well, and indeed I am ashamed to respond so tumultuously to your courteous letters. Forgive me, I beg you, most illustrious man; for in such a rush of occupations, which surrounded me eagerly, I could not do better. But yesterday's haste was also to blame for my omission of some things, with which (believe me) I would not have been troublesome to you, a very busy man, unless the requests of some had urged me to do so.</p>
      <p>In recent days, we had with us a man of the highest rank among us, Augustin von Salis, who said he had a nephew (if I am not mistaken) from his sister, aged 14 or thereabouts, whom he had decided to send to Zürich not so much for studies as for the sake of learning the German language. Therefore, he asked me to intercede with you by letter, so that with your help he might be able to manage comfortably with you. I agreed to do this, as I cannot deny my service to such a great man.</p>
      <p>Now I ask and beg you, most illustrious man, if it is possible, to look out for accommodation for him and to ensure that I am informed of what you have accomplished before our market days, either through my relative. He will bring the boy with him to the upcoming St. Martin's fair.</p>
      <p>But I would be pleased if you could also write about what money would be needed, so that I could inform him properly, and he would know how to arrange himself accordingly. These things also hastily.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and forgive me for taking advantage of your kindness. I have explained the reason why I trouble you so often.</p>
      <p>Give our greetings to your most honorable wife first and then to all your other family members. Chur, November 2, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of Zürich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
