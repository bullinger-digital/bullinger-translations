      <p>Greetings and Best Wishes. Although I have nothing that necessitates writing, most honorable Bullinger, I am not at all willing to let this letter go completely empty, as I am accustomed to not missing even the smallest opportunity to write to friends, unless hindered by more serious matters. These days, the most grievous death of Doctor Hedion has been announced to me, who on the twentieth day of this month fell asleep in the Lord, to the great lament of the church of Strasbourg; may it not be that the funerals of such great men portend to us a great famine of the divine word throughout Germany.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is said to be only four German miles away from the French, which makes us continually expect some news, whether good or bad, as God will have it. The Duke of Alba, while hurrying to Metz with his cavalry to observe the city already being besieged by the Emperor, is said to have barely escaped with flight on the twentieth day of October, having been attacked with great force by the French or Germans who were in the garrison, and not to have lost many. I hear nothing certain about the Margrave of Brandenburg, in whom many, however, have little trust. The Prince of Mansfeld is said to be arriving from Lower Germany with twenty-four companies of infantry and a thousand cavalry, presumably to assist the French or to impede the Emperor's crossing of the Rhine. We must pray and beseech God to finally liberate Germany from the wickedness of such great tyrants, to preserve the pious, and to protect His church with a strong arm against the Antichrist and the gates of hell. Amen. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 28, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your [faithful] Conrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the man of renowned learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, incomparable friend. Zürich.</p>
