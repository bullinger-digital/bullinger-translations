      <p>S. In your letter dated January 28, you wish to know the outcome of the Valaisian uprising; it is as follows: On January 29, my lords' envoys returned home from</p>
      <p>Valais together with the envoys of the Five Cantons and Solothurn; Junker Gladi Mei, who was one of the envoys, told me the whole affair. The cause of the uproar was that initially, when the French alliance was proposed, all the districts rejected it except one.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the pensioners managed to obtain a copy of the treaty, bribed with money, and persuaded six districts to join. The seventh, the Leuk district, never wanted to agree. When the envoys were sent to France to seal the treaty and returned, the treaty was somewhat different from the copy, especially regarding the article that their land should always be open to the King of France. This caused much discontent and murmuring; moreover, it was rumored that the envoys (who returned from France) had behaved arrogantly, which was offensive to the common people. Nevertheless, no one wanted to initiate an uprising until finally, many of them dressed in devil's clothes, hung themselves with cow tails and bells, carried long staffs, similar to how the peasants in Zurich once did. They began running through the land from one village to another, from one district to another, shouting and jumping so much that people thought they were possessed by the devil, as Junker Gladi said.</p>
      <p>They made the people restless everywhere and stirred up the masses. The sensible people of the land were greatly concerned about the unrest; for once, all the districts gathered together; they found the counsel that it would be more appropriate to march out with the banners than with the masses; thus, unjust violence could be better prevented than otherwise, and everyone was ordered to the banners by honor and oath. So all seven banners marched together to Sion, where they feasted and drank. Meanwhile, my lords' and other Confederates' envoys arrived. When the Valaisians became aware of them, they had both German and French announced; whoever wanted to seek the common good should gather at a designated place. This caused a great commotion and gathering.</p>
      <p>However, the land captain was so prudent that he immediately separated the districts and ordered each to its banner under threat of life and limb. Thus, each district deliberated separately, and the envoys rode to each, and in the end, the matter was brought to a proper resolution, so that six men from each district were appointed as judges, before whom the pensioners and others had to account for their actions. Thus, they withdrew with the banners, but during the withdrawal, they strongly trusted the appointed judges to act justly, or they would soon return with the masses to house and court. So the envoys rode off and came here together. They were treated honorably; however, a fine matter occurred here during their stay, quite laughable. Among the envoys was the treasurer from Uri, Muhenheim; this year, he had taken away the wife of a citizen here, Niklaus Sultzer, brother of Sulceri. She was the daughter of the late Cuntz. When she went on a bath trip to Valais, he was also there, and they came together so that the whore did not stay long with her husband, ran after the boys to Uri, behaved there so that the wife became aware of her and also drove her away. So she came back here and the man divorced her. Meanwhile, she stayed here with one of her relatives, named Heini Müller, who hoped he might bring her back to her husband, so he kept her with him. When the treasurer from Uri returned from Valais with the other envoys, he went to her on the night of January 30, came to Heini Müller's house at midnight and into the whore's chamber. Müller had long suspected something was wrong; he got up from bed, grabbed a spade, went into the whore's chamber, found him there, and began to beat him so that he feared for his life and shouted: "Oh, my lords from Uri's sake." When he heard he was from Uri, he first realized the joke and said: "Are you from Uri? You are the one who brought the whore here and there. What are you doing here?" and beat him even more. Meanwhile, the treasurer's servant ran to help him. Müller's son also got up, caught the servant at the Carthusian and threw him down the stairs, breaking an arm. So Müller let him run away that night, though well beaten, and the treasurer left his sword and other things behind. He became the mockery and finger-pointing of all the Confederates. The whore also escaped. It would be good if all the lechers fared the same. That is the news with us. Furthermore, much is said about a great downfall of Spanish troops that perished for the emperor in Zeeland, and also how the city of Brunswick was supposed to be betrayed; I think they know more about it than I do.</p>
      <p>There is no need to write about the rest. I am now expecting the envoys every hour to know what the lord and the most honorable council of Zurich have decided about me. Farewell.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially Mr. Musculus, my wife and family with all of yours, whom I also wish to be greeted from me. Bern, February 7, 1550.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
