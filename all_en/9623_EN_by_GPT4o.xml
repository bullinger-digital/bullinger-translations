      <p>Greetings. You know, dear brother, that the week is approaching in which there is almost daily preaching, not to mention my weakened strength, which I mention so that you are not unaware of the reason if I am brief in writing now and perhaps remain silent for the next 14 days, unless some necessity compels me to write.</p>
      <p>Regarding Ganthner, a man corrupted by sects and seditious and malicious, I had decided to say nothing more. You remember what I last wrote to you about him; unless this man is restrained, he will cause great harm to the church, and the magistrate would have rightly decided about him if only, as he stubbornly persists in evil, the magistrate would also execute its decrees. He abhors the Lord's Supper because it is the bond of union, 1.</p>
      <p>Cor. 10., from which he recoils; he is not a member of the church, therefore he recoils from communicating with us. He comments on dignity, as if dignity were in us and not rather in faith in the blood of Christ. The faithful are worthy not because of their merits, but because their hearts are purified by faith, John 15, Acts 15. Because he is devoid of faith, he recoils from the supper. It is a strange judgment of God that he was a teacher of the church for so long and shows himself so disgracefully in the highest matters of faith and has wiped away all shame. May the Lord have mercy on him and convert him or restrain him.</p>
      <p>I congratulate our Pontisella of blessed memory, that he has migrated to the Lord and is freed from those evils, which I fear the survivors may regret being entangled in because of life. If his son reflects his father in faith and diligence, it would not be unjust for him to succeed his father in the school; thus he would also aspire less to the sacred chair, from which many things distract him, age, inexperience, no exercise, knowledge of theology, etc. The widow and his other children could be consulted and an argument of gratitude could be shown if the son succeeded the father. - It is absolutely necessary to petition the magistrate with arguments, not with the seditions of the people, which must be suppressed if they want to arise, with all faith and diligence and constancy, to restrain the audacity of the bishop, to whom it is not granted what he thinks.</p>
      <p>An inquisitor should be sent to him, and he should be frankly written to, not to presume more than is fitting. Regarding tithes, not religion, a composition has been made; they want religion to remain inviolate. Bishops, monks, and priests act like the wicked boys who throw a stone into a tree; if something falls, they leave it and throw more; if nothing falls and they are reproached for it, they say:</p>
      <p>"What harm if it had succeeded?" and run away shamelessly, etc.</p>
      <p>The Austrians hold the old position. They often remind me of the history of Joachim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, the kings; may God's mercy prevent us from ever experiencing such a thing! It is written from Antwerp on March 12 that the Turkish fleet is at sea and has sunk and captured several Spanish ships; but since you, who are closer to Italy, say nothing of this, I consider it to be false.</p>
      <p>The affairs of Prince William of Orange are not in a bad place so far. I will write more certain things when the merchants return from Frankfurt. Those who come from France report everything filled with tumults, but nothing certain. Our villages are still contending with the people of Schaffhausen about Paradise; I wish that Paradise does not become Hell! I am reluctant to write about these things.</p>
      <p>I approached Josiah; he has not yet been able to find anyone to whom he could entrust letters. He has arranged a copy of his book "On the Presence of Christ" for you, as well as for Campello and Lentulo individually, and in addition, a copy of his library for Campello. Today Martin Gobler gave him hope that he would like to enclose it in a vessel and bring it to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever. Greet the honorable consuls, Mr. Gregory, Victor, Francis Bellincet, etc.</p>
      <p>Most quickly. April 2, 1574.</p>
      <p>I fear there is a red tumult brewing in Innsbruck.</p>
      <p>May the Lord overturn wicked plans!</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear lord and brother.</p>
