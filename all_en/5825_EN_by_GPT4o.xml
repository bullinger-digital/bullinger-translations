      <p>Duke Erich of Brunswick, after he overran the Bishop of Münster and extorted 60,000 thalers from him, has moved on to Gmünd, where he also extorted the town, plundered, set it on fire, and acted very unjustly and unprincely. Because of this, the Landgrave and Gilch gathered 6,000 horsemen and foot soldiers against him, and the old Duke Heinrich of Brunswick intended to take Duke Erich's land; however, it is not known in what manner, perhaps so that others would not take it and he could give it back to him later.</p>
      <p>But Duke Erich, who had about 20 companies of soldiers under him, each with 800 men, is now back in his land.</p>
      <p>New misfortune is brewing between the Dukes in Saxony and Duke August, the Elector, who was supposed to pay them a large sum of money for the electoral dignity and other matters but has not paid anything. Therefore, one of the Dukes of Saxony himself rode to him and kindly requested that he fulfill the payment according to the agreement. To this, he replied that he did not have it, did not know, and could not pay them; however, since Leipzig was pledged to them for this reason, he wanted to take the risk and play with him to see if Leipzig was entirely his or if he owed nothing more for the debt and was free of it.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Saxony said he could not take possession of it alone, as it also concerned the others, but he would write to them about it, which he did, and received the answer that he could well take the risk with their consent; for they were not very concerned about it.</p>
      <p>Thus, they played, and the Duke of Saxony won Leipzig from Duke August; but the Elector does not want to let him have it, etc., which has left him and the others very dissatisfied, and they want to have it resolved shortly, although he initially brought it to the Duke of Saxony.</p>
      <p>Thus, there is concern that great discord will arise from this.</p>
      <p>May the dear God provide a way and means for them to come to an agreement with each other otherwise, etc.!</p>
