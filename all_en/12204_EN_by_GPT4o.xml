    <p xml:id="regest1">As the doctor Nikolaus [de Copeaux] is going to [Konrad] Gessner in Zurich and Bullinger has [not received] Curione's last letter urging him to write more often, Curione is sending this letter with [de Copeaux], who will report [orally] on the situation in Lausanne. - Curione thanks the people of Zurich, who, as a result of his communicated opinion, have agreed to forgo a Latin version of their refutation of Luther's [“Kurtz bekentnis”], even though it is now claimed that a Latin response has indeed been written. If this is true, the people of Zurich must have had good reasons for it. Curione asks for further information. - He would also like to know what has happened with Zwingli's works in the meantime. As soon as he learns the price from Bullinger, he will send [the amount] so as not to have to do without this reading any longer. The companion [...] of Nicolas [de Copeaux] is to return to [Lausanne] soon and has agreed to deliver any shipment. - Greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], the children, and the other brothers. Greetings from Curione's wife [Margarita Bianca, née Isacchi] and the children.</p>

      <p>Celio Secondo Curione sends many greetings through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>When Dr. Nikolaus, a pious man and a very good friend to us, informed me that he was going to Zurich, I did not want to miss the opportunity, dearest brother and most esteemed by me, to send you this brief letter. I did this even more willingly because in your previous letters to me, you requested that I write to you more often. Therefore, I am doing so now and will continue to do so in the future, not missing anyone whom I think might be coming to you, to whom I will not give a letter. And, to inform you about our situation, I see no need, since you have Dr. Nikolaus, who is going primarily to Dr. Gessner, from whom you can receive all the information about what is happening and being done here.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, we thank you for giving so much weight to our judgment and advice in your previous letters, indicating that you would only publish the book responding to Luther's calumnies in German. And although I hear that you have since changed your mind and have published that booklet not only in German but also in Latin, we do not doubt that you (with your prudence) have been led by suitable and just reasons to do so; not because I have seen the booklet itself, but because I have heard that you have done so. Since this is the case, I will not hesitate to approve what is reported to have been done by you, even though your letters can confirm me in this opinion.</p>
      <p>Regarding the books of Zwingli, a truly divine man, I do not know what has been done since. Indeed, if I am informed by you about the price, I will send it to you as soon as possible, so that I may not be deprived any longer of the benefit of their holy and learned reading. Our Dr. Nikolaus has a companion who (as I believe) will return to us immediately; if you give him anything to bring to us, he promises to deliver it.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ Jesus, our only savior, my dearest and most esteemed Bullinger, and greet your wife, a woman full of charity and good works, along with your sweetest children. Also, greet all the other brothers, who are most delightful to me. My wife, grateful for your kindness, and the children send their greetings to you. Pray to God the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ for us.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, May 12, 1545.</p>
      <p>Celio S. C., yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor and evangelist of the Zurich church, my dearest and most esteemed brother. In Zurich.</p>
