      <p> Greetings. I have been silent for longer than usual and against my custom and will, because I was lacking messengers; for none presented themselves to me except the current bearer, and I was all the more pleased when he arrived. I fully agree with you and yours regarding the people of Locarno, and I do not doubt that the other cities have entangled themselves in another's fault; for not even the smallest appearance of agreement should have been admitted when it concerns the subversion of religion, nor should evils be done, even through dissimulation, so that good or lesser evils may result. </p>
      <p> May the Lord therefore strengthen yours and inflame ours with the zealous love of His. I am eager to know what is currently happening with the best brothers. I thank you for the shared writing containing the summary of the arbitrary opinion and the letter from Philipp to Calvin, and I will in turn share with you anything I receive that is worthy of reading. Germany is still pressing the Diet of Augsburg, and there are those who affirm that King Ferdinand and Christoph, Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, have already gone there; others deny it and say that Ferdinand is detained by the Turkish incursions into Transylvania. The Roman Pontiff has granted and confirmed the fief of the Duchy of Milan to King Philipp. In Corsica, the French are said to be pressing the enemy hard and have gathered a huge supply in Marseille, increasing their forces in Piedmont, presumably to turn the weight of the war towards Italy and free Siena from siege. The Franciscans in France are said to have recently abducted a noble virgin, who had arranged a place and time in their temple for a young man to speak with her secretly about marriage, and after abusing her for three nights, they buried her in that temple. The crime was discovered by someone who was locked in the temple that very night, by divine providence, as he had fallen asleep during evening prayers, and fearing for himself, he hid in a corner. At dawn, when the doors were opened, he immediately reported the matter to the magistrates, and thus the monks were condemned to the stake, but because they appealed the judges' sentence, they were transported to Paris in two carts to be judged by the parliament. But farewell in the Lord with all yours. Basel, January 12, 1555. </p>
      <p> Yours, Sulzer. </p>
