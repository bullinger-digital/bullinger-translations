    <p xml:id="regest1">Cannot write in detail, as the letter carrier unexpectedly returned quickly from Nuremberg and because he himself is heavily occupied with the dispute with [Sebastian] Franck. Franck, who will move to Basel, has filed a complaint against him because he admonished him in a letter and brought to his attention a reproach communicated by Melanchthon; he writes this to Bullinger so that he can inform Gryn√§us and offer him a report from Frecht. Since Gervasius [Schuler] has meanwhile traveled to Zurich, he only briefly addresses Bullinger's letter: The concern that the Nuremberg religious discussion would mix Lutheran and papal religion is unfounded; since he himself is being considered as a possible participant, but has heard nothing about the planned meeting after the Diet of Worms, he doubts its occurrence; he does not want to rule out that it could be beneficial, but the same mistakes must not be made as with the [Kappel] Peace. News about Luther's appearance in Leipzig, the refusal of Turkish aid by the Catholic estates, stays of Bucer in Worms and of Blarer in Augsburg, the Emperor's marriage plans, a Persian victory over the Turks, and an alliance of the Persians and Tatars against the Turks.

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Your fellow citizen, as you write, a wonderfully ingenious and, as it appears, a pious and upright man, recently delivered your letters to me. As I was expecting his return from Nuremberg, I seem to have been disappointed in my hope; for, being greatly occupied with both the common affairs of the church and the conflicts with the sectarians, which are not insignificant here, I came home later than usual today. I was informed that the young man had been here, advising that if I wished to write to Zurich, I should do so in time. However, since tomorrow, besides the theological lecture, I might also have to respond to that impudent braggart Franck in the senate, I could not now respond in more detail to your letter, which is filled with pious care and concern for the welfare of the churches.</p>
      <p>Franck, who is about to leave for Basel these days, is causing me trouble; for he wanted to complain to me in front of the consul that I had written him letters that he found quite injurious. However, I had written him, as he was soon to depart from here, brotherly letters, if I am not mistaken, in which I again urged the man, who had been admonished so many times, to repentance and also warned him out of zeal that unless he removes and retracts the scandals he has caused to the church of Christ and the state, and the rash writings, he would see things he would be better off not experiencing. But he impudently and boldly seized upon this as if I could have written nothing more atrocious to him, who was about to leave for another place. I also took the occasion for this letter to Franck from Melanchthon's letters sent to me at the end of June; for Philip complains to me that Franck had threatened him atrociously at the last Frankfurt fair, to which a pious heart wishes nothing but a better mind and a love of simple truth, which I also wished for Franck, yet I am forced to hear that I am dealing with him unjustly. I mention these things so that when Franck comes to Basel and slanders me there and elsewhere, you at least have the basis for my future apology and can write to Grynaeus, if you have the time, that I will soon describe to him everything that has been done here with Franck quite brotherly, but in vain; for he everywhere babbles that the people of Ulm have dealt with him either little or not at all in terms of faith, even though he is forced to leave for another place. However, that cunning braggart interprets this as if he is free to return here whenever he pleases. But I refrain from bothering you with these matters.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned at the beginning, I cannot now respond in more detail to your letter. However, I wrote to our Gervasius, the Memmingen churchman, a most dear brother, one or two weeks ago, and these days a good man from Memmingen wrote to me that Gervasius had gone to Zurich. I believe he has either in person or by letter explained to you those things that are worth writing back to you about; for it is not, my venerable Bullinger, that either you or anyone else who wishes well for the church of Christ from the heart should think it advisable to forge one religion from the Lutheran and papal religion at the Nuremberg assembly. There will not be, I hope, if this assembly proceeds, such concord-makers who sew a new patch on an old garment or an old patch on a new one.</p>
      <p>The field of the Lord is not to be sown with seeds of different kinds, and reconciliation is to be established in the Lord and completed only after consulting other churches. But why do I mention these things? Nothing has yet been said or entrusted to me (whom some even unwillingly make a future concord-maker) or to my colleagues about this assembly from the recent Diet of Worms, so that I also subscribe to those who conjecture that this assembly will proceed like a crab. However, with all due respect to better judgment, I do not subscribe to those who are of the opinion that, before the concord-makers meet, they should decide that nothing can be dealt with at such an assembly in Nuremberg that could be of any use to the churches. Therefore, my Bullinger, you may be assured in this matter; for, as you piously advise, I will never be an author, either for myself or for others, that anything unworthy of the gospel be established in any assembly. For the dangers of others, as it is said, should make us cautious. May the Lord forbid that such things be established anywhere as those which, for the sake of public peace, have been established in the common Helvetic dominion, which, though they cannot be corrected, must nevertheless be tolerated. I would not want you to think that I wrote this to the disgrace of your noble people. But I refrain; for the rest, Gervasius.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new that I do not think you already know. Luther is said to be preaching in Leipzig. The papists have denied King Ferdinand aid against the Turk. Bucer is staying in Worms, called by the most pious prince of the Hessians. Blarer is said to be advising the church of Christ in Augsburg. It is not yet certain whether Charles wants to marry the daughter of the King of England or of the King of France. The King of Persia has destroyed the son of the Turkish emperor with an army. There are rumors of great alliances between the Tartars and the King of Persia against the Turk. I cannot write more, for I have not even been able to reread this. Therefore, forgive me and farewell with the brothers, especially Mr. Pellican.</p>
      <p>In haste, Ulm, July 3, 1539.</p>
      <p>Frecht.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich, of singular doctrine and innocence of life, a venerable lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
