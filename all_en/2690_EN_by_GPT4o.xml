      <p>Greetings. The letters you sent me with the booklets have been faithfully delivered to me. I was instructed to present one of them to our consul and to express his greatest thanks to you in his own words. I also express my gratitude for the way you honor me with your constant generosity. May the Lord always shower you and your household with His most abundant blessings and make everything prosper for you, amen. I believe, however, that the consul himself has found a little leisure to write something to you with his own hand, which I have strongly encouraged him to do.</p>
      <p>There is a persistent rumor that the Polish are steadfastly contemplating the Christian reformation of their kingdom, and may this be fortunate and auspicious for them; for if the advice of their neighbors prevails, they will undoubtedly become sworn enemies to us and our churches; you understand whom I mean. May the Lord Jesus Christ strongly defend the truth of His gospel against all who do not follow its right rule, and may He make us all, inspired by His one Spirit, think and speak the same and be united in every way, so that we may continually contribute all our efforts, studies, plans, and labors to the propagation of His kingdom with common prayers. We experience more than enough adversaries otherwise, even if we vigorously pursue our cause, which is Christ's, with the utmost unity of spirit.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I received letters from Theodor Beza, in which (after Calvin's letter, which he sent eight days ago) he writes that the church in Geneva is now in great tranquility and that the progress of the gospel is incredible, which good fortune we should remember to continually implore the Lord for with faithful prayers.</p>
      <p>The Emperor lifted the siege of Marienburg in Picardy, and the king brought in provisions for the town to last two years. In Italy, the Emperor's forces are strong; the king is still gathering his, as you know, so it seems the summer will not pass without a great struggle for him.</p>
      <p>Regarding the affairs of England, Thomas Sampson writes from Strasbourg: "The adversaries are cruelly burning the members of Christ; but the more they burn, the more the prisons are filled, indeed they are so full that they are forced to release a great multitude on bail. For now, they flock to the bishops in groups of hundreds, publicly professing to hold the same faith as those whom they burn, and the more adversaries burn, the greater the number of confessors becomes; thus the blood of Christians becomes the seed of the gospel. Papal bulls have recently arrived in England for the burning of three bishops, Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer; but their death is not yet certain. The queen had not yet given birth by June 26, though she suffered labor pains. Moreover, it is said of the evangelicals that they have already hindered her with some enchantments, and even that they have killed the child in her womb, for which some, along with Athanasius, have been accused and thrown into prison. England is very fearful for itself, and not without reason, from the King of Denmark, whom the French, with their Scots, arm against England. In Scotland, 50 Danish ships have arrived with soldiers and war instruments, and 100 or more are expected. They attempt nothing in England yet; soon we will see what monster they are nurturing." So far Thomas.</p>
      <p>Our consul Welser wrote to me yesterday: "Nothing is resolved at the Reichstag; the priests will not yield. However, since there is no peace, they should consider something better; for the princes will not deviate from the truth of Christ. I pray from the heart that the Lord grants them His grace. There is peace with the Sophy and the Turks; if there is a campaign against Hungary, the king should be more willing for peace; if not, we must entrust it to God the Lord.</p>
      <p>The King of Denmark's armada has arrived in Scotland with 70 ships, 4 miles from Edinburgh, intending to make his brother or son king in Scotland and have the gospel preached. You might think that he will want to help the English with the Scots towards the gospel, as they will soon join him, since they have now been forced away from it with violence, which many pious hearts will rejoice in.</p>
      <p>The king is negotiating with the estates to establish a peace in the land; afterwards, if this is agreed upon, he will make a decision in religion; however, whoever does not agree to it is not obliged to accept the peace in the land, even if he had already agreed to it. And yet, if the peace in the land is concluded, he wants to make an alliance with those who are in it, so that there would be two parties and all sorts of consequences would follow. The Turk demands Transylvania for Wida; the king cannot give it, and if he wants to have it, there will be no unity in the Reich.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, with all the brothers and friends, especially your household. Pray for us to the Lord Jesus Christ, that He may protect us, His little sheep, from these grievous wolves with His mighty hand on the right and left and bless us eternally with His solid salvation. My Funck and Wittenbach commend themselves to you diligently, whose servant is to bring back his wife; Wittenbach does not seem to be serving as a soldier now, as the pay is counted stingily, which means that some others also stay at home for a while until the king's generosity flows more abundantly. Biel, August 9, 1555.</p>
      <p>I ask you to ensure that the letters addressed to Mangold are delivered to him as soon as possible by the boy.</p>
