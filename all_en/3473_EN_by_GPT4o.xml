      <p>Greetings. I send to you, honorable father and co-father, through this messenger of yours, your translated prefaces, so that you may inspect them; I have also added the symbols, which, besides having much difficulty in themselves, were translated by me very hastily and tumultuously only yesterday and today. If they seem to you to be added to the work, let it be done, if not, let them be omitted.</p>
      <p>I also send back my preface, to which, besides those things you advised, I have added some other things, so that all the parts may more fully correspond to each other, as you will see; if you wish to add or remove anything, you may do so by me.</p>
      <p>I send it because Apiarius cannot print them; for, as I predicted long ago, he will not be able to complete the work with only one press before the fair, and although he was warned in time, he still did not want to prepare another. He has now gone to Basel; I do not know what he is doing, whether he will bring more printing assistants or not. Therefore, it will be worthwhile for Froschauer to print both these and perhaps also part of the work, if he wants the work completed before the fair. The indexes will also require several days of work. I am also writing to Froschauer about this matter.</p>
      <p>I am not sending any gatherings now due to Apiarius's absence. However, they are now working on the last gathering of the second alphabet.</p>
      <p>I have formed the title according to your prescription with only one or two words changed and omitted the words that displeased you. I have also added some things from your prefaces, symbols, and my preface, which you may change or delete entirely at your discretion.</p>
      <p>If anything more needs to be done, you will inform me in time. I have nothing new, except that last Sunday both in Geneva and here the covenant was confirmed by sacrament. May the Lord grant that this is fortunate and happy for all of us! Gallus seems to be seeking more soldiers. Musculus is not very well due to a rather severe cough.</p>
      <p>It is reported that the Swiss left in the Ferrara region have clashed with the Spaniards, but we do not know how certain this is. From Paris, we have no certain news about the captives.</p>
      <p>I expect your letters daily.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with all yours; ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 12, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord and co-father, to be honored in every way.</p>
