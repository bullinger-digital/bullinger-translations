      <p>Greetings. I received with great desire the books you wrote against the Anabaptists, venerable father in the Lord. I understand you sent them, according to your old custom, by which you have made me a participant in your writings since the death of the most illustrious man, Dr. Vadianus, an adoption than which nothing could have happened to me more pleasing. But whence this favor to me? Surely, it is so that you cannot help but love in return him who loves, honors, and respects Vadianus, living among the heavenly ones, and you, still surviving among us by the goodness of God, from the heart. Therefore, I give and hold immense thanks to your humanity and remarkable modesty for your immense benevolence bestowed upon me, an unworthy man deserving of nothing of the sort, and truly immortal thanks for the vigils and labors undertaken for the Church of Christ. For they are such as are required today for the restoration of the fallen church and the defense of the restored one. You have done a most useful and salutary thing against the restless kind of men, furious and hostile to all order, from which I hope much fruit will return to the church. May the Lord bless you!</p>
      <p>It is not given to write more, deceived by the haste of the messengers. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Commend us to the Lord in your prayers; I make mention of you in my daily prayers, however humble they may be. Please greet the fellow ministers, the best and most learned men.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler, your most devoted from the heart. Give this coin in my name to your most chaste and dearest wife; for I do not doubt that while you labor late into the night during these winter months, she, concerned and compassionate for her aged husband, has endured long hours. Please ask her to accept it kindly and make good use of it.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, his esteemed lord.</p>
