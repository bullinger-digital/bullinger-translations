      <p>Greetings. When I arrived in St. Gallen, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, I found my wife not entirely restored to health, yet not confined to bed.</p>
      <p>She is pressing for the move and has decided, if it can be done, to set out on the journey next Monday. May the Lord grant that this departure causes her no harm! I have not yet been able to meet with Dr. Vadian, but I will meet him tomorrow after the sermon and will excuse your silence, as you did not send any letters to him through me. I cannot write more at present. I have not yet been able to hear here what the people of Constance are doing, or rather what madness they are up to, except that on the journey I learned they are vacating the houses of the canons, so that, as unclean spirits were once cast out by the power of Christ, they might be received again, having been driven mad by the cunning and malice of Satan, making the latter state worse than the former.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. Greetings to your wife and the whole household. St. Gallen, 22nd of September, 1548.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and brother in Christ, dearest by far.</p>
