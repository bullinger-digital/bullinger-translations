      <p>--- We send a small gift, yet one that encompasses much, which we have published in our language and under a different name, first because we have imitated Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullian in writing it, hence we have inscribed it as Octavius Florens, namely from Septimius Florens, and secondly because my enemies of the cross of Christ have stirred up such envy against me among our people that many would plainly despise it upon seeing my name unless, with a new name, I attracted new and perverse listeners to the reading, perhaps, if not further. For this is one of the many most pestilent deadly things, that we condemn the unknown and cast it into the abyss of heresies which we have not yet weighed by the measure of scripture.</p>
      <p>Things are going quite well with me; for I am in charge of a very wealthy monastery, and no less in the verdant meadows and woods resounding with the chirping of birds, I profess both pious and good letters. And so far, we have interpreted the Gospels of Matthew and John, and then several of Paul's epistles, namely those to the Romans, both to the Corinthians, to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, to which in the afternoon hours we have added Erasmus's "Copiae" books and his "Bellum" with Sallust and several books of Virgil. But at present, we are professing the epistle to the Thessalonians with Philipp's "Dialectics".</p>
      <p>Hence, in some decrees of the Helvetians, though covertly, I am proscribed, I cling entirely to the cross and do not dare to advance a broad stalk from the fields of Zürich, unless it pleases to dedicate my life to Vulcan or the sword. But it is sweet for me to become the refuse of men [1 Cor 4:13] for the sweet name of Jesus Christ, my Lord, who long ago I had deserved far more cruel things for my sins. Pray to the Lord for me, that He may confirm in me and all the faithful what He has begun by grace, and that in our death we may sing with Saint Ignatius: "We are ready for beasts, for fire, for swords, and for the cross, only that we may see Christ, our Savior and Lord."</p>
      <p>--- To the Helvetian, that is, to the rude and severe young man. Forgive, my brother, the youthful affections and manners, then indeed not reborn through God, but now revolving incessantly in the most ardent heart with you and your teachers. You will commend me to them.</p>
      <p>Our Michael has deserted the unfortunate priesthood and entered the wool weaving trade. My brother Johannes is still acting as a sacrificer, indeed a shepherd of the Uranier. Jacob has taken a wife, becoming an innkeeper. I bid farewell to Antonius very much, with whom you also may fare well perpetually.</p>
      <p>From Kappel, our monastery across the Albis of the Zürichers, the second of May 1526.</p>
