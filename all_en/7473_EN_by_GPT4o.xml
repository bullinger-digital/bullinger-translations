      <p> Greetings. I received your letters, most esteemed lord, in which you anxiously recommended to me Daniel from Silesia, a learned and industrious man, and certainly, wherever I could, I would not have failed him willingly (as you write). But if those who are recommended by you to us, we ought to be much more diligent in assisting them. Which certainly in this very case I would have most eagerly provided, had he not arrived at a most inconvenient time for me. I was at that time in foreign baths when he offered me your letters, and I could not provide him with anything. For before I could prepare myself for the journey, he had already girded himself again; he hastened his departure because of companions he had found here and there as far as Tuscany, and there is no doubt that he can reach Milan safely; he could not have been recommended further by our people. They also say that the unrest of the monks of Como and those around Lake Como has subsided; hence we do not think any danger threatens our Silesian. Two most wicked monks will also be summoned, one from Plurs, the other from Chiavenna, who have lived most seditiously until now. They will be brought before the republic of the Three Leagues in the upcoming assemblies on the charge and suspicion of some treachery committed against the homeland. But lest they consult for themselves by fleeing, our people have already warned the prefects of these places to not neglect to guard them in time and to keep them in custody until the appointed day. I sent you the story of the monk from Plurs translated by Ambrosius the Younger long ago; I lost the Italian version. Our Schwenckfeldians have not yet been examined; for the supreme tribunal is inactive. Meanwhile, I so thoroughly imbibe your booklets that, if they are to be poured out again, the adversaries may be suffocated and perish in their own poison. I will return them soon; for there are few things left to be picked, and there is not always leisure to attend to them; thus I am never not occupied with business. - Our Brunner, since he came to Maienfeld, has never deemed me worthy of either conversation or his letters. He was dangerously ill. I approached the doctor, asked, spent my money. He recovered long ago; no one satisfies the doctor, nor does he indicate in a word what he is doing, how he is living, what he is planning. He is a living dead man. - Remigius von Schauenstein, also a leader of the French war, has now appeared for the third time in our senate asking to be received and to be granted the ability to stay in the city. The more frequent senate asked whether he acknowledged his fault and would be willing to undergo the punishment they would impose. Becoming angry (as he is a rash, irascible, lofty, and envious man), he replied that he had done nothing wrong either against the homeland or religion; therefore, he would not surrender himself nor undergo any punishment or fine for that reason. When the magistrates noticed the man's insolence, who also arrogantly rejected the means of regaining citizenship, they ordered him to leave the city within eight days and to emigrate with all his belongings. I do not think there will be any room for favor further. Now they say he will move to the nearest castle of the bishop.</p>
      <p> The whole family of Gideon, the son of Philipp Gallicius, came to me today, humbly asking that I might implore this from you, that Gideon may not suffer rejection if he asks you for permission to visit his family for some time; for since he is feverish, he might fare better with a change of place and air. They fear, however, that this absence and interruption of studies might cause him to lose his stipend.</p>
      <p> Therefore, they implore your humanity on bended knee, that you may grant him the opportunity and permission to visit his family and that he may not suffer any loss in the meantime, most mercifully deign to ensure and provide. If my intercession can have any weight with you, I beg you not to deny them this service. While I was writing this, I hear the drum, and they say the sign of Captain Herdli is being brought in; tomorrow, when it dawns, I will observe these soldiers. Our Flavio, who is intimate with the royal legate and was sent by him to Venice, and from there to Rome, brought this peace agreement between Emperor Maximilian and the Turkish emperor; indeed, I sought it out in your favor through the work of your most devoted Charles and copied it from the hand of the interpreter; however, he asks that you use it cautiously, since the envoys of the Emperor have not yet arrived. The same Flavio affirms that Cond√©'s name is so formidable to the pope himself, his cardinals, and the entire city, that he restores ancient buildings, constructs new ones daily, and does not cease to fortify and strengthen himself with the strongest machines. Some merchants from Italy report that cardinals are mutually eliminating each other with poison and that several have now perished. They also report some unknown things about a battle between German knights and Spaniards. In Milan, it was said that the Spaniards were superior, but I heard that 800 Spaniards were slaughtered by the Germans. Neither is likely true, since the German knights are said to still be stationed on the borders of France. - Now I come to our synod. Our Engadiners in the previous assembly, in which the Zanchi case was discussed, designated Zuoz as the seat of the synod, a place indeed not insignificant in Upper Engadin, but not consecrated by public assemblies. They chose this place by their own votes, when the Italians and almost all the others except the Engadiners had already departed. No synod has been held there until now; but they obtained it by a majority of votes.</p>
      <p> Now, as the time approaches, the Engadin brothers write to us all bitter letters, in which they first complain about our negligence, as if we make the chosen seat of the synod despicable to all, mock the Engadin assembly, discourage and deter the brothers. They therefore urge us to do our duty and not only to appear with the others, but also to bring with us the seal, the book, the register, the secrets, the regalia, and whatever concerns the authority of the synod, and to hand over all these things as quickly as possible with submissive bundles; unless we do this, they will accuse us and condemn us of pride, tyranny, and schism in the senate of the Three Leagues. Among other things, our Campell most odiously reopens the Zanchi affair and affirms that we will truly be schismatics if we do not attend the Zuoz synod.</p>
      <p> He wrote this invective of his to Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, and me. I, who was particularly noted in this writing (because I know well that I am in the barley here with Campell), wrote an apology of 8 pages, which I have not yet sent, fearing that more serious lacerations might emerge here and there. I also prepared myself to cross the Albula mountain and attend the brothers. However, when we were about to ask for permission from our most honorable magistrate due to the upcoming holidays, we were forbidden to go there; indeed, we were also prohibited from sending the seal there. Everyone believes that some new monster is being nurtured. They are thinking of derogating from us and, contrary to custom, also attributing to themselves the use of seals in secular matters. The Upper League also refuses to come to those minor assemblies and seeks to abolish and obliterate them. A sharp contest will follow. Just as the Engadiners ask for the seal and all the secrets to be attributed to them, so the magistrates, both Upper and Engadin, might also attempt this in civil matters. Our senate was very angry and also wrote special letters to the Zuoz people and the synod itself, in which they give reasons why they dissuaded us from this journey; they also criticize the enthusiasts of this novelty, among whom Campell is not the last. While these things were happening, I received letters from the entire Davos senate, in which they announce that they have forbidden their pastor from attending this synod, but ask for a declaration whether we are going there by the counsel and will of our magistrate; for it seems to them a new and odious matter, etc. Thus we remain at home against the wishes of the Engadiners.</p>
      <p> We will soon hear what they are going to do and decide. May the Lord defend us from internal disturbances and bites. Unless the Engadiners follow the footsteps of the ancients, you will hear of tumults and nothing but evil will follow here and there. They are ill-disposed towards our city, yet undeservedly; now they do not even blush to arrogantly demand all the secrets of the synod from our city, where they have been perpetually kept. This is enough; I wrote everything very quickly, so forgive me and farewell eternally with all yours. I received no letters from you today.</p>
      <p> You command my Mr. Erni to be well. Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, Mr. Charles, all yours, and no one not good, greet you. Forgive, I beg, the haste; for I wrote this at the eleventh hour of the night, weighed down by sleep; for tomorrow before dawn our Kobler will leave. Farewell a thousand times, most holy lord father.</p>
      <p> The last of May 68.</p>
      <p> Your dignity's most observant Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p> Chur.</p>
      <p> Forgive, I beg, that I so burden you with my nonsense. I did not reread.</p>
