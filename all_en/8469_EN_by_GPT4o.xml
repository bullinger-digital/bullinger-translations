      <p>Greetings, my Bullinger. The reason I have written to you less frequently is the death of Abel, to whom alone I was accustomed to entrust my letters and any other matters; for he was a most faithful friend, and I am quite doubtful where I might find another Abel.</p>
      <p>But the Lord, (as I hope) will raise up for me someone similar, who will perform his duty in the future. Norwich is almost 100 miles distant from the city of London, to which I do not usually ride unless called to parliament, which is to be held next winter. There, someone trustworthy must be sought, who will safely ensure my letters are delivered to you. Our merchants are reluctant to go to Flanders or Spain; for they fear the Spanish Inquisition more than the devil, which spares neither its own nor foreigners.</p>
      <p>Grindal, recently the Bishop of London, has been made the Archbishop of York, Sandys of Worcester the Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>Around the beginning of November, great sea floods brought much damage to various parts of England, and my Norfolk and Suffolk are not exempt; Flanders has been afflicted more than all others. The ground here has been and still is covered with deep snow (such as I have never seen) for several weeks; nothing green appears anywhere. A plague among the cattle is feared due to the scarcity of food.</p>
      <p>My wife has been ill from the beginning of November to this very day, and has not yet recovered. If I know that this letter has been safely delivered to you, I will try to write more often; for the death of Abel, the Belgian turmoil, and spies everywhere have thus far somewhat delayed my efforts.</p>
      <p>Wish all the happiest things for your councilors, senators, ministers of the word, citizens, and the entire dominion of Zürich. Farewell to you all in the Lord. And again, I bid you farewell, most delightful Bullinger. My ailing wife sends her greetings to you all. Norwich, January 16, 1571.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, John Parkhurst, N.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zürich.</p>
