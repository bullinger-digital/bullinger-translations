      <p>Greetings. I received the letters from your synod that you sent to me on behalf of the brothers and ministers of Lesser Poland, and we give thanks to our God for the grace granted to you. Although we have never doubted the integrity of the faith of your churches (even though we have frequently admonished you to beware of foreign doctrines), now having seen and considered the brief confession of your faith, which we judge to be orthodox, we have greatly rejoiced in the Lord, and we pray to the Lord to preserve you in that simplicity and to guard you from the disturbers of the churches.</p>
      <p>For we certainly inform you that many wander about who indeed feign piety, but filled with the most impious doctrines, they breathe nothing but the destruction of true religion. Some mock the adorable Trinity, others dispute about the divinity of the Son of God in such a way that they do not wish to appear Arian, yet in reality, they act with Arius. Others speak of the simplicity of faith in such a way that they can meanwhile retain their convoluted opinions with impunity and, given the opportunity, also affix them to others.</p>
      <p>Indeed, because of the malice and cunning of many, we have been compelled to write certain articles in our church and school, which we have decreed to be recited to any foreigners and strangers wishing to stay with us. If they reject these, they are not received by us but are immediately ordered to leave. If you ask what these articles are, I will report them: not to impose them on you or others, but so that you may see what we follow in our perilous times and how we are vigilant lest various sects sprout. One God, etc. [...]. I share these articles with you, lord and brother, so that you may consider with your prudence if there is anything in them that might also benefit your churches. You are certainly exposed to greater danger in these matters than we are, since, as I hear, the nobles of the kingdom receive ministers whom they wish, from which they come to you from Italy and other nations in the hope of obtaining positions. These, unless carefully examined beforehand, later begin to instill their depraved opinions into others and pave the way for themselves to break through to greater, that is, worse things. Therefore, diligently watch over the sheep entrusted to your faith.</p>
      <p>I cannot conceal from you and the other brothers that the voices and proclamations of some not entirely sincere people are heard, that soon churches will arise throughout Poland with doctrines far purer than those found in Germany, France, or England or other kingdoms, which today seem to have the gospel. The pious understand these to speak of Servetian and Anabaptist doctrines.</p>
      <p>But however these matters stand, watch over yourselves and keep the true confession rightly made by you pure in your churches. I have seen the Stancarian insults and have also sent them, as you wished, to Mr. Calvin.</p>
      <p>This rascal has hardened his forehead, and he is no longer ashamed to utter palpable lies and to weave such open slanders that whoever does not see and judge the grossest of them sees nothing and is hardly worthy of having any brighter torch kindled for him. But when the book is published, it will be considered what needs to be done.</p>
      <p>Persevere in the truth and drive this wolf away from Christ's sheepfolds...</p>
