      <p>Greetings. There is no need for you to send back the writing of Prince of Orange, as I believe it has already been printed. Three weeks ago, the envoys of the six electors set out to our Emperor; I cannot know what they are doing, although I have inquired from many; however, it is thought that they will announce to the Emperor things that will be least pleasing, as there is a rumor that certain new schemes against them have been discovered by the princes. I wanted to add this to the letter, as the messenger stayed longer than I had thought.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, September 30, 1568. Your most observant, Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Lord Heinrich Bullinger, etc., his esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
