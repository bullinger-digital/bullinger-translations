      <p>Although there is nothing new, most observant lord, that I should write to you,... to greet you briefly and to inform you of the state of affairs... however, so far tolerable, praise be to the Lord, although the priests and all those still devoted to the papacy do not cease to stir up tumult. Nevertheless, I think I have nothing to fear from these things, since I am certain that I am under the care of Him, without whose will not even a hair from the head of those who depend on His providence will perish. As for these pious ones, I have been received by them so kindly that there is nothing in which I desire either their effort or diligence. Above all others, the magnificent Mr. Anton Sonvico, now elected consul, who visited you there with his brother, overwhelms me daily with his services. He, not forgetful of your exhortations, sincerely strives to promote and propagate the gospel of Jesus Christ, our Lord. May the Lord prosper and daily increase his holy desire more and more.</p>
      <p>In his and his brother's name, I send you many greetings and best wishes for your health.</p>
      <p>So much for these matters.</p>
      <p>I ask you to, as you do, keep me in the number of those who are most dear to you; above all, I wish that you commend me and my church to God in your prayers. There are still many more who oppose the gospel than those who favor it, although they can rather be called atheists than lovers of any religion. The Lord is able to open their hearts, if only He wills.</p>
      <p>Finally, in my and my wife's name, I send my most diligent greetings to you, your most pious wife, Mr. Heinrich, your son, Dorothea, and Veritas, to whom you will add my dearest and most observant Mr. Lavater, Zwingli, Josias with their wives, whom my wife kisses with a holy kiss. She is getting better day by day after a long and deplorable illness, which she suffered during the journey, in which we were for 22 days. The Lord had mercy on her and me, so that she may be present to bear and alleviate our common miseries. She lay sick for 9 days in Chur, where we experienced the incredible kindness and beneficence of Mr. Fabricius and his wife; may the Lord repay them for us. Farewell, most excellent one, and love me.</p>
      <p>Misox, 13th day before the calends of June 1559.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Giovanni Beccaria, useless minister of Misox.</p>
