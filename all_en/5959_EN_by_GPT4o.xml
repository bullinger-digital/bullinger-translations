      <p>Greetings. Since I last wrote to you, venerable brother, these new events have occurred: When almost only adversaries were in the king's council, it was suddenly decreed with furious impulse that the walls of Orléans should be demolished.</p>
      <p>The military prefect began to demolish certain towers and fill the ditches with rubble.</p>
      <p>If the rumor is true, the authors of such a pernicious decree are now ashamed and regret their madness.</p>
      <p>The same was decided for many other cities with no other pretext than that it is not expedient for any places to be fortified except at the borders to ward off foreign enemies.</p>
      <p>Prince Condé left the court a month ago, angry because the king's mother cunningly kept the marriage of his son with the daughter of Saint-André in suspense; thus, having abandoned the cause of Christ, he is devoted to his private interests, although, as no one is concerned with appeasing God, his indignation will spontaneously vanish as usual.</p>
      <p>Now, I will narrate what was brought three days ago: When Admiral came to greet the king, he was received very kindly; then he proceeded to Paris with a very large retinue.</p>
      <p>The Constable, to spite the envious, came to his lodging and led him from lunch to the royal castle.</p>
      <p>There he participated in a consultation, where they think the greatest matters were discussed.</p>
      <p>The Guises, having gathered their belongings, crossed to the opposite part of the city; meanwhile, through the Duke of Nemours, they announced to the king's mother that they were surprised how she allowed the Admiral to be so close to her son.</p>
      <p>She replied that he was an old minister of the king, and there was no reason why he should be prohibited, and that it pleased the king; indeed, there was enough room for everyone, so she advised them to come.</p>
      <p>Which did not happen.</p>
      <p>The court sent mediators to the Constable to appease the mind of his nephew. The same was done by the mayor and the councilors.</p>
      <p>The king was about to come to the court and bring the Admiral with him.</p>
      <p>Soon we will hear what outcome the action had, about which our people are very hopeful.</p>
      <p>Prince Porcien and Duke Bouillon, son of the Marquis, and the great-grandson of the famous Robert, who are both most hostile to the Guises, were expected at the court.</p>
      <p>The Chancellor, who was ours, will now gather his courage from timidity.</p>
      <p>The king, under the pretext of visiting his sister who had given birth, was being drawn to Lorraine by his mother, and he was proceeding so obstinately to Italy that all opposition was in vain.</p>
      <p>Now they say the plan for that journey has been changed.</p>
      <p>All minds are intent on concluding peace with the English. In this way, all the arts of Cardinal Lorraine will collapse with the utmost disgrace.</p>
      <p>The king, in title only greater, is governed by another's will, and indeed almost servilely.</p>
      <p>He is not alien to us if he dared anything.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, you can hardly believe how much audacity there is in all the legal prefects to oppress our people.</p>
      <p>Thus, the innocent are miserably harassed, and impunity increases license.</p>
      <p>The people of Orléans achieved one thing according to their wish, that the garrison was removed from there, as from other places.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I warn you in time to take care to prepare provisions for the neighbors who will soon return.</p>
      <p>Now I come to the most serious matter of all, and to which I desire you to apply your mind and effort.</p>
      <p>You know that the time is approaching when the alliance with the Swiss will be renewed.</p>
      <p>If your senate can be persuaded to enter into an alliance with the king, this is the only way to establish the gospel in France.</p>
      <p>I do not know if you have heard of the conspiracy of the enemies. They think that when a national council is convened, it will be easy and expedient for them to overthrow all the churches in a moment, because they will decide anything at their discretion and execution will be ready.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Pope, with the Spaniard, the Venetians, the princes of Italy, and the Duke of Savoy, is preparing to utterly destroy this city and to remove us all from the midst.</p>
      <p>Good people fear that the king's mother, unless restrained, will be too inclined to help their faction.</p>
      <p>This would indeed be the safest and almost the only remedy if the Swiss cities that have embraced the gospel strike an alliance on this condition, that the French churches and their liberty are safeguarded.</p>
      <p>This will be obtained with no difficulty.</p>
      <p>The authority of your senate will be followed by three other cities.</p>
      <p>Nor would it only benefit the French and us to bind the king to support the churches in this moderate state, but it would also be most suitable for you to restrain the neighbors, whose spirits would be broken, and thus the intemperance would subside.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beseech you, venerable brother, in the name of God, and I implore you for the salvation of all the faithful, to forget the many things that might hinder you and to devote yourself to securing this alliance, which will protect the religion in France safe and intact and close the door to the plots of the wicked.</p>
      <p>You see how simply I deal with you.</p>
      <p>I eagerly wish to know what you think about this matter.</p>
      <p>This one thing I will dare to testify freely: if your people refuse, they will be liable before God and men for not one kind of crime.</p>
      <p>But perhaps there will be no need to contend more vehemently, once they understand not only how sacred the duty is to rescue the endangered churches from all fear, but also how much it is in their interest to keep the king bound not to abandon the care of defending religion.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and my venerable brother. Diligently greet all my colleagues in my name, as mine greet you.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with you and sustain you with His strength and keep you safe for a long time.</p>
      <p>Geneva, December 2, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>Your Ionville reverently and sincerely greets you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my most venerable brother and fellow minister.</p>
