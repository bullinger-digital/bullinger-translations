    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger responded to Camillo Renato [above No. 2245] in a scholarly manner and to [Martin] Borrhaus [above No. 2273] in a candid way. In his excessive craving for novelty, Borrhaus seems to have indulged more in the [artifices] of Kaspar [Schwenckfeld] than made use of his judgment. Vadian read Borrhaus’ “In Salomonis... ecclesiastis [concionem] commentarius” [Basel, Robert Winter 1539; VD 16 B 6741] and noticed even then that its careless and complicated writing style is difficult to understand even for scholars. Therefore, Bullinger is right to admonish the otherwise learned man to be more clear-sighted, especially since he himself calls for it. - Vadian regrets that he could not deliver the [Small Chronicle] of the abbots, which will soon be completed, by the [originally] promised date [see above No. 2159] due to his official duties. However, he is pleased that Bullinger prudently reserves his judgment until he knows the entire [work]. Vadian hopes that the treatment of the abbots will please Bullinger more than [the already sent texts (see above No. 2257) “On the Monastic Order” and “On Saint Gallus, on the Beginning, State, and Nature of His Monastery”], in which he brings nothing new, even though he believes it is worthwhile for the common German reader to take note of these texts. In the treatise on the abbots, Vadian is very restrained so that he cannot be accused of having given free rein to his feelings. However, he does not want to limit himself to a mere catalog, because such lists are worthless for posterity. - In his writing on the “Thurgau” [see above No. 2154, note 2], in which Vadian intends to present a large part of the local history, he will also show how the wealthy monasteries have abandoned their original purpose over time. - The victory of [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse has delighted all the pious. It is hoped that the Cologne [Bishop Hermann von Wied] can assert himself peacefully and that the Mainz [Bishop's] seat will be granted a more moderate [Bishop] than ever before. Certainly, the [foolish] “Antronier” [see Adagia, 2, 5, 68 (ASD II/3 450, No. 1468)] have legitimate reasons to be afraid! For some even consider it certain that Duke [Wilhelm IV.] of Bavaria will also convert to the [Evangelicals]. However, Vadian fears that the princes will be too lenient with the arsonist [Duke Heinrich of Brunswick]. The execution of the old [custom, to deprive the guilty] of his eyesight and to punish him in an appropriate manner, would be suitable for such corrupt German princes! If [Duke Heinrich] is not punished, there will never be peace from the wicked. - Bullinger should just keep writing, even if he has something to dictate or criticize. Greetings to all colleagues.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You responded to Camillo Renato in a scholarly manner, most distinguished Bullinger, and to Borrhaus with candor. For indeed, the excessive and almost immoderate craving for novelty of the latter is not unknown, as he seems to follow not judgment, but his own genius, while he reads in Kaspar what he admires. I read his Commentaries on the Ecclesiastes of Solomon long ago, and I noticed, if I am not mistaken, how carelessly he deters even a moderately learned and pious reader from his works, and hardly admits scholars into that archive of his, which is tortuous with obscurity and subtlety and alien to that amiable and gracious ease of teaching. You do well, therefore, to deter a man otherwise very learned from his genius and to encourage him towards judgment. For this very thing, if nothing else, indeed demands that office of promoting piety, to which he is appointed. But enough of this. - I will soon deliver the abbots, and I am ashamed that I have been so pressed by business that I could not fulfill what I promised on its due day. However, I am pleased with your prudence, who suspend judgment until you may judge the whole, although the lion is judged even from its claws. I hope, however, that you will approve more of the treatment of the abbots than that insipid repetition of mine of almost commonplaces, which I nevertheless judged not unworthy of the knowledge of our German countrymen. In the abbots, I restrain myself exceedingly, lest I be accused of having indulged my feelings. But I do not approve of mere catalogs, both because they are unfruitful and because they seem to show off, as if those ill-omened monsters were worthy of the memory of posterity; furthermore, when the history of the times is added, it is easily understood why and for what reasons they deserved to be named. Not only will it be a pleasant reading, but also a useful one about the wealthy monasteries, which, seduced by mammon, have abandoned the institution of their ancestors and followed the world. A large part of the domestic history of Thurgau will be given by my work and will contain actions not unworthy of being known. But we will follow your judgment. - The victory of Hesse has wonderfully delighted all the pious. There is hope that the Cologne seat will live in peace and that the Mainz seat will obtain a more moderate prelate than ever before, but also that there will be a most famous accession of these men, whom infirmity still holds captive. Certainly, the Antronier have certain and just reasons to be somewhat afraid. For there are those who confidently predict that our Duke of Bavaria will also be theirs. We fear one thing, that the councils of the princes will deal too leniently with that incendiary. The deprivation of sight is an old and indeed honorable punishment for the lost princes of Germany; unless justice inflicts this on him too, there will never be peace from the wicked and criminal. Farewell and write back likewise; also dictate and subscribe, my Bullinger, diligently and in my name greet the memorable college. St. Gallen, the day after the Kalends of November, in the year 1545. Yours sincerely, Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>Commend us to the consuls.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed friend, most honorable lord.</p>
