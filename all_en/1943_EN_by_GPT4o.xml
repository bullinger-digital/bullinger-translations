      <p>Peace and truth in our days. The letters, which you sent to me a few days ago, most esteemed and revered Bullinger, along with two sermons on the venerable matter of the Eucharist, were received by me with gratitude, indeed with the greatest gratitude. Through all of these, you not only revive and renew the old friendship between us, so that it does not fall into oblivion, but you also wish and desire to observe it renewed.</p>
      <p>For he who is the knower and observer of our hearts and thoughts knows that I am of that mind and opinion.</p>
      <p>Hence it is to be observed that the wisest Solomon said among other things in Proverbs 18: A man of friends, and to whom it is in his heart to show friendship, associates himself with them and adheres more firmly than a brother. May he, who by his eternal wisdom has appointed the friends of God and the prophets, confirm us in this to the end. Wisdom 7.</p>
      <p>You have acted prudently regarding the two small works on the most holy matter of the Eucharist, in that they are published in the German language.</p>
      <p>For the doctrine of the Lutherans and the Concordists among us (believe from experience) is not yet extinguished, but lies dormant, hence pious men and those who think rightly in this matter must be vigilant and pray, lest this doctrine (unworthy of pious ears) prepares a greater conflagration than ever before and the last things become worse than the former.</p>
      <p>We all see (what you write) burning with a fire, so to speak, inextinguishable throughout the beloved land of our old Germany. All kings, princes, cities, contribute everything to the wood, and especially we Swiss, our ignorance and ingratitude towards God and the dear fatherland, are described in order from chapter 2 to the seventh (if we apply it to our customs and our times); it will also be fulfilled in its time and not one will remain outside. May the pious father of the family grant us to ponder deeply what is written about the ministers of the word in chapter 6: I have set a refiner, etc.</p>
      <p>My prefect, whom you bid to greet most warmly in your name, perished on the 25th of June in the river or torrent... (perhaps unknown to you). Therefore, another will be elected on the next Sunday after the feast of James; - we think the lot will fall on Ludwig Zenhender, the former prefect of Biberstein. Let it be so, let it be so. - As for the baptized Jew, I cannot admire; he always has so many and such difficult questions at hand; it would be impossible for pious and learned men to answer everything; insatiable for answers. May our Lord Jesus Christ, that true light, illuminate that man and remove the veil he has from his eyes. Amen.</p>
      <p>As for the state of my life, I have entrusted myself to my dear God and Father, if something adverse happens (as happens daily), I am mindful of what is written, that the last times must have their course and everything will be fulfilled, as Christ himself, Paul, Peter, Jude, and John have written; it comforts and strengthens me in such a way that I may do my rest patiently and steadfastly and always remember that the Lord said: Peter, when you are old, etc.</p>
      <p>May he never withdraw his spirit and word from us, amen.</p>
      <p>Joseph Altenburger from Dachssens, a young man from the region of Zürich, who will come to you during the autumn season to see the state of the Zürich church, this one, whom I have raised from the cradle, may you have commended along with my other most esteemed fathers and brothers. Farewell in the Lord, all of you. From Aarburg, the 25th of July, 1553.</p>
      <p>Peter Sartorius, friend of friends and of the learned of God and Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious and distinguished man of piety Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church and his most esteemed friend.</p>
