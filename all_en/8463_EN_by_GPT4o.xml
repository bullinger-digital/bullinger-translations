      <p>Greetings. There is no need for an apology for being brief in your letters, most illustrious and highly esteemed man, for I am well aware that you are constantly occupied with numerous and very serious matters. I consider it a great favor that you, for my sake, have not hesitated to send your recent letters to me and to Lord Ehem. May God grant that some opportunity may arise for me to reciprocate and show my gratitude towards you. I have delivered your letters to Lord Ehem and thoroughly explained the entire matter in person. He has shown himself to be accommodating and kind, so that he has conceived a good hope of obtaining something. Whatever I may achieve, I will inform you when the opportunity arises. The Elector Prince, because the letters of the most honorable council of Zürich seem somewhat concise and only encompass the summary of the whole matter, requests an example of the divorce document sealed by the Zürich council, which I hope will be sent to us shortly.</p>
      <p>Regarding the excommunicated and other matters, you will be informed by the letters of Dr. Erastus, my host.</p>
      <p>Farewell, honorable man. May the Lord keep you safe for us for a long time and grant this year to be most fortunate. Please convey my greetings to Lord Gwalther and Lord Cellarius, my former host, in my name.</p>
      <p>Given on the 3rd day before the Nones of January in the year of Christ 1571. Your most observant Johann Philipp, Baron von Hohensax, by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zürich, to be regarded as a lord and as a father.</p>
