    <p xml:id="regest1">Greetings. Thanks for the help for the recommended Bartolomeo [Paravicini] [in No. 1939], also on behalf of his father [Raphael Paravicini]; relieved that he does not have to hesitate to ask Bullinger for help, although he can only show insufficient gratitude. Asks for news [about the state of the Reformation], especially now that great princes are making peace. The [Reformation] in the [Veltlin] is thriving at its best; all brothers send their regards to [the people of Zurich]. May Bullinger strengthen in [faith] the bearer Felix [...], who is known to [Renato] and is of simple origin and moderate piety.</p>

      <p>Camillo Renato to the most humane Heinrich Bullinger, peace from the Lord, amen.</p>
      <p>We are very pleased and grateful that you have greatly assisted Bartholomeo, whom I briefly recommended to you as both a fellow countryman and a Christian youth, with your dedication and effort, as well as your authority and favor, as we have been informed. His father, all his family, and especially I, extend our deepest thanks to you. This matter has certainly made me feel relieved from a certain hesitation, which indeed had previously prevented me from troubling you with such letters, and now I am convinced that if I ever request anything of this kind from you, not only will I not seem bothersome or impudent to you, but also, which is indeed great and ample, I will consider there to be nothing that I cannot promise myself from you. Indeed, I owe this, as much as it is, to your humanity and piety. As for how much Camillo owes you for this matter, measure it by the greatness of your goodwill towards him. I certainly feel that I will never be able to repay you, but I will always hold gratitude for you. Furthermore, I wish that, since you have begun so generously, you would overwhelm me with the sea of your liberality, to which, if we can never respond due to the modesty of our means, I hope it will be enough for you to be pleased if you understand and we profess that we are bound to you forever by your immortal and infinite kindnesses. Therefore, since your kindness allows us the opportunity, we ask you to write to us at some leisure about the state or hope of religious matters, especially in these times of some unknown peace among the greatest princes. And if you have anything new in hand that you think it would be in our interest to know, I earnestly ask you to do so; it will be very pleasing to all of us. Our matters, as far as piety is concerned, are proceeding excellently in this valley; thus, all the brothers send their greetings to you in the Lord. In turn, you will greet the church of Zurich for us, to whose prayers we commend our cause most diligently. Farewell in the Lord and love us, as you do. This man, to whom we have given these letters to you, named Felix, is certainly not ignoble, as the region goes, a man connected to our people by great necessity and familiarity, and also by moderate piety; whom, if you have the time, you will strengthen. From the Valtellina Valley, October 22, 1544.</p>
