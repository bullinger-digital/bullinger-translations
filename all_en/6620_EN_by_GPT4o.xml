      <p>You will perceive the state of our affairs in some way from the letters which I have given to Mr. Guwalter.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote to you about how the Pole had sent back his wife to his brother, our emperor; it was also said at that time that he had made a pact with the Muscovites, so that upon his death the kingdom of Poland would devolve to Moscow; but I now hear that both are false, although the Pole does not live with his wife.</p>
      <p>The Dane and the Swede are still waging war against each other, having recently engaged in battle again, as they say; with what outcome, I do not know. They say that our emperor has come to an agreement with the Turk and that peace has been established. Our people do not cease preparing Malta with the greatest labors and expenses day and night; the Turk, however, is said to be preparing a larger fleet and equipment than before to attack it. The death of the pope will greatly hinder the repair of Malta.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, I sincerely pray that the coming year may be as healthy and prosperous for you and yours as he, on whom all salvation alone depends, may grant; at the same time, I send enclosed these as a token of my mind to you, until I can do otherwise.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given at Augsburg, December 26, in the year of salvation 1565.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten. All these things into your bosom and that of Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
