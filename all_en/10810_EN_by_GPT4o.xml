    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not report on important events such as the death of Berchtold [Haller] earlier, as he was unexpectedly sent to Strasbourg to appoint Sebastian [Meyer] [as his successor]. Although the highly learned theologian does not want to commit long-term due to his age and because of his wife, who also prompted him to leave Augsburg, Leonhard Tremp was meanwhile tasked with bringing him to Bern. Megander, who considered resigning because the decision was made without him, seems to have relented at the urging of Bullinger and others. The arrest of the [Solothurn "bandits" Hans and Rudolf] Roggenbach on Bernese territory has put Bern in a difficult position. Cannot write in more detail as the messenger is about to depart. Has partly burned, partly taken into custody Bullinger's letters to Berchtold [Haller]. Is willing to write more often. Asks for indulgence.</p>

      <p>S. You undoubtedly wonder about my prolonged silence, dearest and most esteemed Bullinger, especially at this time, which, if ever, provides ample material for anyone to write about. For the death of the most pious father Berchtold and the various changes in our affairs, etc., could very well awaken the pen of even the laziest person, so that no one would hesitate to inform those who have an equal interest in knowing. However, the reason I was unable to do so is the mission to Strasbourg assigned to me by our magistrate, which I was compelled to undertake so hastily and unexpectedly that I barely had time to prepare for the journey, let alone, as I had planned and most desired, to write to you thoroughly and diligently about everything. Otherwise, my dear Bullinger, I am neither negligent nor forgetful of you, and I would like to do you a favor on this and any other occasion. Therefore, upon returning home, I had nothing more urgent than to inform you of everything at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>First of all, so that you are not unaware of what I have done or achieved in Strasbourg: I was sent to summon Sebastian, and I did indeed obtain his promise to come here temporarily. However, whether he can stay here permanently and take on the position is very doubtful for the old man, worn out by age and labors, especially with a wife who is plainly simple and foolish, who was also the reason for his leaving the church in Augsburg. Nevertheless, whatever the case may be, Leonhard Tremp has been sent to call him, a man most learned in theology, prudent, and truly pious, unless I am deceived by the testimonies of all who know him, so that I have hope that, due to his excellent qualities and old acquaintance and authority, he will become a most useful pastor for our church, if he can endure the physical and domestic inconveniences - unless perhaps Megander, driven by some human emotion, intends to disturb this, which I do not think he will do, given his prudence and piety, especially since he himself has also agreed to the election, from which he initially seemed somewhat averse, not so much because he disapproved of Sebastian's learning or diligence, but because he felt slighted for not being consulted in such a decision, which, as you know, led him to consider leaving, as I am aware you were not kept in the dark about this. However, this thought has been so skillfully countered by your letters and those of others that I hope he will not be induced to do anything of the sort anymore.</p>
      <p>If you are unaware: The Roggenbachs have been captured in our territory, which would have stirred up considerable trouble for us in this most dangerous time, unless the Lord had looked upon us with some special providence as if from a machine. On one hand, the treaties prevent their release, and on the other, conscience prevents us from judging and deciding according to the old Swiss agreements, and no easy solution appears to address this almost desperate situation without causing a great upheaval in our Switzerland. But more on this later. For now, I could not write more, as the messenger is about to be dispatched at night, as first indicated to me by your legates through my boy from Zurich.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, and love me in return as I love you most earnestly.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 23, 1536.</p>
      <p>I have partly burned and partly kept your letters to Berchtold; I only assure you that you can be at ease regarding them.</p>
      <p>If I understand that it pleases you for me to write frequently, I will gladly trouble and disturb you with many vain matters.</p>
      <p>Be assured that I have hurried; therefore, do not be angry.</p>
      <p>Yours wholeheartedly,</p>
      <p>Simon Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed patron. To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
