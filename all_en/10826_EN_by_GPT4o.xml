    <p xml:id="regest1">The announcement of his intention to resign from the pastoral office [in Frauenfeld] - as discussed with Bullinger - because [the Reformed] are not advocating enough for their concerns, has caused great regret, and he was urged to stay with many promises. Since they are now determinedly opposing the Catholics' plan to erect more altars and also want to bring the matter of the schoolmaster to the Diet, he is willing to stay, but asks for the consent of the people of Zurich. Greetings. Bullinger can send the reply with Andreas Müller.</p>

      <p>Grace from God and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Especially dear lord and brother in Christ Jesus, as I have recently, burdened on behalf of my conscience and church, sought and found counsel with you, namely, where I could not feel greater diligence, a more inclined will towards the poor, their youth, and servants of the word, I might with good conscience depart, let it be tried by another or let them become entirely hungry for God's word; yet before John I should not depart. I have presented this to them simply and shown my opinion to them; about which they have raised a regret and perhaps thought I wanted to avoid the cross or for other reasons, not necessary to mention now, to leave them, and thus diligently for the second time through honest people begged me not to depart from them; if in any way I have been negligent or remiss concerning the poor and youth, they want to make up for it with diligent consideration in the future and handle and foresee all things, especially those that concern the honor of God and the common benefit of theirs, in due time according to the peace of the land; yet they would gladly be helpful to their poor, the ignorant youth, their servants of the divine word, where they could. But they cannot bring it about for themselves, while our lords, Zurich and Bern, whom they should rely on, are not helpful to them in their Christian undertaking. But they want to stand by the truth with God's help as poor people and act faithfully.</p>
      <p>However, our opponents have more altars, which they do not need, now want to erect in the parish church at Easter, stone and sand already brought into the church; they have forbidden them with force and uprightness. Also, regarding the schoolmaster, they turn to our lords in Baden, in good hope, he will not be denied to them according to the peace of the land. This Christian undertaking and action of theirs has moved me, so that I could not refuse their friendly request this time, yet with the reservation, if you, as the learned, together with my gracious lords, can advise and instruct me with good conscience. For as I have not intruded myself into the office, so I do not want to depart from it without the command of God or his servants, and thus be obedient to you, my lords. Therefore, my diligent request is that you will write back to me with this messenger and show your counsel and opinion, so that I may act without offense to the gospel and my church. I ask you to let us be recommended to our gracious lords, so that we may remain in all distribution of church goods according to the peace of the land, from which to be helpful to the poor and to provide the school with a pious fellow.</p>
      <p>With that, entrusted to God. Greet Master Leu, my faithful preceptor Theodor and Pellican and other preachers and lords.</p>
      <p>My stepson Andreas Müller will come to me at Easter, with whom you may, if it is convenient for you, send your answer.</p>
      <p>Given in Frauenfeld, April 7.</p>
      <p>Petrus Rümelin, always your willing.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, faithful servant of the divine word in Zurich, his dear and faithful lord.</p>
