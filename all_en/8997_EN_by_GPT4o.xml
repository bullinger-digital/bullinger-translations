      <p>Most Reverend Father, for several days now I have had to interrupt the duty of writing because I had so strained the index finger of my right hand that I could hardly grasp the pen and draw a line, and indeed could hardly do so at all. Now, by the grace of God, feeling somewhat better, I would compensate for this interruption with an abundance of letters, if it were not possible to discuss everything more safely and better in person soon. I will begin my journey on the next Saturday, when I will go to Mr. Victor in Maienfeld, where I will stay until the necessity of time drives me away, if it seems so to the Lord, who arranges everything most wisely for us who propose. And unless some new illness hinders me or some misfortune (which God forbid) intervenes, I will thank you in person for all the labors you have fatherly expended for our sake. You have already sent me a bundle of that amazing painted rye, and now the sentences of canon law, for all of which I am not unaware of how much I owe you, but I am painfully aware of how much I can repay.</p>
      <p>This little book will be most useful to me, as I am daily among papists without being one of them. - However, how our Gantner has behaved since he had to undergo the sentence of the synod, I now write down in order and report in the records; which, when I have completed, I will either take with me or send to you through others. From these, you will certainly recognize what a hypocrite he is, indeed a manifest slanderer, who, spreading lies, calls for the counsel of Zurich, who previously could not shout enough: 'Is our faith to be summoned from Zurich?' What was the need to bother you? Why does the insolent man not subscribe to the decree of the synod? Why does he delay? Why is he a scandal to the whole church? Why has he not attended sermons for a whole year? Why does he avoid our sacraments? Why does he continually fill the ears of the lords with new inventions and lies? Why does he pursue us with such great and monstrous hatred that he even spits whenever he meets us? If he thinks rightly and purely with us, why does he fear to subscribe to the sentence of the synod? Why does he not openly declare his mind to us either by word or in writing?</p>
      <p>The most arrogant man lies, splendidly lies, that he has ever declared his mind to us in any way; he does not deign to address us with his face or speech. He indeed asks to remain safe in his little corner; but why he asks this, we experience daily: he desires to have a refuge for companions of his own kind; he diligently works to draw the sheep away from the obedience due to the worship of God. Nor was he recently compelled in any way to attend sermons once except to please the lords, which he did not blush to say recently without shame, and at first, he refused this many times with all his might. He is a supporter of heretics, or if he is not, why does he not gather with us? Why does he not subscribe to the decrees of the synod with his hand fearlessly and sincerely? Indeed, he appended his name to the synodal book in 1558; but others did this too, who later contaminated themselves with not insignificant heresies. If he agrees with the Helvetic Confession in every part, why then does he exempt heretics from the office of the magistrate? Why does he involve himself in six hundred errors? There was no need to go to Zurich, who could find a remedy for the furious wound nearby, unless stepmotherly hatred and unparalleled arrogance were obstacles. Yet I rejoice and greatly rejoice that he no longer openly despises the people of Zurich, whom he, along with Marius, his inseparable companion, previously did not value at all. Gantner sought this alone from your greatness, to extort some letters of favor from you with his flatteries and painted little flowers, with which, having been recommended to the magistrate, he would have sounded the trumpet henceforth: 'See, behold our most rigid censors.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bullinger can bear me, who received me kindly and dismissed me and interceded for me fatherly with our people. Those who handle everything from emotions want me dead, want me uprooted, etc. But lest I be longer, you will recognize the lion or rather the wolf from the claws without any trouble if you read the acts, which I have written truly and candidly without envy. I have written in German so that others can understand, who are daily alienated from us by the marvelous lies of the simpler ones. Indeed, I would have sent it now; but some things are missing, which I could not add, as midnight urges sleep and one thing after another incessantly hinders me. Venetian affairs are persistently silent; everything is so blocked. Paulus Gadius writes that he has nothing; snails are coming, which I have not seen, however.</p>
      <p>These things very quickly from our study on August 25, 1572. Mr. Consuls, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Campellus, Mr. Gregorius, Mr. Bonetus, Mr. Victor, and everyone good greet you. May your whole choir be safe and Mr. Wolfgang Haller, most respected by me, may you all be safe and Mr. Ernius. Farewell, most esteemed fathers. Your most observant Tobias Iconius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant minister of the church of Zurich, his lord to be honored with singular respect. Zurich.</p>
