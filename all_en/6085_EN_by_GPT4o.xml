      <p>Our righteousness is Christ.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I received your letters full of kindness and goodwill, most revered father in Christ, and nothing could have been more pleasing or desirable. Having read them, I gladly embraced your fatherly affection towards me and your keen and loving concern for my well-being. Indeed, to confess honestly, your letters (although I have been somewhat instructed from a young age in moral sincerity and Christian simplicity, and today, by God's grace, nothing can be more important to me than true and Christian religion) have made me more eager in the pursuit of piety and more diligent in running the race set before us. For the sacred words of Paul always cling to my mind, and I often repeat them to myself with a mindful heart, and I strive to express them in my life according to the grace the Lord has given me. They are as follows: "The grace of the Lord God has appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age," and so on.</p>
      <p>In these few words, a great part of theology is contained (as I indeed believe); for it was not absurdly written by someone not the least among theologians that piety, self-denial, and humility are the first, second, and third parts of sacred theology. For what does the varied knowledge of things and the constant reading of distinguished authors avail if the mind is devoid of piety and still held in the Cimmerian darkness of sins, not striving daily to become more and more adorned with divine gifts? Therefore, most illustrious lord and father in Christ, much to be revered, I would have you persuaded that for a long time now I have been and am a most ardent lover of piety and true religion, yet not so that the benefit of Jesus Christ, our only Savior, is of little value to me. I know the weakness and frailty of human nature, in which it is most foolish to trust; I know the impotence (so to speak) of our spirit to do good and acceptable works to God; I know that our righteousness is more contemptible than the vilest rag if we wish to arrogantly and confidently thrust it upon God without regard to the merit of Christ. But in the meantime, I do not think we are free from all tribute due to God, so that we can sleep securely and lazily and indulge in the highest slumber; rather, we must strive with diligent effort to recover the image lost by Adam and be made conformable to the image of the great God's Son, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity (as the apostle says) and purify for himself a peculiar people zealous of good works. This is my opinion and mind, my most beloved father in Christ; to this I acquiesce, earnestly invoking Almighty God to aid and prosper my efforts with His divine will. I trust that if I do not attain certain things (due to the slowness of my understanding), God, in His mercy and immense kindness, will accept my ignorance in a better light; I desire to please Him, to Him I stand, to Him I fall, to Him I live and die; yet I will gladly allow myself to be admonished by pious and learned men and, if there are any errors, I will not be reluctant to correct them and will eagerly embrace better things. You know (as I trust) my mind, my lord, you know it to be simple, candid, and by no means obstinate. I love your kindness, I embrace and observe it in Christ, and I wish all prosperity and happiness to you and your family, whom I am bound to honor with perpetual observance, from the bottom of my heart to God, the best and greatest. Farewell, most revered teacher, in Christ, who is our salvation and righteousness. Convey much happiness in my words to your wife, my lady, to be honored in many respects, and to your daughters and also to the maidservant.</p>
      <p>The young men here, who delivered this to you, are noble Frisians adorned with uncommon piety and learning, most worthy of the goodwill of learned and distinguished men, one of whom, the younger, I have been closely associated with.</p>
      <p>Mr. Beza wrote that Mr. Calvin is gravely ill and that there is very little hope left for his recovery. Two noble Poles are with me, along with a tutor, a young man adorned with learning and integrity. My affairs are in good condition; we trust that the plague will soon abate.</p>
      <p>I was going to write something to Mr. Lavater and Mr. Simler, if any time had been left.</p>
      <p>Therefore, greet them very much in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again, most illustrious lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, March.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Utenhove, of Ghent.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant minister of the Church of Zürich, his lord and teacher, much to be honored. Zürich.</p>
