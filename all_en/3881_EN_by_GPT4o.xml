      <p>To his dear Viret, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I cannot easily and briefly express how much I have been tormented for a long time by the unfortunate disturbances that have arisen in the church of Lausanne. However, I did not write to your piety about this matter, because I hoped that our dear Martyr (d. d. Martyris nostri) had such authority with you (whom I knew had written to you and urged you not to abandon the church entrusted to your faith) that you would be easily persuaded to remain there. But now, since I understand that you have abandoned it, I beg your piety, my most esteemed lord and brother, indeed by the Lord Jesus, not to disdain to return to it.</p>
      <p>For if in governing the church of Christ, it is above all to be considered that it is built up, and as much as possible peace and tranquility remain in it, and offenses are avoided, I do not see how you should not return to the abandoned church. It is certainly better to have some church and discipline than none at all.</p>
      <p>If you do not return to the church, I do not see how those whom you wish to heal by your departure can be healed. You are not unaware of what has been disputed back and forth about excommunication between the Donatists and the blessed Augustine, and likewise between the Anabaptists and us. You are not unaware of what Augustine's judgment was on this matter in his 3rd book, chapters 2 and 3, etc., against the Epistle of Parmenian. You are not unaware that the Lord instituted excommunication for correction, not corruption, for preservation, not destruction, and finally for the salvation, not the subversion, of churches. Hence, if the saints see and actually experience it breaking out to the contrary end, they are not greatly burdened to abstain from it altogether.</p>
      <p>Who does not know that the gravest disturbances and secessions have once been made in the old church for this kind of business? Indeed, it is not insignificant that the most honorable council of Bern (Bernensis) concedes.</p>
      <p>Use these things, as you can, well for the salvation of the church, the Lord will give more abundant grace. Otherwise, everything is scattered wherever you turn in the Christian world.</p>
      <p>Our churches throughout Switzerland (Helvetia) remain, by the grace of God, united in Christ. Therefore, it will be your duty to provide no occasion for our enemies to rejoice and say: the sacramentarians now use the matter of the supper not for the gathering, but for the scattering of churches. I will not recount more to your prudence, as I believe you see many other things of this kind in person and have learned much besides in this turmoil. What remains, I beg and beseech you by the mercy of our Lord God, that you may finally deign to return to your church and unite with our brothers in Bern in holy agreement.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus be with you and keep you from evil. ZÃ¼rich, March 3, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
