      <p>S. Greetings, dearest brother. Our Laelius will give your kindness a book and one image, and, if you wish, even more.</p>
      <p>Consider the modesty of the small gift kindly. Albert is working on concord, the pope strives to disturb; what will happen, I do not know. Almost everyone fears wars, dreadful wars. The same Albert was with my prince for four days. Good God, with what joy he received us, how glad I am to have become familiar with him; truly he has excellent qualities, so that he can even use the Latin language not unsuccessfully, above all he surpasses me in revering the pope. With Frederick dead, Otto Heinrich succeeded and peacefully took possession of the electorate; now the whole Palatinate will be de-papalized, which I am diligently urging.</p>
      <p>You know that the book "On the Amplitude of the Blessed Kingdom of God" was condemned or rejected by you and your colleagues, which the people of Basel, indeed even those of Strasbourg, also did; but now the same distinguished book is being circulated as if it were printed in Basel, when it was printed in Puschlav in Raetia. I do not know who imposed it on the prince, so that he might hunt it down; but the prince immediately saw the errors and thought the book was very bad, infected with not just one error.</p>
      <p>Brentius explicitly condemned it and regrets that it was spread in Poland. Why are you silent, why do you not remind them, so that they may learn to spread good to all good churches; it does not seem a matter to be ignored, it concerns the glory of God. That is especially abominable: it explicitly says that a man can be saved by the law of nature apart from Christ. Perhaps I write impelled, but by the authority of great, but pious men, who wish that author to be restrained, so that he may not write such things anymore. But with you I speak familiarly, I would not want what I wrote to be shared with many. I bid farewell to the family, the school, the church; help me with your prayers.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, March 26, 1556.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. H. Bullinger, dearest brother. Zürich.</p>
