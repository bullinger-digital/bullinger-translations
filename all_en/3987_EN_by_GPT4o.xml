      <p>Greetings. Your letter, most illustrious and reverend father in Christ, has greatly struck me: for I seem to foresee great upheavals. But I am comforted by the fact that God is most present when He seems to be asleep with His own. The Christian faith, like a palm tree, successfully struggles through adversities.</p>
      <p>He who sits on high still lives, and He laughs at their plans, which He scatters, so that He may establish His own forever. My wife has greatly praised to me your services full of humanity and benevolence. I owe more to you and yours than I can repay.</p>
      <p>Our bishop set out today with his entourage; it is said that he wishes to consecrate a church on the way at Feldkirch in the cemetery, etc. The royal envoy himself is waiting for when he will be summoned by his king to France; he diligently works to appear Catholic. The fickle crowd always changes with the prince, yet ours does not want to be, so that it might fit him: The voice is Jacob's, but the hands are Esau's, etc.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new at the moment.</p>
      <p>I wrote this late, as we had just returned from the Alps.</p>
      <p>All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, with all of yours.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 10, 1559.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
