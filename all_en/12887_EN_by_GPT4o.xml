    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Keller is compelled by the unfortunate end of the war to bid farewell to his dear colleague Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder. He was an ornament to the Augsburg church, for he was exemplary both in teaching and in conduct. This can be confirmed by his colleagues, the council, and the people, as well as by Keller, especially since Schwyzer assisted him in church service. Therefore, if he should be disparaged in Zurich, Bullinger should protect him. Furthermore, Bullinger should pray for the city of Augsburg, which has been severely affected in its majesty, and greet his colleagues. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] The rest will be included in a joint letter from the Augsburg parish chapter [No. 2839]. Georg Frölich sends his regards and may also write. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] With the peace between Augsburg and Emperor Charles V, everything is in limbo. The Emperor departed from Ulm the day before and is heading towards Nuremberg with soldiers and war equipment. Apparently, he intends to come to the aid of Duke Maurice of Saxony, who is encircled in Zwickau by the troops of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] May the Lord protect his church. [The German Protestants] had to suffer great losses to be able to say with David that princes cannot be trusted and that help comes from the Lord alone. </p>

      <p>Greetings. The unfortunate, alas, outcome of the war, most learned Heinrich, has forced me, though with great reluctance, to let go of my beloved colleague in the Lord, Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder. For his skill in teaching and the sincerity and purity of his life would have made him a great ornament to our church. This testimony he will abundantly receive not only from the brothers but also from the council and the entire populace. Therefore, I wanted to write this to you, my esteemed brother and lord, so that Rudolf, who was added to my ministry and is more known for his innocence in doctrine and life, may be sent to you adorned with this testimony of truth. Therefore, if he is disparaged there in any way, I implore you to defend him, and pray to God for Augsburg, which is now touched by the very majesty, continually with your church, and greet the brothers and beloved colleagues in the Lord on my behalf.</p>

      <p>The rest you will receive from the common letter of our assembly. Georg Frölich sends you many greetings and may also write to you when he has the time.</p>

      <p>Regarding the peace, which is still uncertain and pending in conditions, I can write nothing certain. The Emperor, having left Ulm the day before, is proceeding directly to Nuremberg, heavily escorted by soldiers and war equipment, perhaps to bring aid to Duke Maurice of Saxony, who is encircled in Zwickau by the troops of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>May the Lord protect his church from false religion and tyranny! Amen. For with great loss of both body and life, we have learned that saying of David: "Do not trust in princes, in whom there is no salvation," and conversely, we now begin to pray: "Our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell and live happily with yours in the Lord forever! From Augsburg, March 5, 1547, from the house near St. Anna. Yours most devotedly in the Lord, Michael Keller.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable master Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church in Zurich, my esteemed lord and brother.</p>
