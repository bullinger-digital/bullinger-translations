      <p>God with us.</p>
      <p>Now I truly have nothing else to write, other than what I have already written to you, dear sir and godfather. You have urged me that, if I found the lord of Cham still at home, I should inquire anew; however, he rode to Lucerne on Sunday, as you already know. Therefore, I went to the other lord and asked him whether anything had been brought before the council in Baden regarding an alliance with Milan and whether they would allow the passage and give a final answer to Bapt.</p>
      <p>He replied that they had brought as little before the council as he had otherwise heard about it, that it should exist, and in summary, he knows nothing about it, and it is not before the council. He also said that he does not believe that even if something were brought forward, they would open the pass to any foreign people.</p>
      <p>He sends after the departure; but the lord of Cham has taken him with him concerning the matter of Glarus. But as soon as the lord of Cham returns home, I will ask him again, but I also know thoroughly well now that no pass has been opened to the Milanese envoy in Zurich.</p>
      <p>As for the German lands, it stands thus, that there is much armament for war therein, especially among the evangelical princes. The reports are now varied; yet mostly the talk is: upon the conclusion of the council, the Spaniard (Hispanus) as a Catholic king is appointed by the fathers as the defender and executor of the council. The pope is said to have secretly promised him the imperial crown, should he conduct himself well.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is concern that he (Hispanus) might attempt something against Germany, yet under the guise of helping his cousin Savoy regarding his and against Geneva.</p>
      <p>Just as well, it will further affect the Germans, us, and you. So if it were thus, how badly would you act if you allied yourself and gave him passage and way for such an undertaking? The money and gifts would deceive you and then everything would come back into the hands of those who gave it to you, and it would also be the right reward, and it would happen to you rightly. Dear...</p>
