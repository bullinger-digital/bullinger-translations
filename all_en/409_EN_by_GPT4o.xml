      <p>Greetings. Your letters have been delivered to me, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, which have brought me singular comfort in my almost overwhelming internal sorrows, and I am truly grateful to you for that. For your letters are held in the highest regard by me, as is fitting, and are placed among those things which are dearest to me. If you inquire about these domestic difficulties of mine, my dearest wife has been suffering from a severe illness for the fourth month now. Therefore, I would especially like to ask your piety to intercede with the Lord for her and for me, so that we do not collapse under this cross, but bear it with a strong heart and steadfast faith to the end.</p>
      <p>Although the state of our times is such that, if ever before, it can now most deservedly be said: blessed are those who die in the Lord, yet how well would it be for me and my four little children if we were so soon to be bereaved? But truly, in whatever direction the matter may fall, let us only pray that the Father of mercies may so prepare us, that we may sincerely say either with the Savior: Thy will be done, or with Job: The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. That this mindset may be inspired in us from above, I ask you, my best Lord Bullinger, to solicit the best and greatest with your most pious prayers, whether private or public. But enough of this [Greek], henceforth we will write about your letters to me, from which I have testified at the beginning that I have been cheered and refreshed. For I have understood that you, especially you, the pillar and head, and then also the other leaders of the ecclesiastical and scholastic republic, are most favorably and rightly disposed towards me and think of me as I have always wished, and indeed you can safely do so.</p>
      <p>And first of all, because you write most amicably that you have persuaded yourself that there will be no need for many words and arguments with me, this indeed clearly shows that there is no doubt about my zeal towards you and yours; for we do not need to spur a horse that is accustomed to run of its own accord. Therefore, I ask and pray that you persevere in this opinion of me, and I will strive, with God's help, to conduct myself towards you and your people in such a way that you will have no occasion to complain, as if you had been deceived in your hope and opinion. If you indicate with a single word or even a nod what you wish to be done by me, provided it does not exceed my strength and abilities, I will be ready to serve, not only in domestic and familiar duties but also in other more serious matters.</p>
      <p>For you are the men who, by the name of the fatherland and dignity, have no small right over me, which I freely and gladly acknowledge. Furthermore, as for the business concerning which you addressed me in the name of your most worthy college, this also declares your goodwill towards me; for we do not commend dear ones except to dear ones.</p>
      <p>Moreover, you seem to approve of my profession so much that you order your young men to be entrusted to it; for this is also a most certain judgment of your will towards me. Therefore, I give great thanks both to you, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, and to your other colleagues, men adorned with every kind of virtue and learning, for such great goodwill towards me. Furthermore, so that you may know what has been done by me, since I also approved your counsel as most prudent and consultative, I have arranged that Hyler and Bumann may henceforth have the right and permission to attend four lectures in the second class and two in the third class, namely in this one on Aristotle's Organon and Physics, in that one on Cicero's speeches and the poet of all authors and leaders, Homer; for thus they seem likely to make the greatest progress in the most excellent languages and arts, and the young men themselves told me they would be most grateful to you if I obtained this. But if you have any other opinion, you can write back; I will ensure that whatever you wish is permitted.</p>
      <p>In short, you will indeed have me as most obedient, and your young men will have me as most loving and devoted to their affairs. These are the things I had to write in response to your most loving letters at present, which you will take in good part and with singular love for me. Farewell in the Lord Jesus happily together with your most excellent wife and most fortunate offspring, for whom we pray for all good and fortunate things. Please commend me to your most worthy college and excuse me to Mr. Gualther, to whom I could not respond now due to occupations, but I will respond (God willing) as soon as I can in leisure. Let my most ailing wife be commended to your piety. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 20, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Johannes Hospinianus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man in sacred and human disciplines, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, acting archbishop of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and patron. Zürich.</p>
