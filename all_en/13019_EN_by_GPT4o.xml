    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Although Haller is waiting daily for his recall to Zurich (otherwise he would have left Augsburg on his own initiative long ago), he wants to report on the situation in Augsburg, especially since he knows how interested Bullinger and some councilors are. This Swiss messenger [...] offers himself to him, who brought the letter from the Swiss to the Emperor [from July 9]. He hopes that the present letter will be in safe hands with this messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] On July 21, when Thoman Ruman was still in Augsburg, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba and supreme military commander over the Spanish and Italian troops, arrived in Augsburg with about 1000 horses, his entire entourage, and many other princes, whose names Haller does not know all. The riders were armed with guns, not spears. The Duke of Alba is quartered in the house of Mayor Hans Welser, from where secret passages have been set up to the house of Anton Fugger, so that the Duke, the Emperor, and King Ferdinand can meet at any time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On the Monday before [July 18], the Bishop of Augsburg, Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, arrived. He is staying in the episcopal residence in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] On July 22, Ruman left Augsburg. Everyone believes he acted correctly and wonders if Haller, who stayed despite having good reasons to leave, is not crazy. However, he strives to satisfy both God and the authorities, probably harming himself in the process.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] On July 23, around 12 o'clock, the imperial procession began to enter Augsburg, led by the 10 companies already quartered in the city, forming a passage through which the Emperor passed. This was followed by a large train of mules and wagons, accompanied by 200 soldiers equipped with arquebuses. Then came the Augsburg captains and city mercenaries, dressed in black, who had ridden out to meet the Emperor. Next came the Dutch cavalry, then the imperial banner with the eagle symbol, accompanied by some lords. A little later, the three Augsburg mayors [former mayor Georg Herwart and the two mayors Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser] and some councilors rode in, who had previously received the Emperor [outside the city]. Then followed the drummers and trumpeters, then the imperial marshal [Wolfgang von Pappenheim], who carried a bare sword ahead of the Emperor. He was followed by the Emperor, surrounded by 300 guards. He wore a simple velvet coat adorned only with a small chain and rode a horse without a cover or riding gear. He looked around proudly. He was followed by the Bishop of Augsburg with a cardinal's hat and red cloak, then other bishops and clergy, then Maximilian, the son of King Ferdinand, many foreign and German princes, including Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and Landgrave Christoph of Leuchtenberg, all accompanied by many soldiers (the two last-mentioned princes had been prisoners of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony for a time). Then came the members of the imperial court, about 600 mounted nobles with their own servants. The nobles and their horses wore clothing of brown and yellow velvet over their armor. Each rider was equipped with a gun and a spear. Then followed foreign cavalrymen. The entire procession lasted about an hour. Then [Nicolò] Madruzzo and his 10 companies arrived, which again took almost an hour.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] After the procession, terrible scenes occurred between the city population and the newcomers to be quartered. The imperial troops drove people out of their homes, broke down doors, and even those who received them well were deprived of their beds and threatened. Moreover, more people are pouring into the city every day, and although they can still be accommodated, there is no more room for donkeys and horses. The cloister of the St. Anna Monastery is full of donkeys, singing mass day and night. Of all, the donkey drivers behave the most outrageously.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Two citizens [...] have already been stabbed, but no one cares! It is hardly possible to visit the church, but Haller does not want to elaborate further. Hardly one in ten of the people bustling in the streets speaks German. Honorable men are fleeing with their wives and children. Some have tried to complain to the council, but they were not helped. And so the imperial troops mock the locals and threaten them with murder and manslaughter, although they probably have not received any orders to do so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The bishops and other clergy are well treated by the Emperor, while the entire population crowds into the [houses of] the streets. Where the great lords are accommodated, mass is held. Two churches [the Augsburg Cathedral (Frauenkirche) and the Dominican Church (Predigerkirche)] have already been cleared, where the imperial troops will perform their idolatry. May it remain so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Restrictions have been imposed on the preachers. They are not allowed to reproach anyone for their faith to avoid any displeasure. This makes Haller's stay in Augsburg unbearable, regardless of whether he is recalled to Zurich or not. He would gladly endure everything else for the Lord's sake if only he could preach freely. In the current situation, however, it is not appropriate to disregard the orders of the Augsburg authorities and anger them. Therefore, it would be better not to have to be there at all. Although the citizens and common people also suffer under the circumstances, no one asks about the pastors anymore, especially since most of them, who live by their craft, know how to take advantage of the new situation. Also, all evening sermons on Saturday and Sunday have been canceled, so Haller has at most one sermon to give. The pastors are required to pray not only for the Emperor or King but for the most gracious imperial or royal majesty, as if the short designation were an insult! Haller could report much more about the Augsburg authorities. And God knows he does not exaggerate and does not want to slander them. It is almost unbelievable how much they have changed. This is why he no longer wants to serve in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Georg Frölich has sided with [the council] too much for a while. Now he is beginning to realize where this is leading. Haller has admonished him brotherly to orient himself primarily to Christ and to behave honestly, which he seems to take to heart. Bullinger's [previous] letter to him [not received] has also had an effect.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Nikolaus Müller, known as Maier, is at a loss.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Haller is accused of ingratiating himself with the common people, not being the same, and being too gullible. But God knows that he relies on no one but God's help and grace and Bullinger's advice. If only the people of Zurich had believed Haller more than the fine words of the letter written by the Augsburg council [from May 24]! Then he could have spared himself these unedifying reproaches. The people of Zurich did not even believe Müller and Michael Keller, although they are no longer children!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Perhaps Haller is unwelcome in Zurich. It is certain that he has behaved in Augsburg, despite all the turmoil, in such a way that Zurich is spared any disgrace. Although he has occasionally exposed himself more than others and was therefore exposed to greater dangers, he has always informed Bullinger about it. Enough of that!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Haller cannot tell in detail what happened to Sebastian Lepusculus. The Spaniards invaded his house. When he refused to yield to them and leave everything to them, they brought him before the council, which did not settle the case. He had to leave all the wood and wine behind. When he complained about it to Herbrot, the latter became angry and replied that he did not need any reproaches. Yes, such things the pastors have to endure! Such protection is granted to them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] It would be more honorable for the Zurich authorities if they did not leave Haller in this miserable state any longer. Haller otherwise did not mind being in Augsburg and would continue to stay there if the people of Augsburg proved faithful to God. For he could very well forgive the behavior of the foreigners. The people of Zurich now know, at least partially, how things stand in Augsburg. If Bullinger wishes, he can also let others read Haller's letter. His writing corresponds to the truth. There is much more to report than what can be entrusted to a letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] On the morning of July 26, Duke Wilhelm IV and his son Albrecht V arrived in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] On the same day in the evening, the captured Elector of Saxony was brought to Augsburg on a wagon. He was guarded by 500 Spanish soldiers (200 riders and 300 infantrymen). He is being kept in a manner befitting his rank and decently. He still has many of his own servants with him. Everyone, even the godless Spaniards, is well-disposed towards him and admires him because he always behaves bravely and shows trust in God. When he was led past the Emperor's residence, the latter had all the shutters closed and looked out through a glass pane (many people noticed this). When the Elector took off his hat for the third time, he looked up at the Emperor [in vain]. It is believed that Charles V behaved this way to avoid having to return the Elector's greeting.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] Landgrave Philip of Hesse is still in Donauwörth. He is said to be treated badly. No one speaks well of him or wishes him well. Even the foreigners say that he betrayed his own people. It is believed he will go mad. Haller regrets that God let him fall so low. May God lift him up again!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] Duke Maurice of Saxony is said to have fallen out of favor with the Emperor because Duke Henry the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel accuses him of having orchestrated his capture by cunning [in 1545]. Otherwise, he would never have given up his resistance at that time. He is now supposed to reconquer his duchy and threaten the cities of Bremen, Brunswick, Goslar, and Minden.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">[20] The chancellery of the Landgrave was searched, and much secret material was confiscated. It is feared that many honorable people will be harmed as a result.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">[21] The Emperor is said to plan to reinstate Duke Charles III of Savoy in his territories and to punish Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">[22] Haller was pleased to learn from Bullinger's [last] letter to Frölich [not received] that the Swiss are holding together. May God strengthen them in this, for the Emperor's war tactic is to sow discord among the allies. But if they continue to show unity among themselves, he will certainly not attack them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest23">[23] For a time, it was claimed that Sultan Suleiman had taken Pressburg, but this rumor has dissipated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest24">[24] The Augsburg merchants report how the Venetians are being persecuted for Christ's sake. May the latter confess God to the end! Amen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest25">[25] Otherwise, Haller has nothing more to report. Bullinger should greet all councilors, friends, and his household and pray for him to be delivered from this misery!</p>

      <p>By God's grace first. Although I am hopeful that, if it is God's will, I will soon be with you (since I am waiting daily for my lord's recall - otherwise I would have long since taken leave myself), yet since I know that you and other lords are eager to hear how things stand with us, I cannot withhold this from you, especially since this messenger of the Swiss Confederates, who brought a letter to the imperial majesty here, offers himself to me. For I hope it is safe what I write with him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>On July 21, when Romanus was still with us, the Duke of Alba, the imperial majesty's supreme field commander over the Spanish and Italian troops, arrived here with about 1000 horses and many followers, along with other princes whose names I do not all know. The riders all carried long handguns, no spears. He is staying in Mayor Welser's house, from which secret passages have been made to Fugger's house, where the Emperor is staying, so that he, the Emperor, and the King, who will be staying between the Emperor and the Duke of Alba, can always come together in the houses.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>On the Monday before, the Bishop of Augsburg arrived, as I wrote to you before. He is staying at the episcopal residence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>On July 22, Romanus left. Everyone says he did the right thing, and whether I am not foolish, who have such good reasons and let such an opportunity pass? But I would always like to do what pleases God and the world; but I fear I am harming myself with it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>On July 23, around noon, the Emperor's troops began to enter. First, the 10 companies stationed in the city moved forward and made a passage through the city, so that the Emperor had to ride through them. A large train of mules and wagons followed them. They were accompanied by about 200 arquebusiers. Then our captains and city mercenaries, who had ridden out to meet the Emperor, all dressed in new black clothes. After them, the Dutch cavalry (I cannot estimate how many there were). After them, the imperial banner with the eagle and some lords with it. In between was a small gap. Then three of our mayors and the councilors who received the imperial majesty. After them, the drummers and trumpeters. Then the Emperor's marshal, carrying a bare sword before him. And after him, the Emperor with the guards, of whom there are 300, very simply in a velvet coat and a small chain over it (otherwise neither gold nor silver, also the horse in the simplest way, without cover and without gear). He looked around boldly at all the houses. After him, the Bishop of Augsburg in a cardinal's hat and red cloak, also other bishops and clergy. Then Maximilian, Ferdinand's son, and many Italian and German princes, Margrave Albrecht and Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, who were both previously captured by the Elector, all with many people. After the princes, the imperial court servants of the nobility and others, each with his own servants, up to 600 horses or more, dressed in brown and yellow velvet (horse and man over the armor). They carried spears and guns. After them, a group of Italian cavalry. Thus he entered. It lasted an hour from the time the mayors rode until the end of the cavalry. After the cavalry, the Lord of Madruzzo with 10 companies of foot soldiers. It also lasted almost an hour.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Then the trouble began between the citizens and them, until they were quartered. Much mischief happened that day. They drove people out of their houses, broke open doors, threw people, even where they were well received, out of their beds (they wanted to lie there), along with unspeakable threats. Besides, there is still such an influx of foreign people every day that, although the people are already oppressed, the donkeys and horses cannot be accommodated. The cloister in our monastery is full of donkeys. They sing mass day and night. The donkey drivers are more wanton than anyone else.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Two of the citizens have already been stabbed. No one asks about it. We can hardly come to church; I will not speak further. Not one in ten people you see on the streets is German! Honest men flee with their wives and children, boys as well as daughters. Some have complained, but the lords cannot help them. So the imperial troops laugh at us now. When they see us, they threaten to behead, hang, burn, although I think those who do it have no orders.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The bishops and clergy are the most important to the Emperor, and the streets are full of people. In all the houses where the great lords are staying, mass is held. They have already cleared two churches, where they will practice their idolatry. May God let it remain so!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Our preaching has been so restricted that we are not allowed to reproach anyone for their faith, so that no displeasure arises. This makes it difficult, yes unbearable, to be here, whether they send me or not. I would gladly endure the rest for the Lord's sake, if only I were allowed the freedom. That I then cry out against their will and cause displeasure is not appropriate at this time. Therefore, it would be better not to be here at all. The citizens and common people, although heavily burdened, do not ask us anything, since most of them, who know how to enjoy the trade, do not care. They have also canceled all evening sermons on Saturday and Sunday, so I have no more than one sermon to give. They also want us to pray not only for the Emperor and King, but for our most gracious lords, the imperial and royal majesty. And this is driven by our authorities (God knows I do not say this to speak ill of them, but it is the truth) so much that it is unbelievable how their minds have changed! Therefore, I cannot and do not know how to serve here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Laetus has been too compliant for a while, but he is beginning to realize where it leads. I have brotherly admonished him for God's sake, he should not let anything be dearer to him than Christ and steadfast honesty; which he begins to recognize, for he truly wanted to hold too much for a while. But I know well why; but it is getting better, as I hope. Your writing has also done well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Dr. Nikolaus Meyer also does not know where to go.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I must let it be said of me that I want to ingratiate myself with the common people; and am no longer the Haller; and I trust the people too much; and other such things. Now God knows my heart, that I look to no one but His help and grace and your advice. And would God, you had long believed me more than the smooth words they wrote to you. Then I would not need these reproaches. Dr. Nikolaus and Master Michael Keller are not children. But they also have little faith in them. Now well! So it stands now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Perhaps they wish me no good; I must commend that to God. But I have conducted myself in Augsburg, through all the turmoil I have encountered there, in such a way that the city of Zurich should have no shame. I have sometimes done more than others; therefore I must also endure more danger, as I have often written to you. But enough of that.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>What happened to Lepusculus, I cannot write in detail. Spaniards came into his house. When he resisted, refused to yield, and did not want to give everything they wanted, they brought him to the mayor. They could not settle it otherwise than that he had to leave the house and leave the wood and wine he had there. And when he said to Herbrot: "Is this the protection you promised us?", he became angry and said there was no need for such insolent words. This happens to us! We must endure it! This is the protection we have!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Therefore, it would be more honorable for my lords if they did not leave me in this displeasure, than if they left me in it. Otherwise, I appeal to God that I am never unwilling to be here and could still be here if only our people were faithful. I would overlook the behavior of the foreigners. So you have in part how things stand with us. You may also let others read it if you wish, for it is the truth. And there is much more going on, of which not all can be written.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>On July 26 in the morning, Duke Wilhelm and Duke Albrecht of Bavaria's son arrived.</p>

      <p>On the same day in the evening, the captured Elector of Saxony was brought on a wagon with 500 Spanish guards, 200 on horseback and 300 on foot. He is held princely and well. He still has many of his own court servants with him. Everyone is favorable to him, even the Spaniards, because he always shows himself brave and cheerful in God; which even the godless are amazed at. When he was led before the Emperor's lodging, the Emperor had all the windows closed and looked out through a transparent glass, so that many people saw him. The Elector took off his hat for the third time and looked up, hoping to see him. It is believed he did this so that he would not have to show reverence again out of shame.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>The Landgrave has been taken to Werd. He is said to be treated badly. I hear no one who wishes him well or speaks well of him. The Italians themselves say he betrayed us. It is also said that he is going mad. I am sorry that God lets him fall so low. May He graciously lift him up again.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>Duke Maurice is also said to be in the Emperor's disfavor because the Duke of Brunswick accuses him of having treacherously brought him into captivity and persuaded him; otherwise, he would not have surrendered. He, the Duke of Brunswick, is supposed to retake his land with a force and severely plague the cities of Bremen, Brunswick, Goslar, and Minden.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>The Landgrave's chancellery has been inventoried, and many secrets found, from which it is feared that many honorable people will come to harm.</p>

      <p>I am pleased by your writing to Laetus that the Swiss are so united. May God strengthen them, for the Emperor wages war only with divisions. If he finds them united, he will certainly do nothing to them.</p>

    <div xml:id="div23" corresp="regest23">
      <p>There was a rumor for a while that the Turk had taken Pressburg, but it has been quieted again.</p>
