    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Aware of the great danger in which the entire church is hovering, Haller hopes to soon receive Bullinger's response to his repeated letters [HBBW XVIII, No. 2723. 2726]. Many people in Augsburg are losing courage. However, the pastors are proving to be more united than ever before and are warning (probably in vain) against apostasy and a disgraceful peace. Although the people are still steadfast, this can, as is well known, change quickly. If peace does not come, all the wealthy would flee the city. But if it came to a people's rule, then [the pastors] would have nothing more to say.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It has just been reported that a reconciliation with Emperor Charles V is being discussed in Strasbourg. If it comes to that, then the people of Augsburg, who are already suffering from food shortages, will probably also give up the fight, especially since they can hardly hold out alone after the Ulmers and the cities misled by them have betrayed them. How wonderful it would be if God would not abandon the city! But since it counts so many traitors and good-for-nothings, it will probably also fall.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Fuggers have returned to the city. They probably want to persuade it to accept peace. Haller fears an uprising, which the pastors will probably pay for with their lives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Charles V is said to have occupied the Duchy of Württemberg. Consequently, there will be supply shortages in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony is said to have regained control of his land and deprived Duke Maurice of Saxony of his duchy. Many rumors are circulating about Landgrave Philip of Hesse. The Elector and the Landgrave, who have demanded all their money from the cities, have a very bad reputation in Augsburg. Therefore, the cities are so inclined to make peace with the Emperor. Memmingen and Biberach are already giving in. Gervasius Schuler is even said to have praised the pious disposition of the Emperor in a sermon and assured that he had changed and was not seeking the destruction of the Gospel! Martin Frecht in Ulm is also said to be showing himself too compliant.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Augsburg pastors are united. They urge repentance with all their might, but they are unable to abolish abuses, usury, and blasphemy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The church is commended to the Lord, its only head! It must indeed be tested. But what should the [Zurich pastors working in Augsburg] do? Haller believes that they should endure to the utmost as long as the people of Augsburg remain steadfast. But if the people of Augsburg deny the truth, Haller believes they should definitely leave. If they were to fall into the hands of the enemies beforehand, they are ready to die for Jesus. But if they saw an opportunity to flee, they would take it. It is certain that they cannot remain in a church that makes a pact with the devil and forbids the free confession of the truth. The Augsburg authorities do not want to let the three pastors [Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] return to Zurich, because this could create the suspicion that they intend to deny the Gospel (which is true). If things go wrong, they will blame the clergy for it. They already accuse them of being crazy because they urge the people to be so steadfast. Do they not know that if the population were harmed, it would rise up against the pastors?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] It pains Haller to hear how badly people speak of the Confederates. Therefore, it is quite good that the Zurichers have forbidden [their] soldiers to leave Zurich! Even Sebastian Schertlin seems, like everyone else, to be mainly interested in his own enrichment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Georg Frölich is completely at a loss, as Bullinger will probably gather from his letters [No. 2741 and No. 2742]. He is the only one Haller can admire. Therefore, he commends himself with him to the will of God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] If only the Zurich council would write and show that it is concerned about its pastors! If the latter finally knew what to do, they would write to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Bernardino Ochino, who knows the disposition of the Antichrists well, is very depressed. He commends himself to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Francesco Stancaro hereby sends two booklets as thanks for the friendship shown to him by Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Hans Wilpert Zoller is doing well. Heinrich Richmut now wears a real (as far as Haller can judge) gold chain around his neck! Will he do the same in Zurich? One of his two comrades, [Hans Jakob "the Younger"?] Brennwald, behaves quite decently.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Tomorrow are the mayoral elections. If the [bearers of the present letter] had waited that long, Haller would have reported on it as well. He suspects that the former mayors [Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot] will be re-elected. The first seeks peace at any price, but the second does not, unless he is deceiving the people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] The Augsburg schoolmaster Christoph Wirsung and the wealthy [Leonhard II.] Weiß want their sons (one Philipp, the others Georg and David), who are currently studying in Strasbourg, to continue their studies in Zurich. They informed them of this in writing and enclosed a letter of recommendation from Haller intended for the Zurichers. Should these boys actually come to Zurich, the Zurichers should take good care of them and find a reputable host, as they belong to honorable and wealthy families. Sixt Birck and Haller are happy to vouch for them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] A few days ago, Hans Vogler [the Younger] informed Haller in writing that he had entered into a [secret] marriage a year ago in Lindau with [Maria Grafner], the daughter of the widowed [Euphemia, née Gasser], a sister of the Augsburg doctor Achilles Pirmin Gasser. Dr. Gasser, who knew nothing about it, had [Maria] come to him in Augsburg. As soon as Vogler found out, he visited her often. This made Gasser suspicious. He then learned from his sister about this marriage. When he confronted Vogler, he confessed. Vogler also asked the doctor to help him reconcile with his father [Hans Vogler the Elder] and to find a position. As soon as Haller learned of this, he inquired with Gasser. It became clear to him how seriously Gasser takes the matter and how difficult it would be for Vogler the Younger to be released from his vow. Gasser asked Haller to write to Vadian to ask him to mediate between son and father, as he knows both well. Bullinger should only tell Vogler the Elder about it if a good opportunity arises, as Haller plans to write to the father about it anyway. The girl is honorable. However, Haller does not know how talented she is.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] Oh, if only a letter from Bullinger would come soon! Haller is no longer able to devote himself to study or reading the Holy Scriptures. He can barely manage to write his sermons. Due to the confused situation (and not out of fear), he can hardly concentrate, not even when praying.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] Greetings to Rudolf Gwalther. Haller would have returned his sermon notes on the Epistle to the Hebrews, but he had to give the messenger so many other letters. He will send the notes soon. Greetings to Anna [née Adlischwyler] and the children, also from Haller's wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli]. Recommendations to Konrad Pellikan and Theodor Bibliander. Greetings from Birck, who is currently present.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] Haller could not read through the letter again.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I cannot describe to you, venerable father, how much in danger not only our affairs but the entire church are! I have written to you once and again recently. Anxiously, I await your advice and response. The spirits of many among us are declining. However, we ministers of the word are all in agreement. Such concord and consensus have never been among us before. We urge them not to falter, not to surrender to impious conditions, but I fear we will achieve little. The people are indeed steadfast. But you know how fickle the crowd can be. Unless peace is restored, the wealthy and all the superiors will flee. But if the people hold the reins, we will all ride under the horse.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>At this hour, it is also reported that the people of Strasbourg are contemplating making peace with the emperor. If this happens, it will give our people even more reason to falter. We are pressed by a shortage of resources, which will easily conquer the people. Ulm, by God, has betrayed all other cities. Will Augsburg alone remain? If only it would remain alone! I would hope the Lord would not abandon us, but since the city abounds with traitors and scoundrels, I do not see how it will remain steadfast.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Fuggers have returned to the city. What monster they are nurturing, I do not know, but I easily suspect they are plotting to drag the city into some peace conditions. I greatly fear a sedition, which will ultimately end with our heads.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>They say the emperor is occupying the Duchy of Württemberg. I do not know how many towns he has already occupied. From there, neither wine nor other supplies will be provided to us any longer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>They say the Elector has regained all his dominion and has deprived Duke Maurice of his duchy. There are also many uncertainties about the Landgrave. Since they have sought nothing but money during this time of war and have drained the cities, they are very poorly regarded among us, which will also make it easier for them to be moved to make a pact. Memmingen, Biberach, and other cities are also declining. Gervasius, I do not know by what insane spirit, praises the pious mind of the emperor in a public sermon. He advises surrendering. He claims the emperor has changed; he is not seeking the extermination of the Gospel, but I do not know what else. I hear Frecht in Ulm has also conceded too much in this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We are unanimous: We cry out until we are hoarse, urging repentance as never before, but we cannot bring about the abolition of abuses, usury, blasphemies, etc. Hence, I do not promise myself much good.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Come on! We commend ourselves and the church to the Lord, to whom it belongs; who alone is its head. It must be tested. But what should we do in these troubles, I beseech you to consult. As long as they stand by the truth, we will remain to the point of blood. But if they surrender or if we sense they will surrender, I do not think we should remain in any way. If we fall into their hands, we will be, with God's spirit contributing from above, courageous and eager in the testimony of Jesus. But if a convenient opportunity to escape arises, we should use it wisely. For I cannot remain in this church, which makes a pact with Belial; where the free profession of the truth is not allowed. Our lords do not want to send back 3 brothers, lest they seem to be contemplating defection, which they are indeed contemplating. In the end, this bean will be pounded on the ministers. For they openly tell us, are we not insane? What are we going to achieve with the people? The people themselves will rush upon us when they have to suffer anything. In short: We stand between the sacred and the stone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Zurichers do well to have forbidden anyone to leave for military service, because many people, high and low, speak so badly of the Confederates that it could make my heart bleed. I would like to see what they achieve. But unfortunately, it is clear. Schertlin now also lets himself be gilded in the devil's name. Everyone seeks private gain!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Dr. Laetus is also very doubtful, as you might understand from his letters. He does not know where to turn. He is the only one I admire, and I will commit myself to the same fortune as him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I wish the Zurich lords would write to us and give some hope of returning, so we do not seem to be completely abandoned by them in these dangers. If we sense anything more certain, we will inform them with a common letter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Dr. Bernardino is very dejected. For he knows the minds of these antichrists. He asked me to commend him to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Dr. Stanggarus sends you great thanks for the friendship offered. He sends you these two booklets.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Zoller is well. Heinrich Richmut wears a gold chain (unless I am mistaken about the material) around his neck here; I wonder if he does so at home too. His other companion, Braevald, is an honest and serious man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Tomorrow, the consuls will be elected. If they had waited, I would have written about it too. However, I do not think others will be elected than the old ones: Welser and Herbrot. Welser seeks peace in every way. The other does not, unless I am mistaken in my judgment, and his words are dissonant from his mind.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Furthermore, I have nothing else to write, except that if these young men, Philipp Wirsung, Georg, and David Weiß, from Augsburg, who are now studying in Strasbourg, happen to come to you, you should commend them for their very honorable and sufficiently wealthy parents, one of whom, Wirsung, is one of the schoolmasters. They asked me to commend them to you, so that if they happen to come to Zurich (for they will write to them to come to Zurich), you will provide for them, so they may live with some honest man. Their expenses will be generously supplied. Xystus and I will be their guarantors. They will also undoubtedly bring my letters of recommendation with them, which their parents, having obtained from me, send to Strasbourg, so that they may have hope of finding more convenient lodging in Zurich.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>A few days ago, Vogler confessed to me in a letter sent to me that a year ago, while he was in Lindau, he married there the niece of Dr. Achilles Gasser. She has now been summoned to him by Dr. Achilles, who has become a citizen of Augsburg; Vogler immediately found her and visited her so frequently that he became suspicious to the doctor. Having first inquired from his sister, he learned that he had married her. Then he also spoke to Vogler himself, who confessed that he had married her and implores his help to be reconciled with his father and to find a position. When I learned this from him, I approached Dr. Achilles to ask if the matter was as it seemed. I sense that he is pressing the matter and that Vogler will not easily be able to escape here. Therefore, I wrote about this matter to Dr. Vadianus, as Dr. Achilles advised, in case he might provide himself as a convenient mediator between Vogler the elder and Dr. Achilles, both of whom are familiar to him. Therefore, you should not tell him anything unless it can be done conveniently. I will also write to him myself. I just wanted to inform you, in case you have any advice to offer. The girl herself is honest, but I do not know how gifted she is.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Write back quickly, I beg, so that I may find some relief in these troubles. All my studies have ceased. I can barely compose my sermons. I only read the sacred texts. My mind is so distracted, not by fear, but by the perplexity of the situation, that I am not as able to pray as I would like to be.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>Greet Dr. Gwalther. I would have sent him the notes on the Epistle to the Hebrews, but I had already burdened the messengers with many other letters. I will send them soon. Also, greet his wife and sweet children. My wife sends her greetings to you. I wish Dr. Pellicanus, Dr. Theodor, and other venerable fathers and brothers well. Dr. Xystus, who is with me as I write this, sends you many greetings. Augsburg, January 7, 1547.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>Forgive me. I was not able to read through it again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his lord and venerable father. M. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
