      <p>Greetings. My venerable Bullinger, dearest brother, I will always perform my duty towards all those whom you commend to me, provided that I may obtain this one thing from you: that you do not become angry because I very rarely write anything to you; for I am torn apart by countless (unzählige) affairs, so that I can do nothing for friends. Perhaps soon, a little more leisure will shine upon me.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and commend me, as you do, to Christ. Greet Pellican, Theodor, Leo, and all the others.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, April 26, 1535.</p>
      <p>Truly yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the people of Zurich, lord and brother much to be revered in Christ.</p>
