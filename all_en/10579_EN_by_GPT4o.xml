      <p>Grace from God, the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You should know about a good, poor fellow from the community of Roggwil, who is suffering adversity solely because of divine justice. The bailiff of Arbon has forbidden us preachers and has prohibited us from all church properties. He has also come among us into the church and started a dispute with some. I said that if the bailiff of Arbon would not let us remain in peace and justice and would throw us into an unjust cost, I would be the one to seek the chest (treasury) from him. Then someone said, "He would lie in the castle and would let you be summoned." However, I said that if he wanted to lie in the castle and not keep peace and justice, one could still pull him out of the castle and throw him out by the head. Because of such words, my lord bailiff wants to take from me what I have. Therefore, I ask you, dear sir, to take my matter to heart for the sake of God and for the sake of my small, defenseless children. My brother-in-law knows and leads my case; he is not informed of these matters. If I can earn this from you, along with the entire community of Roggwil, I will do so.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>From me, Hans Zipperli, always willing with the help of God, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, into his honorable hand.</p>
