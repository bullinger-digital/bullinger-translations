      <p>Greetings. I have taken care to transcribe what our beloved brother Beza wrote to me, and I wish to share it with you; he also sends you his warmest regards. Cardinal of Lorraine and the King of France are entirely focused on holding a council, but with deceitful intentions, about which there is no time to write now. A delegate from the King of France, named Saint Lawrence, is being sent to the Emperor, who, in a letter to me from Schaffhausen during his journey, does not conceal the reason for his mission, etc. May the Lord scatter the plans and [counsels] of the impious! Messengers are also being sent to the princes of Germany, etc. I, having been warned early from Italy about the counsel of Ahithophel, revealed the matter to the most illustrious Prince of Hesse; for he had sent a messenger to me these days, through whom he indicated what the theologians of Jena are attempting to persuade the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg and other princes to convene a synod, in which the adiaphorists and Zwinglian sacramentarians would be condemned, etc. I hope the Lord will disperse their impious plans.</p>
      <p>I received letters from England dated at the end of May and mid-June, testifying that religion is progressing beautifully by God's grace, and that the English are waging a social war in Scotland against the French. There was some discussion about peace for a while; however, they did not add anything about it, but rather pamphlets were published in London at that time, one being the protestation of the King of France, the other the response of the Queen of England, in which it is discussed by what right or wrong the war is waged on both sides, etc. May the Lord grant peace! Everything is turbulent everywhere.</p>
      <p>Several papist bishops in England have been thrown into prison in recent days, etc.</p>
      <p>The pamphlet mentioned by Beza about the Ambrosian tumult was not given to me by the couriers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Matthias, with whom you will share this.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 12, 1560. In great haste. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Sent to Winterthur to Mr. Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
