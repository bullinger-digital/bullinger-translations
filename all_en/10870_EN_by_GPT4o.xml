      <p>To Kaspar Megander of Bern.</p>
      <p>The more I desire your letters, my dear Megander, the less frequently you write. I do not know what the reason is; however, I suspect that your occupations are the cause. But if you make up for the neglect with a written letter, I will complain no more.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is something that greatly torments my mind: the syncretism of your people and the French. I fear, my dear Kaspar, that it will be a great evil for all of us, especially for the Gospel. Your people do not want to assist the French with troops, but hostile armies of the Emperor are being led through their borders. They seem to favor the French entirely, who support and assist the French troops, and I wish they would not even pursue them. You know how much the martial spirits of our people are stirred by the well-equipped phalanxes of those setting out. You are not unaware of how much damage Jehoshaphat suffered because he favored the party of Ahab. Today, indeed, there is no king more wicked than the tyrant of the French. This is the one whose hands are still stained with Christian blood. This is the one who pollutes everything with adulteries, debaucheries, and lusts, from whose plots and violence not even a matron or maiden in France was safe. This is the one who has corrupted all the dynasties and republics of Europe with his gold. This is the one who has shed more native and Swiss blood than any of the kings. This is the one who first sowed the discord that will soon ruin us, in our free and united country. In short: This is the one who, for nearly 23 years, has disturbed all of Europe, has laid waste to many cities with their citizens, who has afflicted, wearied, and worn down Italy, Germany, Spain, the most powerful kingdoms, with long wars, and has set kings against each other. He has also incited the Turk against the Christians and has never accomplished anything noble. Now, indeed, against law and right and the given oath, he invades the borders of Lombardy, so that he may finally receive his deserved reward. Yet today we honor him as a friend, we support his cause. Consider what I write to you, and to you alone. I do not think you would do anything unworthy if you were to warn your people not to join too closely with this most despicable scoundrel and his cause. The alliance of the kings of Egypt and Assyria never ended well for Israel. I wish we may not be forced someday to witness the miserable fate of our country! It certainly went well for those who bravely fell at Capellas in a just cause and for the name of Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and most venerable Kaspar, and continue to love me.</p>
      <p>May 27, 1536.</p>
