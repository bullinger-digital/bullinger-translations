    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] On Tuesday [October 11], Blarer received three letters [not preserved] from Bullinger. On the same day, Johannes Haller traveled through Konstanz, but Blarer was unable to send a letter with him at that time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Shortly thereafter, news arrived that Ravensburg is being asked to take in Spanish soldiers or pay a certain sum. Just as it is written in Hosea, foreigners drain everything to the last drop. God help us!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blarer lent the first illustration [of the Glarus celestial phenomenon] to someone [...], who forwarded it without Blarer's knowledge. Therefore, he was no longer able to send it to Vadian when a messenger [...] was available. He apologized to Vadian for this. Thanks to Bullinger for his faithful correspondence and for the [new] illustration. The vision, as Bullinger rightly judges, is to be understood as a warning from God. May God have mercy on the blind and deaf world!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The letter addressed to Bullinger from Hans Schöner will be forwarded by Blarer to his sister Sabina today, conveying the thanks from Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler] and announcing an upcoming letter from Bullinger. Blarer will also enclose a copy of the letter from the Augsburg authorities addressed to him and Bullinger. May Schöner bear his suffering in patient expectation of the Kingdom of Heaven in the short time he has left!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Haller can report that Emperor Charles V is not as ill as claimed. Nothing more could be learned about the 10,000 [casualties of the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]. The news from England aligns with what is read at Bullinger's. If only the Kingdom of God would come! The news received from Bullinger and the people of Konstanz about the Hanseatic cities is also consistent. May God stem the tides of these troubled times! The Swiss are rightly planning to defend themselves against the Emperor and King Ferdinand. Everything points to a [military confrontation], and without God's help, all is lost, for nothing can be expected from the Germans who are divided among themselves.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The messenger [...] has just brought Bullinger's last letter [not preserved]. As Blarer wrote earlier [with No. 3021], the rumors about Philipp Melanchthon's [recantation] are not true. He has no evil intentions. He could be of no use to the old [imprisoned] Elector Johann Friedrich I of Saxony. He did not want to go to Leipzig. So he still wants to stay in Wittenberg. However, he made himself available to the old and the young prince, Duke Johann Friedrich II the Middle, in case a school is founded in Weimar or elsewhere.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bullinger will probably know what the envoy of King Henry II of France [Louis Daugerant, Seigneur de Boisrigaut] wanted to achieve with the Swiss, even if he did not come to Zurich. May God bring all these monarchs to serve Christ!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Should Blarer receive reliable news, he will share it. Currently, however, so many lies are being spread that he is disheartened by the transmission of news. Even reputable people are tempted to spread fabricated tales!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Enclosed is a document regarding a council. It is clear from this that nothing can be expected from it! But the Lord will prevail. May He grant the patience to wait.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] If only people trusted in God, as Bullinger also wishes! Then everyone would be helped, and we could defy the world and its princes like kings or emperors. May God increase our faith!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Blarer still hopes that [Konstanz will not grant the Emperor] an unchristian and [before God] indefensible [peace], especially since the cruel examples [of other cities] are still vividly before our eyes! Bullinger should earnestly pray for the people of Konstanz. What else can be done?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Recently, Bullinger transmitted 4 florins from the schoolmaster Kaspar Seidensticker, who works in Burgdorf or Aarau. However, Blarer and Jakob Funcklin had each lent him 2 gold crowns, totaling 4, which correspond to 6 florins. The debtor will surely remember this! Bullinger should urge him to pay the remaining 2 florins immediately and not grant him any delay, so that other needy people can also be helped. Bullinger should forgive the associated inconvenience, but since Seidensticker sent him these 4 florins for transmission, he must now demand the rest.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Greetings, also from Thomas Blarer and Konrad Zwick. Sebastian Schertlin and Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz, both of whom are ill with a fever, also send their regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] [P.S.:] Here come the two youths, previously mentioned [in letter No. 3021], [Josua and Joseph Boschar]. They are warmly recommended to Bullinger and Johannes Wolf! The elder, Josua, has been appreciated by everyone since his childhood for his piety and eagerness to learn. Recently, as usual, the scholarship students studying at the Collegium [praedicatorum] in Strasbourg from the four cities [Biberach, Isny, Konstanz, and Lindau] were inspected by a representative [...] of those cities. Both the teachers and the school supervisor [Crispinus Pithopoeus] were clear that Josua is destined for an extraordinary fate compared to all other students. The younger brother, Joseph, cannot be compared to the elder. However, he is not bad (just less gifted) and is also sociable. Both should not cause Wolf any trouble. They bring him some money, as Bullinger wished. May the Lord promote their studies to the glory of His name and the edification of His church!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] The Emperor is said to have sent a lot of money as a gift to the Swiss in Lucerne. If that is true, Bullinger will already know about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Pray to God that He may have mercy on us and His church, grant us more favorable conditions, and above all, improve us; for then the world can do nothing to us, and everything will work out for our good.</p>

      <p>Dearly beloved, especially trusted lord and brother, I received your three letters well on Tuesday and had nothing at that time that I could send you with the pious, dear Haller, who then traveled here and back on the same day.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Shortly thereafter, news arrived that they want to station Italian troops in Ravensburg or demand a sum of money for it, so that everything is drained and the foreigners must consume our strength and power, as Hosea 7 says. God help us all!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I had the first picture with someone who sent it away without my will, so I couldn't send it to Vadian when I had a messenger. I apologized to him. I thank you very much for your heartfelt, Christian correspondence, also for the picture, whose best interpretation is, as you write, that God wanted to warn us in time. May He grant grace that we believe it. For this wicked world also lacks common sense; it is deaf and blind with open eyes and ears. God have mercy on it!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I am sending you Schöner's handwriting today through his sister, so that she also hears something from me. Write to her, along with thanks to your dear wife, with the indication that you will write yourself shortly. Also send her a copy of the letter from Augsburg addressed to both of us. May God keep the good man in his cross for the short time of his remaining life with patience in the eternal fatherland.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Regarding the Emperor not being so ill, you will have heard from Haller along with other things. I still cannot find any basis regarding the 10,000, etc. The news from England aligns with your writing. Oh God, that your kingdom would finally rise! The news about the Hanseatic cities is also consistent with yours. May the strong God set His limits and boundaries to this as well. Trusting in the Emperor and King, as you write, you are not mistaken. The evidence shows more and more where everything is headed. Without God's intervention, everything is deceived and betrayed according to human calculation. We Germans are all betrayed and sold, especially since we are all false and unfaithful to each other.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Now I receive your last letter from our messenger. It is indeed nothing with Philipp, as I wrote to you before, but Philipp has, in my opinion, no evil counsel for him. He could not be of use to his old Elector. He did not want to be in Leipzig for any reason. He stays in Wittenberg as long as he pleases. He promised the old and young prince that if they were to establish a school in Weimar or elsewhere, he would serve them before all people, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>You probably know by now what the French envoy's recruitment elsewhere was, even if he did not come to you. May God graciously and timely move all these monarchs to the knowledge of Himself, so that they may kiss His Son with His Holy Spirit!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>What I learn anew with certainty at any time, I will surely and accurately keep you informed. There is so much lying beyond measure that I am almost discouraged from writing news. Even the truthful ones err, who, although they never lie, often write magnificent and highly embellished falsehoods.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Herewith you receive the occasion regarding a council, which is being initiated in such a way that there is no gain for the truth. But the Lord will still set everything right in His time and finally prevail with His cause. May He grant us patience and long-suffering to wait!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>As you write, it is only to look to God. If we did that, we would be helped. Oh, how glorious, princely people and most powerful king and emperor we would be if we could truly trust and present ourselves to this supreme Lord, despite all the world and its princes! How soon they would stumble upon us and break their spear against us! Oh, my God, increase our faith!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>For our part, I am still of hopeful confidence that nothing unchristian and indefensible before all compassion will be granted, for the examples are still fresh and cruel enough before our eyes. Will anything else help us? Therefore, may the faithful God help us with all earnest prayer, for outside of this, I know nothing to trust in everything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>You sent me 4 florins some time ago from Mr. Caspar Seidensticker, now schoolmaster in Burgdorf or Aarau. Now he owes us 6, as I previously reported to you, for we lent him 4 gold crowns, which he should rightly know, and the 4 florins do not include crowns: There would always be coins added to it. It is my request that you urge him to send the remaining 2 florins as well and show himself grateful. More good has happened to him from us. The money all belongs half to Jacob Funckely: He lent 2 crowns and I two. He said, "As soon as God helps him," that he would pay us back immediately! We desire that he does so. Then other poor people can also be helped, etc. Forgive me for having to trouble you with this; for since he sent you 4 florins, you must also be concerned about the other two.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Say many, many services, good and greetings to all yours. My dear brother and cousin send you, along with S. Schärtel and Marcell Dietrich, who both have a severe quartan fever, many friendly services with all good from God. Dated October 13, 1547. Yours, A. Bl.</p>

    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Here I present to you these young men of ours, about whom I wrote to you. I commend them to you and through you to our Wolf as much as I can. The one named Josua, who is the elder, has been remarkably pious and studious since childhood, and therefore very dear to me and all good people. Furthermore, when recently the college in Strasbourg was inspected by a delegate sent from the four cities in the usual manner, and testimonies about the morals and studies of each student were collected from the teachers and the steward, all unanimously placed this Josua beyond the common lot of all others. May the Lord graciously grant him His spirit, so that he may advance more and more in piety and letters! The other, although he does not equal his brother in any way, is not bad, but moderately talented and manageable, so we believe they will not cause Wolf any inconvenience. They bring some money with them for Wolf, as you requested. May the Lord bless their studies for the glory of His name and the edification of the church!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>It is written here that the Emperor is said to have sent many crowns to Lucerne to gift the Confederates. But if there is any truth to it, it would not be hidden from you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, that He may have mercy on us and His church, grant us better conditions than we have seen and endured for a long time, and above all, make us better. For then this worst world will do us no harm, but everything will turn to profit. Yours, and entirely.</p>
      <p>To the very distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and dear brother.</p>
