    <p xml:id="regest1">In the year 1543, Bullinger published a treatise on the true justification of a Christian as a preface [to his work «In evangelium secundum Ioannem commentarius»]. He has now had it reprinted separately [under the title «Iustificatio»] in Zurich [by Christoph Froschauer the Elder]. In doing so, he certainly hoped that his view of justification by faith alone would become known to many. That is likely to happen!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Thamer bought Bullinger's commentary on John four years ago, read it, and excerpted some parts from it. However, he must admit that it was only the new edition, which seemed like a new book to him, that prompted him to engage with Bullinger's [view] again. He would like to discuss it with Bullinger, if he agrees. This should initially happen confidentially between the two of them in the spirit of the Lord. Afterwards, if this exchange proves beneficial for the glory of God and the church, it could also be public, so that all may partake in the talent entrusted to them by God and one day hear like the faithful servant: «Well done, you are good and faithful servants, you have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over all my possessions» [Cf. Mt 25, 21].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[This is followed by a detailed theological treatise on Bullinger's writing «Iustificatio» from 1548, in which Thamer comments on chapters 1-15 after a general part].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Due to his limited time, Thamer cannot address all chapters (this letter has already taken a whole day!), but he will catch up on that. Bullinger should use the next Frankfurt Autumn Fair as an opportunity [for letter delivery] to respond to Thamer's remarks or correct them if necessary, as anyone can err. It would be reprehensible to persist in error.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings. May Thamer and Bullinger, including the Zurich colleagues, continue to show goodwill towards each other.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ. Five years ago, you published a treatise on the true justification of a Christian as a preface, which you have now had reprinted separately in Zurich, certainly hoping that this doctrine of justification by faith alone would become known to many and that the reason for your teaching would be more evident, which you will undoubtedly achieve with many.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Indeed, to begin with myself, although four years ago, when I bought your commentaries on John, I read them as time allowed and noted some things from them, I must honestly confess that it was only with this later edition that I was drawn back to you and thought I was recognizing a new book. Since you have now made your work public and common, I ask you, my dear Bullinger, that with your permission, I may discuss a few things with you on the same subject, first privately between us alone according to the Lord's command, and then, if it is to the honor of God and fruitful for the church, we will set sail and place our talent in the name of the Lord, so that we may hear with that faithful servant: Well done, good servants, because you have been faithful in a few things, I will set you over all that I possess, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Two main points are contained in your writing. The first part is about faith, which you assert is the sole cause of salvation without all works, and you interpret it as many others do in these times: a mere trust in mercy, which we conceive from the vocal word towards God concerning grace and eternal life to be given in the future. The second part is about good works, which you judge to be an honorarium or, as you call it, an ornament and clothing of the new creature itself and not to pertain to the substance and constitution of God's righteousness, even if they proceed and descend from God - just like faith itself. This opinion about faith and good works, although often debated in the church and defended by some with a gladiatorial spirit, has never won victory or been accepted. God has always raised up men who would support the truth and remove and examine the lie from religious hearts, lest they lose salvation through evil security. For as Saint Augustine testifies in the book On Faith and Works, chapter 14, immediately after the Apostle Paul was killed by Nero, the sons of Belial arose, who, along with the yoke of Moses, also tried to cast off the gentle yoke of Christ, claiming the authority of the apostle, whom they falsely said taught that all works, even of love, were separate from the faith of Christ, and that faith alone sufficed for salvation. Against whom, he says, James, Peter, John, and the other apostles and elders wrote. Indeed, the same impudence and lie of theirs he refuted and reproved through an entire book, which he titled On the Spirit and the Letter, showing that the Apostle Paul did not separate all works, but only those preceding faith in Christ. Therefore, if Saint Augustine, indeed the apostles and fathers, are as important to you as they deserve to be, there is nothing more I need to discuss with you. Our victory is assured, since such a faith alone has been condemned by the whole church and is still condemned, and is considered similar to the faith of demons, as the same Augustine proves in the book On the One Baptism from the Apostle James, part 6, chapter 10. Also Psalm 31. These places you pass over in silence, and you improperly bring forward those that seem convenient to you. Hence, while you think you have confirmed the doctrine of faith alone learnedly, you fall into the opposite and supply us with weapons from the fathers by which you are defeated. And, to address each point in order, we wish to retain the method you have kept, lest any confusion arise, and to distinguish, interpret, and refute in such a way that the reader may clearly see, as on a tablet, which opinion is truer and more fruitful for the church and us. When I have completed this briefly, I hope that both you and others will not only read attentively but also faithfully weigh each and all things, so that they may perceive that I have sought nothing but the truth itself. If I err from it, I desire to be led back to the way and instructed by you. I am not so obstinate that, when convinced by certain arguments - as many are in these times - I would not relinquish any preconceived opinion, unless perhaps God blinds or hardens me so that I see nothing with my eyes or understand with my heart. May God the Father avert such blindness from us through Jesus Christ! Amen. Therefore, you first present various opinions about faith, of which you number four: One of those who assert that one is justified by faith alone in Christ. Another of those who condemn and reject the same. A third, who attribute justification to both faith and works. Lastly, those who assign the beginning to faith, but the completion to works. Of these, I will say nothing now. For it is not our intention at this time to inquire what each believes, nor, if I were to inquire, would it ever be possible to investigate. For who, except God alone, is the knower of hearts? But I wonder why you list true faith among opinions. Are we righteous and pleasing to God by opinion? Far from it! Therefore, in my opinion, you would have done much better if you had treated human opinions separately and apart from the true faith, which the apostles hand down and which we do not opine but, like Abraham, discover with full assurance. For both dialecticians and scripture teach us to divide, so that we may separate falsehood from truth by the whole genus. And then we may subdivide either falsehood or truth with their recognized and neighboring species. The faith of Christians is not to be judged by human opinion, but by the word of God. Let men opine what they will. What is that to us? Concerning the first chapter. You rightly inquire at the beginning about the name, what justification means, but you understand and define it somewhat incorrectly, although the words are not inappropriate. You say: To justify is "to give praise to God, to yield, to freely and openly confess that He alone is righteous, we are sinners and unrighteous," etc., since you think that praise is given to God by faith alone without works. This is false, even from that Matthew 5, where it is said that God is glorified by good works, etc. Also Titus 1: They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, etc. Also Philippians [2]: Shine as lights in the world, blameless, in the midst of a crooked nation. Therefore, it is absurd what you conclude from this: In the present cause to be inquired, the word justify is forensic, taken from the forum, and signifies to pronounce just (that is, to free from punishment and declare absolved) him who is accused and now summoned to punishment, etc. If it is taken from the forum, as you rightly think, and no one there is justified or condemned unless he is truly (that is, in deed and truth) innocent or guilty, it necessarily follows that you have spoken confusedly here. Because to justify is not simply to pronounce just (that is, to absolve) him who is accused, but to absolve him who is rashly and innocently accused. This meaning is clarified by the very last things you add. Because you bring an example from Deuteronomy 25: If there is a dispute between men, they shall go to judgment, that the judges may discern between them, and they shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked, etc. Behold, here you see that to justify is to pronounce just him who is righteous, not him who only believes, as James and Christ (Matthew 25) openly testify. He who clothes, does not believe he will be clothed, he who feeds, does not believe he will be fed, etc. He is righteous: To this pertain the many testimonies you cite from the prophets, where the doers of the law (namely, the spiritual law) not the hearers or assents, will be considered righteous. Therefore, that of Isaiah, which you allege, will fit us excellently, saying: Woe to those who justify the wicked, etc. Do we not justify those who have only an opinion about the mercy of God? But these are wicked, as those who honor God with their lips! True worshipers will worship the Father in spirit or trust in mercy and truth (that is, in good works in this mortality). Therefore, righteousness is not only the absolution and remission of sins, as you contend, but also the sanctification and operation of the Holy Spirit, which if they are not in you, you certainly deceive yourself thinking you are wise, when you do not yet rightly understand: 1 Corinthians 3 and Galatians 6: If anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself, etc. Nor does David simply say: "Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven," but adds: "whose sins are covered" and to whom "God does not impute sin," etc. What this means, Augustine in his Quinquagena clearly demonstrates. Because God forgives sins, not righteousness or good works. He imputes what is imperfect as if it were perfect, not what is nothing. If he excluded all works, even of love, then he would have pronounced those blessed whose works were forgiven. But now he calls those blessed whose sins (that is, evil works) are forgiven. Not so that we do nothing or are justified by faith alone, but rather, that ceasing from evil we may do good, as the same prophet soon proposed in the 33rd psalm. Therefore, not only are sins to be removed, but also by infusing righteousness and works God justifies us. This is your first error in a false definition, because "the defined extends more widely than the definition." 2. Chapter. The second chapter is about the manner of justification, which you rightly assert to be Jesus Christ our Lord, as the pious and faithful have always believed from the beginning of the world and now believe. For who can be reconciled to you without your own mercy or be honorable without your own righteousness? Certainly, another's virtue brings me no praise, indeed often brings me ignominy, as if I am injurious to others, but my servant is just and good, then people will object: Theobald's servant is good, but he himself is a tyrant, etc. Therefore, if righteousness, wisdom, mercy, power, which are Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 1 and John 14), bear fruit in your heart through the Holy Spirit, you are reconciled to God, just as that member, which has my spirit and wisdom and mercy effective in it, pleases me and is reconciled. Therefore, the Spirit of Christ is the medium between you and the Father, by whom if you are led, you are reconciled to God the Father. But this does not happen through faith alone, but through those works by which God the Father is glorified. Hence it is clear that what you dream about the external cross is also false. Because when the apostle says he knows nothing but the cross of Christ, he does not mean the wooden cross or external death, but the spiritual cross (that is, to bear anything in the name of God), as he himself proclaims about himself in 2 Cor. 12. Also, that the old man through the Spirit of Christ in you is dead, you no longer seek your own advantage and vain glory, but you care for the things of God and your neighbor (1 Corinthians 10). 3. Chapter. In the third chapter, you prove with many words that it is only by the grace of God that we are justified, which seems to be a completely useless dispute among us. Because there has never been anyone, even among those sophists you condemn, who denied that it is only by grace that we are both righteous and act righteously. Read the Sentences, book 2, distinctions 26 and 27, where they cite that of Paul in Ephesians 2: "By grace you have been saved through faith," etc. Therefore, here you seek a knot in a bulrush. And you bring forward things that have no difficulty or controversy. Chapter 4. The fourth chapter is about the participation of Christ, how we become members of His body. Here you seem to stray far and wide from the truth of the gospel. For you think that he who has only trust in the death of Christ, that He died for him, is blessed, which is not simply true, but he who at the same time, as a member, is dead to his own glory and advantage, henceforth lives to God and the brethren - lives, I say, that is, bears fruit - not he who has trust in one of the natures (that is, in the created flesh of Jesus Christ), but he who through the communication of idioms communicates to both natures, human and divine, according to that 2 Peter 1. For the man was not made from the Virgin Mary so that you remain a mortal man, but that you become God and immortal. On this matter, there are many excellent sayings of Augustine in the books On the Trinity. Hence the fathers and the church rightly judged that faith of the Jews, which depends on the death of Jesus Christ the man. Since they also believe that Jesus Christ died and indeed for the people, as is evident from the prophecy of Caiaphas in John 11, where he says it is better for one to die than for the whole people to perish, etc. But the fathers judged that true faith by which we believe that Jesus Christ is God who died, not just a man. See the Sentences, book 3, distinction 24. Therefore, the same Sententiaries learnedly gather from the fathers that the death of Christ is not only the form but also the cause. By His humanity, He provided us with an example and form, which we express in deeds. By His divinity, however, He is the cause of obedience. "For where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom" (2 Cor. 3). Therefore, faith alone without the efficacy of the Holy Spirit does not suffice, nor is it the cause of salvation, as you contend (John 1: To those who receive Him, He gave the power to become children of God, etc. Namely, those who receive both natures or the whole person of Christ, these are born of God). We, Bullinger, attribute too much to the creature. The humanity of Christ is useless without the life-giving Spirit (John 6; and Augustine in book 1, On Christian Doctrine, chapter 35, where he certainly does not want those things to be enjoyed, although Luther held it tenaciously according to his custom). The error arises because we think that faith is taken only for trust, which is as if someone were to reason from that: "My soul magnifies the Lord," also "Praise the Lord, my soul," also "Let every soul be subject to the higher powers," etc. Therefore, let the soul alone magnify, let the soul alone praise, let the soul alone be subject without the body, etc. But what do those mean: "Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise," etc. Also "Glorify God now in your body and spirit," etc. Therefore, just as in the old man often a part is taken for the whole, I think, the soul or body for the whole man, so also the new man has two substantial parts, faith and love, through which - like a tree from roots and branches bears fruit - or pleases God. Nor is he alone, or will he please God naked. Trust in mercy is the foundation and root, from which love draws the juice or spirit, through which the root works. Nor is it worth anything by itself, just as a foundation without a house or a root without branches. For what are branches cut off from the root? Or what is the soul worth in this life without the body or the body without the soul? Both are the cause of works, soul and body, fire and heat, the righteous and righteousness, root and tree, faith and love. Hence the Apostle clearly says: Faith working through love, like a husband working through a wife, begets children and produces fruits. But trust alone, like a man without this help, is worth nothing. Therefore, not simply by faith alone, but by faith and love, we partake of the divine nature. "For God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God," and in him grows and bears fruit unto eternal life. And he who separates love from faith separates what God has joined, hence we are rightly separated from Him. To this pertains that: "The love of many will grow cold," etc. Both perish, root and branches, if they are separated from each other. Therefore, although faith sometimes signifies trust in mercy, it does not exclude faithfulness or love. Hence the apostle (Heb. 11) asserts faith as substance and evidence, which definition, because I have explained it in the themes I transmit to your humanity, I refer you to them. Trust is the foundation and substance, which no one can change, but it must be built upon and confirmed (that is, confirmed by good works) until the end of faith is reached. The foundation and the house are the complete work, not the foundation alone, so the root and the tree are the whole. Also, the soul and the body are one man. But on this matter, I have written a discourse of sixty-four pages, which I will gladly send to you if you promise not to publish anything without my consent. For it is my decision that I will never publish anything unless it is approved by the whole church as fruitful and beneficial to the brethren. 5. Chapter. In this chapter, you equate: "We are justified by grace. We are justified through Jesus Christ or His merit. We are righteous by faith in Christ," etc. But you deliberately omit that phrase, which occurs very frequently: We are righteous by works or the observance of commandments (Rom. 2, Luke 10, Matt. 19, 1 Cor. 7, also 1 John 2, 1 Peter 1, and in almost infinite other places). Therefore, if we are also considered righteous by works, as you elegantly and learnedly dispute in the latter part, why do you exclude them from the substance of faith? Wherefore you incur here the fault of division and composition. You bring forward the expressions that favor you, you omit the rest! 6. Chapter. In the sixth chapter, you try to prove from scripture that you rightly said faith alone justifies, even though that phrase is nowhere found in the sacred writings. Because Paul says he knows that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, etc., where you contend with many testimonies that ‹unless› means the same as ‹only›, but with these testimonies you achieve nothing else than to show that only the faith, which is of Christians, justifies, which no one ever denied. For who among the Jews or Turks ever thought, let alone believed, that faith pleases God from the pious? The word ‹unless› is a conjunction that excludes what preceded. But what preceded? The works of the law. For he says: We know that a man is not justified by the works of the law, etc. Therefore, he excludes the works of the law - the law, I say - not the works of the spirit or faith, which he himself repeatedly joins to faith, as faith working through love, etc. Also, if I have all - all, I say - faith, but do not have love, I am nothing. Also: "Now abide faith, hope, love, these three," etc. Therefore, just as Joseph, when he says to his brothers: "You will not see my face unless you bring your youngest brother," etc., does not exclude all sight. Otherwise, it would have been necessary for them to have their eyes gouged out, but he forbids it to the extent that they do not bring their brother, for this preceded. So also Paul by that ‹unless› rejects the preceding works of the law, not all, so that faith alone is and is separated even from love, which faith establishes and introduces! But he calls the works of the law all those things you do for earthly goods, so that you may live well and happily here, as if you honor God and parents so that you may be rich here and live long on the earth, not in spiritual goods, so that from these visible things you may know the invisible. God has implanted in us self-love and gave the law through Moses to be our pedagogue to Christ, so that, as you have loved yourself and this carnal honor until now, so henceforth you may love God, serve Him, and refer all things received to Him. There is a double love: legal, which we also call natural, which now, after we have been called by God, ceases, otherwise we would not be faithful servants. For how will that servant please you, who still provides and consults for himself? "No one can serve two masters," his God and his own belly. Therefore, legal or pedagogical love is to be separated from the faith of Christ, according to that: He who loves father or mother or wife or himself more than me, he cannot be my servant or disciple, etc. Here certainly he does not reject all love, but only natural and legal, by which God the Father has allowed you to live until now, not that you should remain in it, but that, called by Him, you should hold how you should serve. For unless I found in myself perfect love written, by which I pursue myself with all my heart, soul, and mind, even if Moses commanded me six hundred times to love God with all my heart, yet I would never grasp it. Hence the Apostle says we were confined under the law or this self-love as a pedagogue until faith was revealed, that is, true worship, true love, and wisdom, which is, that henceforth we love God the Father and our neighbor, as we have loved ourselves until now. And if we do this, the Holy Spirit testifies together with our spirit that we are children of God. But if we omit it, we similarly feel that we are children of sin, and we must pray that not only may He forgive that crime, but also impart the Holy Spirit, which in the future may protect and defend us from such crimes. Therefore, the works of the law (that is, those works you do for the preservation of this life or the holy land) are to be separated from faith. But true love, which the spiritual law commands, is not abolished, indeed it is established by faith, as is evident in Rom. 3. The pedagogical law and the old testament are abolished, like childhood. But the spiritual law, which the apostles also call the law of the mind and the law of faith and perfection, is now introduced and inscribed in our minds according to that: I will put my law in their hearts. We clearly gather this division of the law from Rom. 3, where he says: boasting is excluded not by the law of works, but by the law of faith. Also in chapter 7: "I see another law in my members." Why was it necessary to say another law if there is only one? And there: "So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh the law of sin," etc. He now calls the law of Moses the law of sin, because just as a servant cannot, after being called by the master, serve himself even a little without sin, so also we, now made servants of God through the gospel, if we love ourselves even a little, we sin. The old love, which is undertaken for this life, is condemned, not because it is for the glory of God. In a servant, that love is odious to you, by which he serves himself, not by which he serves you. Therefore, pedagogical and childish works are rejected by faith, not practical and manly. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things - childish things, I say - not all things. In the old testament, we were held under elements and figures, from which we only learned the truth. But in the new, we are brought from shadow to light, from school to forum, from gymnasium to battle, so that now we may perform true works for the glory of God, which are the very faith itself. Thus Augustine and other fathers distinguished the old and new testament, asserting that the former dealt with corporeal things, the latter with spiritual things, with the same precepts remaining (Tractate 4 on John: "Those things are commanded there in the decalogue, which are also commanded to us, but not those things are promised, which are also promised to us," etc.). There is a double end, but the rules are the same. It is the same to see in schools, the doctor of law uses the same words in practice, which he once used in schools when he was a child. And a fighter defeats the enemy with the same weapon with which he once exercised in the gymnasiums. Therefore, Luke 11: Christ does not cast away the arms from the strong man, but distributes them to us, so that the same members, which were once the arms of the devil, now become the arms of God for righteousness. Therefore, those who say that in the new testament no works are required of us, but only the remission of sins is brought to us, are no less foolish than if someone were to say that a child and a servant should work, but a husband and a master are not obligated to any work. But we are now made men and spouses of Christ, who are so far from doing nothing, that we endure all things, and undertake in the name of the bridegroom. But more on these in their place copiously. Now I hope you understand what the word ‹unless› excludes, namely the works of the pedagogical law, not the spiritual, which faith itself establishes and fulfills (Matt. 5, Rom. 3). These the fathers call preceding. Because just as childish things precede youth, and pedagogy practice, and gymnasium battle, so the old testament precedes the new, and the works of the law the works of the spirit, and natural love the spiritual and true, which is to love God for eternal goods. Furthermore, as one error begets infinite others, so it has happened to us in these times. For as we have made no distinction between the law of faith and works, so also we have confused the righteousness of the law and the righteousness of faith. You say the publican descended from the temple justified, but the other, wrapped in his own sins, fell from his hope: By this saying, although perhaps imprudently, you place yourself in the place of God, and you condemn as sin that work which the Lord called righteousness. Christ says: κατέβη οὗτος δεδικαιωμένος ἠ ἐκεῖνος, etc. He does not say the other sinned, just as in Matt. 5: "Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Pharisees," etc., where he does not reject their righteousness, but desires a fuller one, indeed in Matt. 23, after sharply rebuking the Pharisaic traditions, he adds: "These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others." For the rules of grammar are necessary for children, but something more must be added, namely practice and use, so that from here you may obtain glory and riches. So also the righteousness of the law is good for the weak and unlearned, of which certainly many of us are seen, but it is unseemly for men, according to that Gal. 4: "But now, after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage?" Also Rom. 6: You are no longer under the pedagogical law, but under grace and the kingdom of Christ, by whose spirit you are now led, etc. Finally, you strive to prove from that Rom. 3: We are justified freely by His grace, etc. Also in chapter 11: But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works, etc. Here you err in defining the word δωρεάν (freely). Because (as Augustine testifies in On the Spirit and the Letter and in the place above cited On Faith and Works chapter 14) by this word only preceding (that is, pedagogical) works are excluded, not those that follow. Therefore, if you accept the authority of Augustine, you are already convicted. Are not works also given freely? Certainly! For God works in us both to will and to do. What do you have that you did not receive? Therefore, so far from δωρεάν excluding good works from faith, it sanctions and introduces them. For if true faith dedicates and offers all members to God (Rom. 12 and 6), not only ears, it is necessary that both feet and mouth, briefly internal and external, are required for the completion of faith. Faith alone is that idol, which has hands and does not work, feet, and does not walk, eyes, and does not see. We are not hindered by what you cite from chapter 4 of Rom., where Paul says that righteousness is imputed to us without works, etc., not adding the word ‹law›, as if he excluded all works. Because it is enough that he put it at the beginning of the chapter, with these words: What then shall we say that Abraham our father has found, κατὰ σάρκα (that is, according to the flesh), etc. Therefore, here he speaks of carnal works, which are also called, as said above, works of the law. But in Ephesians 2 he most manifestly shows which works are to be rejected, namely those in which we can boast, not good works, for which we are prepared and created by God. 7. Chapter. In this you teach us that we are made acceptable to God because of faith, not because of works, and you interpret faith to be Jesus Christ and the grace of God, etc. Therefore, it would have been much more convenient with the apostles to say that only grace and only the name of Jesus Christ is that in which we are saved, than faith alone without all works: For thus the word ‹alone› is found, not to exclude works, but to ascribe all glory to God as the creator, which certainly does not consist in the heart or even in the lips, but in deeds and virtue. Therefore, faith alone and grace alone differ, because by this we separate creatures from the creator, not works from the faithful, so that you may serve God alone, etc., (that is, serve with all your strength, heart, mind, soul, hands, and feet). But spiritual works are not excluded from the faithful, as they can be less separated from faith than life from the soul or heat from fire or the useful from the honest. Here you incidentally bring up imputation, which you imagine to be idle, and to be done without works, but if all the works of God are perfect, it is necessary that His imputation brings with it such power and potency that it produces the greatest and most excellent works, not only faith. The example is the first, to whom righteousness was imputed, Abraham. He was so fervent in spirit after that imputation, that he did not even spare his only son; for which deed he inherits the promise (Genesis 22). Do you think the imputation of man is so powerful that it makes you new, and God's is idle? For if you owed me twenty gold coins, which if I forgave or imputed the payment freely, surely (unless you were a monster of a man) you would love me differently than before that imputation? 8. Chapter. The eighth chapter contains the division of works, which is indeed well instituted by you, but not aptly accommodated or even explained. For the works of the law are not condemned in themselves, but insofar as they have erred from the end (that is, Jesus Christ), and now are in the impious, to whom all things, even mind and conscience, are defiled (Titus 1). But to the pious and faithful, all things work together for good. The same judgment is of the works of the law, which God proposed as an element of truth in figure, until Christ Jesus (that is, the right reason and wisdom of God) came to us, so that we might know what is good and what is evil. For then the pedagogy ceases, and those who always learn but never advance (even will be cursed according to that, as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse), are liable, etc. Namely, after the fullness of time and the right age has come, but we neither advance in grace nor wisdom, we are certainly monstrous and abominable to God the Father. Therefore, you rightly feel in some part about natural works and the law, which in those called to righteousness and the glory of God, if they do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation, wrath, affliction, and anxiety, etc., are. But that you separate the works of faith and good from justification, you seem to me to sin greatly. Because if God effects the same who effects faith, even if they are later (as Eve was created after Adam), yet it does not follow that therefore they are to be separated from justification, unless you also deny that the walls, which are built upon the foundation, are parts of the house or that the soul, which is infused into the embryo before the fortieth day, is separated from man. If the righteous shall live by faith - live, I say -, it is necessary that both, faith and life, are joined. Now if the righteous lives in faith, and there is no life or can be without actions, even in a one-day-old infant, it is necessary that works are part of righteousness. I never like to place faith as the cause of salvation. God is properly the creator and cause of all things, not faith (that is, trust in mercy), which He effects in us according to His good will, just as also works. Therefore, we will rather call trust in mercy and love substantial parts, as my opinion holds, than the efficient cause. Therefore, you fight with yourself in this chapter, when you say that good and just works are said by the good and just, but below in chapter 11 you attribute them to God, which is true. For good works are given by the good God. Therefore, if God is the cause of salvation, and God works in us both faith and works, why do you separate God from God? Then you say that faith is the foundation of works, which the apostle also said before in 1 Cor. 3 and Heb. 3 and 11. But just as the foundation is a substantial part of the house, not the whole house, so also trust in mercy is nothing unless another part is built upon it, so that you may be made a fit temple of God. Thirdly, you bring the authority of Paul, who in 1 Cor. 6 says that we are washed and sanctified by the name of the Lord, etc., from which you conclude that faith alone is the justification of man. Which consequence is most absurd: For Paul calls justification there the very works, as is evident from the preceding and following. For in the preceding he called evil works, such as fornication, avarice, theft, robbery, etc., damnation. Therefore, by contrary sense, good works are justification. In the following, however, he calls us members of Christ, which certainly are not alone, but all can through the communication of the body. For the hand sees, feels, hears, because of the other members, as is beautifully shown in 1 Cor. 12. Fourthly, you deny that even Abraham was justified by works, etc., which openly contradicts Moses. For he in Genesis 22 clearly states that because he did this - did, I say -, he was justified, namely in the world. For before God, we are justified neither by faith nor works, but before this world was created, we were righteous and dear because of love and wisdom. Therefore, the ambiguity of the word ‹justification› deceived you, as it does many others. For it is taken in two ways in scripture, as is the fulfillment of the law and many other things. For in God's providence all things were fulfilled and justified, just as you have the work you are to complete in your head completed and perfect, but perhaps not yet begun in work. So Christ Jesus is the wisdom and head of God, in whom all things are already perfect and consummated, but in us, the same must be perfected and completed until we become a perfect man. Hence in Rom. 5 he says that we, whom he said a little before were justified by faith before God - God, I say -, are finally to be justified by obedience. Therefore, here you seem not to rightly divide the word of God. By faith (that is, trust in mercy) we are always justified before God, but by obedience and works we are also justified to ourselves and daily gather treasure in heaven. 9. Chapter. The ninth chapter is about the nature, as you say, of justification, that works justify no one. And you define there the work of justification to be to calm the conscience, which was disturbed by the remembrance of sins, etc., which definition you now acknowledge to be false. Because justification is not only the remission of sins, but also sanctification and renewal, so that you are transformed daily and reformed to the image of God. No one, as soon as he believes or is newly born, is perfect and complete, as Luke said of Jesus Christ in figure. For that saying pertains to us His members, who thus gradually proceed in spirit until maturity is reached. Nor does it hinder what you write that no one persuades himself that he satisfies the divine law with his works, etc. Because I will also be allowed to say the same about faith, since no one perfectly believes in the mercy of God. Nor does the consequence hold: The works that God works in us are imperfect; therefore, they do nothing for justification or do not please God, etc. Just as it does not hold: Apples around the feast of John are imperfect, therefore they are worth nothing! Or thus: I have not completed the house I began; therefore, it displeases me, etc. Will not God perfect the work He began until the day of the Lord (Phil. 1)? Indeed, we have greater care for imperfect works, and for the weak, than for the perfect. So God does not reject us infants with infantile works, but establishes, restores, supports, and builds until we are joined into one body. Then also works persuade me, and indeed not less than faith itself. Because in 2 Pet. 1 we are commanded to make our calling sure by works. And James says he shows and proves his faith more conveniently by his deeds than by faith alone. Indeed, nothing confirms and persuades us that we are children of God than those very works that God works in us (1 John 3). We have confidence towards God, etc., because we keep His commandments and do what is pleasing before Him. How can that tree be firm, which bears no fruit? Which does not bear fruit, is cut down. Therefore, works persuade us to be certain of salvation and accepted by God, like fruitful trees. Finally, what you cite from Acts that our hearts are purified by faith, is to be understood by synecdoche. Because in 1 Pet. 1 it is written that we are pure by obedience. His words are these: "That you may have faith and hope towards God, who have purified your souls by obeying the truth through the Spirit with brotherly love," etc. Behold here he openly joins faith and the Holy Spirit and love. 10. Chapter. The 10th chapter and the following present us with another method of your institution concerning good works, in which place you immediately contradict yourself at the beginning. For you say you feel that faith is never without works, which is as if you were to say, the soul is never without life, but yet it alone does all things, than which nothing is more absurd. If faith is never without works, then works are of the essence of faith. Also, if faith is never without works, how is it without works in justification? Furthermore, you say you confess that faith justifies by its own virtue, not by the aid of works, etc. What is the virtue or spirit of faith? Is it not works and efficacy? Certainly, James equates faith to the body, but works to the spirit or soul. 11. Chapter. The 11th chapter on the origin of good works is greatly approved by me. For you make God the author of works and assert that they give glory to God. Hence I wonder how it happens that when you know God is the cause, and He requires perfect glory from us, which certainly cannot be given to Him by faith alone, why you have separated faith and works unnecessarily, and that with the loss of many? Indeed, I see no reason why love, which is God, according to that of John: "God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him," etc., you separate from faith, which is also of God. If Christ dwells in our hearts by faith, as the Apostle testifies, and Jesus Christ is power, wisdom, mercy, redemption, sanctification, life, truth, etc., it is necessary that faith is joined with all these virtues. And where their efficacy as a habit is not, there also faith is not, so you seem to me to deviate somewhat, and to depart from the purpose. For you ought to have proved that works are not of the substance of justification. But you prove that they proceed from God, which entirely undermines your business. For you yourself write everywhere that righteousness should not rely on our - our, I say - merits. For he who works for a reward from debt, not for a reward according to grace, to bind God to himself as a debtor, will never be considered righteous before God. But here you make it a gift of God. Therefore, to whom God does not grant this gift, that he may both believe and work, he will never be righteous. Also, if works are of God, which we do, there can be no dignity of ours. Therefore, there is no danger, even if we judge that faith and good works concur in justification, since both are of God. 12. Chapter. In this chapter, you show how scripture attributes justification to works, and you cite the testimony of Saint Augustine from the book On Grace and Free Will, which although you have transcribed verbatim, yet you twist the sense of that man to defend an unknown doctrine to the church. For that man fought most fiercely against faith alone, so that I do not know if any of the fathers was more offended by this security. He does not strip faith of its ornaments, and lay bare our salvation, but removes preceding works, so that grace may obtain its place, which is written everywhere by him. Therefore, you are deceived by speaking the truth, while you draw the mind of Augustine elsewhere than he himself thought. Then there you say: It should have been added that the works themselves, although they are truly of God and the Holy Spirit, are nevertheless said to be and are ours (that is, of faithful men), etc. Here you certainly seem to stumble gravely, not so much against the fathers, but also against the Holy Spirit, because you say that partly God works them, partly they are done by us. But if we are capable of thinking (we received that from God), much more should we refer works entirely to God. God prepared us as an instrument, and through it works according to His good will for the glory of His name. But that they are called ours is because of the gift, just as faith and the gospel are called ours, not because they are from us, but because they are given. For what the father gives to the son, this is his, not from debt, but from grace. If you separate works from faith because they are called ours in scripture, and God works them in us as through an organ, you will have to separate faith from justification for the same reason, because it is more often used as ours than works. How often is it read, your faith has saved you, etc., as you have believed, so be it done to you? Therefore, these are more against you than for you. If works are as much a gift of God as faith, by what authority do you separate God from God? Furthermore, what you say is a most shameful and ungrateful indication of mind, if a son, unmindful of his father's munificence, were to boast that all the faculties he received from him were acquired by his own labors, etc.: "No one denies." But it does not follow: That vain boasting, which is against God, is excluded. Therefore, all boasting is excluded. There is the glory of God, which we are all commanded to seek and excel in: Rom. 2; Phil. 2, where the apostle openly says, so that he may boast in the day of the Lord. Also 1 Cor. 9: He does not allow his boasting to be made vain, and 2 Corinthians 1, so that he may be their glory, as they are his, etc. Therefore, as the glory of the old man is abolished, so the true glory arises in us (2 Cor. 3), so that we are transformed from glory to glory. Therefore, he who boasts in this way (that is, by good works in this crooked nation), shines as a light, not so that he may be great here, but that the name of God may be magnified, he will indeed receive a reward according to these works, not only will he not sin. Chapter 13. You try to prove the same from the parts of faith, which you not inaptly call reconciliation and obedience, which the apostle placed as substance and evidence. Because true faith has in itself these two parts, trust in mercy or knowledge of reconciliation, which is substance, and obedience, which is as it were evidence, and a certain argument of that foundation. For fruits manifest and prove the tree itself, whether it is good or bad. But here you err, in that you improperly assert that justification is attributed to obedience, but properly to reconciliation. Because if both are from God, and justification is ascribed to both by the apostles, why do you separate God from God, and consider this proper, that improper from your own sense? Obedience purifies and justifies as much as faith itself, as shown above from 1 Pet. 1 and Rom. [5]: "As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous, etc.!" And in the sixth he opposes obedience to sin: Whether, he says, of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness, etc. Also 1 Sam. 15: He prefers obedience to all sacrifices. Therefore, obedience also properly justifies and purifies. The error, however, arose from the confusion of the word ‹justification›. For by faith we are absolutely righteous before God, because we believe as certainly that we are made partakers of the promised grace, as if we already held it in hand. And God, before I was born, not only did I believe nothing, knew in His providence that I was justified and perfect, but I myself was not yet perfect or justified, before I rendered good faith to God in these goods which He committed to me. Therefore, by knowledge (that is, faith) we are justified before God, but by practice and obedience we will be righteous. The same judgment is of the fulfillment of the law. The law is the will of God, which was completed from eternal ages, is, and will be. But in us it is fulfilled daily, until this body receives its fulfillment and glory. Therefore, Christ, who is the head and wisdom of God, indeed fulfilled the law. But in us, as members, what is lacking and, as God ever imparted and poured the cup, it is to be fulfilled, namely by obeying the truth. Hence also that distinction falls, which you make between purification, which is done by our care, and that which you call the first and made by the external blood of Christ, etc. Because, although there is a double purification (one, which is made in the providence of God concerning all and singular, another, which is made by obeying in each of us), yet neither is done by our care or industry, but both descend from God, and as God began that work, so also I am perfected. Nor are you improperly spoken here, when the scripture also uses the same phrase, so that, as it calls faith and works ours, so also it places purification, care, wisdom, etc., as ours, when yet they are of God, but made ours by grace and gift. But I blame this, that by this distinction of purification you try to separate works from faith. 14. Chapter. You assert the same in this chapter from the writings of the apostles, that sometimes justification is attributed to faith, sometimes to works, now if justification is equally ascribed to faith and works, to what end is it necessary for the Holy Spirit and wisdom to be justified by us? You cite from Acts the council of the apostles, which completely abolishes your opinion of faith alone, because it only excludes the works of the law (that is, circumcision and the external decalogue, which is, that you no longer honor either God or brothers for the holy land - for these were temporal promises, until we were called to true faith through the gospel -, but for eternal life and His glory), indeed not even now are all works abolished. The Jews are not freed from the works of the law, the Gentiles only in part, as is evident from the text. For they are commanded to abstain from idols, from fornication, and from things strangled and from blood. Therefore, if not even all the works of the law are cast away, much less are the works of the spirit separated from faith. This also pertains to what you write shortly after about effective faith: For you say that James altogether contends that Abraham was not justified by faith alone (that is, by that vain opinion), but by works (that is, true faith), etc. Now if true faith and works are the same and Christ (John 8) says that we are made sons of Abraham both by his works and by faith, it is necessary that faith does not justify alone, but with works. This I especially predict to you, Bullinger, that you assert that effective faith justifies, not as many in these times are accustomed, who under this name condemn sophists, because they judged that effective faith or faith formed by love was true faith. Certainly, if form is that by which a thing is known and which gives the thing its being, but faith without love is nothing, it does not seem inaptly said by the scholastics that faith formed by love is fruitful. For by this we are known as disciples of Jesus Christ (John 13). Then if "God is love," as also the scholastics held, what absurdity follows if we judge God to be our form and essence. But we, to seem to bring forth something new, say that Jesus Christ is the form and substance of faith. Is not Jesus Christ also God? Therefore, he who says that faith is formed by love, rightly and Christianly thinks, nor is he rashly to be condemned of impiety, provided he joins true love. I confess indeed that love was defiled by some sophists. But it does not follow that the stains of love are to be washed away. Therefore, the whole form of faith is nothing. 15. Chapter. In the 15th chapter, you dispute about the reward, which you say is proposed according to the common custom of speaking to the well-deserving. And in the meantime, you condemn the scholastics, whom you say used a new way unknown to scripture. Which indeed I have not read, but I know this, that they bring the same saying of Augustine, which you do, to prove that only grace working and cooperating is our merit (see book 2, distinction 27).</p>
