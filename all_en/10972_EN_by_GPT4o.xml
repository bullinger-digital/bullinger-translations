      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I am sending back your bag. I am also sending my letter back to Bullinger, along with Luther's booklets.</p>
      <p>I inform you that I am leaving with my brother to Strasbourg to explain and perhaps conclude the matter, as far as it concerns our church. We are sent by the church with full instructions to be delivered to Luther. May the Lord be with us. Remember us before the Lord, so that everything may be conducted according to His spirit. I cannot write more, as my departure distracts me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>December 30, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Konrad Pellikan, professor of Hebrew letters, teacher, and dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
