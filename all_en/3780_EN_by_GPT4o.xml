      <p>Krakau, 30th November 1558.</p>
      <p>Greetings. After I had completed and sealed my previous letters, I received letters from Mr. a Lasko and Mr. Utenhovius, in which they wish to be excused for not having written individually to all the ministers of the Zürich church. For both, the constraint of time was an impediment, and for one, along with the constraint of time, a very adverse health condition. Mr. a Lasko, as almost always, was severely afflicted by his familiar illness throughout the time I have been here, and in these past eight days, he has suffered from it much more severely and dangerously. Therefore, let him be commended to God, the best and greatest, in the prayers of the common church.</p>
      <p>Through letters, they have imposed upon me the task of beseeching all the ministers of our church to send joint letters to the royal majesty, in which both the royal office and religion would be reminded. They also urge that other princes, such as the Palatine of Vilnius and the Lord of Krakau, be encouraged to diligently complete what they have begun. They believe that if the Christian nobility is encouraged by the joint letters of all, it will result in considerable benefit. You should act in a manner befitting Christians.</p>
      <p>For certainly, the time is now at hand in which the kingdom and truth of Christ can be promoted, if our negligence or fear does not prevent us from advancing to where the reckless and shameless audacity of the adversaries drives them to rush. The king is by nature easy-going and approachable, and can easily be led to our opinion. He recently set examples that should not be disregarded, as he could not be persuaded by the bishops to send the evangelicals away during the time of the assemblies. I implore, beseech, and entreat you by Christ and the salvation of your souls, not to neglect this opportunity.</p>
      <p>Your letters could be sent here safely and quickly by Mr. Johannes Gwalther from Ulm.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it would be beneficial for the gospel if you made a magnificent mention of Mr. Johannes a Lasko and Mr. Utenhovius both to the royal majesty and to the princes. Nor should you forget about these matters to the nobility, and if it is permissible to mix the profane with the sacred, I would wish for myself and my business to be commended at least to the princes and the nobility. Farewell in Christ, our only savior.</p>
      <p>Hastily, as above.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, John Burcher, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, and the other most esteemed ministers of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
