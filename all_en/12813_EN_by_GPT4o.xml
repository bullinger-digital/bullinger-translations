    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The Bernese authorities are grateful that, upon their request, the Zurich council has allowed the current students Johann Knechtenhofer, Johannes Fädminger, Abel Mühlhofer, and Jonas Danmatter (who studied in Strasbourg at the expense of their authorities before being recalled to Bern) to continue their studies in Zurich. Bullinger is to arrange for the maintenance costs specified by the Zurich council, placing two students with Otto Werdmüller, the other two with Benedikt Euander, and if this is not possible, with other suitable hosts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Bernese youths are to be treated, instructed, and taught in the same manner as their Zurich schoolmates, so that they are later able to serve and lead their churches as well-educated and well-trained men, and furthermore adhere to the resolutions of the Bern Disputation [of 1528] and the religion recognized so far.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] They are to obey their Zurich teachers, diligently attend classes, and actively participate in disputations, lecture exercises, and other common exercises. They should behave decently, willingly, and modestly, so as not to damage their reputation and that of their authorities. The schoolmasters have also impressed this upon the four students.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] However, if they do not adhere to this and are guilty of laziness, arrogance, or other offenses, they are to be punished just like the other students.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Furthermore, they are not allowed to borrow money from others or buy anything (neither books nor clothes or anything else) without the knowledge and approval of their superior, especially since the Bernese authorities must cover these costs. Since Bullinger probably will not have the time to attend to the students' needs, he should appoint someone else to whom the students can present their respective concerns, as long as they are reasonable and appropriate. The bookkeeping should be detailed and kept separately for each student. Settlements should be made every six months. The Bernese council will pay the bills promptly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The council and schoolmasters of Bern will show themselves grateful and helpful.</p>

      <p>Our friendly greetings and willing service according to our ability beforehand, to the highly and well-learned, distinguished, wise lord, favorable, dear, and good friend. After our gracious lords received from your lords, their faithful dear confederates, a friendly response and approval of their request, that they may now bring and maintain their students (whom they previously supported at other schools at their expense, but now wish to advance) in their city and schools (which they have gratefully accepted, offering to serve them equally and more), we have, by their command, sent these four who were previously in Strasbourg (Johann Knechtenhofer, Johannes Fädminger, Abel Mühlhofer, and Jonas Danmatter) to you, with the friendly request to accommodate them according to your best judgment, two together (with Mr. Werdmüller two and with Mr. Benedikt Euander also two) or wherever you deem best according to the circumstances of the time and persons, for the sum previously written to our lords.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Hereupon we commend them to you all together, to keep them in discipline, teaching, and instruction in the same manner as other lords of Zurich or your own, so that they may be raised in virtuous conduct and life, also in the pure teaching of the holy gospel and other good arts, practiced and prepared for the honor of our Lord God, also to serve our gracious lords and their churches (so that they may later be useful and capable as learned, well-educated men and servants), to maintain them by the holy word of God, by their disputation, by the accepted and hitherto practiced religion in all simplicity and truth of the holy gospel; in this (as much as it depends on you) not to spare diligence and effort towards them, as we completely trust you all together and individually.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In return, they should also render to you as their preceptors all due, willing obedience in all things, diligently attend all lectures, also allow themselves to be used and employed in disputations, orations, and in all other honorable affairs and exercises, as is also held at other schools and especially with you. They should also otherwise conduct themselves with their behavior, life, and growth not extravagantly, but obediently and modestly, as befits pious, virtuous young men, so that their reputation does not stink before our gracious lords and others; all of which we have previously told them with seriousness.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Whoever and whichever do not adhere to this, find themselves guilty of laziness, arrogance, and other disobedience, we command you to bring the matter to them with due punishment, as with others, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Furthermore, they should not take up anything for themselves, notice or buy (books, clothes, or anything else), since it all goes and will go at the expense of our gracious lords, without the foreknowledge, advice, and approval of one of you. Therefore, we also particularly ask you, Mr. Bullinger, as our special dear lord, if you cannot manage this due to other affairs (as we well reckon), to appoint another of you to whom they can present their concerns and handle everything with that person's advice. Whatever is then lacking for their needs, also according to the honor of our lords, that may be granted and allowed to them, yet such should be properly recorded and sent to us every half year (as it has been practiced elsewhere, as you also well know), along with the cost in the table, in good accounting from piece to piece, each one separately. Payment will be made thereupon properly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In this and other matters on behalf of our gracious lords, according to our trust, you will prove yourselves, which we will, above all our lords, take from you with great thanks and also be indebted to you in the same and other matters. (repay) Herewith commending you to God faithfully, dated January 23, 1547, your willing Sulpitius Haller, treasurer, and others from the council, preachers, and learned, schoolmasters in Bern.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned, distinguished, wise lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, and other learned and appointed of the schools in the city of Zurich, our favorable, dear, and good friends.</p>
