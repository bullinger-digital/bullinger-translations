      <p>Greetings. I received, venerable man, your letters and read the new ones from France, which you shared with us, and I was filled with joy and inflamed to give the highest thanks to God; for I experience daily that God looks after His own and delivers them from danger according to His will quite promptly. I had written to you about our community's seal, that few of ours were present in the senate that day (because the senate was not fully convened), and the adversaries cunningly obtained the seal from the incomplete senate, with which they proposed to seal the subscription of the Council of Trent.</p>
      <p>However, when this matter was raised by the people, a gathering was made by our people, and they elected three who recounted to the consul in order what danger was to be expected for the evangelicals from that sealing, and they warned him not to allow the adversaries the use of the community's seal without the full votes of the assembly. And thus, the wishes of our enemies have been hindered so far; God knows what turmoil may arise from it. We heard that the bailiff of Appenzell also, along with a few papists, subscribed to the Tridentine council and sealed it with the public seal; however, when the rumor reached the public, they were forced to rescind the sealed documents and return the seal. Therefore, as far as I can tell, I think it would be safer not to grant the community's seal in this matter. In our assembly held in May, we appointed a guardian of the Gaster bailiwick of papist inclination, whose election the people of Schwyz do not want to be firm, because he is suspected of favoring our party more than is fair; however, our people do not want to elect another. What this hatred will eventually produce, anyone can guess, nor should it be hidden from you that our people, through the envoy who will now be sent to the assembly in Solothurn, have written to the royal envoy and earnestly requested him not to gather an army from the Glarus people, partly because we are certain that the Guise family, under the pretext of royal protection, proposed to use it to overthrow the gospel, and partly because we are divided into factions. I hope the Lord will soon arise to scatter our enemies. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated May 12, 1562, in Glarus.</p>
      <p>Fridolin Brunner, minister of the word among the people of Glarus.</p>
