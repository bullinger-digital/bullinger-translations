      <p>To the illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my patron and most revered lord, Johannes Rudolf Stumpf sends eternal greetings in Christ. D. P.</p>
      <p>In response to your recent letters, which have truly delighted us, although each of us has already replied, I now begin to write to you again.</p>
      <p>Among other things that you kindly shared with us, you also encouraged us to share any news we might have with you; I have now undertaken to do this as much as I can: for now, the opportunity to write more freely and abundantly has been given, since on February 6th of this year 1550, a truly festive and most fortunate day for us dawned; for it brought an end to the council in London and freed the Duke of Somerset from prison, who, having been ensnared by the plots of the papists and falsely accused of various and serious crimes, was not only removed from the governance of the entire kingdom, which had been entrusted to him after the death of Henry VIII, but was also thrown into the harshest prison: so much so that there was little or no hope left for his release, unless he exchanged life for death. The grave fall of this prince caused such great disturbances among the evangelicals and all good people, it is astonishing to say: for the Romanists themselves, the most cruel beasts, with which Oxford abounds, were already triumphing over the death of our Duke, the death of our gospel drawing its last breath, and their revived sweet little mass (missa), as if they had already secured a solid victory for themselves, celebrating the abominable mass again in their conventicles, using their old nonsense in funerals and other such matters, and indulging themselves completely in wine, as befits the defenders of such a religion. Their furious rage had progressed to the point that they shamelessly threatened the faithful of Christ with punishment, exile, sword, and flame, and finally all evils, unless they would come to their senses at the extreme peril of this prince and defect back to their side. But oh, bold and insane deed! For whatever plans they had, they have now consumed them to no avail, and have completely exposed their evil intentions to everyone. For beyond everyone's expectations, the Duke was freed, and the religion was confirmed by the common vote of the entire council.</p>
      <p>Hence, I have not dared to write anything new until now: I hope there will be a safer opportunity to do so in the future. After the council was dismissed, Dr. Cox went to Oxford, where he has remained until now: we also hope to have found a way to cut off and banish the rotten members of this antichrist from the entire university; this hope was confirmed by certain words of the prince to Dr. Cox, which he gave upon his arrival.</p>
      <p>But more on these matters another time: now to the rest. It is said that the bishopric was offered to Dr. Latimer, the royal preacher, in whose place our Lord Hooper succeeded. Dr. Tschieck, the king's, and Dr. Trehern, the Duke of Suffolk's, contemporaries of the king, have taken on the roles of παιδαγωγία (tutorship) assigned to them by the council.</p>
      <p>These are the things, venerable father in Christ, that I especially wanted you to know at present, hoping they will not be unwelcome, unless you have perhaps already received the same from others more fully: therefore, I do not think there is any reason to trouble you with longer letters.</p>
      <p>I only ask you most earnestly to continue to favor and protect me with your benevolence and humanity, which I have so far enjoyed excellently. There is nothing to fear about receiving gifts and stipends, as you have sufficiently understood from my previous letters, in which I replied to yours, if only they have been delivered. Farewell in Christ, glory of the fatherland. Please greet Lord Huldrich Zwingli, your son-in-law, my dear friend, in my name, to whom, if I had known it would please him, I would have written even now. Dr. Peter Martyr and Dr. Oglendorp are well and alive, and they send you many greetings. Given in Oxford, 1550, February 28th.</p>
      <p>Your most respectful Johannes Rudolf Stumpf.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man of utmost piety and singular learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Zurichers among the Swiss, my patron and most revered lord.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich in Switzerland.</p>
