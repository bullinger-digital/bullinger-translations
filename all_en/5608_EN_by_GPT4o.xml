      <p>S. D. Your letters, sent through Tretius, and those you sent after Tretius's departure, were most welcome to me.</p>
      <p>Would that we soon hear for certain that the recent conflict was resolved without the loss of good men! For unfortunate wars consume the best men, who could have greatly contributed to the governance of both the church and the state.</p>
      <p>How truly I rejoice that our Beza is alive and well! I have long feared that something unfortunate might have happened to him, and this concern has greatly troubled me.</p>
      <p>But you have freed me from all worry by sending his most desired letters.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord to bless him.</p>
      <p>I also ask you to greet him most diligently in my name when you next write, and to inform him that our dearest Martyr (if he does not know) has passed to the Lord, to the great sorrow of us all.</p>
      <p>I will take care of what you advised about Lotharingia; I have already written to Augsburg and Chur about this matter.</p>
      <p>It is now being spread as certain in our vicinity that Brisach, one of the Guise leaders, has defeated the English with a notable victory, having slain at least 5000. However, I hope for much better, especially since those who are the authors of this rumor mix in other things that make their account seem less credible.</p>
      <p>I am still engaged in writing my response to Brentius's book on the majesty of Christ, published against Martyr and me.</p>
      <p>There is nothing noteworthy among us.</p>
      <p>You did well to admonish the Polish brothers; I thank you for that effort and for the kindness shown to Tretius on my recommendation.</p>
      <p>He is now staying in my house, a truly good man. Always love us, dear brother, and farewell forever, most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 5, 1563.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Although I do not respond to your letters, dearest Ionville, they were nonetheless most welcome.</p>
      <p>Attribute my lack of response to my affairs, you and Crispinus, whom you will greet in my name.</p>
      <p>I am entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Please send me 5 or 4 copies of my "Summa of True Religion" printed in Italian with you; indicate the price, etc., and if it exists, what I responded to the Bavarian articles.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
