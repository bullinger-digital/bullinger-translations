    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich is pleased that Bullinger has long sought his friendship. He too aspired to Bullinger's friendship. Now, with Bullinger's sending of a letter [not received] and the [“True Confession”], a favorable opportunity has arisen. He can hardly recommend himself to Bullinger through education or experience, and if he possesses a little piety, it is solely thanks to God's goodness. But what could Frölich value more [than the “True Confession”], which, like the Sphinx and like Gordius, resolves Luther's [enigmatic] and entangled statements with such moderation, weightiness, and dignity? This writing will be useful and beneficial to many, whether it pleases the gates of hell and [their guardian], the Cerberus [devil], or not. Frölich will keep it as a treasure for his children. - In Strasbourg, it is allegedly said that the confession of sins before communion and perhaps other Roman customs are being reintroduced. Bucer has published the concord [“A Christian Harmless Consideration”] worked out by him and [Georg] Witzel in Leipzig. Many are amazed by this. If only they would once and for all take on the true form of the [ever-changing] Proteus! Frölich would grant others their special esteem if they did not bring so many down with them. - He thanks for the greetings from [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Kaspar] Megander, and [Rudolf] Gwalther. If only he could one day gain their friendship! He sends his regards back and apologizes for his artless expression.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am truly delighted, most memorable man, that you have long sought my friendship.</p>
      <p>For this is exactly what I had long ago decided to offer you with open arms, if any opportunity had conveniently arisen until now.</p>
      <p>But now, since you have so generously poured out your piety and kindness upon me, not only with your most courteous letters but also with your own work, namely the sacred confession of the Zurich church, you have both greeted and gifted me, I am now fulfilled in my ardent wishes. In return, if it pleases you to enjoy the modesty of Laetus, consider yourself satisfied. I know indeed that I have not made myself commendable to you through either learning or experience, about which I can boast nothing at all; but if any piety is thought to be in me, let it be attributed solely to the goodness of God, to whom always be thanks, by which the minds of the faithful are united in various and wondrous ways. Thus I hope I have first become known to you, and now, may it be fortunate and happy, I have struck a perpetual bond of friendship with you. What more could have deserved from me than that Gordius and that Sphinx, which with such modesty, such gravity, and finally such majesty, resolved Luther's apothegm and the knot indissoluble to many, so that whenever they are reconnected, they are explained? It is indescribable, most excellent man, how much this writing of yours pleases me and all sincere people among us; for it was necessary and will be beneficial even with the gates of hell and Cerberus himself protesting. That, I say, your confession, even if by God's grace I have long been rightly instructed, will be more precious to me than any metal and will be kept as a treasure for my children.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, as I hear, the confession of sins before the Lord's Supper is being restored, and perhaps something else of Roman flour. Bucer has published the concord between himself and Witzel, once meditated in Leipzig, which is a wonder to me and most good people. If only they would finally take on the form of Proteus, always consistent with itself! I would not begrudge some their authority so eagerly sought, if they did not also drag others down with them.</p>
      <p>I gratefully embrace the greetings of such celebrated men, Mr. Pellikan, Bibliander, Megander, Gwalther, so much so that I rejoice and exult with joy. Oh, if only I could one day deserve to be included in the friendship of each! You will greet each one most diligently, and promise them all services from me. Farewell and kindly excuse my artless expression. April 4, 1545.</p>
      <p>Georg Frölich, called Laetus, chief scribe of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To the most virtuous and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant ecclesiast of Zurich.</p>
