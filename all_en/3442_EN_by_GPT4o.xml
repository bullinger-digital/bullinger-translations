      <p>Greetings. I recently sent the preface to the Decades to my brother; for I did not have the leisure to write to you, most esteemed lord and godfather, at that time. I pray that you correct, change, delete, add, or cut whatever seems necessary. You may also create the title according to your judgment.</p>
      <p>I fear that Apiarius will not be able to complete this work before the fair, unless he uses another press; for he will scarcely reach the middle of it before the first of January. I hear that your commentaries on the Apocalypse have also been translated; Froschauer wishes to have them printed here under his name, which would indeed be very pleasing to Apiarius, and no one will hinder this. I am waiting to hear what you think about that other confession of Beza and Farel.</p>
      <p>I cannot grasp what it means: "The bread is κοινωνια (communion) of the body," that is, that thing which when we take it, the Son of God is truly present. I do indeed read that Paul calls the bread κοινωνιαν του σωματοσ (communion of the body), but I do not quite understand that the Son of God is truly present when we take it. For if they mean that he is present bodily, they are mistaken and try to deceive us with this manner of speaking. But if they mean that he is present spiritually, that is, by his grace and power when we take this thing, they seem to want to bind grace to the symbol. For what prevents him from being present to us before and after the taking as well, and not only when we take it? Therefore, with these subtleties, they make me very averse to the assembly they so insistently urge. For how will truth be served if our people now begin to turn into so many different forms? What concord can there be in these doubtful expressions? Even the pagans recognize and write that the speech of truth is simple.</p>
      <p>I would wish much more for it to prevail among us. But what hope of peace can we have from those who, with piled-up confessions, so stubbornly cling to their opinion, as we see the Saxons do? What, I beg you, do you think should be done if we are summoned to a colloquy? In my judgment, it would be better to abstain from it than to return to a contest with nothing accomplished. But I do not see what can be achieved.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new.</p>
      <p>The Geneva alliance is now completely confirmed and the documents are sealed.</p>
      <p>We await from you what you have.</p>
      <p>I am sending again several gatherings of the Decades.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially Musculus. I wish your entire household well, along with the whole church.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 21, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and godfather. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
