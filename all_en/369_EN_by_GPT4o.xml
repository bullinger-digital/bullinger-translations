      <p>My entire friendly willing service along with whatever I can honor, love, and do good, beforehand. Highly learned, pious, honorable, gracious, dear lord and cousin, David Zechender, my brother, the bearer of this, a seventeen or eighteen-year-old youth, will arrive at your place. He has learned the goldsmith trade in Geneva for the last three years for a customary fee, which my mother gave him. Therefore, he has never ventured out, except now, where it is to be expected that this first journey will be entirely unfamiliar and burdensome for him due to his youth. For he has been supported by our late father and us in schools and otherwise with money, etc. Therefore, on behalf of my mother and myself, I earnestly and urgently request that you, if it is not burdensome for you, assist him in Zurich with the master goldsmiths, especially with Stampfer (to whom Samuel Tillman here has also written on his behalf), so that he may be accepted and employed, even though he is young and inexperienced, yet rewarded according to his merit and obedience, as is appropriate and agreeable to them. To this end, I ask you to lend him your friendly word, which he will undoubtedly benefit from. I am confident that you will show our entire friendship acceptable service and goodwill. My highest and greatest request, however, is primarily to you, that you do not take offense at such a rough request without prior introduction and acquaintance, much less any proven kindness, but rather, because we are lacking our late father, like others, seek help where we hope to receive it, trusting in friendship.</p>
      <p>In this, I wish to show you how I assure myself entirely towards you. If I could and knew how to earn your favor with the help of the Almighty, I will always be found entirely willing. Herewith, I commend you to the protection of Almighty God.</p>
      <p>Dated December 19, 1548, in Bern. Your entirely willing Hans Zehender, council scribe.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, pious, wise Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my especially gracious, dear lord and cousin, chief overseer of the holy gospel. Zurich.</p>
