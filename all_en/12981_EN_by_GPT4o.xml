    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The people of Chur were very pleased with Bullinger's letter [not preserved]. According to Bullinger's instructions, Blasius first showed it to Mayor Luzi Heim. Subsequently, Blasius was summoned by a messenger [...] to the council meeting and asked to read it aloud there. Everyone was delighted. Heim thanks Bullinger for taking the time despite his heavy workload.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blasius took the opportunity to remind the council of Hans Tscharner's promise to have a city view of Chur made for the [Zurich] printer [Christoph Froschauer], especially since the other Swiss cities are also doing so. Tscharner blamed the painter for the delay. The painter is currently in Feldkirch and communicated in a letter that arrived the day before that he would not come to Chur for the sake of one picture, as he is very busy. The Chur council dispatched a messenger today [...] and ordered the painter to come immediately. He will certainly be in Chur by tomorrow. As soon as the picture is finished, merchants will bring it to Zurich. Bullinger should inform Froschauer about this. Blasius would have liked to send it at an earlier market date, but the painter was absent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blasius will also convey the very credible news shared by Bullinger to Johannes Travers, [Raphael?] Paravicini, and the other [friends] beyond the Alps. In Chur, nothing new was learned about Italy beyond what Bullinger already mentioned in his letter. However, the Chur merchants have more detailed information regarding the uprising. If Bullinger is interested, they will provide it to him. Regards.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Bullinger, Greetings. We received your most desired letters, a man in the Lord most highly esteemed, which filled us with ineffable joy. As you instructed, I first showed them to Mayor Luzi Heim, and then, summoned by a messenger, I was ordered to read them aloud at the council meeting, which I did. As far as I could judge, they too were greatly affected with joy, and all, but especially Mayor Heim, instructed me to write back to you with immense thanks for your care and diligence towards us, that you, so occupied with other matters, deign to write to us so diligently, etc.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, in the same meeting, I very conveniently proposed at length about the icon of our city, which Hans Tscharner had promised to send to the printer, urging them not to disdain to do what the other more celebrated Swiss cities have done. Tscharner, however, blamed the painter, who is now more occupied in Feldkirch (as he replied in a letter the day before) than to come to Chur for the sake of this icon, etc. When the council understood this, they immediately sent a certain messenger with letters for the painter on the same 27th of June, instructing him to come to Chur without delay along with the messenger, etc! Therefore, I have no doubt the painter will come on the 28th of June. Then, as soon as it can be completed, it will go to you via merchants. This is the response you can report to the printer about the depiction of our Chur. I would have gladly sent it to you at the earlier market, but at that time we were daily expecting the painter summoned by Tscharner's letters, but in vain (as I said). Now, however, he will certainly come!</p>

      <p>Finally, I will also ensure that this new and entirely credible news is transmitted to Johannes Travers, [Raphael?] Paravicini, and the other excellent friends beyond the Alps. We have nothing else from Italy beyond what you mentioned in your letter, although it has been brought to us more clearly by merchants, namely the cause of the tumult; if you do not have it, you will receive it briefly, and farewell through God. Given in Chur, 5 days before the Kalends of July in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent minister of Christ Jesus, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful and vigilant Antistes of the most ample church of Zurich, his most esteemed.</p>
