      <p>Come, Lord Jesus, quickly. Geneva, June 27. Since nothing is more alien to man than inhumanity, and humanity adorns man especially because of the affinity of name and nature; your humanity has made it so that I greet you with my letters, lest you rightly think me inhuman for not writing to you, whom you have often treated so humanely. For since the Lord always hates the ungrateful, who do not acknowledge the benefits they have received, and the ungrateful are troublesome to people themselves, lest I willingly fall into that vice which I have always hated in others, my duty has demanded of me, your dignity has urged, and both have impelled me to write, to at least acknowledge with words the thanks I owe, since I cannot repay them with deeds.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I pray that you may live long, with all yours, happily and for the sake of the hospitality, by which you have treated us all exiles so kindly, and with the joyful remembrance of which I delight myself, may the Lord bless you perpetually for His kindness. Continue, therefore, what you have begun, and by doing good to the wretched, adorn yourself and all yours: for the Lord is pleased with such sacrifices; He grants a memory that will never die, and He cannot forget your beneficence to His exiles. But while your many noble deeds are cited with much gratitude by many, there is nothing, however, in which they more seriously rejoice than that you strive to bring Peter Martyr to you. Many notice how unworthy it is for such a man to be silenced, especially in these times; and how great an addition will be made to the truth to be extracted in your most free liberty, when they see, many promise themselves great things from him. And although it is pleasant and almost necessary for our wretched selves that all Englishmen gather in one church, with mutual complaints and fervent prayers to the Lord for our fallen church, to supplicate, to entreat; yet to return to you, after I perceive that he has come to you, both my spirit desires and a slight occasion will draw me. Whatever you wish to know about us, this good man wishes and can faithfully report everything. You will bid my dearest Mr. Gualter, along with each of your other colleagues, and separately Mr. Gesner, whom I live by his work next to God and daily become a little better, to be well. May the Lord Jesus preserve you with your church perpetually, and restore ours, having had mercy on us in our collapse. Amen.</p>
      <p>Yours by your merit, James Pilkington, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man and most vigilant pastor, Mr. Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
