    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends a recently written letter [No. 864]. Welcomes the position of Myconius and [Grynaeus] on the [Wittenberg Concord]; [the Zurichers] do not want to sign either the Concord or the [Augsburg] Confession. Rejects further meetings as well as any departure from the [First Helvetic] Confession. Greetings. Onofrius Setzstab has secretly entered [French] service; also from Schwyz, Toggenburg, and Lucerne, mercenaries are said to join the French [King Francis I], but Zurich is careful not to favor any party. The St. Gallen Abbot [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee], together with envoys from Lucerne and Schwyz, unsuccessfully tried to reverse the redemption of Toggenburg; Zurich has sent [Hans Rudolf] Lavater there, and [the Zurich theologians] have opposed the abbot's claim. Inquires about the observance of social class barriers in marriages in Basel; in Zurich, the relatives of a citizen's daughter have prevented her marriage to the son of the [knacker] Heitz [Gro√üholz].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I wrote a response a few days ago, as you requested in your previous letter, but due to the lack of messengers, I did not send what I had written. However, I am sending it now.</p>
      <p>I am pleased, indeed very pleased, with what you have responded to the council regarding the Saxon Confession. We do not wish to subscribe to either the Wittenberg Concord or the Saxon Confession. I return your response and give thanks.</p>
      <p>Among other things, you write: "Then there will also be consultation about the common assembly." Know, therefore, my venerable Myconius, that we will not attend any assembly in the future. We met once in Basel, we confessed once. There is no reason for us to meet again unless we do not wish to persevere in the confessed truth. Why are we being troubled and tested so often? In short: I would rather sharpen the confession once made than soften it. Why are we being driven here and there? If Luther and his followers can accept our confession, I thank God. If they cannot, it will not be right for us to change even a little of the confession unless they first convict us of error. The people of Strasbourg have solemnly promised that they will not act against this confession in the future, nor will they act without us. I await the outcome of the matter. There is nothing else they should expect from us; what we have once confessed, we confess today as well. What more do they seek?</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest brother, together with Grynaeus, the esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Onofrius Setzstab has secretly entered mercenary service. People from Schwyz and Toggenburg, as they say, have gone to the French with three banners. They also say that people from Lucerne will go. Our people remain consistently the same and do not join any party.</p>
      <p>The Abbot of St. Gallen, accompanied by envoys from Lucerne and Schwyz, entered our council and requested certain things against the Toggenburgers, but achieved nothing. Our people have sent Lavater to the Toggenburgers; we await his return. The abbot would gladly take back the purchase and bring them back to the blockhouse. We have publicly criticized the monk in a sermon. Pellicanus also admonished him in the inn to repent; but Antronius despised it.</p>
      <p>Farewell. My occupations do not allow me to write more.</p>
      <p>Please answer this question for me: Is it allowed among you for a hangman or executioner's assistant or any other dishonorable person to marry the daughter of an honorable citizen? Among us, such a thing has happened; the son of Heitz has taken a citizen's daughter and she is with him.</p>
      <p>The father is old; he thought it must be so. But when he was informed, he opposed it with the relatives, and they have been separated. They have not yet given themselves to each other nor lived together.</p>
      <p>July 28, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the excellent man, Oswald Myconius, my dearest brother. In Basel.</p>
