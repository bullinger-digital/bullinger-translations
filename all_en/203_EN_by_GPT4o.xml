      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Although the sacred oracles teach that nothing should be hoped for in man, our present times present so many examples to our eyes that we can certainly see that all who have placed their hope in the sons of men will be confounded, but only those whose hope is the Lord will dwell safely and confidently. For I recently received many lamentable things from D. Musculus. Now at last that little ship containing the disciples of Christ has been committed to the stormy sea, now we must apply ourselves to the oars; now that flock of the Lord, truly small, is reduced to a narrow place; for the most powerful princes and the wealthiest cities adore that Roman beast. Many are offended by the multitude of those who adore the beast and the few who bear the sign of the Lamb of God, and that many saints are conquered; but I recognize that this does not happen without reason. For there are many things that can console us. For Christ, the true shepherd of our souls, does not lose one of those given to him by the Father, who are written in the book of life; those who have the character of the beast and adore the beast are tested, because no one can buy or sell unless he has the character or name of the beast. The Lord always preserves for himself some remnants, though small, who will not bend their knees to Baal, and without a doubt, this number is greater than we can conjecture according to our reason. I am accustomed to frequently inculcate these and other things of this kind to the church, as I see that some faint-hearted ones can be easily offended. May the Lord have mercy on us; for now, as I hear, it is over for many, as far as human matters are concerned. Today the thoughts of many hearts are revealed, many fall away from the Lord, but only those who have never truly tasted how good the Lord is and how blessed is he who trusts in Him. There is one thing that moves me greatly: I hear from trustworthy men that painted images are publicly sold among you and frequently bought by citizens; it cannot be said how greatly this offends many, nor has it been objected to me only once with some bitter insult that images are now again being sold in Zurich, which the malevolent want to use as an argument that there was an error long ago in abolishing images and that the people of Zurich now waver in their faith and that many are ready to receive the returning demon with seven other worse ones with a grateful mind. However, others who love evangelical truth are saddened and disturbed by such things. Since this is the case, I cannot sufficiently marvel at the supine indifference or negligence of your council, otherwise most prudent, at this very time, which could tolerate such things, and indeed it should not be tolerated because of the scandal. Therefore, concerning this, and if there are other things you wish me to know, I ask you to finally write to me, breaking your long silence. Regarding the Swiss confederations now again being confirmed by oath, with various things being said that cannot be written, I would very much like to hear something certain.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I do not doubt that my cause is very much commended to you; for you know that two years ago I complained about the meagerness of the stipend; now I am no better off.</p>
      <p>D. Haller recently discussed with me about the Bernese diaconate, as he said, on your advice; but I plainly refused to accept it, and not without reason. I would like to serve the fatherland in many ways, especially for the sake of my wife and children; but since that cannot be, willingly or unwillingly, I will eventually be forced to live elsewhere, yet on the condition that I may enjoy freedom afterwards, about which I will soon speak with you in person; for I hear that you, with the Lord willing, will soon come to us with your brother D. John, our most esteemed father, which I would indeed greatly desire and long expected to come to me; for I will seem much happier and more blessed to me if I can have you as a guest in my home, under whose protection and patronage I have been able to live quite happily until now. You will be a most welcome guest to me; I only ask this, that you do not change your plan nor allow yourself to be hindered by any business. You will have me as a host who certainly loves you very much and, if not serving lavishly, yet striving to treat you kindly to the best of my ability and congratulating himself on the given opportunity to show a grateful mind for your infinite benefits, since I have long used your hospitality most familiarly.</p>
      <p>My wife sends her greetings to you. I pray for health for your whole household, to D. Gwalther, Collin, and the other brothers. Farewell and keep me commended, as you are accustomed to.</p>
      <p>Aarau, July 18, 1548. You undoubtedly have certain news from Constance and Lindau, which are hidden from us.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in humanity, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord.</p>
