      <p>Greetings. Whenever our adversaries have attempted to suppress the true religion, they have, with their very own schemes, provoked it even more, and this has always been observed to be the case from the time when the pure light of the Gospel began to shine upon us by the grace of the most excellent God, up to the present. This is now much more evident, as the Antichrist, with his cohort, deciding to make his utmost efforts to oppress the pious, is himself being more thoroughly crushed everywhere than ever before. Regarding the French war, which I hope has been successfully concluded, all the pious rightly give the greatest thanks to our God, as they recognize from how many dangers they have now been delivered, which were threatening them from the Antichrist. I have compiled in the attached schedule what is being reported everywhere about the state of affairs among us.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, most esteemed lord, with all your people. Given in Augsburg, March 31, in the year 68.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten. To the venerable, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
