      <p>Greetings. When Calvin sent me the formula of agreement along with his and your letter, most excellent Bullinger, and also the letters you had sent to him to be read, I began to give thanks to God from the heart and to pray that in these so sorrowful times, in which the light seems almost taken away, He may cause the light of consolation, peace, and edification to shine forth. This agreement is a very small matter: since you and Calvin and those who agree with you have not fought among yourselves, neither in spirit nor in opinions, it was therefore easy for those who were already in agreement to consent. Thus, perhaps someone will judge, and I also hear some such things being thrown around in mockery. But the matter is much greater than they think. I know that it was no less necessary to strive for it than it was desired that it should happen, so much so that a way out could hardly be found. But the Lord, who accomplishes all things more fully than we would dare to hope, finally brought it about that there was full agreement, and it came to light, and true and genuine charity has been so increased and strengthened by God's grace, and as much as possible among all who have subscribed to the agreement, that nothing now remains to obscure it, but that it is full and open. The delay, as it was more troublesome due to the strong desire with which I longed for everything to be completed, so your care, my Bullinger, in which you were careful to avoid that concord should provide material for discord, was very pleasing. Indeed, it was rightly done by you, that you diligently sought out both with yourself and with good men what might more edify and less offend, so that everything might be done in due time. You finally found that all things would turn out for edification with time, even if the present time does not allow for full publication, but only that the pious may be consulted and if there are any wicked ones who boast of dissension, they may be restrained: which indeed is much. I hear that some in France, affected with the greatest joy, give thanks to Christ for the mere hearing of such concord: what will they do when they see openly what both sides think? For, although you have been careful in your writings, lest anyone should think that you believe and assert that Christ is absent from His church, and that His Spirit, by which the sacred ministry is performed, does not operate in the pious while the things instituted by Christ are being performed, yet there are not a few who everywhere cut you down and vociferate even among good men, that you establish a church without Christ and the communion of Christ, and that the whole ministry is vain and ineffective, as if they were only signs of absent things. And Calvin is thus heard among some, that he knows nothing of the Spirit of baptism, but only the baptism of water: that he considers nothing beyond the signs, having them for things and adhering to them in such a way that he is not carried higher.</p>
      <p>But the writings of both of you protest against this. It is true: but not everyone can read them, either because of the tyranny of the executioners of Antichrist or something else, and meanwhile the worst impostors here and there gather or rather fabricate in your writings what serves their impiety. The formula of agreement, which the lost will not be able to prevent from reaching everyone, will stop the mouths of the pestilent.</p>
      <p>There is no need for me to write much about these things which I prefer to see rather than write, and you can see more, as you have already felt through the Lord's clemency. One thing greatly refreshes me, that I see the closest friendship between you and Calvin in this concord, and it is truly Christian, most useful and necessary for the church and all the pious. Each has the gifts of God, and they are very excellent, which contribute not a little to the church, so that each does not grudgingly expend them.</p>
      <p>And what will this holy union not contribute with so many excellent gifts, so that they may be more and more useful to all. Viret is certainly not to be despised, if he was your friend before, what addition has this concord made? What should I say of others? who, as many as are pious and see how well you agree with Calvin and Calvin with you, cannot but regard you with love. I will say nothing of myself. I would rather testify by deed than by words how I am affected. I see no less holy hearts united there with Calvin and the rest than ours are with you as one.</p>
      <p>It remains that we cultivate and cherish such a gift of God, and let it not be shaken in any part by the wickedness of any slanderer, but let us on both sides let fornicators, drunkards, the avaricious, not to mention the fully impious without God, whatever forms they assume, be, and as much as we can, strive to separate them far from the flock, I mean the hopeless ones, and as long as they act so perniciously among the sheep of Christ, and we mutually helping each other strive for the edification of all. But why do I pour out these things to you, as if you have not long since abhorred such things, and those fornicators who were sent away from there long ago are not known to you, how little they are useful to the church, so that all should rightly beware lest the sacred ministry be defiled by such stains. But to us they are monsters, as more horrendous so more cunning, and who even to those long engaged in the work of the Lord, with whom they have also lived, and who have so often experienced the wicked, almost fear and explore everything, to these, I say, they impose: thus they feign piety with learning.</p>
      <p>True sophists. May the Lord Jesus deliver the churches from such plagues, and make all the pious agree among themselves as holily as possible in all things. In which matter, since you are strong with your gentle nature, may Christ cause you to expend yourself entirely, and not only others, as you are accustomed, but even surpass yourself, and what was begun by your authority, that it may be holy with Haller, agree with Viret and the good, and what has not entirely failed may always grow more and more and be fully completed.</p>
      <p>I congratulate you, indeed that very dear city to me, for the constancy in avoiding such wicked conditions of the covenant: would that others had had another regard for piety. Farewell most excellently, and with you all your colleagues, lest I pass over Theodore with the old Pellican and Gualther. A colleague sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Neuchâtel, December 12, 1549. I wish the pious consul Hab and his son and Heinrich to be safe.</p>
      <p>Farel, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the very distinguished man both in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, to be especially respected. In Zürich.</p>
