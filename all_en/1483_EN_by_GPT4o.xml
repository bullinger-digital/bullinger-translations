      <p>To the most illustrious men and faithful pastors, doctors, and ministers of the Church of Christ in Geneva, most esteemed colleagues and dearest brothers, greetings.</p>
      <p>We have heard with great sorrow that the church, which the gracious Lord has willed you, beloved brothers, to serve, is troubled.</p>
      <p>We recognize and proclaim those outstanding gifts which the generous Lord has bestowed upon our church and upon you. For just as it is a refuge for the faithful expelled from their homes by cruel tyranny, so the preaching of the truth, which is the proclamation of Christ, has reached from there to neighboring peoples and indeed throughout all of France. This grieves Satan, the enemy of sincere truth and the glory of Christ; therefore, he rages and strives to disturb and scatter your church, indeed at no time since the restoration of the doctrine of the Gospel have we been more savagely attacked by the antichrist and the prince of darkness, the devil, than at this very time, when we experience him arming the most powerful princes against us through false bishops and prophets, and even stirring up false brothers among us, inciting quarrels and disputes, and finally stirring up countless Epicureans and the fury of the mob. And indeed all these things tend and conspire to elevate and remove our ministry and to disturb and scatter the church of Christ, so that falsehood, imposture, and antichristianism may prevail again. Therefore, if ever it was timely to be vigilant, it seems now most necessary to be vigilant and to pray, and indeed for us, who are destined by the grace and protection of the eternal God, we can be more easily scattered by any slight breeze. And in the present cause of Hieronymus, it seems to you that you should strive by all means, if perhaps you might understand each other better and be reconciled in the Lord. It seems to you that Hieronymus has conducted his cause immodestly; however, in you too, brothers, we desire modesty, as you seem to be very harsh in those writings of yours sent to us.</p>
      <p>It was always necessary to remember that prophetic and evangelical statement made about our Lord Christ: "He will not quarrel nor cry out, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets; a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he leads justice to victory." Although in the meantime we do not deny that with the incurable and obstinate it is necessary to act more severely. However, we do not wish to bind the chains of a captive man unknown to us, as we are not appointed judges. As for the kind of doctrine in which you disagree, there was no need to ask for our opinion on election and the reprobate, on faith and the powers of man, since you cannot be ignorant of it from our last consensus, in which we believe the whole matter is comprehended. But since others interpret our views differently and good men among you now wish to hear our opinion briefly expressed again, so that they may perhaps judge for themselves about the agreement or disagreement of doctrine, we propose these few points for the consideration of the pious. First, we establish that the election by which God from eternity chose the undeserving and sinners and embraces them in Christ, through whom we have all things pertaining to life and salvation, is entirely gratuitous and that all human salvation (which is the foundation of faith) is to be ascribed to the gratuitous mercy of God according to the apostle: "It is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy," and again: "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world was laid, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love, who predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he made us accepted in the beloved." Then we teach that the faith by which we embrace Christ is not obtained by any merits of ours, but is given by the mere grace of God through the Spirit and the Word, and that the same grace of God increases and preserves the same faith in us according to the apostle: "To you it has been granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him." For elsewhere the apostles pray: "Lord, increase our faith." Hence we also gladly acknowledge that statement of Augustine in the third chapter of "On the Predestination of the Saints": that faith is preceded by grace. Here we attribute nothing to the powers of unregenerate men except corruption, voluntary sin, guilt, and punishment; to those regenerated by the Spirit of God, we attribute voluntary and good operation because of the Spirit of God according to the apostle: "The natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God," and again: "We are not sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God." For he also says elsewhere: "It is God who works in you both to will and to do for his good pleasure." For it is also read in the Gospel: "If the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed; for where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." Nevertheless, we acknowledge that remnants of the flesh remain, so that according to the word of the apostle, what we do not want, we do, and therefore we ourselves serve the law of God with our mind, but with the flesh the law of sin, so that throughout the life of even the regenerated, grace may find something to do. For David, feeling this, said: "Do not enter into judgment with your servant, for no one living is righteous in your sight." Moreover, that the reprobate do not believe the word of God, but live impiously against God, should indeed be imputed to them, not to God, who justly and deservedly condemns those he condemns.</p>
      <p>But sin clings to man, not to God; for God, whose way is perfect and who does not will iniquity, is just in all his ways and holy in all his works. Finally, we do not remove order from the business of salvation, nor do we reject or confuse causes, whether proximate or remote. We confess that God laid his hand on Job without his fault, we confess that he used the works of Satan and Satanic soldiers, who nevertheless are by no means to be freed from blame, since their eye was evil. But Job himself bears witness for us: "The Lord gave," he says, "the Lord has taken away." He does not say: "The Lord gave, the devil has taken away." This is our opinion briefly comprehended in these letters and more fully set forth in our writings, from which those who wish, setting aside persons and setting aside favor or hatred, will easily judge about our agreement or disagreement.</p>
      <p>We love you, brothers, we love your church and we pray to the Lord from the heart that he may happily and kindly quell all disturbances. Pray for us to the Lord, live and farewell, esteemed and beloved lords and brothers in Christ. Zürich, November 27, 1551.</p>
      <p>The pastors and doctors, ministers of the Church of Zürich.</p>
