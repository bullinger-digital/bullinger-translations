    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The Lord allows that up to this point there are questions on which [among the Protestants] there is no consensus. Yet it is believed and taught together that the Holy Scripture alone is authoritative; that the old creeds are to be upheld and taught; that our salvation rests solely on the true faith in Christ; that Christ must be acknowledged so that He can assist His own and strengthen their faith whenever they gather to administer or receive the sacraments. All this has been declared by the people of Zurich in the Basel Confession [i.e., with the First Helvetic Confession]. Therefore, the people of Strasbourg rightly believed that a community in Christ could be maintained with Zurich; hence, they always regarded the people of Zurich as friends and always spoke favorably of them. If one of them went to Zurich, he was encouraged to behave in a friendly manner. They were also always grateful when the people of Zurich sent them one of their own: they endeavored to treat him with all kindness. The differing beliefs observed between them, whether regarding some Bible passages, the church, or the pastoral office, they commended to the Lord and asked Him to lead them to the same understanding.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The two Zurichers, Ludwig Lavater and Jakob Gessner, as well as the Schaffhauser [... Zingg], who had been entrusted to the colleague Johannes Marbach, were treated by him like his own sons. He took care of their piety and studies as best as he could and never argued with them about the Eucharist or other subtleties. However, since they never participated in the Lord's Table and Easter was approaching, at which the entire school is obliged to participate in the communion, Marbach thought it was his duty as pastor and householder to admonish the Zurich students to participate in the Lord's Table together with all their comrades and the entire church of Strasbourg, without presuming to judge the communion dispute or even first wanting to explore with what understanding the people of Strasbourg approach the communion. It is not fitting for someone who believes that there is only one body of Christ to refuse to partake of this body with other Christians. After Marbach's admonition, the Schaffhauser decided to attend the communion, but the two Zurichers continued to refuse.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] When Dr. [Konrad] Gessner stayed in Strasbourg during the annual fair [end of June 1546], he was told that the students were really only required to make a simple and general confession about Christ's presence and effect in the communion; indeed, that nothing else was desired from them than that they participate in the communion with a faith conforming to the Basel Confession. It was also emphasized how much the behavior of the Zurich students set a bad example. Dr. Gessner promised to speak with the young men and to present the matter to the Zurich colleagues. He believed that a solution to this disagreement would be found.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] They continued to try to keep the matter secret. But then the unfortunate war broke out. Public prayers were instituted, and communion services were organized more frequently than usual, following the example of the apostolic and the early church. Again, the two Zurichers refused to participate; but this time the Schaffhauser joined them, while all the other boarders of Marbach went to the communion. This caused talk. Some others even began to refer to the example of the Zurichers. As the preceptor of these young people, Marbach recognized both his responsibility and the danger associated with this behavior for both the city church order and his own house order.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] However, since he did not want to upset the Zurich colleagues, he did not expel the young men from his house and asked his colleagues for advice. They summoned the students and admonished them fatherly. They tried to make them understand the serious consequences of their behavior. No one can stay away from the communion without the church disapproving and expelling him. Furthermore, the people of Strasbourg do not deserve such behavior. They also cannot understand that the young men hold such a poor opinion of their church. After all, nothing else is demanded of them than that they participate in the communion in accordance with the Basel Confession or with Paul's statement: "The bread that we break is participation in the body of Christ; the cup for which we give thanks is participation in the blood of Christ" [1 Cor 11:24f]. What they so vehemently dispute, whether regarding the presence of the Lord in the communion, the interpretation of some Bible passages, or the church and the pastoral office, they should entrust to the Lord. The regulation of the Strasbourg school requires that whoever uses its services must also use the services of the associated church. The people of Zurich would not tolerate a citizen, at least a councilor, refusing to participate in the communion because he believes it is not properly administered!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] In this way, the young men were admonished, and this with the greatest mildness. The people of Strasbourg did not doubt for a moment that the students wanted to be Christians and therefore would not condemn the people of Strasbourg, as they partake of the same Christ. When the young men justified themselves by referring to the instructions they had received from their church, they were reminded that their church had neither rejected the Basel Confession nor defended the opinion that only symbols of an absent Christ are handed out in the communion. They were therefore asked to let themselves be enlightened by the Holy Spirit. If they were not so well brought up or did not show such reverence to God, one would not worry about their abstention from the communion. Furthermore, if one were of the opinion that their church taught falsely or did not fear God, they would not be allowed to the communion either.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Three days after this admonition, the Strasbourg pastors learned that the young men had complained that they had been threatened with expulsion from the school. I, Bucer, therefore summoned them again in the presence of the householder Marbach and asked them if they had indeed claimed such a thing. They denied this, but said (since it had been impressed upon them that every student at the Strasbourg school must also use the local church, and since they had also been pointed out that such behavior would not be tolerated in Zurich either) that they now feared they would soon be expelled from the school if they continued not to participate in the communion. They were told that nothing would be rushed; that they should rather reflect on the admonition addressed to them, indeed devote themselves to their studies without worry, instead of already considering how they would be dealt with if they did not relent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] But since the Strasbourg pastors sensed that the Zurich students wanted to adhere to the instructions of their pastors, they decided to write to their colleagues in Zurich in the hope that they would urge their young men not to exclude the people of Strasbourg from the community of Christ any longer by refusing to participate in the Strasbourg communion. This was communicated to the young men. They were also told that in the future they would be shown what was written about them to Zurich, so that they would also know what they wanted to discuss in their letters to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Thereupon the young men were determined to change their boarding house. An hour later, the Schaffhauser [Zingg] unexpectedly packed his things, had a merchant [Richard Hilles?] settle the bill for his accommodation, and said nothing more to his householder, preceptor, and pastor, Mr. Marbach, than: "Farewell, Mr. Preceptor. I am leaving!" He was rightly dismayed at such ingratitude, admonished the young man, but then let him go anyway.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] All this the Strasbourg colleagues wanted to report here in detail, for they do not doubt that the Zurich colleagues also wish that their young men would continue to benefit undisturbed from the school and the church in Strasbourg, especially since they sent them to Strasbourg for study on their own initiative. Therefore, they should also urge their students to participate in the communion, all the more so as nothing is demanded of them that contradicts the Basel Confession or the statements of Paul. These students are not aware of how much they sin by rejecting the community with Christians, especially that of their teachers! The people of Zurich will surely be able to imagine what bad consequences this behavior has in Strasbourg. The times are already difficult enough! Moreover, the devil is trying to incite the believers against each other! But what the latter have received from the Lord, they should rather pass on with gratitude, without insulting or despising each other! In the church, everyone should be granted the freedom of Christ. Everyone should be allowed to teach and act in accordance with his faith. This is how the people of Strasbourg behave towards others; the same should be granted to them, as long as they are guided by the word of God. Therefore, they ask the people of Zurich and the students sent by them to treat them as brothers as before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The Strasbourg pastors wish their Zurich colleagues all the best and hope that they will relieve them with the desired answer in this troubled time.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace in the Lord, esteemed and dearest men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The Lord indeed has allowed certain questions to arise, about which we have not yet been given the same understanding on both sides. However, He has granted that we both believe and teach that the divine scriptures alone are to be followed in the doctrine of religion, that all the old creeds of the church are to be upheld and proclaimed, and that the salvation of all men is to be placed in the true and living faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is also to be acknowledged as present with His own and effective in increasing the salvation of His own, when they gather in His name to administer and receive His sacraments, as you have confessed in the Basel Confession. For these reasons, we have rightly considered that the communion of Christ is to be cherished with you, and thus we have always thought and spoken of you as friends, and we have diligently instructed our people, when we sent them to you, to do the same. We have been very grateful that you have also sent your people to us, whom we have embraced and treated with as much humanity and charity as we could. Meanwhile, we have commended to the Lord the fact that there is not the same judgment on both sides regarding the interpretation of certain passages of scripture, certain churches, and ministers, praying that He may inspire you with the same and His own opinion on these matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>When three young men, two from your area, Ludwig Lavater and Jakob Gessner, and one from Schaffhausen, were entrusted to the care of our colleague and brother, Dr. Johannes Marbach, he certainly treated them like sons, instructed them in piety, and assisted their studies as much as he could, never disturbing them with disputes about the Eucharist or other more scrupulous discussions. However, since they never participated in the Lord's Table here, which the rest of their fellow boarders rightly did from time to time, and since the time of Easter, which had just passed, approached, when we are accustomed to instruct and exhort the whole school to the holy communion of the Lord, Marbach considered it his duty, both as their pastor and as the head of the household, to exhort them to communicate at the Lord's Table with their fellow boarders and the whole church of Christ. He therefore admonished them to communicate with simple faith in the institution and words of the Lord, not to set themselves up as judges of the controversy that is being debated on this matter, nor to inquire too scrupulously about the manner in which we communicate with Christ; that it is a serious matter for one who wishes to be one with the other faithful in the bread, one body, to refuse to participate with them in the one bread of the Lord. After this paternal admonition was made to them, the Schaffhauser communicated, but your two did not. Dr. Marbach bore this and ignored it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>When Dr. Gessner came to us at our fair, we discussed this matter with him and showed him how we are content with a simple and general confession about the presence and efficacy of the Lord in the holy supper, and that we ask nothing more of these young men than that they communicate with us in the faith of your Basel Confession. We also pointed out how bad an example it would be if they, living with us in scholastic and domestic custom, were to disdain the communion of our church. He promised to act with the young men and to report the matter to you; he hoped that this stumbling block could easily be removed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The matter was again ignored until the time when the Lord aroused such a horrible war against us. Then more solemn supplications were instituted, and the communions of the Lord's Table were held more frequently according to the institution of the Lord and the example of the apostles and the ancient church. Again, your two, and with them the Schaffhauser, who had communicated at Easter, alone among Marbach's household did not communicate. Since it appeared that the Schaffhauser was also withdrawn from our communion, and certain words were spread, which were taken as an example of contempt for our church and its ministries, which we certainly strive to perform for the Lord in such a way that we trust we can approve them to Him on the day of His judgment (not, alas, as far as the zeal and religion of administering are concerned, but yet as far as the ministries themselves are concerned), Dr. Marbach's conscience began to be burdened by this matter. For he saw that this manifest diversity in religion among many of his boarders was harmful to both ecclesiastical and domestic discipline, and also that there was a certain weakening of discipline and respect towards their teachers, which befits good students.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>However, because he himself wished to do what was pleasing to you in the Lord, he did not want to expel the young men from his house, but reported the whole matter to us. We therefore called them to us and admonished them paternally about the communion of the church, and how serious it is to withdraw from it; for no one can alienate himself from the union of the sacraments of any church without its condemnation and excommunication. We do not deserve this, nor do we think that they make this judgment about us. We ask nothing more than that they communicate with us in the faith of the Basel Confession, or this Pauline one: "The bread that we break is a participation in the body of the Lord, the cup for which we give thanks is a participation in His blood" [1 Cor 11:24f]. What is more acutely disputed, whether about the presence of the Lord in the supper or about the interpretation of certain passages or even about churches and ministers of churches dissenting in this matter, they should commit these things to the Lord. It is also the rule of our school that whoever wishes to use its benefit must also use the church; for we have established a Christian school, which is nothing other than a certain church of Christian and literary youth. We have also long heard that in Zurich, not even in the society of citizens, or at least in the senatorial order, is it tolerated for someone who never communicates at the Lord's Table, and openly declares that he does so because he judges that the Lord's Supper is not rightly administered among you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>We admonished these young men from your area with the utmost gentleness, urging this one thing above all, since we did not doubt that they wanted to be of Christ, that they should not condemn us by the communion of Christ, into which we have been assumed by the Lord Himself. And when they referred to the institution of their churches, we replied that we did not doubt that you do not contradict the Basel Confession, nor do you establish that nothing is received in the holy supper but the symbols of an entirely absent Christ, bread and wine. We therefore dismissed them from us, urging them to deliberate and consider with the invocation of the Spirit of Christ how serious it is to deny the communion of Christ to anyone who believes and strives to follow all that is of Christ. If they were ill-instructed and devoid of the fear of the Lord, we would be less concerned about their abstention from the Lord's Table. Indeed, if it were clear to us and the church that they were so, we would not admit them to the Lord's Table, even if they wished it. But now we regard them as piously and holily instructed, well-behaved young men, sent to us by those churches which wish nothing more for them than progress in piety, and it is necessary for us to be religious if we were to ignore this sin of theirs, the denial of communion with us, which is much more serious than they think.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>However, three days after this admonition was made to them, it was reported to us that they had complained that we had threatened them with expulsion from the school unless they communicated. I therefore called them to me again, I, Bucer, who had especially addressed them in the common admonition in the name of the brothers, with their host, Dr. Marbach, and asked if they were indeed complaining about such a thing from us. They denied that they were complaining, but from what we had said, that it was the rule of our school that whoever wished to use its benefit should also use the church, and that in Zurich a citizen who did not communicate at the Lord's Table was not tolerated, they feared that perhaps, if they continued to abstain from the Lord's Table with us, they would be expelled from the school. We replied that we were not so precipitate; we had admonished them and used arguments by which we hoped they could be moved to what we do not doubt is the command of the Lord and in their own interest for salvation, and we had instructed them to weigh the whole matter with themselves, and we had added nothing about what we would do if they did not acquiesce to our admonitions. They should not interpret our words otherwise than they were made to them by us. They should devote themselves to piety and letters with a calm mind.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>However, when we noticed that they were being held back by the authority of their pastors, whom they have at home, we decided to write to you and explain what we were asking of them and for what reasons; and we hoped that you would also interpose your authority, so that they would not continue to exclude us from the communion of Christ, as far as they were concerned, by denying the communion of His Table, and whatever we were going to write, we wanted to show them before we sent the letters to you, so that they could also write to you what seemed appropriate. Thus we dismissed them, intending to send you such letters when a suitable messenger occurred.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Meanwhile, they themselves thought about changing their lodging, and the Schaffhauser, without the knowledge of his host and preceptor, packed his books and belongings, found a merchant to settle his account with his host, and, without expecting anything of the sort, approached him an hour later, saying nothing more than: "Farewell, Master Preceptor, I am leaving." Dr. Marbach, disturbed, and rightly so, by this ingratitude and inhumanity of the young man, began to admonish him gently and as a pious preceptor should, and then dismissed him in peace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Since these things have happened and are as we have recounted, it seemed right to us to present all these matters to you in a simple and faithful narration, for we do not doubt that you wish that your young men fulfill their duty in all things, and that our school and church enjoy the greatest tranquility, and we ask you in the Lord, that, since you undoubtedly send your young men here to a Christian school, you be their advisors, so that they do not refuse to communicate with us in the sacraments in the Lord, since we require nothing from them at all but your Basel Confession, indeed only that Pauline one which we have mentioned. The young men do not know how great a sin it is to deny the communion of Christ to those who are of Christ, and even to their preceptors. Furthermore, you can easily recognize what such examples produce, especially when some are boasted of with special authority. The times are otherwise more than afflicted, and Satan rages everywhere, trying to tear us apart, whom the Lord has joined together. Meanwhile, that evil one urges his own in a horrible manner. What we do not doubt we have received from the Lord, we profess, and without disparaging anyone. We strive to be grateful to those through whom the Lord has imparted His most abundant gifts to us, but without contempt for anyone. We wish to have each one in his place and number in the church of God: the freedom of Christ, and that each one may teach and act according to his faith, as we gladly grant to all, so we also rightly ask to be granted to us, as long as we keep within the rule of the word of God. For judgments in the church must be altogether holy, yet free, and candid. Thus we trust you are also disposed. Therefore, as you have hitherto held us and still hold us in the number of your brothers, so we pray for the sake of our common Christ that you may persuade those whom you undoubtedly send to us to be educated and instructed in piety to do the same.</p>
      <p>We wish you to fare well and prosper in the Lord, and to refresh us with the desired response in the present afflictions of the churches.</p>
      <p>Given on the 6th of December, in Strasbourg, 1546.</p>
      <p>Caspar Hedio, Dr. Peter Martyr, professor of theology.</p>
      <p>Martin Bucer, your brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and the other pastors of the church of Zurich, our venerable and dearest brothers and colleagues in the Lord. To Zurich.</p>
