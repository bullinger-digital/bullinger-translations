      <p>S. I was recently in Neuchâtel with Mr. Musculus during our autumn holidays. Farel, who was very kind to us, sends his warmest regards to you and all the brothers who are there. We are waiting to see what the Pagans will do again in the case of the minister of St. Blasius, who, apart from using the voice of the neighbors, has said nothing that could harm or offend anyone. But without a doubt, there is another snake hidden in this grass. We will hear what will come from those Baden assemblies. Our people did not want to send anyone because of the reasons I wrote about earlier.</p>
      <p>The war against the Frenchman has already been publicly declared and proclaimed by the Emperor in Burgundy. Maria, the Emperor's sister, is planning something against the Frenchman in Picardy. Meanwhile, he rages against the pious, declaring that he is waging war not with the papacy, but with Julius. I greatly fear for this kingdom because of the Christian blood he has shed, and also for us, who, having learned from so many dangers and evils from his dealings, have not yet learned to abstain completely.</p>
      <p>One of our mayor Nägelin's sons was captured by Gonzaga in Milan when he wanted to go to Parma. The messenger found out and asked Gonzaga to release him, which he did. He is now demanding a ransom of 4000 crowns, wanting to extort from the father what he had previously handled in his case; he is in trouble. But it is exactly right: if we kept our children at home and taught them to work, this would not happen to them. But it must be the way of the French, so that we do not forget to be French. We will see if he can be released in exchange for the king's prisoner.</p>
      <p>This is all I have for now. I am not sending any copies of Vergerius because of the storm; however, you will give him the letters that I am sending along.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet your wife, children, and brothers; mine also send their greetings to you. Bern, September 28, 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
