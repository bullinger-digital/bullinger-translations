Bullinger, whom [Luther] also provokes, should be careful not to do the same in his response; Luther refuses to read books from the [Swiss] churches; therefore, when composing his defense, Bullinger should keep the bride of Christ in mind; however, one must respond to make Luther understand that the [Swiss] are no fools. Such writings directed against the [Swiss] churches are extremely to be [lamented], especially now, when Emperor [Charles V] and the Empire are already negotiating matters of faith in Worms.

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>The fanatical book of Luther came to me from Wittenberg on December 4th; I am sending it through this young man, so that you may read it and respond to Luther, who is driven by a mad, if not satanic, spirit, as he delivers all our churches to Satan. He impiously criticizes Zwingli and Oecolampadius, nullifies the Marburg Colloquy and its agreement, and cunningly interprets the booklet written by Zwingli to the King of France, which was published posthumously! Be careful, be careful not to become like Luther in your response; for he also criticizes you, but cleverly. He refuses to read the booklets of our churches. Therefore, write to the church, the bride of Christ, if you are going to write anything. It is necessary for you to write and establish an apology for your church, which he specifically names, so that he does not think we are completely foolish.</p>
      <p>It grieves our hearts that these insane booklets - when the Emperor and the Empire are about to act on matters of faith in Worms - defame our sacred churches as if they were completely incorrigible. O heaven, o earth!</p>
      <p>It is a figment of Satan, who undoubtedly agitates Luther with hidden force and efficacy and imposes madness on him. He wants to be wise above all; he arrogates everything to himself, as if his doctrine alone converted all of Germany to the faith of Christ. He swells with pride just like the Corinthians, although he does not have as many gifts as the Corinthians had. But the Lord wants to test us, to try our constancy and long-suffering. May the Lord deliver us from all evils, both from Luther and from other enemies.</p>
      <p>Someone wrote to me from Wittenberg, who sent this book, that Melanchthon abhors Luther's writing and is very grieved that it was published. But who dares to oppose Luther, unless he wants to turn the world upside down or be exiled?</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all yours. Be strong and act manfully. May the Lord be present with his spirit and wisdom, with which you can easily resist all adversaries of the church of Christ. Greet Theodor in my name. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 5, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, G.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
