      <p>Greetings. If things are conducted in this way, brother, I doubt whom I can trust in the future. I see the times approaching, about which the Lord predicted would be very dangerous. Those who have given themselves to the most disgraceful court and have pledged their possessions and blood to the king, to say nothing more atrocious, will soon realize what they have intended; for the Lord lives in heaven. However, the fact that he is considered the primary author, about whom you write, almost kills me; but we are human, and cursed are those who make flesh their arm. He himself was here with me in Zurich the day before yesterday and, not without pain (whether he is sincere or not, the Lord knows), complained that his people, while he himself was performing the duties of the supreme judge in Baden, were induced to affix the seal to the French treaty, as if those favoring the French had observed his absence as the greatest and most convenient opportunity, as if things would have turned out differently in his presence. If, therefore, he is the author of the enslavement of his country and, moreover, feigned this with me, I do not know what can be safe; I commit the judgment to the Lord. Let us watch and pray in the meantime, that we do not fall into temptation. I wrote to Johann Valentin Fortm√ºller my advice, not to abandon the church, but to now act as a prudent shepherd; indeed, Isaiah was migrating from the city of Jerusalem, about to abandon the church, because Hezekiah, against the protests of the prophets, had made a treaty with the Egyptian king Tharacon, Isaiah 30, 31, etc. I am sending you these letters because I think they can be delivered more securely through you and with less suspicion; all of mine end up in the hands of D. Vadianus, and since I do not usually write to ministers, he would suspect, due to his cunning, that some mystery is hidden. Therefore, take care, my brother, that they receive these of mine promptly.</p>
      <p>The king has recruited in Baden to expel the poor peasants from the Confederation, especially the rebellious people of Constance; but he has achieved nothing, and the matter is directed towards a withdrawal; the king's men have been dismissed. When I learn more certain things, you will have them; I have no new news. Farewell forever with all yours. July 13, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, D. Ambrosius Blarer of Griesenberg, now residing there, his esteemed brother. Griesenberg.</p>
