    <p xml:id="regest1">Distrusts Chelius and suspects him of making mocking remarks in Solothurn about the intransigence of the Bernese. In the event of a conquest of Geneva, Freiburg, Murten, and other places could also be at risk. Asks Bullinger to get to the bottom of the rumors that the Five Places have offered the return of cannons and banners if Zurich does not continue to support Bern. Asks him to come to Bern. The messenger is only conditionally reliable.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt that you have received our response, dearest Heinrich, but I do not know how pleasing it will be to you. However, I hope that our spirits will never be at odds, as long as we understand each other correctly, both mutually and in person. In this matter, I find Chelius to be less fair; for in Solothurn, many suggest to the people that all cities have joined Luther, and only the Bernese donkeys and drones stubbornly persist in their opinion, which they cannot substantiate anywhere. But where do you think this murmur has arisen from, if not from him - otherwise pleasing to the French envoy, our scourge - having reported it? He did not mention the matter to me in words, but I fear he may be slandering us all to others, as he has been a Lutheran from the beginning. But what of these things, which are indeed useless and vain.</p>
      <p>I will write something else to you alone with the trust that you have long since believed not only in me but also in those whom you know have desired you entirely. I have been warned that in this storm of our affairs with the Genevans, if the plans of certain people succeed, Geneva may be occupied by the Savoyards or the bishop, and then Freiburg and Murten, our neighbors, may be miserably occupied with their alliance and assistance, driven away from religion and obedience, and other things which you can more easily conjecture than I can write. Therefore, you too have been approached by the Five Places either privately or with great silence, with the promise of the return of all cannons and banners, as long as you stay at home and the lion does not care at all for my bear. Then finally, some may achieve their desired plans, so that with you winking and sleeping, I am completely suppressed. To this, as I hear, you responded that you do not dare because of your field. Here I would like you to examine yourself in all your members, in whom you trust, whether such a thing has happened or what plans they are whispering everywhere, so that I can more cautiously provide for my affairs. For otherwise, as much as I can, I will seek peace and not involve myself, as I see even Geneva acting in such a way that all the burden and loss of all things and expenses are transferred to me, which you will understand from the assemblies. Therefore, I beseech you, dearest Heinrich, to respond in such a way that what you give is certain. If nothing is certain, add nothing certain, but that it was reported by others with the pen. Thus I am compelled to trouble you perpetually, since I trust you alone as best as I can. It would be a great joy for us if this were denied by the Five Places, also a most certain argument about their plan. Whatever you find written here in singular number, understand it through enallage or heterosis.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I do not doubt that you have received everything you desired from the prefect of Lenzburg. It will be yours, if you wish to see me, not long to live, to come to us. For I can neither come to Aarau on foot nor on horseback.</p>
      <p>The messenger is that former parish priest, now a craftsman with us, related to Megander, to whom, as far as this matter is concerned, you can trust in writing, but nothing from his mouth, except what has been common to all of us. However, with one word, you can reveal your plan, if you do not write to us sooner, as to who and what will come. For I do not see how we can better agree on everything in any other way.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest Heinrich, and never forget me in your prayers.</p>
      <p>February 9, in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
