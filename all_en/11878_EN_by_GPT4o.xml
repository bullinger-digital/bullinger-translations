    <p xml:id="regest1">Would not dare to disturb Bullinger if he were not convinced of his friendly disposition. His colleague Sebastian Grübel has a capable son [Sebastian the Younger], who is delivering this letter; Grübel would like him to study theology, but since he has more children, he can only achieve this goal with external help; his relative, the goldsmith [Gebhart] Brunner, gave him hope for a scholarship from the Zurich church, for the approval of which Bullinger should now work. The [Schaffhausen] mayor [Hans von Waldkirch or Hans Ziegler] mentioned that he reported to Bullinger about an alumnus [Joachim Pur (Agricola)?] who must be relegated from [Schaffhausen] to Zurich because he adheres to the Strasbourg view of the Lord's Supper; the alumnus wishes to be recommended to Bullinger, [Kaspar] Megander, or another church servant, in order to be able to live with one of them; Vogt asks Bullinger for admission [in Zurich]. Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander], Kaspar Megander, Rudolf Gwalther, and all other scholars; greetings from Sebastian [Grübel the Elder], Heinrich Linggi is not at home, otherwise he would have also sent greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>If your kindness towards everyone, especially towards fellow workers of the word, were not well known to me, most honorable man, I would not have dared to either interrupt your studies or address you on behalf of another, who is either equally or more loved by you than I am myself. But since I am well aware of your renowned humanity, I do not doubt that you will take my writings in good part and that you will gratify not me, but our entire church in this matter.</p>
      <p>Sebastian Grübel, my colleague, has a son, the bearer of this letter, a pious young man, well-educated, diligently devoted to his studies, and, as far as I can judge, of promising potential. He would gladly and willingly dedicate himself to studies and the church. But since learning at this time is costly and he already has more than enough children to support, he cannot reach his desired goal without the help of benefactors. Through Brunner, the goldsmith, his relative, he has managed to have some hope that the young man will be accepted into the scholarship of your church. You alone can promote this with the authority you wield in your church. I therefore earnestly ask that you have him recommended and promoted. For the young man has served under me in literary studies for some time, and not unsuccessfully, as far as I can judge, so much so that his father, persuaded by me, did not want to withdraw him from more honorable studies. He will perhaps be given some time to allow his literary progress to be judged. Then, I do not doubt, you will find that I have written the truth.</p>
      <p>If you hear us, you will render his father, along with us, most deeply indebted to you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, our mayor recently informed us that he mentioned to you about our church's alumnus being sent to you, so that he may finally learn to expel or digest the sacramental error poorly absorbed in Strasbourg through constant practice, lest he disturb our church, to which he is dedicated, with new doctrines, and so that he may devote more effort to sacred letters with you. He asks that he be recommended to you, or to Megander, or to another of the preachers of the word, so that he may obtain accommodation with one of you, along with sustenance, for the time he will be staying with you. Therefore, if it is to be for you or another of you as well as for the alumnus, you will have done us a particularly pleasing favor if you take him into your company. But if this is inconvenient for you, at least ensure that he can live with some learned person or a prudent and pious citizen.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name Theodor Bibliander, Kaspar Megander, Rudolf Gwalther, and all the learned men. Sebastian and the other brothers greet you. Linggi is no longer at home, otherwise he would have also sent his greetings. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
      <p>Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most beloved brother in Christ, the ecclesiastic of Zurich. Zürich.</p>
