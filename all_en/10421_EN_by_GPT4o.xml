    <p xml:id="regest1">Melander has rightly noted how relevant the First Epistle to the Corinthians is. The present-day Church suffers from the same evils as that of Corinth. Thus, the discord between Lutherans and Zwinglians can be compared to that between the followers of Cephas and Paul. Bullinger points out further parallels of specific grievances by listing the main topics of the letter in order. The most famous men have interpreted the letter, but their interpretations are no longer current in all respects for various reasons, so there are still things that require explanation. In doing so, Bullinger is grateful for the works of the ancients, whose results he intends to use at appropriate points.</p>

      <p>To Dionysius Melander, the most vigilant overseer of the church in Frankfurt, Heinrich Bullinger's preface to the First Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians.</p>
      <p>You have wisely requested from me, most learned Dionysius, an exposition of Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians, if only I had at my disposal the necessary resources for a commentator, as readily as I have the willingness to serve you and all students of sacred literature. Indeed, you have seen how relevant it is to our times. Our church is afflicted by the same diseases that the Corinthians experienced, for which the Apostle's strong remedies were effective, so that if we wish to consult for ourselves today, we will find the most effective remedies for our own vices. For we see today, which I report with the greatest sorrow, that the distinguished churches of Germany are divided among themselves, particularly because one is inflated by the name of this teacher, and another by that, and is driven into some insane hatred of the other, so that now the names of Lutherans and Zwinglians are no less celebrated and widespread among us than the factional names of Cephas and Paul were among the Corinthians. And just as among the Corinthians, so among us, we see many ministers of the word not seeking the things of Christ, peace, and the churches, but rather those of ambition, contention, and vain glory. Among these, some, swollen with wild arrogance, prefer themselves to all brothers and despise their fellow believers who excel in piety, learning, and spirit, as if they were some kind of umbrellas, or they deliberately - for I will not say with exquisite malice - dissent from those whom they know preach the same Christ as themselves. Worse than these are those who, moreover, despise the pure doctrine of the gospel because of its simplicity - as some did among the Corinthians - and boast of some spirit, to which they attribute a peculiar rhetoric beyond that recognized by common speech, a new mode of preaching, and even a new church, as if the gospel had not yet been preached by the true spirit today, nor any church gathered in the world until now. For such people, not even the Apostle, the vessel of election, preached the gospel, who in this epistle defends the simplicity of the gospel, praises the humble preaching of the cross of Christ, and mocks the lofty spiritual pretensions of these people. They themselves indeed spoke splendidly, grandly, and sweetly with remarkable skill and eloquence about spiritual philosophy and the kingdom of Christ, and with remarkable wit they raged against the Apostle Paul, but when it came to the intolerable and dire crimes of the Corinthians, where they should have been most vocal, they were, as they say, more silent than fish. Of this kind of teachers, you will also find countless today, who rail with importunate insults against innocent brothers, but are very favorable to usurers, oppressors of the poor, tyrants, bloodthirsty men, corrupters of the laws of equity and justice, and indeed to the most corrupt scoundrels in luxury and ambition. Now what the Apostle writes in this epistle about marriage, divorce, and unequal marriage, as well as about virginity against the perverse opinion of some, you would swear was written against the customs of our age - so similar are the opinions of some to those. And about idol sacrifices, that is, things sacrificed to idols, whether it was permissible for a Christian to eat them, there was great contention among the Corinthians, with some asserting this from the power of Christian liberty. But in our time, the question is about the idols themselves, which some defend under the same patronage of Christian liberty. Again, many errors or, if you prefer to call them abuses, had crept into the ecclesiastical assemblies of the Corinthians. For some behaved indecorously in the presence of the church. Others abused the most sacred Lord's Supper. There were those who were either excessively proud of their gifts or envious of the conspicuous gifts of God. There were those who abused tongues and speech to the detriment of prophecy. The same can be seen in our church. What is more, some today dispute about the glorified body in such a way that they almost cast doubt on the resurrection of bodies. Since our church suffers from the same diseases that the Corinthians experienced, and the remedy for the same disease is always the same, and this is described and applied in the present epistle, nothing could be more relevant or useful to our age than this. Here, however, I would have preferred to hear the exposition of someone more learned and experienced in sacred matters. But since no one comes forward, I, imitating the example of the poor widow of the gospel, bring two small coins into the treasury of the temple of God, yet in such a way that I do not despise or weaken by my retraction those richer and more instructive gifts of this kind, which men distinguished by antiquity, holiness of life, and rare learning have brought into the temple of the Lord before us. For there are indeed expositions of the most illustrious men on this epistle. However, those that are older are written in such a way that they cannot be entirely useful to us, either because they wrote for their own age or attacked the heresies of their own age or discussed otherwise plain matters more learnedly than can now be understood by the moderately learned. For no one who has even slightly engaged with ancient writers is unaware that most of the ancient theologians were inclined towards the Platonic school. But those who have written on this in our age have so pursued brevity that the more copious are desired by the mediocre, or they have played with digressions and commonplaces in such a way that they have meanwhile treated the context and the very words of Paul more negligently. I do not say this to peck out the eyes of crows, but to indicate that there is still something that can be treated after the labors of many. And indeed, I dare not promise anything about myself. I lack much, not to say everything, in learning and judgment. Meanwhile, I am very conscious of my faith and diligence. I see that ancient writers, after the labors of many most holy and learned men, have also, without injury to these, and indeed with no small praise from the good, repeatedly rolled the same stone, although not all nor always have given better things. But if I also disappoint your hope, most excellent Dionysius, in these commentaries, I deserve pardon, as I do not begrudge if others also after me present better things, provided they do not judge this intention of ours with any malice, but are grateful, just as I am grateful to my predecessors and do not blush to use their interpretations in their proper place.</p>
