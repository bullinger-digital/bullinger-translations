      <p>Greetings. The fact that you do not wish your mysteries, so to speak, to be such to me, I understand your spirit towards me. I rejoice as much as I cannot express. Then it pains me that there are so many terrors everywhere, but God will protect His own as He has done so far, and that is where all pain is removed.</p>
      <p>There are two things I am compelled to write about due to the lack of time, one concerning Erasmus, the other concerning my Platter.</p>
      <p>Erasmus' "Ecclesiastes," which has come to me secretly, not yet completed, contains among other things, after the commendation of the priesthood of the new testament, finally from the comparison of the priesthood of Aaron and his sons: "What great dignity befits the ministers of the new testament, who daily sacrifice that heavenly victim to be adored by angelic spirits, who handle with their hands the flesh of the spotless lamb?" It does not seem permissible that such a thing should be printed in a Christian city. Let me know your opinion.</p>
      <p>I wish to recommend to you the new printer Platter, so that if you can assist him in any way without offending Froschauer, do not hesitate. What you write is dear and indeed marketable. You can therefore promote the use of his services with your writings. I say this briefly, so as not to seem to distrust you. I hope there is something by which he can be helped.</p>
      <p>I return your belongings to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 24, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, foremost guardian of the word among the people of Zurich, especially dear to him.</p>
