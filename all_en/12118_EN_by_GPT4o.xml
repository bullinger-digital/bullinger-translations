    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer thanks for the two copies of Bullinger's [„Brevis ἀντιβολή“] against Cochläus, one of which he will entrust to Ottheinrich's soon-to-arrive messenger. - One day Bullinger will have to change his opinion about Luther. Luther is convinced that the [Confederates], including [Zwingli and Oekolampad], oppose the word of God; hence his vehement attack [in the „Kurtz bekentnis“]. - Bucer thanks Bullinger for leaving him to his conscience, but deeply regrets that the leaders of the churches cannot agree on the Lord's Supper, where they should strive solely for the honor of Christ. He himself is not a follower of Luther, but a worshiper of Christ. However, he thanks Christ for Luther, whose imperfections he tolerates. - In Wittenberg, Bucer did not at all retract the stance he showed towards the [Confederates]. Anyone who doubts this is not sufficiently grounded in Christ. Judgment should be left to God alone. Furthermore, it should be noted that every dispute harms the church. The people of Zurich should not believe those who incite them; if only they knew the church of Germany better! - Paul III. has reconvened the council. He has also severely criticized Charles V. for his decisions on religious matters at the imperial diets, as can be seen from the enclosed copies. - The gout keeps Charles V. in Flanders. Some fear that [Suleiman I.] will invade Hungary before the opening of the imperial diet (he is said to have long left Edirne); others fear that a peace negotiated with the Turks will result in the submission of the [Protestants] to the papacy. In a few days, it will be known what kind of marriage Francis I. [in regard to his son Charles II. of Orléans] has planned, and Bucer is grateful that he did not mention him in it. However, he regrets that Bullinger continues to defend Zwingli's posthumously published [„Christianae fidei... brevis et clara expositio“]. Are there not already enough causes for dispute? Through the dispute over the Lord's Supper, the devil endangers all of Germany, as he now hopes to split the Protestant camp thanks to the fear of the Turk. But this does not concern the [Confederates]! One should only write if it serves the church and not the love of dispute.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. You have easily obtained both from me, my dear Bullinger: that I gratefully read your book against Cochläus, which you sent me as a gift, and that I send the other to Prince Ottheinrich with letters; which I hope to do today or tomorrow. For I am expecting the messenger of this prince.</p>
      <p>You will change your opinion about Luther someday, when the Lord reveals the hidden things of darkness and the counsels of hearts. He is convinced that you obstinately oppose the word of God. He judges the same of the dead, whom he attacks. Hence, he inveighs against both you and them. May the Lord mitigate these scandals, which are recalled at the most inopportune time for the church.</p>
      <p>I thank you greatly for leaving me to my own conscience; do not doubt that it is approved by the Lord, who searches hearts and minds. That it is not possible to establish among such learned and leading teachers of the churches about the sacrament, which all should both take and understand, this is such a grave stumbling block that I rightly shudder to share in it. For who would believe that true Christians, who seek nothing of their own but only the glory of Christ, who wish to persist in prayers and to hear and teach each other in true charity, cannot finally come to one opinion about this so popular mystery after so many years of disputation? Indeed, I adore all things of Christ, not of Luther; of whom (Christ) I have discovered so many things in Luther, for these I bear with him for the sake of Christ and his church, and those which I cannot attribute to Christ in him.</p>
      <p>I did not retract anything in Wittenberg; but what I professed with you. Whoever is greatly moved by such words must not yet be greatly hardened by the cross of Christ. May the Lord grant us to live wholly for him, and to judge soberly about brothers, whose hearts we cannot see, and to engage in the cause of religion with fear and trembling. No fight among the saints can be harmless to the church. Many incite you to renew the battle; if you knew them, you would wish to gratify no men less. If only you knew the churches and their ministers throughout Germany a little more certainly and did not judge the churches from the letters of a few! But what my conscience suggested, I have sufficiently explained to you; it remains that I pray the Lord to kindly guide you in all things and to turn your efforts to the true benefit of his church and to make you, rescued from all evils, blessed in all things.</p>
      <p>The Council of Trent has been reconvened by Paul III., and he has severely rebuked Emperor Charles for wanting to deal with religion in these diets; I send you copies of both writings. The Emperor is detained by gout in Flanders. The diets have not yet begun. Many fear that the Turks will be in Hungary before the princes are present in Worms; for they say that the Emperor of the Turks has long since left Edirne. Others fear that, with a truce made with the Turks, they will try to bring us back under the yoke of the pope. The former fear seems more certain. In a few days, the attempts of the monarchs will reveal themselves; for yesterday was the day on which the Emperor should decide about the marriage with the French.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant us to depend wholly on him, and nothing will fall to our harm. In this, fare well with all your colleagues. Amen.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, January 21, 1545. Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>In the book you gave, I venerate many gifts of God and am grateful that you made no mention of me, even where there seemed to be an occasion. But I wish you would not undertake to defend Zwingli's posthumous booklet everywhere! What is the use of urging things that not only do not benefit the churches but greatly harm them? Is there not already more than enough fighting? And what is in that booklet that has not been treated in others very often? But the Lord, who bought his church at a great price, will see to it; my anxiety accomplishes nothing. The sifting of us by Satan is permitted, and it must be extorted from him (Satan) by prayers and repentance.</p>
      <p>Indeed, a great evil threatens all of Germany from this revived dissension by Satan. For he thinks he has now found the opportunity he has long sought, to introduce a new political schism, to which the Turkish fear contributes not a little, and that against this common enemy of Germany and religion you contribute nothing. Therefore, it would be very useful to undertake as few contentions as possible now, and to allow the pen only for purging the churches.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
