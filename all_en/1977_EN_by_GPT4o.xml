      <p> Most illustrious man, I see that it is not so much my fault as it is your kindness and generosity that has caused me to write to you with greater interest than the laws allow. Demosthenes sets the interest at one hundredth, which our legal authorities have followed. But I truly gain not only in number but also in weight more than a hundredth part. For I write very briefly and with few words; you respond more extensively and always with added encouragement, so that I can no longer offer any reason why, if I wish to avoid the penalties of the laws, I must henceforth consider how I might either repay you equally or, since I cannot do that, show myself grateful in whatever matters are possible. Certainly, neither you nor anyone else whom I have held in the same regard will ever desire this last part. You indeed act well and piously, who not only relate these tragic events of our age to those most bitter times, about which is written in the books of Kings and Chronicles, but also draw consolation from that true source. So many things happen today beyond hope, the plans of the powerful are so intricate and uncertain, that little can be achieved by human prudence. Now life is plainly governed by fortune, not wisdom, as he said. The monstrous causes of this inconstancy are desires, which allow none of those whom they ensnare to have any consideration. One pretexts liberty, another religion, a third something else; thus the play is performed with that theme and is led to a catastrophe mournful to all good people. But I, my Bullinger, lest I seem to have spoken too eagerly against the Emperor out of partisanship, write about the most atrocious matters as gently as possible. But I have learned, and unless God averts it, the outcome will soon prove, that the Emperor will attempt by open force, that is by slaughter, arson, and factions, to achieve in Germany what he wished to accomplish by many convolutions of plans and actions always suspended in uncertainty. </p>
      <p> Here ambition drives him, there the desire for revenge, and the more slowly he sees himself reaching that hereditary kingdom, the more he is inflamed. But if man by nature is in himself (as Plato said) immutable, why should we not hope that all these things will come to nothing in a moment when God finally looks upon his own? </p>
      <p> I see now that the letter has grown beyond what is just and that I, lifted by just grief, am not writing a letter but a tragedy, and that with words fit for the stage. Our fleet has set course for Corsica; for with the supreme pontiff or perhaps some others intervening, it seemed not right to pursue the Duke of Florence further in war. The Turkish fleet only ensures that ours can sail safely. Never (believe me) will we be so blind that, taught by the example of the Greeks and all of Asia, we do not know to what extent anyone should be trusted. Farewell. Chur, the day before the calends of September. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes, Bishop of Bayonne. </p>
      <p> To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich, dearest friend. </p>
      <p> In Zürich. </p>
