      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, esteemed brother and colleague. Greetings. It would have been enough, most honorable man and sincerely esteemed brother, to testify in one word that Lelio now rests with a calm mind in the same faith we profess, so that I would receive him kindly, all offenses having been abolished: indeed, your recommendation also had the effect that I was ready to generously provide whatever services he might have desired. The letters, of which you sent a copy, have unfortunately fallen into the hands of traitors who seek to gain empty triumphs from our dissensions. The argument that, whenever it is discussed, irritates our minds back and forth, I intended not to touch upon in the future. I see that all assemblies are odious to you.</p>
      <p>Yet, in my judgment, this was the only remedy for the evils that offend you so greatly. For if the princes had hoped that we would be inclined to a friendly meeting, they would certainly never have allowed us to be condemned, or for anything more severe to be decided about us.</p>
      <p>Now, because either by your silence or by indirect refusal the hope of reconciliation was taken away, Philipp and those who favored us along with him, being of small spirit, easily yielded to the stubbornness of others. However, I wish it had pleased you, when the hand was kindly extended, to come closer.</p>
      <p>For what you except, that this is not in your power but depends on the consent of your most honorable council, I do not see where it tends: unless to deny that you are the open authors of the rejection. For I am convinced that if the matter were dear to you, there would be no delay in the magistrate.</p>
      <p>I see that the main obstacle for you is that it has been decreed by the most moderate of the opposing party not to depart even a little from the Augsburg Confession. This, they say to the papists, just as they would allow us to say, if a common confession had been issued by us. Add that, bound to this formula from the beginning, whether they want to or not, they are forced to stand firm there. Meanwhile, they do not call us to them on the condition that we are compelled to subscribe to their doctrines.</p>
      <p>Indeed, if you observe more attentively, they open the way to inquiry, as if they were already inclined to some moderation. Certainly, as Philipp's leniency is known to all, so being aware of it, he would greatly desire to have allies in some legitimate assembly. I remember what I experienced long ago, and today I suspect nothing has harmed more than seeing the hope of the conference, on which he had relied, dissipate. If you think I am not moved by that unjust prejudice, by which they treated us inhumanely, you are greatly mistaken, and they know from my letters, in which I complained freely as the matter required, how gravely offended I was. But it is also our duty to consider whether part of the blame resides with us, who withdrew the support that our friends sought, out of some unknown disdain. What you urge, that we steadfastly foster the union among us, I gladly accept.</p>
      <p>Nor is there any danger from me that it will ever be dissolved. If it should happen that we are called to some conference, as I have already professed to you, so today I do not conceal that I will come: not with the intent of seeking new friendships to slip away from you, but to reconcile those who dissent from us, if it can be done. And indeed, I do not consider myself bound by any law, if others avoid it, that I should not come where my conscience leads me. Whatever journey I undertake, it will not only be my care to admit nothing unworthy of my faith, but also to uphold the agreement that should prevail among us with the sacred constancy it deserves. Although perhaps I foolishly imagine these things with all hope of the conference broken off.</p>
      <p>I simply wanted to profess that I am not so forgetful of my freedom as to comply with plans by which I see or at least believe a good cause is being ruined. I am not frightened by threats, since nothing should be more pleasing than to leave this world as quickly as possible, let alone to leave the station of this city. If you do not understand what I mean, consider better where the things you have been discussing so far are tending.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, the matter itself will show that I was unjustly suspected by you, if I seem to have spoken more harshly than was proper. Be assured of this, that I have unburdened the pains that oppressed me as if into a brother's bosom.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most honorable man, and my esteemed brother, with the other colleagues, to whom I wish much health. May the Lord be with you all, guide and protect you.</p>
      <p>My colleagues greet you.</p>
      <p>Geneva, May 22, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
