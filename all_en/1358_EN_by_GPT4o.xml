      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received the three field hens along with the p ellelein (a type of small bird), which you sent us out of good will through Zoügern, and we thank you very graciously for them. They have come to us at a good time; for two from St. Gallen, your brother-in-law, visited us during the Badenfahrt (a festival), with whom we, along with him, wish to enjoy them with joy (God willing). The little books that we sent to you have also been returned to us. We do not wish to hide our good intentions from you. Dated Urdorf, the 30th of July, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of W[ürttemberg] etc.</p>
      <p>Today it was written to us that the Emperor is still in Augsburg; one hears of no departure, his movements are said to be kept more secret than ever.</p>
      <p>Magdeburg is seriously on Charles' mind; we hear about it daily.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
