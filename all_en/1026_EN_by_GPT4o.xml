      <p>Most illustrious man; I have finally returned to the church which the Lord has entrusted to me. I found my sons, whom I had nurtured with the milk of the gospel, safe and sound, as well as all the brothers, and now, having found a very suitable messenger, I will inform you of all my private and public affairs that I know.</p>
      <p>From here, I will begin with the most important: the one who was sick in Bergamo has recovered and returned to me, although still very weak in health. Therefore, I give thanks to my God, who did not want to deprive me of this man, who is more dear and useful to me than can be expressed.</p>
      <p>I escaped a great danger in the Alps; for, what I would never have suspected at this time of year, I found the highest snows, which almost buried me. I have had both of your booklets copied, which I translated, and I still hope that I can winter with you.</p>
      <p>The Pope has prepared a persecution against the members of Christ, such as Italy has not yet felt, nor, I think, any province. He has given this province to the dogs of demons, who act according to their own lusts, even without consulting or against the will of the bishops.</p>
      <p>In such great license, no one can easily say how much they rage and go mad.</p>
      <p>First, they preach and invite the brothers with certain rewards offered to secret denial (those rascals call it retraction and repentance) and indeed seduce some of the weaker ones with that cunning; soon they rage against those whom they see to be steadfast, defame them, drag them to prisons, confiscate their goods, force them into exile, and send them to the galleys. But I tell and complain of small things; for they present even more atrocious spectacles to the people; for they use the work of executioners and take away life. Ten days ago, one of the brothers in the city of Piacenza was hanged; he departed to the Lord with such great constancy, faith, and joy that I think greater fruits have resulted from his martyrdom than could have from many sermons or books of the best brothers. In the whole span of 30 years, scarcely one or two had been executed in all of Italy for the gospel, and the princes seemed somewhat mitigated from madness and fury; now, inflamed by Julius III, as you hear, they rage most cruelly.</p>
      <p>But hear about the demon dogs preaching and about the Pope, which is worth knowing for you. They openly boast in many cities in sermons that a council is soon to be celebrated, but they expressly declare that no one will be admitted to it who is not entirely united with the doctrine and faith of the papists; then they add: "For the Lutherans will be entirely rejected, unless perhaps they say they want to come to the council to ask for forgiveness." This, I say, they affirm everywhere in Italy, which I certainly know, nor are they ashamed in the meantime to promise magnificently in the Diet of Augsburg and to some princes that they want everyone to be able to attend the council; but you know in what sense they use this word 'attend'; for I have revealed the whole matter to many churches, especially yours. Many brothers have recently fled from Italy to various regions, eight to me up to this day, and I still expect others shortly.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if I delay my return to you longer, this reason will detain me.</p>
      <p>For it is very important that someone be in these neighboring places to gather, support, and console the wretched, exiled brothers. I confess that my life is in danger while I am here, especially while I suspect the Pope's enemies, and I have heard many things that the Antichrist has recently said about me; but I do not want to fail in the duty of a Christian man and to the brothers, even if I must die a thousand times. Cardinal Sfondrati of Cremona died in the very heat of the persecution he had prepared against that church; he was not only the bishop of that city but one of the three general inquisitors. He was immediately succeeded (lest the republic suffer any harm) by Cardinal Carpi, a man of noble birth, wealth, and authority among those devils.</p>
      <p>The Pope indulges himself, so that in that kind of thing he surpasses Leo X, and every day he shows himself more intent on the most vain cares, not only more cruel and wicked, as all who write to us about him confirm. Recently, from a certain monastery of regular canons, which is in Cremona, five monks fled in one day, three of whom came to me. The Pope learned both of their flight and that they were received by me; therefore, he threatened the generals, abbots, and priors unless they guard the rest with the utmost diligence, and he has arranged guards to patrol these borders of Italy and to capture, if they can suspect anyone wanting to come here to the Rhaetians. In short: that true devil does everything he can to destroy the members of Christ and Christ himself, if he can; but may the Lord destroy him with all his members. Amen.</p>
      <p>What was spread about the arrival of the Emperor in Italy has now completely vanished. Certainly, there is no preparation in Milan; many think he will winter in Germany.</p>
      <p>In Italy, especially in those cities subject to the dominion of the Venetians, and even in the city of Venice itself, there is a struggle with a shortage of grain, and they expect worse. The Lord is indeed warning them not to persecute themselves; but they are not yet aroused nor do they repent.</p>
      <p>What I wrote to Mr. Pellicanus and Gwalter about a certain defamer is very true. You will later know both the author of those letters and the one who spreads rumors through Rhaetia. If it seems good, remedy this evil, namely with those letters I requested, written to our synod, although I am not anxious, as I have the testimony of my conscience, which consoles me.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Mr. Zwingli and Lavater, your sons-in-law, and Mr. Otto and Mr. Wolf, whom I greatly love for their piety and learning. Briefly greet all the brothers and the whole church with my words; pray for me and for those wretched brothers and members of Christ who live under the tyranny of the Pope and the devil and suffer such cruel persecutions. Oh, how their cause and affliction grieve me, oh, how they would move you and all the pious if you could see them with your eyes fleeing from the cruelty of the popes, torn, scarcely breathing. The Lord has given me in these matters a harvest and material for exercising charity, and because the situation at home is narrow and I can help little, I hope in Him who led me out of Egypt; He is able to increase the means to help the brothers and His cause, not, I say, for any of my own benefit. Farewell, sincere man and excellent minister of Christ. May the Lord keep you from evil. Amen.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, September 17, 1550.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
