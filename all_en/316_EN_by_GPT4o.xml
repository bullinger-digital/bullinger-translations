      <p>Greetings. Today, a few hours ago, I wrote to you through my own messenger. I forgot to mention that I have not written anything about Calvin's propositions, which were illustrated with your annotations. They have been returned to me. I sent a bundle of letters to Geneva through Mr. Beat Count, who sends many greetings to you and Gwalther. All the brothers have read the propositions as Gwalther transcribed them, and I am now having them copied for myself by a boy, who has not yet finished; otherwise, I would have sent them back with this messenger, but I will return them with the next one.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. Mr. Jodocus, Eberardus, Textor, and Nicolaus, who returned home yesterday, send their greetings to you. What you write about Sebastian Guldibecius, I will discuss with the school authorities and will also try to approach him privately; he is a man practiced in languages, yet, as you know, too unrefined; but these things must be endured as far as they cannot be changed. Johannes Ferus also seeks this position, who has led the school in Schaffhausen for many years, but now acts as a pastor in our region; I do not know if he is known to you, he lived in Basel for a long time on Erasmus's stipend. I saw him in Augsburg, and he is known to me, although I also have some reservations about him. Hospinianus, who is in Bruges, is a good man, but a negligent executor of school discipline and not practiced in grammar; he reads many distinguished authors, yet without grammatical practice, which is very harmful to the boys. About that Hospinianus, who teaches in Basel, you write correctly; he also seems such to me. That Xystus should be called, I will hardly achieve; you can understand the reasons yourself. One must be chosen from all; may the best be chosen.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. October 24th.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller</p>
      <p>To the most faithful servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his uniquely esteemed lord and compatriot. Zurich.</p>
