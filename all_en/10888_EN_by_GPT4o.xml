      <p>The grace of God first and my willing service.</p>
      <p>Honorable, well-learned, dear Master Heinrich, I have written to you on behalf of my son-in-law Walder, as you know, that he was in the monastery in Zurich, and like others, he has not yet received anything, but he has always been promised, as I also hope he has done, that if he conducts himself honorably and well, he will be rewarded; however, he has not yet received a definitive answer. Now my lords have again sent a recommendation to a council in Zurich, hoping for a better response than before. I have also written to my dear lord and friend, Herr Rudolf Lavater. I ask you to help with him to do the best, so that a good answer may result. I believe that I would well deserve it for a city like Zurich and its people.</p>
      <p>Dear sir, I have just learned from my old lord of Wettingen that the aforementioned Lavater has been elected to the council; this has greatly delighted me, not only because I wish him well in honor, but also because I hope to God that he will achieve much good in God's and temporal matters in the council, and that I and other good friends will have a trusted man to write to from time to time about what necessity and other matters of God and otherwise require. I hereby wish him a long life, support, and increase of divine grace, so that he may faithfully apply the same talent to our Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>As for other news and how things stand with us, I think the aforementioned my lord of Wettingen will report the same to you well.</p>
      <p>We want to encourage the much-mentioned Lavater to write often; I will do so as well. And hereby we commend ourselves to God the Lord.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, the 18th of June, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Jacob Meyer.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of the church in Zurich, my dear and good friend.</p>
