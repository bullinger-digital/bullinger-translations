      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I owe you great thanks, my father, for adding this to your other benefits towards me, by which you recently favored those whom I had recommended to you. Your warning about the confession, fearing that it might sometimes inconvenience the common cause, has made me think about preparing a response, should anything of the sort happen, which I do not think will; for I seem, however it may be, to have laid such foundations that, once laid, whatever they wish to establish must necessarily collapse. But about these things, I hope to discuss them at another time, if the occasion arises.</p>
      <p>I am returning to you the writing of Staphylus, in which I wish there were more falsehoods than there are. The same person has written another book, as I hear, where he calls himself the advisor of the Emperor.</p>
      <p>In that book, it is said (for I have not seen the book), he recounts many things which we here are compelled to see and hear daily, to the great disgrace of the church. Yet these things seem to have no effect on the principal authors of these offenses.</p>
      <p>And do you wonder that we are taking the ultimate counsel? Believe me, my father, we have tried everything, endured everything; the Lord knows this, to whom we do not hesitate to appeal, if that ruin should occur, which now seems to be impending. May the Lord suggest timely remedies in these extreme evils.</p>
      <p>He indeed, I hope, will so strengthen us that, whatever happens, we may be able to prove our diligence and faith before God and men, so that the blood of those who are to perish cannot be required of us. Farewell, my esteemed father.</p>
      <p>I ask you to greet D. Martyr, D. Walter, and the other dearest fathers and brothers in my name and to remind them to remember us. All of ours greet you in return.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, May 25.</p>
      <p>Theodor Beza, your most devoted son in the Lord.</p>
      <p>You will receive from our Laelius a certain writing, to which Peter Toussaint of Montbéliard and all his colleagues have subscribed; I exclude those who, more or less three years ago, were expelled without cause and happily built the Waldensian churches, as well as those who were driven out a month ago. I wish you knew the man well, I mean the one who does everything there at his own discretion.</p>
      <p>It is indeed certain that those who were appointed in place of the first four brothers who were expelled were expressly ordered to abjure the doctrines of Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and Calvin.</p>
      <p>If good Toussaint dares to deny this, you will easily be able to refute the man's impudence. I pity the excellent and most kind prince, whom they so easily deceive.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed father, the truly faithful pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
