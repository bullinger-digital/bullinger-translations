      <p>S. D. Truly, my venerable and most learned Bullinger, there was no reason for you to ask me so much here, lest I bear your prolonged silence with difficulty, as I am not unaware of how you are constantly occupied with holy matters. I would be very upset if, because of me, unless something significant happens, anyone else is deprived of your Christian work. Now I am very grateful to you for responding, even if late, and especially for promising to remember the young man Lazarus, who is of good character and hopeful promise. I would urge you again to do this, if your faith and your zeal in helping the poor were not already well known to me, so that you need not be reminded of these matters repeatedly. Together with some other good men, I will contribute to a common fund, from which the boy can be frugally educated for a while, until he is admitted to the lowest rank of poor students, in which our Theodore also assists us excellently, who will also, if necessary, whisper in your ear at the right opportunity, so that I cannot help but have good hope for Lazarus.</p>
      <p>Petrus Sch√§rus, my relative, writes that he will soon be with us, setting out from here to Zurich, to find some consolation in us through mutual faith, both his and ours, and may Christ make his journey fortunate with angelic companions. My brother, my own sibling, was with me these days, and he affirms that he did not notice what you wrote about your rustic departure, that you left without saying goodbye, fearing rather that he himself might have inadvertently done something rustic and inappropriate. He instructed me to greet you reverently and dutifully in his words and to commend you to your holy prayers.</p>
      <p>There are said to be strange practices present concerning Thurgau; the king is said to soon desire to resolve it, etc.</p>
      <p>The commander in Constance has been relocated. It is certain that many flags are being made in Constance, some black and yellow, some red and white; I have this from people who have seen it; what it means that it is being done in that place, etc.</p>
      <p>It is still not believed that the emperor will personally conduct the diet, and there are such varied reports from Augsburg that I cannot express enough wonder and cannot report anything about it; they say the whole world is full of treachery.</p>
      <p>The emperor is said to have arranged a great practice in Venice, of which people have become aware over time, and some have been captured because of it.</p>
      <p>[Received] from Johannes Ulmius from England are letters to my dearest sister Griessenberg, which he wrote last March, in which, among other things, he earnestly asks his sister to ensure through me that the greatest thanks are given to you, because he feels that prince, his patron, is so favorable and generous due to your influence, who, when he learned from your letters sent to him, Ulmius, that the book to be dedicated to him would soon be completed, immediately counted 26 English crowns in the name of the gospel with remarkable kindness, meanwhile also encouraging much greater hopes, from which you can easily gather what you should expect from that principal generosity. You should know that I have already acted in good faith on your behalf in this matter, as Ulmius so earnestly requested, and make sure that he understands that this has been done by me at some point.</p>
      <p>Greet your most chaste wife with the utmost diligence on behalf of myself and all of mine, and commend us to Christ in a Christian manner, whom we also implore with common and divinely zealous prayers for his church, now in extreme peril, that he may look upon it with the eyes of his mercy and avert these evils, by which it is more and more oppressed and almost crushed, so that it seems it will never emerge, as soon as possible. Farewell and love me constantly, as you do. June 19.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable friend and brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
