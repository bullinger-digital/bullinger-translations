      <p>Reverend, honorable, highly and well-educated, honorable, pious, kind, especially dear gentlemen, my humble, poor (modest), willing service is always ready for you. Reverend, honorable, gracious gentlemen, you undoubtedly know well how I, a poor servant of God's word, have been expelled from my gracious lords, the mayor and council of the praiseworthy and evangelical city of Z端rich, due to my unskilled life and conduct, and have been residing for the fifth year in evangelical teaching and life in the principality of W端rttemberg. I have been deemed entirely unsuitable, despised, and underestimated by some brothers, and partly considered unworthy of my services and position, which has often hindered me, as I have been dismissed and expelled by a city and entire synod. However, so that I may more freely proclaim God's word and lead my life securely in my teaching and the holy gospel, and maintain myself among the evangelicals without disgrace and reproach, my heartfelt, earnest (urgent) request to the common, Christian-assembled synod and to each one individually is that you may graciously and brotherly recognize (accept), forgive, favor, and receive me, a poor servant, for God's sake, and also make a common intercession to the mayor and council, so that the city and country may graciously open to me as to a stranger and traveling guest. For I desire no parish, service, or shelter to stay, only free access, as befits and is due to a stranger. If I may deserve this from you all, I will always be found diligent in your services. May the almighty, good, merciful God keep you powerfully with His spirit by His word always.</p>
      <p>Given from the city of Hettingen on the Alb, Saturday after St. Gall's Day, in the year 1539.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom's willing, obedient servant, Kaspar Frantz.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, highly and well-educated, honorable gentlemen, the common synod of the praiseworthy city of Z端rich, my gracious lords.</p>
