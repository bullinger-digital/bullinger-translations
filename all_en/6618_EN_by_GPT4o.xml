      <p>The grace of the Son of God be with you. Do not be surprised, most learned Bullinger, at my prolonged silence, nor should I say that I have not informed you whether the one whom you, my lord, recommended in your letters could succeed Vogler upon his departure. But our Vertumnus, breathing hot and cold from one mouth, has delayed the response, and Vogler will not resign his office, even though he says he will prepare to leave in the autumn. Today I was going to write to you again, my lord; but from the enclosed note, you will understand the matter; thus, he is pleased with the small profit, etc. Our little church is slowly progressing.</p>
      <p>In Richenweiler (Riquewihr), there is a great loss to the church everywhere. I suppose you have read the responses of the Palatines to Farczbach (as they call it). Stentor does not cease to shout from the rostrum until he is hoarse; but the majority of the people of Strasbourg are nauseated by his slanders. The magistrate, acting cautiously, fears that the crowd may be stirred up.</p>
      <p>A meeting of the princes is to be held in January; what they will decide, time will tell. There is great hope that Sélestat, Colmar, and the remaining ten cities, which are pledged to the House of Austria, will receive Christ.</p>
      <p>In Haguenau, which is the primary city, they have replaced the priests with a preacher, and Obernai and Colmar have followed suit, with the entire senate conspiring for Christ, except for one or two. We pray earnestly that the kingdom of Christ may be propagated.</p>
      <p>And you also pray for us.</p>
      <p>In haste, on the day of salt [...] in the year of the birth of Christ 1565. Yours, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, theologian and most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his brother.</p>
