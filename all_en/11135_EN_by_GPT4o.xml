    <p xml:id="regest1">Spoke to the pharmacist regarding the son [of Christoph Klauser]; the teacher considers the boy to be clumsy, but nevertheless anticipates a successful completion of his apprenticeship. Capito reminds Bullinger of his leading role in the Swiss Confederation and urges him, in light of Luther's response [to the Swiss], to align teaching and church leadership with [the First Helvetic Confession]; this will strengthen concord but also fortify the church, which is too dependent on the authorities. Requests to encourage moderation with Erasmus [Ritter], as the people of Strasbourg do with [Sebastian Meyer]; instead of arguing, one should bring the Crucified closer to the people, as neglecting pastoral duties especially risks leading the youth into unbelief. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I showed your letters to the pharmacist, with whom the son [of Christoph Klauser] secretly deals, adding threats from our magistrate who wishes to gratify you in Zurich. At first, he was astonished and tried to prove his diligence to me in many ways, but he said the boy is not very sharp and does not have the ability and practice to write down only those things that occur daily in the workshop. And to prove this, he indicated what he had perhaps noted in the daily ledger. Furthermore, he said that the boy had learned something from him, which would be greatly beneficial to him, and he hopes that after these two years, he will be able to provide a commendable example of his skill. The other one he has is indeed more skilled, but excels in years and experience and thus by nature itself, etc. Meanwhile, I called again; he replied that the boy is quite industrious and progressing nicely.</p>
      <p>My dear Bullinger, you see the position you are in and the great burdens you alone bear there; for Switzerland rightly looks to you, whose leadership it follows.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since Luther has responded suitably, ensure that the method of teaching and governing the church is tempered among your people according to the Basel articles, and not only will concord be established, but also the church will be constituted, which otherwise, being vague and uncertain, is perishing and collapsing in our hands, as we see.</p>
      <p>For it relies not so much on the authority of the ministry, which you do not yet have, as on the strength of the secular magistrate, who rather cares for those things that are of the world.</p>
      <p>Restrain, if you can, the ferocity of Erasmus; we here, believe me, do not cease to put a bridle on our cold old man, who, like melancholics, is said to be more tenacious of indignation once conceived. What is the point of quarreling perpetually; the people neither understand nor care about these things. Rather, let us strive to instill Christ and him crucified as the only savior, for which the word of preaching and the sacraments are effective, and in which the desired ecclesiastical discipline contains the fickle populace in many churches, which, if left to itself, falls into the doctrines of the Epicureans, so that it ultimately believes nothing. Especially the youth, if it is permitted to speak the truth, in our churches, with religion dissolved, rushes into all wickedness. What hope, therefore, is there for the future church after us, when its hope perishes in the grass, with the youth lost in this manner? Not even a syllable is demanded beyond the word of the Lord. Would that we in our church could somewhat fulfill what pertains to the office of a pastor! We indeed teach quite diligently from the pulpit and meanwhile discuss church matters with a few. But who among the common people cares? They are neglected to a man, unless they are publicly admonished to study religion. There is indeed a very rare one among us who seeks the lost sheep, which thing troubles my mind. Nor do I hope for anything other than that in the Lord's chastisement, with diligence, his grace will be restored to us. Therefore, you too, my brother, help us with your prayers.</p>
      <p>Bucer greets you, who is pressed by a similar concern. You should bid Leo Jud to be well in the name of both of us. His nephew is in good health. Sturm, the professor, has been beautifully restored to health. You will greet Bibliander and Pellican.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, the day before the Ides of January, in the year 1538. Wolfgang Capito.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, friend and brother to be revered in the Lord.</p>
