      <p>Greetings. I received the letter you sent me on the 23rd of December last, most esteemed sir; I also read the attached note. I recognize from it your more than dutiful spirit towards me, which I cannot equally reciprocate. As for the narrative itself, it is surprising how that nobleman from Stetten could remain so hidden in the camp after committing such a crime. There are nobles from Stetten in Franconia and Swabia. My grandfather Michael had two wives, the first being a Scheittlerin from St. Gallen, with whom he had no children; my great-grandfather Johannes moved from Franconia to Augsburg... and the elder's name was Johannes. I received this information from some of my pious ancestors, who were curious about such genealogies. It is a perpetual custom that those who once ruled are overthrown, and those who were once lowly are exalted, which the nations attributed to fortune and their gods, but we recognize as happening by divine providence, although we sometimes do not know the reasons. We know that the faithful, in whatever state they may be, enjoy the favor of God, which alone suffices for them.</p>
      <p>You judge rightly about the nature of the English. Indeed, God has placed that queen as a most illustrious miracle, whether you consider her prudence, fortitude, excellence in managing affairs, or her piety and learning. Regarding the pretext of the Turkish war, I hold the same opinion as you; but I think nothing will be accomplished, indeed the universal ruin of the papacy is at hand, as almost infinite precursors of that supreme day arrive, proclaiming it to be at the door. Therefore, both the reckoning of time and the present state of affairs show that marvelous and notable, indeed sudden, changes are happening everywhere in the world. You have attached here a note from which you will understand what is considered certain among us. I am sorry to hear that you are suffering from a head ailment.</p>
      <p>However, I pray to the Lord that He may soon grant you better health. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg on the 16th of January in the year 72.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, pious, and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
