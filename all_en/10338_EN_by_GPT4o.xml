    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's letters always encourage him. He wishes he could benefit more from Bullinger's advice on shaping his further education, but he is held back from studying by various duties. He hopes for relief and support from the returning Simon Sulzer, who has had a good education. Mayor Hans Jakob von Wattenwyl has returned from France, where he negotiated the continued validity of the "Eternal Peace." In Glarus, there is said to be an uprising of the Reformers against the Catholics; Bern is sending envoys there. A Bernese delegation negotiated in Solothurn in vain about the eight exiles and religious freedom. Bern warned Solothurn against encroachments in the countryside; Solothurn then sent envoys to Lucerne. A Solothurn delegation is in Bern; Bern does not want to treat the matter of the exiles separately from the evangelical cause and will bring the whole issue before the Diet. A Basel delegation is in Bern. Christian Dan Matter wrote to Bullinger. Froschauer is to send Haller further parts of Pellican's commentary. Urges the early publication of Bullinger's commentary on the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>How much my spirit is continually refreshed by your letters, filled with both learning and piety, dearest Heinrich, I have no doubt you have long understood from me. You have satisfied me with your advice on how to manage my studies. If only I could satisfy my own progress with the sound advice you provide. Certainly, my spirit is not lacking in the pursuit of letters, nor has it ever been, but there are so many things that pull me back, distract, invert, and pervert, that I have despaired in many ways. But you give me hope and make my spirit more animated, so that I dare not complain any further, especially now that we have received from Basel a young man of great talent and excellent promise, a Bernese, who had until now served as the head of the college, as they call it, in Basel. He has a position equal in every way to Rellicanus, is learned in Greek, and has tasted Hebrew, so that he can contribute. He will now lecture on Aristotle's Greek rhetoric, as well as Latin dialectics, for the youth, of course. I make use of his familiarity in such a way that he will deny me nothing. Indeed, through my intercession with the senate, he has advanced in three years to the amazement of all who hear him. While his father was alive, he learned Latin grammar from Glareanus, but after his father's death, he became a barber and abandoned his studies for eight years. Now, however, he has progressed so successfully, even at the expense of our senate, in Strasbourg with Bedrottus and in Basel with Grynaeus. I urge him to teach Greek.</p>
      <p>Then, concerning current events: Our consul has returned from France, sent by the king with respect, with a happy and grateful response. What that is and why he was sent there, you will know later. We do not seek help from the king of the Assyrians, but whether the peace established many years ago will be maintained and by whom.</p>
      <p>Rumor has spread among us that in Glarus, the papists have been driven out by an uprising of the pious. A messenger from Fribourg passed through our city, completely unaware of this tragedy. Nevertheless, two wise men, well known to you, are being sent there.</p>
      <p>But what should I write in the meantime about the people of Solothurn? We sent four envoys to discuss and settle the cause of the eight exiles and the word of God, as they had promised in good faith to do before all the Swiss envoys, I say, the people of Solothurn. But our people could not achieve this. For when it came to the free preaching of the word of God, they rashly asserted that they would not listen to a word. Our people returned home with the matter unresolved. In the meantime, we were warned that the people of Solothurn, with an armed hand, would introduce the priest and the mass on December 14th into the village near the town, which is under the authority of Bern, and they themselves, the people of Solothurn, judging and punishing our faith as a criminal matter. Hence, two were sent from the city, and in the field, two hundred or fewer or more were subordinated, who would resist their attempt with arms if it could not be otherwise. However, they were first warned by our senate not to do so; they were also previously offered a legal settlement. As soon as the people of Solothurn learned of this in the town, they immediately called a meeting and sent an envoy to Lucerne. What response he brought back, I do not know, but I know this one thing: on December 18th, four envoys from Solothurn appeared before the senate with the most flattering words, who previously disdained to see and hear us, and they presented themselves as willing to resolve the cause of the exiles. But they made no mention of the word of God. Our people, having called a meeting, responded to them that they would not do anything for the exiles unless the matter of Christ was also addressed. If this cannot be properly settled, then the cause of the exiles will also remain unresolved. Our senate added that they would complain before all the Swiss at the next assembly about how the people of Solothurn break their promises and keep none of what they have so often promised.</p>
      <p>Hence, it occurred to us that the rumors about the Glarus people, which were reported with uncertainty, might be true. There is no other news with us. Our leaders are concerned, with the presence of the Raurici envoys.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you have the letters of my Christian. He is a man, second to none, who is more loving towards you, as he feels the progress of many brothers from your commentaries. Do not delay in responding to him when you have time. He will visit you sometime unless wars turn our plans around.</p>
      <p>Moreover, if only time were given, and Froschauer would send the remaining parts of Pellican's commentaries from the end of Ezekiel for printing, you would take care of this with this message.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I could not write more. May all your affairs be safe. Continue with the Corinthians, for there are many things I do not clearly understand. May your fellow students be safe.</p>
      <p>December 23, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his beloved brother.</p>
