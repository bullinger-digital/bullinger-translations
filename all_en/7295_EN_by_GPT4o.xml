      <p>Greetings through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Honorable and gracious lord, my willing service is always at your disposal. If it goes well with you, and you are fresh and healthy, I would be very glad to hear it; for my part, I give thanks and praise to the faithful God, who may continue to share His grace with us. This letter of mine is solely because I have not received any letters or news from you for some time, not knowing how you are doing, I did not want to refrain from seeking you, my gracious lord and good friend, with this letter, hoping to receive a reply from you. Please understand this kindly from me, and as you are undoubtedly aware of the unrest in France, news has come here before the date that things are supposed to have calmed down again. But since we have no foundation or details, my very friendly request is that if you have a better understanding of the whole affair, please share it with me, and if you wish to write to me, send the letters to Hans Liener in St. Gallen, from where they will surely reach me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding my affairs here, I have not been further challenged by my lords, hoping that the persecution will cease, praying to God that He may grant them the Holy Spirit of recognition. After some time, Conrad Klingenbeck has passed away, and someone from Wittenberg, a local child named N. Dürnhöfer, has come in his place, bringing a good testimony with him.</p>
      <p>He gave his first sermon and confession on the 2nd of this month, and I hope in God that He will have mercy on us and provide a faithful pastor. The other criers do not like to see him, as they already let it be known that he is a Zwinglian and Calvinist, but I do not doubt that God will build up our church in part through him. Whatever further develops with him, I will inform you later. I did not want to withhold this from you in good faith, entrusting you to the protection and care of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Dated in haste, November 7, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, G. S.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my gracious lord, in Zurich.</p>
