    <p xml:id="regest1">Jakob Bedrot reported on the Peace Treaty of Kaaden, which is said to have turned out much less favorable for the victors, Landgrave Philipp of Hesse and Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, than for King Ferdinand I. Duke Ulrich, a supporter of Zwingli's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, had already appointed Blarer from the three theologians proposed to him (Melanchthon, Ambrosius Blarer, and Simon Grynäus), but his chancellor deliberately delayed the matter until the combative Lutheran Erhard Schnepf was recommended by Philipp of Hesse and accepted by the Duke. Schnepf pressured Blarer in Stuttgart until a compromise formula on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper was signed. Haller can only recall its content from memory, as Bedrot did not share the text at Bucer's request. The Duke would like to get rid of Schnepf. The peace treaty, whose fourth point is supposed to ban the "Sacramentarians," will only come into effect on Invocavit, February 14, 1535; by then, it will be known who is meant by this. Oswald Myconius has traveled to the Margraviate of Baden. Grynäus has not yet received a call to Württemberg. Dangerous situation in Geneva: After the legal relations between the city of Geneva and the bishop and Savoy seemed to be settled by the judgment of Payerne, a bishop's plot was uncovered in the city in the spring, and a recent armed assault failed. Due to renewed threats from Savoy, Geneva has now asked Bern for help. The request was denied, mainly because of the still unpaid old war debt; moreover, the Genevans used the word of God only as a cover for their own purposes. Bern also admonished Savoy. The reformed "bandits" of Solothurn are justified by Haller with the "deceitful" attitude of the Solothurn authorities.

      <p>S. Recently, Jakob Bedrot visited us, accompanied by the mathematician Christian Herlin, both of whom are distinguished in piety and learning. He reported very different things about the Peace of Kaaden than what we had received from the people of St. Gallen through our Crispin. Firstly, they say the prince, along with his son, quietly possesses the duchy, and then it is supposed to fall to Ferdinand as a fief, with everyone's rights reserved. Secondly, Cattus and another are supposed to recognize Ferdinand as a Roman king. Consider what Ferdinand has conquered there. Thirdly, Bedrot informed me, as we were told, that Ferdinand was supposed to pay the princes 200,000 guilders, which he had never heard mentioned. Fourthly, they reserved for the Cheruscan not to tolerate the Anabaptists and Sacramentarians in his land. The other matters, which are not as important to me, I have forgotten. Therefore, the arbitrators are Duke of Saxony, also Jörg of Saxony, formerly Empsers, now Coclei's patron, and the Bishop of Mainz; in these three, Hesse and Württemberg have agreed, but have set articles by which they wish to remain. In this, the papists are more honest with both princes than Saxo; he has so much influence with Ferdinand, whom he also granted obedience as a Roman king, that he wants to leave him in his faith without investigation and let him remain there, except that after the departure of the Duchess of Saxony, the three duchies are supposed to fall to the Duke, one of which is Cleves, the other two are also in the Netherlands, and in summary, a better peace has been made than with Cattus and Cherusco. And although the Duke of Württemberg is on our side in the matter of the Eucharist and has appointed three men, Melanchthon, Blaurer, and Grynaeus, he immediately ordered his chancellor to write to Constance for Blaurer; the chancellor delayed and neglected this, as all the duke's counselors were unfavorable to the matter. Meanwhile, Hesse offered his Erhard Schnepf, which Duke Ulrich could not refuse. Thus, Schnepf arrived in Stuttgart a day before Blaurer, and when Blaurer arrived, the Duke considered how he could reconcile the two men so that they would have the same doctrine. Schnepf immediately spoke to Blaurer: "If I do not agree with you on the Eucharist, I will not tolerate you." However, it eventually came to the point that they both signed an agreement with each other, a copy of which I have read. It is an amphibology: that they are not detrimental to our truth in the eyes of all understanding people, and Schnepf will also be sufficiently satisfied in this. I did not need to demand a copy, as Bucer had instructed Bedrot to say everything only in secret, lest the less intelligent immediately seize upon it as a calumny against both the prince and Blaurer. I know well that the agreement has the same wording: "I, Erhard Schnepf," the other "I, A. Blaurer, acknowledge that I am capable of the words of the Lord, 'this is my body' [Mt 26, 26 par], that the body of Christ is essentially and substantively in the Lord's Supper and is received." I do not want to have spoken wrongly, be aware that it will all be attributed to you. However, it is present that, as Schnepf, the most learned in Hesse, is unwilling and reluctant in Marburg, having requested leave several times, as Cattus has improved his stipend excellently, even with Rheingau wine, and cannot request leave with honors, it is the plan of the Württemberger that as soon as he can dismiss Schnepf with honors, he will do so. The fourth article of the treaty, however, since peace has not yet been promised, but a deadline set until Invocavit, will first come to a declaration, which are the Sacramentarians, in the hope that in the meantime everyone will be well informed about the matter.</p>
      <p>Miconius has traveled to the Margraviate of Baden to bathe. Grynaeus is called from Cherusco.</p>
      <p>As for our affairs, the situation is dangerous. The Bishop of Geneva and the Duke of Savoy have been given a judgment at Payerne by the 10 places, reserving their rights. Meanwhile, the bishop has instigated a treason, intending to place a knight from Freiburg in his place in Geneva, but when the traitors arrived, one or two were executed. The Genevans believe the bishop has forfeited his rights. Thus, he has gathered a force, no one knows how many, intending to overthrow the city of Geneva under the evangelical preaching of Farell and go with them to banishment, of which they were warned, and the whole city unanimously decided to write to my lords, who sent their embassy, which wrote back today, a new force is gathering, I suspect of the Duke, from his nobility from the Vaud, Fussigny, etc. The Genevans are requesting 200 men as an addition. It was denied today. They are supposed to pay what they owe, namely 9900 crowns; then my lords will act further according to the alliance. They also write that it is not convenient for us to intervene whenever they want. They have stormed the Duke's chapels and idols in or before the city, are impudent, fearing God's word is their cover, and that we should leave them less. My lords also write to the Duke and his Vaud that they wish to abide by the judgment. I do not know what will come of it. We fear great upheaval, false practices.</p>
      <p>As for the bandits, they are not pursued so vigorously. However, since those from Solothurn have lied to them, other places, and my lords about everything, and no justice helps, they have forgotten Christian gentleness and uselessly accused them of treason and heresy. But when the envoys come on the appointed day, you will hear the details of the matter. These are the street rumors from Geneva and Solothurn. I did not want to withhold all this from you, as I have written to this stone. You know well, for your prudence, to advise me in all things and also to do the best for yours.</p>
      <p>Regarding your commentary, as much as I have seen in it, I am well satisfied, praise God; but I have not yet examined it with judgment and comparison of others, it will be better considered in the future. There is a fine book on both epistles to the Corinthians; but you have already done more than enough. If I knew that you wanted to let the other epistle also be published, I would not bind this one; rather, let me know. Now I do not know further.</p>
      <p>Farewell and write more often than you have done so far.</p>
      <p>August 21.</p>
      <p>Your B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his dearest brother of all.</p>
