      <p>Greetings. I believe that what has been done so far regarding the bishops of Chur is not unknown to you, most illustrious man. However, you will learn diligently from Mr. Friedrich Salice, along with some others related to him, through the letters he sends to you. He will finally present his case in these days, unless he is deceived by some who are ill-disposed towards him; for they punish an excessive, indeed nefarious matter too moderately in my judgment. Whatever has been done, I will make sure you know. Mr. Zanchi is still staying in Chiavenna, mainly because of the illness of Count Ulisse, which he has often testified to me with tears as being more serious to him than his own case. Indeed, he now writes that Ulisse, like some angel descended from heaven, thinks and speaks of nothing but the most divine things and speaks with such majesty about God, heaven, eternal life, and the glorious resurrection of Christ, that he draws everyone into the greatest admiration of him, etc. May the Lord Jesus so temper your baths that you may be able to be safe for his church and all of us for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and I ask that you commend us, your servants, to your faith. Quickly.</p>
      <p>Chur, 10th of July, 1567. Yours most devotedly, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the greatest pastor of the church of Zurich, his eternally honorable lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
