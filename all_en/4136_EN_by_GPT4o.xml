      <p>Greetings. Although, most illustrious man, I have nothing new to report to you, nevertheless, since a reliable messenger presents himself, we could not refrain from informing your kindness about the Anabaptist matter that has transpired among us. Surely, it has not escaped your notice what was done between the ministers of our church and the Anabaptists about 17 years ago and how many have interpreted those actions in a worse light, and from there judged them to be ambitious or of some other nature, because they did not communicate with those other brothers (before they met with the Anabaptists), whose doctrine and work could have been helpful. However, they explained in person that nothing was done rashly or without certain reasons at that time, and in such a way that their excuse seemed sufficient to you. Now, since something almost of this kind has happened, from which perhaps some might seize the opportunity to slander us, it pleased us to briefly explain the matter to your kindness, so that we might have you as a more ready defender; if that happens, we will care for nothing further. On November 13th, our most honorable senate summoned the Anabaptists and among other things forbade their preacher Heinrich Wyninger from teaching anyone further, neither privately nor publicly; for if he does not cease, he must pay the senate 20 florins for each sermon. Furthermore, they are enjoined to enter the sacred building and hear the word of God.</p>
      <p>But they refuse to do this, adding the reason that we teach impious doctrines and things contrary to the word of God. Hence, the senate decrees that they return on November 16th and in the court, in the presence of one or two ministers, prove that we teach impious and things contrary to the word of God; they should also propose what those impious doctrines are. This pleased our most honorable senate for this reason, if perhaps they could be convinced of their error and led to the right path, or if they were unwilling, after being punished or fined, they would have less to excuse themselves, otherwise, they did not doubt that everything with them would be treated in vain. Therefore, on the appointed day, two are present, we meet, the senate's decree is repeated to them and they are urged to satisfy it.</p>
      <p>But what do they do? In their usual manner, they twist themselves in strange ways and recite things irrelevant to the matter, which are nevertheless refuted by the senators themselves. Not to overlook (the greatest inconsistency and levity of men and the manifest lies by which they tried to defend themselves by evading) I was forced to annotate these things in the margins, which I had nevertheless consigned to oblivion. Seeing therefore that the matter was at hand, to prove what they had said, they bring forth the passage Matthew 28:3, to which they add Acts 19, and from there they try to infer that they baptize in the manner of the apostles and the primitive church, but we do not. The passages are debated for and against, finally, they are so entangled that they can no longer explain themselves, they almost confess to erring about Anabaptism and yet are convinced. Now, when it should be proven that we sow false doctrines, they repeat the passage Matthew 28, Mark 16, insisting on the doctrine that only those capable of understanding, namely adults, are baptized and should be baptized according to the command of Christ, but we baptize infants who are incapable of understanding and lack faith, therefore, etc.</p>
      <p>But when we insist that they prove we act impiously by baptizing infants, or where it is forbidden, since they lacked the weapons to pierce us, they nevertheless firmly asserted that they do not err, simply believing as they proposed. Those appointed by the senate put an end to the dispute, adding two reasons: that they had not yet proven what they said, nor satisfied the promise that if they were convinced by the word of God of error and instructed otherwise from the same, they would yield, but they wanted to admit neither of these, and that it was wasted oil and effort, and they promised to report this to the most honorable senate. Thus, each departs to his own.</p>
      <p>Here you have briefly and simply the whole matter. I ask you to consider the unpolished and hastily written letter kindly, and if anything has been done wrong in this matter, in the judgment of others to whom the matter is less clear, we beseech you to defend us. Finally, if you have any news from Scotland, France, or Rome, we ask you to kindly share it with us. We could not understand what the soldier recently enlisted in the vicinity of the Zürich territory was doing, especially since it was done in the name of some Zürichers; you surely have more certain information. Farewell in Christ with all the learned in Zürich and always keep us and our church commended to you. Simpertus and others greet you and the others.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, November 25, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Jakob Rüeger. To the distinguished man by piety, learning, and kindness, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Zürich church, his most honorable lord and brother to be observed.</p>
