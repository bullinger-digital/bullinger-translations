      <p>Greetings. I highly value, most illustrious and esteemed sir, that amidst your many and great affairs, you have stolen a little time for yourself to address me with your most loving letters. I give you the greatest thanks for this and earnestly ask you to continue writing to me; for I am greatly delighted by your letters, which are truly elegant, learned, and most courteous.</p>
      <p>And since from the account of our dear friend Tretius, an excellent man, and from your most loving letters, I understand how much you value me and how much my well-being is of concern to you, I will, with God's help, ensure that I do not appear inferior to you in zeal and love. And as you bind yourself to me in all duties of life, so you should know that I am, in turn, in all things and through all things (if I may speak thus) entirely yours. For the gem of salt and the certainly most beautiful little book you sent, I again give the greatest thanks to your kindness and will ensure, when the opportunity arises, that I do not appear ungrateful. Moreover, I especially urge you, most illustrious sir and beloved brother in the Lord, to continue to do what you are doing, to vigorously and steadfastly defend the doctrine of our holy faith against innovators who contaminate our sacred things and impiously reject the terms used in the churches since the times of the apostles, along with the matters signified by those terms, such as the Trinity, persons, essence, and similar concepts. For I hear that you are fervent in this struggle, which I greatly approve. Know that the lukewarm are spit out from the mouth of the Lord, and indeed it cannot be that a mind rightly imbued with true faith can patiently hear the impious novelties, indeed blasphemies, of fanatical men. May the Lord increase His grace to you. The rest will be reported by our Tretius, in a living letter to you, which I know well will not be unwelcome, since he loves you exceedingly. May the Lord Jesus keep you and bless you and yours forever! [Please deign to greet the most illustrious man, Dr. Anton Schneberger, the physician of Zürich, my esteemed friend]</p>
      <p>Zürich, August 14, 1567.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, minister of the church of Zürich, entirely yours.</p>
