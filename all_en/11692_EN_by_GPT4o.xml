    <p xml:id="regest1">Refers to a report sent by [Hans] Fehr to [Georg] Binder concerning [Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick; there are still no reliable news about the war declared on July 19. In the military camp in Vienna, troops and money are lacking, but preaching is free; Germany lacks a shepherd, as King [Ferdinand] is not suitable for this role. French troops have captured and burned down the Luxembourgish Damvillers and occupied Verdun; now Yvoy [Carignan] is being besieged, while Ferdinand's army is gathering in Diedenhofen [Thionville]; Duke [Wilhelm] of Guelders is still being held up by Dutch troops. [King Francis I] wants to avenge his imprisonment in Spain and hopes to become Emperor; his hope is nurtured by [Sultan Suleiman I]. Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg has received the profitable Abbey of Gorze from the French king and fortified it after expelling the monks; he has moved to [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse via Strasbourg and has taken Captain [Hans Stengle], a citizen of Basel, with him. The Turkish Sultan is said to have sent help to the French king; [Duke Wilhelm of] Guelders is supposed to besiege Antwerp and could seize the city treasury, which would have far-reaching consequences for Germany. It is said that the Swiss in the field for France would be deployed against Spain; Myconius inquires about those allegedly fallen from the Five Places. The letter can also be shown to Theodor [Bibliander]. The Appian edition mentioned [in No. 1644] was printed in Mainz.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Here is Ferus, once a schoolmaster in Schaffhausen, who claims to have sent the letters about the incendiary of Brunswick, which I had lent him, to Binder. You have surely seen them by now, as I promised to send them. I add one thing: on July 19, war was declared by the Saxon and the Hessian; it is now being waged. However, I still have no certain information about what or how things are being conducted. It is known that enough soldiers have gathered. May the Lord turn it to good.</p>
      <p>From the Viennese camp, more miserable and calamitous news is heard daily. The entire army is not yet present; many lack money, and in many, there is unspeakable licentiousness. However, Christ is preached openly in the camps. Almost no one does not complain that Germany is without a shepherd. The king is a boy and devoid of all happiness. This situation greatly disturbs wise men.</p>
      <p>To recall to you the affection towards the King of France, I now fully explain the story I began in my last letters. His army came to a town and fortress in the land of Luxembourg named Damvillers. He struck with cannons until it was enough for an assault. He attacked four times and was repulsed as many times.</p>
      <p>A conference was held, and while it lasted, soldiers, whom we call free, from the other side of the town, having climbed over the wall, rushed in, killed all the men to the last, capturing a few, raped the women and virgins, then plundered the town and completely destroyed the fortress by fire. Thus, he learns to act from his god, the Turk, with men. Soon he attacked the town of Verdun and occupied it, but has not yet set it on fire. Now he besieges Yvoy (Carignan), and unless help is provided, the entire territory of Luxembourg is lost. Ferdinand's army is gathering in Diedenhofen (Thionville). The Duke of Guelders has an army of 10,000 on the way to the said French army, but is hindered by the soldiers of Lower Germany. In summary: the Frenchman is mad and hopes he has found an opportunity to avenge himself, because he was once led captive by the emperor to Spain. I add this last: the envoy, who was at Solothurn until now, boasts that his king will soon be emperor. He is nurtured in this hope by the Turk. Thus say all good and wise men.</p>
      <p>Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg, departing from the Frenchman, received a gift, the abbey of Gorze, whose revenue is 7½ thousand crowns annually. He immediately expelled the monks, all nobles, and fortified the house with strong structures as he wished. When he came to Strasbourg, he was immediately called to Hesse, but first summoned to himself a certain old captain, now our citizen. He indeed complied, after liberty was granted by our magistrate, but not otherwise than to go against Brunswick and return to us after the war is finished, unless something more is permitted by our people.</p>
      <p>To the prefect of Ensheim, it was announced that nothing is more certain than that the Turk sent both money and ships with soldiers to the Frenchman. While I write this, a rumor flies that Guelders has besieged Antwerp and seeks the merchants' treasury there, which they say is immense. And indeed, if he obtained it, he could harm Germany in many ways and for a long time.</p>
      <p>It is written from Milan that the Frenchman has now despaired. For this reason, he has brought back the Swiss to use them against Spain. And the talk about the Five Places, who were the first to leave, being killed, is renewed. I wish to be informed about this.</p>
      <p>This I could signify during leisure. Farewell through Christ with all yours. Let these things be shared with Theodor (if he delights in such matters) with you.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 6, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Appian, about whom I wrote through Butler, was printed in Mainz.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
