      <p>Most Reverend Father, what Mr. Martinengo sent to me about the council and the booklet written against you, I immediately sent to you through the same people who delivered it to me; if you have received it, please let us know.</p>
      <p>However, you seem to be doing the right thing if you write to Mr. Martinengo yourself and thank him for his diligence.</p>
      <p>Now, I have nothing to write; when I advised our councilors about what your councilor is surprised has not yet been written, they replied that they are waiting for a response from Innsbruck and hope the matter can be resolved; if not, they would have certainly written.</p>
      <p>There is a village called Samnaun, located at the lower end of the Engadin.</p>
      <p>It is about an alp (mountain pasture) and the matter is to be settled justly on both sides.</p>
      <p>The law is taken and given according to the agreement; there are 2 judges on our side and 2 on theirs; they take the umpire from ours because they are the plaintiffs.</p>
      <p>When the 2 judges along with our appointed umpire appeared on the set day at the designated place, the other 2 from the imperial side did not show up; however, the people came with armed hands.</p>
      <p>Our people made themselves ready; meanwhile, the others attacked and took some away.</p>
      <p>It is a double offense because they acted willfully in pending legal matters.</p>
      <p>If the government in Innsbruck does not show a special seriousness and displeasure about the action, it is a hidden threat.</p>
      <p>For these days, Balthasar Planta, the bailiff at Fürstenburg, writes here to the bishop, whose bailiff he is: some large artillery has been taken to Glurns (a small town not far from Fürstenburg) and reinforcements have been sent there; likewise, there are many foreign people lying in Lech and in other places more.</p>
      <p>And when it was written to the Fröhlich (thus is the captain at Glurns called) about this, he was told to be without fear; for they are preparing for their new lord Charles, son of Ferdinand; they are waiting for him, etc.</p>
      <p>Yet the matter is very suspicious to many, etc.</p>
      <p>The case of Glarus troubles me not a little; I see into which arbitrators they have fallen, I understand what they promised before and to what they have repeatedly offered themselves.</p>
      <p>They secretly sent a good and faithful man here to us, with whom I discussed many things.</p>
      <p>I fear only this, that their discord may result in great harm.</p>
      <p>Bäldius is one of those who strictly reject these means; Schuler, Vogel, and others are among those who think of accepting them; the consul of Cham strongly advises this. I wrote my opinion; but this is also the opinion of the councilors.</p>
      <p>Please, read the letters first, then seal them and send them with your trusted people; if you think otherwise, I do not oppose you.</p>
      <p>I think more about what can be done than what should be done.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father, and inform us about French affairs and others, so that I may have something with which to reward the illustrious Mr. Martinengo.</p>
      <p>Chur, August 23, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>The councilors and others of ours greet you reverently.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
