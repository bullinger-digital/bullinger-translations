      <p>Greetings. I am sending to your reverence a copy of the letters in which the Landgrave shows what he thinks of the book of the Dukes of Saxony, in which several heresies are condemned. They were written last year, but have only recently been brought to me; I thought, if you have not seen them before, they would not be unpleasant to read. War rumors are thundering everywhere, yet they are so perplexing and uncertain that I do not know at all what to make of them. We are expecting the siege of our city; Bavaria also fears for itself.</p>
      <p>The confederates of Landsberg are already holding a meeting in Ingolstadt, who can give us either war or peace. Our soldiers are gathering, with a small amount of money paid to them, suspending them with the hope of future selection. The neighboring nobles have asked our magistrate to allow them to move into the city with theirs in time of war, which I hear has been granted. Some think this warlike preparation, whatever it may be now, is aimed at Trier.</p>
      <p>Recently, the bishops of Trier and Cologne met in Koblenz with the envoys of France and Spain. Now the Palatines, Wolfgang and Frederick the Elector, then the Duke of Württemberg and the Landgrave, and some others are meeting in Worms. I was certainly informed two months ago that the King of France... was struck and removed from human interaction, and I forgot to mention this in my previous letters, in which I also said that the Pope Innocent, whom I suppose you have long since learned is called Pius II. Last evening, Mr. Geryon Seyler was summoned by the magistrate and taken into custody (I do not know the reason), and this evening he was released again.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>It would be more pleasant and easier to converse about the state of both the city and almost all of Germany than to write. Given in Augsburg on the 7th of March in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten the Younger. To the venerable and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
