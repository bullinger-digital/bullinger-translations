      <p>My willing service is always at your disposal.</p>
      <p>Revered, gracious, dear sir, I have received your letter and from it, I have received not a little distress.</p>
      <p>The boy whom you sent to me, I am sending back, in good hope that his authorities will not yet withdraw their paternal hand from him, but will be helpful to him in what he is capable of. However, if they are of a different mind, they should send him to his mother, who is more obliged to help him and is in a better position to do so than I am. I have raised the other boy for you with great effort; she should be content with that and not expect more.</p>
      <p>The two booklets have been handed over by Master Ambrosius and Doctor Johannes Zwick; I will ensure that they both write to you.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Dated in Konstanz, March 10, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your willing Gregor Mangolt, bookkeeper.</p>
      <p>To the pious and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, his gracious, dear lord, in Zurich.</p>
