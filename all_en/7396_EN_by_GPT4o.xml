      <p>Greetings, esteemed lord and dearest brother. There is no need for you to make so much of the benefits freely offered to you, but you show yourself grateful with praise. Let us, while we live, reciprocate with benefits and duties; for God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, etc. I am amazed at who dares to spread such gross lies, that the Count has been expelled from France, etc. This week I received letters from Bern, Basel, and St. Gallen, also written this week, with almost the same content, that the merchants from St. Gallen returned home from Lyon on February 22; they testify that all peace negotiations and hopes are over and done. The king has issued a printed letter, in which he announces: since the Count does not adhere to any proper peace, he commands all lords, knights, nobles, etc., to withdraw from him; if they do not withdraw from him within 8 days, they shall be punished, etc., otherwise, they will stand in the highest disgrace, etc. He wanted to separate them; but it did not please him; for no one falls away from the Count. The king wanted to block the road to Orléans; but he broke through with force, and he defeated the Italians who lay in his way, and he arrived in Orléans with all his men; he has a very fresh, beautiful, well-equipped army, eager to fight for glory, as it seems that it cannot be otherwise, unfortunately. The king is said to be otherwise 80,000 strong; the prince is said to have 15,000 fine horses and 45,000 foot soldiers. It is to be lamented that, through the instigation of the Pope and the Spaniard (God will avenge it on them), a decent and honest people should fight and kill each other, etc.</p>
      <p>From Antwerp, through Basel, it is reported that the Duke of Alba has summoned and called the exiled princes of Orange and other lords to appear and answer within 6 weeks, under penalty of losing people and land, as well as all their goods. On the same day, January 24, lightning (against nature) struck the church in Middelburg in Zeeland, also in Dordrecht, and burned the churches to the ground without damaging the cities, etc.</p>
      <p>At this time, I have nothing further. However, whatever it may be, time will reveal it.</p>
      <p>God be with you! Greet for me the three mayors, Captain Carli, Pontasella, Ganthner, etc., and all good friends.</p>
      <p>Given on February 27, 1568.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
