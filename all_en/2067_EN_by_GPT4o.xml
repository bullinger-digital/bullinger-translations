      <p>S. D. A few days ago, when I came here to purchase some necessary items for my wedding, know that I have bid farewell to court life and have betrothed myself forever to a poor virgin in a certain town called Tabolca, which is located on the border of the Kingdom of Hungary and the Margraviate of Moravia, ten miles from here. These letters, dated the first of August in Zürich, were delivered to me, and in them were included the discourses on the Lord's Supper sent by you as a token of our friendship. Both the letters and the discourses published by you were most welcome to me, for which, and for your great benevolence towards me, as I ought, I am very grateful to you. I have not seen your previous letters and booklets, which you write you sent to me; I think they have been lost. You wish to know whether I am familiar with the German language; I am ignorant of that language and do not understand even a word. The work on the justification of man, which you now indicate you are writing, is greatly desired both by me and by my friends, to whom I have mentioned this and who are devoted to the Christian religion; I ask you to ensure that at least one copy comes to us.</p>
      <p>In England, all worshippers of piety rejoice that the truth has prevailed. But here a certain document is circulated, already printed here, which spreads the news that a certain duke, the chief counselor of the late King of England and author of the reformed Christian religion, first retracted the religion itself and was later beheaded in a public tumult after the king's death, because of which the adversaries of the truth exult and shake the spirits of the pious with this battering ram, claiming that their doctrine was false, which that good man recanted on his deathbed. You should inform us of the truth of this matter with even a single word. Here, the pious are ill-spoken of by adversaries because of religion, some are even thrown into chains and thus punished. These things, however, must be borne with a calm mind for the sake of the Lord's name. While I write this, a copy of the document about the duke was offered to me, which I have enclosed with this letter to you, so that you may write back to me whether it happened thus and if the duke himself suffered death for the sake of religion. Letters and booklets, if you are going to send any to me, send them to the hands of Paul Strasser, a bookseller of this city of Vienna; he will deliver them to me in good faith. He has a friend in Basel, Frobenius, to whom he often writes. May the Lord God keep you forever. Given in Vienna on the ninth of November in the year of our Lord 1553.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted János Fejérthóy.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend and most pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
