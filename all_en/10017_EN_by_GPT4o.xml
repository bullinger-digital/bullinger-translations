      <p>To Rudolf Weingartner, his most beloved brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>May the blessing of the Son of God and our Lord Jesus Christ be upon you, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>I cannot express how much joy this most beautiful rumor, which has recently begun to spread among us about the Christian spirit of your soul, has brought to me and filled every corner of my heart with joy. Therefore, be strengthened by the virtue of God, for thus one ascends to the stars! You preach the Gospel, you do excellently: the most splendid foundations of your and your people's salvation have been laid. But why should I begin to urge you to complete the work begun by the divine spirit, when you promise by your mind and morals that you will refuse nothing that contributes to the glory of Christ and the salvation of your flock? For from your early youth, you have shown certain seeds that breathe the glory of God and the benefit of your neighbor, and for this reason, it is no wonder how often our patron Volcatius praises you with pious praises; therefore, there was no need for me to consider it necessary to spur you on. Yet, an incredible ardor towards you compels me, as they say, to urge the one who is already running. Go, where the virtue of God calls you, go with a fortunate step! Certainly, you are now at an age where you can judge with extinguished youthful heat and rashness what is true and pious doctrine and what is either beneficial or harmful to your flock.</p>
      <p>Let it be proclaimed by the world that the Gospel of God is blasphemed! But what does the world have in common with the Gospel, what does the flesh have with the spirit, or truth with hypocrisy? Was not Christ himself, the Son of God, along with the entire congregation of the faithful, defamed with this disgrace? And what else do the impious accuse him of but: "You have a demon," what do they accuse the apostles of, but: "They are full of new wine"? And what else does Christ admonish through entire chapters of John but this, which we see, namely that the Gospel is ill-spoken of among men? What else does Paul teach, what does Luke in Acts? [Acts 4:1 ff; 5:17 ff and elsewhere.] Indeed, in this, that the Gospel suffers so much persecution, it openly shows itself to be from God. The source of beatitude, Christ, thus meets the storms of the wicked: "Blessed are you when men cast reproaches upon you," etc. Therefore, since their persecution or defamation of those who adhere to the word of God is nothing new, accidental, unexpected, or desperate, let persecution not make you recoil, but rather attract you all the more. Do you not know Paul's voice? "If I were still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ." Sailors or charioteers are so unafraid of the violence of storms that they know for certain they cannot conduct their business except under the inclemency of the air. Now you too have undertaken that province, in which you cannot but expect the thunder and lightning of men. You are a bishop, an economist, and a steward of the mysteries of God.</p>
      <p>Here it is absolutely necessary either to carry out this matter with the highest praise or to be wearied with eternal damnation. For the word of the Lord is certain, which is thus brought to us by Ezekiel: "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; and you shall hear a word from my mouth and warn them from me. If I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you do not warn him, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul." Now consider the most horrendous examples of damnation of the ancients: Nadab and Abihu, offering strange fire before the sanctuary, perish miserably; and who now doubts that all who attempt to kindle strange fire, other than that of Christ the Savior glorifying God in the hearts of the faithful, perish in a similar manner? I will now pass over in silence God's most severe punishment on Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and On, as it is otherwise copiously described in the Mosaic Numbers. But with what weight of words, with what numerous crowd of words of the spirit, is the sin of the sons of Eli described? Namely, that they did not know God, "and lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tabernacle." But what else is that, I ask, than to neglect the word of God, - which being neglected, it is necessary that all piety and knowledge of God fall - and also to defile the souls seeking God, which they pollute and lead away from God with unclean, sacrilegious, and adulterous seed, as many as preach another doctrine besides the word of God? Another prophet, because he did not obey the words of the Lord God, is torn apart by a lion, nor is refuge provided by the fact that another prophet had ordered him to eat. Undoubtedly, neither will the example, morals, and life of other bishops be able to protect you in this matter, whatever they may preach or say. The Most High has appointed you a shepherd over his sheep, he wants you to be a faithful shepherd, in this, that you offer not muddy water and trampled pastures, but green grass to the thirsty and open waters clearer than any crystal. This parable is played for you: blessed is he who understands.</p>
      <p>The prophets of Baal, because they defrauded the people of God of the word, are most severely and cruelly slaughtered by Elijah; there is testimony of this in 1 Kings 18 [1 Kings 18:21 ff]. But Isaiah also cries out: "If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. And they will pass through it hard-pressed and hungry; and it shall happen, when they are hungry, that they will be enraged and curse their king and their God, and look upward. Then they will look to the earth, and see trouble and darkness, gloom of anguish; and they will be driven into darkness." Jeremiah follows: "For from the least of them even to the greatest of them, everyone is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely. They have also healed the hurt of my people slightly, saying, 'Peace, peace!' when there is no peace. Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor did they know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time I punish them, they shall be cast down," says the Lord. Ezekiel adds: "Because you have spoken nonsense and envisioned lies, therefore I am indeed against you," says the Lord God. "My hand will be against the prophets who envision futility and who divine lies. They shall not be in the assembly of my people," etc. Micah also exclaims: "Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who make my people stray; who chant 'Peace' while they chew with their teeth, but who prepare war against him who puts nothing into their mouths: Therefore you shall have night without vision, and you shall have darkness without divination; the sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall be dark for them," etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since with these most clear and certain words of God you have the punishment most certainly threatened if you depart from his word, you must strive with all your might to offer your flock the purest nourishment of the word of God as purely as possible. Consider that you are the one on whom the hope and doctrine of all your people depend; weigh that you are not only the leader of the souls of God but also of your most beloved brothers. You would indeed be bloodthirsty, not only a wolf but also the most savage robber of all that the earth has borne, if after knowing the truth you were to defraud those of yours of the sweetest nourishment; not a man, but the most truculent tyrant, if you were still to close off the truth from them! Would not then indeed the most truculent voice of the Lord apply to you, thus thundering: "Woe to you, for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men. For you neither go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in." Or as Luke reports more clearly: "Woe to you lawyers, for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in you hindered." The text of the apostle is also clear: "Because, although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools," etc. - I do not know what more could move a good man. Consider even this, how many hundreds of pious souls you have daily, whom you see as abandoned standing before you and ardently longing for salvation.</p>
      <p>What if you have a few goats? Are you not then a shepherd? Are not all the sheep to be lost because a few goats kick? And why do you still hesitate? Behold, the means are at hand by which you may govern the province entrusted to you. The matter is not only easy but also full of utility; for the Lord cries out through Jeremiah and says: "Therefore prepare yourself and arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed before their faces, lest I dismay you before them. For behold, I have made you this day a fortified city and an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land. They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you," says the Lord, "to deliver you." - Nor is there any doubt that these things pertain to you; certainly, they concern you. For Saint Paul says: "Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, but also for us," and also: "For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope." At least believe the apostle: "If God is for us, who can be against us?" We can be persecuted, captured, punished, or even killed, but we cannot be defeated, because "the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed" [Rev 5:5]. And what would you consider hard or difficult, which the spirit of God, renewing and strengthening our hearts, does not soften and smooth? Paul cries out: "I can do all things through him who strengthens me." Why should I continue to describe the reward, when "eye has not seen, nor ear heard, what the Lord has prepared for those who love him"? And if nothing else, certainly this diligent care of the sheep and worthy handling of the word of God ensures that with Paul we can say in that final necessity, when the world totters, friends are sluggish to help, riches vanish, and all worldly things perish, meanwhile the soul alone, never dying and yet destined for death, is presented to that judge who rewards each according to their deeds; that, I say, we can then say: "For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain," "I desire to depart and be with Christ." For "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved his appearing."</p>
      <p>Therefore, dearest brother, by the holy persecution of God and his salutary cross, which he sends to his elect, by the most sacred episcopal office and by the terror of the threats and judgment of God, by the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he abundantly shed for his sheep, which he entrusted to you to feed, by the help and inspiration of the Holy Spirit and that never-fading glory of eternal life, and by the salvation of your wretched soul and all your sheep: I beseech and implore you to complete the work you have begun, to grow in the preaching of the truth of God, so that the glory of God and the salvation of the sheep may bear witness to your word and doctrine. May the God of peace, mercy, and infinite grace strengthen you and guide you according to his most holy will.</p>
      <p>In Kappel am Albis, October 15, in the year of the world's redemption 1524.</p>
      <p>All the brothers in Christ wish you well.</p>
