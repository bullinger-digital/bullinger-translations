      <p>S. Regarding the Belgian expedition, we hear of enormous preparations and Philip's efforts, which are not a little greater than those ever made by his father against the French. He is assisted by his queen, who has obtained from the kingdom's nobles a sufficiently large number of horsemen, foot soldiers, and ships, and that (as they say) on the condition that he allows freedom of religion. Someone wrote this as true, but it does not seem credible to our English exiles. The assembly of princes in Frankfurt has already been dissolved. In it, the Lord granted a final peace between Hesse and the Count of Nassau, much to the joy of the good people. Then, with unanimous votes, they decided to urge the Worms Colloquy, and indeed, to the extent that they refuse to contribute the money requested by Ferdinand unless he wants and provides what he promised to carry out this plan. Meanwhile, an amusing incident occurred in Frankfurt in the main church. When the princes had gathered there to hear a sermon on the feast of John the Baptist and the psalm had been sung as usual, a priest of no ordinary reputation among his people rose to pray. When he had read the Gospel lesson, which the assembly listened to attentively, and was about to begin the explanation, the church, by the princes' order, began to sing a psalm, one and then another, until, driven by impatience at the delay, he descended from the pulpit and the evangelical preacher took his place. This he took so badly that the priest threw the book and the clock to the ground and brought a serious complaint to the Duke of Jülich as if it were a most atrocious injury. When the Duke of Jülich replied that it was in vain to refer these things to him, who had no jurisdiction in the imperial city, the priest added that he therefore demanded of him that he be a witness to the deed on the last day. The Duke of Jülich responded to this speech by saying: "Dear Lord, it is unfortunate; for I think we will not come together in one lodging." This was written by Höcklius, the advisor to Count Georg, from Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 8, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours as always, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
