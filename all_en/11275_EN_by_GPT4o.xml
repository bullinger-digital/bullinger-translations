    <p xml:id="regest1">He complies with the decision not to be allowed to study in Wittenberg and wants to know if this really applies to all Zurich students, as he has heard. Since he could not stay in Strasbourg, he has returned to Basel, because the study in Paris proposed by Bullinger would be too expensive or would force him to attend Mass; he urgently requests to be allowed to continue studying abroad. In view of a lecture by Otto [Werdm√ºller], Bullinger is to send him the works of Cicero, as well as the "Loci" which he received from [Nicholas] Eliott. A Bundestag is taking place in Frankfurt; there is fear of the Turks, and the English King [Henry VIII] is threatened with war by the Emperor [Charles V] and the French [Francis I]. He has sent pumpkin seeds to his stepfather [Sebold Schleusinger]; if desired, Bullinger's wife [Anna Adlischwyler] should also receive some. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, most gracious patron, in which I understood both your opinion and that of our leaders. I will never plan to go to Wittenberg, as I am obedient to your and your mandates. For now, my sole concern is to satisfy you and your commands. Why this has been denied to me, I see quite clearly, it seems, and I do not bear this with an unjust mind, knowing that you are of such an age and have such experience in matters that you can discern much better than I what should be done. However, our Sebastian has spread a rumor in Basel, saying that this decree was made by our people, that no alumnus of our college should go to Wittenberg. I am very surprised if this is indeed the case.</p>
      <p>Now, to briefly inform you of my situation: When I saw that the expenses in Strasbourg were intolerable for me and that their way of living was not very suitable for my health, I returned to Basel and was received with great kindness by Mr. Myconius. The school in Paris (which you mentioned) is inconvenient for my means. I do not know who they are who promise sustenance for 12 crowns; indeed, everyone I have met says that a table costs no less than 25 crowns. Moreover, much must be spent on a room and bed, unless perhaps they think I should live in a certain college; if I do, I must attend Mass every day, which I will never do, even if everything were given to me for free; for I value the salvation of the soul more than heaps of money. Therefore, it seems best to me to stay in Basel for a while, unless you see it differently, whose advice I always propose to myself as the most certain North Star. I ask you to consider what is in my best interest. But I earnestly pray this one thing from you, that you insist with our people that they do not plan my return; for you mentioned this in your letter. Please allow me, like others, to learn good arts among foreigners. But I consider it superfluous to discuss these matters further, etc.</p>
      <p>Our Otto, as I hope, will soon publicly lecture on Cicero's orations. Therefore, I beseech you (most loving patron), if possible, to send me Cicero's works at this Frankfurt fair; if you can, please add the book of commonplaces, which Eliott gave me as a gift. I have nothing new to write, except that when I left Strasbourg, there was a Bundestag in Frankfurt, attended by the Duke of Saxony. Everyone fears the Turks, as a certain merchant from Salzburg told me on the journey when we spent the night together. Meanwhile, Ferdinand (as he himself narrated) is colluding with them; other princes and bishops are more fleecing the people than protecting them. The King of England is said to be threatened with war by the Emperor and the French. Whether this is true, I do not know. If it is true, the Emperor is undertaking a most foolish act, trying to prepare another enemy for himself, in addition to the many he already has.</p>
      <p>I sent seeds of Italian pumpkins to my stepfather; here, when they have grown, your wife (if she wishes) will also be shared with, for I sent them to him under this condition.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write. Please consider my matters with fairness and kindness. Basel, from the house of Myconius, 1539.</p>
      <p>Please greet your mother and your wife with the whole family in my name.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Rod. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the truly learned and pious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his gracious lord.</p>
