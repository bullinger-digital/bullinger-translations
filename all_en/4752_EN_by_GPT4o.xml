      <p>Greetings. Yesterday during dinner I received those letters from Hoser, which were mentioned four days ago in another set that he sent to me through Leonard. Along with them were also letters addressed to you, which you will now receive from the excellent Liner. At the same time, yesterday, our Wonlichius arrived, coming from there and bringing a bundle of letters from Strasbourg from Hubert and my son. They write about the affairs of France and also send a booklet with a preface by Johannes Sturm containing four Eucharistic writings of our Bucer; they also indicate new movements in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>If I were not certain that all these things were also sent to you by your Stucki, I would have ensured that some part, even if unread, was delivered to you now. Therefore, let me know if you happen to desire any of these.</p>
      <p>I cannot do anything further; so many things to write at once are pressing me urgently. Farewell, my venerable and dearest Bullinger. April 12.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
