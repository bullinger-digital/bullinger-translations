      <p>Greetings. When your letters were brought to me, I was not at home, but had gone a little into the countryside.</p>
      <p>I received my booklet, which I had lent to you; I also received the history of the Ambrosian tumult, for which I thank your kindness. If you have received the collation of Becoinus, you will do a most pleasing thing if you share it.</p>
      <p>You have here a copy of the supplication of the people of Jena, to which Roth and Neckar, bad neighbors and ill-behaved men, who should not have mixed themselves more honorably with those turbulent ones, have subscribed, but on the condition that you return it promptly and safely through the next courier, but not before you have used it abundantly.</p>
      <p>We have no news now, except that the rumor is increasingly spreading that Leith in Scotland has been captured by the English and that all the French have been expelled from Scotland. However, I do not yet dare to affirm this for certain; when I have more certain information, I will share it. The 7 Cantons have hurried to Valais; I understand that envoys have been sent.</p>
      <p>Today, the Gospel of Christ has no more hostile enemies throughout Europe than those Five Cantons, to whom the people of Fribourg and Solothurn join themselves; they would gladly draw the people of Glarus to themselves. The number of the faithful in Valais is growing greatly; therefore, those enemies of Christ think they must act in time, lest they wish to do too late what they are now attempting. But He lives, who has crushed all the persecutors of the world; may He therefore crush these too or kindly convert them to Himself.</p>
      <p>The people of Bern have also sent their envoys, but I doubt whether it is in time. From France, they spread rumors that new tumults are constantly arising against the Guise.</p>
      <p>The Pope is thinking of reinstating the council; now he has a conflict with the Caracci, whom he has almost all thrown into prison. He is preparing enemies for himself everywhere, lest his reign be long in the name of all devils.</p>
      <p>May the Lord our God deliver us from these devils and beasts. Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 27, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>May our Matthias and other good men be safe, etc. To my beloved lord and brother Master Ambrosius Blarer, at this time in Winterthur.</p>
