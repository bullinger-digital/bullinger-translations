      <p>I kindly ask you, dear godfather, to greet both my lords, Mr. Landammann Schüler and Mr. Fridli Hässy, bailiff, etc., on my behalf, with the indication of my willing services, and that I have settled the costs incurred with the transport of both barrels of wine, as my lord bailiff from Bern, Mr. Steiger, recommended to me, and also to inform Mr. bailiff and thank him sincerely in your name, etc. Joß Meyer sent me a note with the following content: "What I have spent on Mr. Landammann Schüler's wine: 6 β to unload at the Salt House, 6 β to transport to my house, 6 β to put in my cellar, 6 β to load back onto the ship, 30 β to the boatmen up to the Ziegelbrugg. For Mr. Captain Hässy's wine, I have spent 1 pound 4 β." So I have given you, Mr. godfather, 3 French thick coins, to cover Mr. Hässy's transport costs, and finally, I gave Caspar Millten for my lord Landammann Schüler, which he spent, 2 French thick coins. Total 7 pounds 18 β.</p>
      <p>And as I have settled everything properly, I am also paid and satisfied regarding this debt, etc.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger.</p>
