      <p>To the most illustrious men Wolfgang Musculus, Dusano, my compatriot, Peter Martyr, the Italian, John Calvin, and Heinrich Bullinger and colleagues, Franciscus Stancarus of Mantua sends greetings in Christ. I inform you, most reverend men and brothers in the Lord, whom I have always held in the highest esteem, that the Arian and Eutychian heresies have been spread and planted in this kingdom of Poland under your name by certain deceivers, which I report to you with great sorrow. How and by whom this has been done, you will easily learn from this messenger, whom the noble Poles send to you with writings from both parties with reverence. He is Christophorus of Lviv, a young man both pious and learned, my disciple, who will fully inform you about the whole matter.</p>
      <p>But to briefly reveal to you the essence of the whole affair, listen. Here the Arians teach that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not one God but three gods, so separated from each other as three men are separated from each other, and that these three gods are three substances, three wills, and three separate operations like three separate spirits, as you will see more clearly and distinctly in the history we send to you. Furthermore, they teach that the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, is lesser than the Father in divine nature or according to divinity and that according to the same, he was without beginning, that is, from eternity, and is and will be, that is, without end, a priest, pontiff, and mediator, but according to humanity, a victim and sacrifice. They say and proclaim both publicly and privately that this faith, or rather these heresies and delusions, indeed blasphemies, are yours and that you are united with them in this doctrine, by which they have bewitched and corrupted many under your name. And when we have shown from your published writings that you do not think so, but rightly with the orthodox and catholic church, they, on the other hand, show some letters, both printed and handwritten, which they claim are from you, which seem to express a different opinion, and they openly say that you have recanted and retracted this doctrine of the Trinity and mediator, which we cannot be persuaded of by any means. These Arians also said that they have sent this confession of their faith to you several times and that it has been approved by you, which we do not believe at all.</p>
      <p>With these deceptions and lies, they have filled the ears of some nobles and ministers both in Lesser and Greater Poland as well as in Lithuania, Russia, and elsewhere with this persuasion, so that it could hardly be eradicated. And all this has been done under your name and doctrine.</p>
      <p>As for me, when I opposed their madness when called upon, I was tyrannically proscribed by them through a synod (as you will see in the history) along with three bachelors, and they seek my life. For I defend this doctrine and catholic faith concerning the Trinity and mediator, which the whole world has received and approved from the word of God not once, and continues to receive and approve, namely that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one sole and true God, of one essence, one will, and one operation, and that our Lord Jesus Christ, true God and true man, is our pontiff, priest, and mediator according to humanity only, according to divinity or with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and the author of priesthood and pontificate and mediation, as is openly held in the sixth synod of Constantinople, actions 4, 8, 10, 16, and 18. In a few words, most illustrious men, I have outlined the essence of the whole matter to you.</p>
      <p>It remains for you, in your faith and piety towards God and your honor and dignity, to write back to these noble Polish men about this whole matter so clearly, eloquently, and perspicuously that they may be made certain and not remain in doubt. For neither I nor others doubt the integrity of your faith, far from it, nor do we write to you because we are ignorant of what is to be believed or rejected, not at all. But whatever we do, both in writing and sending to you, we do entirely to assist certain simple and weak people, both nobles and ministers, who greatly trust in your pieties; for they place no, absolutely no faith in us, so bewitched are they by these Arians. To lessen your labor, although we do not doubt that you are prompt and ready to resolve these and other questions, we have nevertheless collected both our and your opinions and authorities on these two articles into one and send them to you, so that you may more easily and quickly send back and respond to our messenger. We therefore ask and respectfully request you not to be burdened to write us your opinion, whether you approve the faith of those Arians or ours concerning the Trinity and mediator; for there is no middle ground.</p>
      <p>And we ask this of you for the sake of those simple ones, as we have said, who adhere to you. It is also your duty to defend both your faith, which you have in your published writings, and your honor against those Arians who have spread and continue to spread these heresies under your name, to the insult of the entire most holy Trinity and the ruin of the catholic faith and the perdition of souls. If you do this, as we firmly hope you will, you will honor the holy Trinity with a great sacrifice and win these noble weak men for Christ, and you will do something very pleasing to us all by procuring the health and peace of these churches. We, in turn, will strive to repay you this favor for this benefit in whatever matter we can. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most esteemed brothers, and pray to God for us, that he may deliver us from heretics and heresies and restore these churches to the health of the catholic faith. Given at Dubiecz on the 4th of December in the year of our Lord 1560.</p>
      <p>Devoted to your pieties, Franciscus Stancarus of Mantua, by my own hand, etc.</p>
