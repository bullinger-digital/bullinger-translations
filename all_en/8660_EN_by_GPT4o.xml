      <p>My friendly greetings and entirely inclined willing service be with you at all times, honorable and especially gracious sir; I would be very pleased to hear of your and your family's good health and well-being. Know also that, praise be to God the Lord, I have returned home safely, and I am deeply grateful for all the honors and goodwill shown to me and my brother-in-law by you, and I acknowledge my obligation to reciprocate in another way. Since my return home, I have received 2 letters from you, and I have also received the package of books through Hans Leiner, which I have handed over to Mr. Dürnhofer. He is writing back to you with this response and has also provided me with a package of books. I will arrange to send this to Hans Leiner in St. Gallen at the first opportunity. Regarding the letters and money from Poland, I have neither seen letters nor money, whatever good Jaske has deposited; he will surely make himself paid in Krakow. Furthermore, I have learned with special joy that you and your people have returned home fresh and healthy from the spa, although you were somewhat weak upon departure; may the dear God keep you longer with the Christian church according to His will. Regarding Jacob Wolf, he has come here. I have spoken with Dr. Volcker about him; he has taken him in for a four-week trial. However, there is not much to learn in surgery here, as the barbers mainly practice it alongside their craft here. I am also writing to his father about all this; I will do my best for him as much as possible. In Mr. Dürnhofer's letter, you will learn about all sorts of disputes with our claimants and criers; it is more about their ambition than about Christian love, lacking in their will to incite the common people. Regarding news from Venice, you will have better information than we do; I am unfortunately concerned that the wrath of God is kindled against them. For now, please accept my letter with love, as I have written it in haste; I will write to you further at the first opportunity, with that you and yours are commended to the dear God.</p>
      <p>Dated Nuremberg, September 3, 1571. Your willing servant Gabriel Schlüsselberger.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my gracious lord, in Zurich.</p>
