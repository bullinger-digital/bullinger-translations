      <p>Greetings. You should neither be sad nor sorrowful, dear brother, since you clearly see the Lord granting you victory against His enemies. Continue bravely on the path of God and refute those who err and their errors. May the Lord grant you strength and abilities and keep you from evil! I read with pleasure what you wrote; however, with some pain piercing me, that the ministers of the church, from whom you should expect the best, have not yet reached the point where they can judge between true and false, and finally openly defend false doctrines and sectarians. May the Lord bring them back! The matters disputed among you, I discuss not so much in the book against the Anabaptists as in the Decades, where I explain the Decalogue. If he resigns from office, let him resign; the Lord will provide another minister, more learned and better. I understand that the magistrate does not fully understand the business in the church of Christ, as well as some other things. He is a bad teacher who has not himself been rightly taught beforehand. I await what else you will write and how the case will turn out. If it seems to you that it would be fruitful to write to him, I will write as soon as I understand what you think. Privately, you will encourage the honorable councilors to do their duty; for unless these beginnings are seriously addressed, you will soon have inexplicable disturbances, which you may not even see or fear now. But the same has happened to others in other places, who never believed it would happen to them, but later, when it did happen, they not only grieved over it but were entangled in many inconveniences, so that they could hardly extricate themselves. Therefore, be vigilant. I have received no news from France or elsewhere. I await what will be brought from Frankfurt. Meanwhile, farewell. I will write more extensively another time; I have written these to you with difficulty now. Always indicate whether mine have been delivered to you; I always fear they may be lost; you will therefore free me from that anxiety if you indicate that you have received them. Then write, I ask, more clearly and better; for I could barely read your last ones.</p>
      <p>Again and again, farewell. May God strengthen you in His holy work!</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, 22nd of September, 1570.</p>
      <p>Greet all our people in order; mine also greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
