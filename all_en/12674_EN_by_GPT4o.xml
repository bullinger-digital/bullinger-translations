    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Von Cham received Bullinger's sad news [not preserved]. He feels strong compassion for the afflicted [Protestants]. May God grant them strength and the ability to successfully resist Emperor [Charles V].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It seems as if he is too dangerous and too cunning for the [Schmalkaldic League]. He has entrenched himself in advantageous positions so far and has refused to engage in battle. He only left his entrenchments when he could harm the [Schmalkaldic League], although von Cham would have expected that they would have gotten to know him better over time and defended their strategic positions more efficiently...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The [Schmalkaldic League] probably thought that the Emperor would dare a battle if they attacked him. But he never intended to. He focuses solely on capturing some cities and, above all, intimidating the [Schmalkaldic League] with cruel retaliatory strikes, while he continues to wait for a good opportunity to launch a new attack. Hopefully, the [Schmalkaldic League] has learned to counter his schemes better.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Von Cham thanks again for the letter and would like to reciprocate. This war worries him more than all his official duties!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] May God bring everything to a good end and protect Bullinger and his family.</p>

      <p>Honorable and well-learned, especially gracious, dear sir, my friendly greetings and entirely willing service be with you always. Dear sir, I have received the new, distressing news you sent me and feel great compassion and pity for the pious, honest (righteous) people who are being so miserably afflicted (plagued). May Almighty God comfort them and grant the Christian estates grace, strength, and wisdom so that they may resist their enemy, so that they and we do not become further victims of these tyrants and their followers.</p>

      <p>Therefore, dear Master Heinrich, it seems to me and I am concerned that the Emperor is too swift and cunning with his intrigues against our people. He has so far placed himself in a great advantage, and has not wanted to deliver a battle to our people. He has also never left his advantageous positions unless he has, through his intrigues and treachery, inflicted some damage on our people, whereupon I would have thought that our people should have learned to recognize him and should have occupied and secured the strategic and useful places better!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>However, I think they meant well. They thought that if they attacked him, he would deliver a battle. But since he has never intended to do so, and as he has captured several cities and attempted to capture others, especially with the cruel punishments, as you have written to me, he intends to bring fear and terror to the people. And if he could proceed according to his will (may God prevent it), he would probably, at a time convenient for him, launch a further attack, where I think our people will now take better care in the future, so that with God's help they will thwart his full intrigues.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Therefore, dear Master Heinrich, I thank you once again for your diligent writing. I can well recognize that it is a burden to you and that you are loaded with many affairs. But since you are so willing, it pleases me very much. God knows that I wish I could repay you for it. I tell you truly, this war gives me more to worry about than all my affairs that I bear.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>May the Lord God bring everything to a good end according to His grace! May He also always protect and preserve you and your household in His gracious care. Given at Kyburg, on the 16th of October. Your entirely willing servant B. von Cham.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, my dear lord and friend.</p>
