    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Vadian was very pleased with Bullinger's last letter [not received]. He rejoices because the Lord reveals His mercy even in the greatest hopelessness and thereby proves that, according to the promise of His Son, He will not abandon His Church. Nevertheless, Vadian fears that some, shocked by the current situation, may begin to doubt [God and the Church]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] It is certain that on March 2, Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony defeated up to 4000 men and thus almost the entire cavalry and infantry of the imperial commander Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach near Rochlitz (about six miles from Leipzig). The Margrave, along with three companions and some other nobles, was captured. The terrified enemies are now completely unsettled. Moreover, [they fear] that something terrible awaits them with Sultan Suleiman. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Vadian, however, finds comfort in the good relations among the Confederates. He is also pleased with the plans of the French King Francis I. Even the Apostle [Paul] noted that God sometimes uses impure people to promote the Gospel. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] Hieronymus Sailer is back in Augsburg. However, he has left his wife [Felicitas, n√©e Welser] and some of his children in St. Gallen. Therefore, Vadian has just informed him by letter what, in Bullinger's opinion, should be done in the matter of [Hans] Muntprat, well known to Sailer. Surely, Sailer will completely settle Muntprat's debts and gladly assist this amiable old man. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Vadian returns the letter from the city of Constance, as well as Bullinger's learned treatise "De ira domini et persecutione," in which Vadian was able to note with gratitude how excellently the last topic treated there was presented, and this without Bullinger being prompted by him. He had long believed that persecution should be regarded as a companion of the cross. It is not only to be understood as a punishment for our sins. It also serves to ensure that we, who will partake in the glorious fate of Christ in the hereafter, are already conformed to the humbled earthly Christ here on earth. The chief apostles already emphasized that persecution serves to discipline and test us, to prepare us for the future certain victory. The pastors of St. Gallen believe that Bullinger's treatise should be printed, as such a publication would remedy the weakness of many people. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Greetings, also to the mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab. </p>

      <p>Greetings. I was greatly delighted by your recent letters, most learned Bullinger, and I rejoice in our Lord with unwavering faith, because in the most desperate situations, the Lord our God continually reveals extraordinary examples of His mercy, showing openly that He will not abandon His Church. He indeed promised this in His Son; however, I fear that there may be some among our ranks who, shaken by the current state of affairs, might give way to doubt.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It is certain that Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony has defeated the cavalry and infantry of Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, the leader of the imperial forces, numbering up to four thousand, with nearly all lost and Albrecht himself captured along with three companions and several other nobles. The battle took place on March 2nd near the town of Rochlitz, which is six miles from Leipzig, and it was fought in such a way that it is certain the terrified adversaries are now hesitant and uncertain about what should be done in the future. Everyone proclaims and laments the terrible threat of the Turks. I find great comfort in the mutual goodwill of the Swiss and am very pleased with the plans of the French King Francis I. His efforts will benefit our religion. Just as some promoted the Gospel through impure motives, as the Apostle says, yet they still promoted it; so too will he, with God providing for our affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Lord Sailer has gone to Augsburg with his wife and some of his children left in St. Gallen. I have therefore written to him today about what you think is best to do in the matter of Muntprat. I am convinced that he will completely settle the sum of that debt and sincerely assist the amiable old man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I also return to you the letter from the city of Constance and the most learned treatises "De ira domini et persecutione," etc., and I thank you for so richly treating that latter topic without my prompting. Indeed, persecution has always seemed to me to be a certain companion of the cross, which the Lord has placed upon the shoulders of His Church, not only as a punishment for sin, which indeed brings certain retribution, but also as an imitation of Himself, that is, of the previously humbled Christ, so that we, who are to be conformed to His glorious body in the future world, may also be conformed in this world to His body subject to sufferings and pressures. Furthermore, the chief apostles write that it pertains to discipline and testing: to discipline, so that we are not excessively carried away by prosperous successes and become sluggish in the midst of the struggle, and to testing, so that we may stand firm in the fight and also raise ourselves to certain victory. Our pastors wish to bring to light what you have written in this regard; it will help remedy the weakness of many.</p>

      <p>Farewell, and please commend me in many ways to Mr. Lavater and Mr. Haab.</p>
