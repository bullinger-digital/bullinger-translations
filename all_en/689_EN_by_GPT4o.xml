      <p>Our friendly greetings and all good things beforehand.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, honorable, wise, especially gracious, dear sir and good friend. The priest of Lenzburg, our Christian, has approached us pleadingly on behalf of his son Hans, who is studying in Zürich, so that we might take him in at our expense, educate and employ him; for he has good hope that he will become useful and virtuous to us. Since we do not know the young man at all, and therefore cannot know how he conducts and behaves himself, and whether we should comply with the father's good hope in this matter, we kindly request from you to inform us about the young man's conduct and prospects, how he is doing, etc., so that we may know how to proceed. Hereby you show us a friendly service, to which we are willing to reciprocate. With this, we commend you to God Almighty in faithfulness.</p>
      <p>Dated September 26, 1549.</p>
      <p>The Mayor and Council of Bern.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, honorable, wise Heinrich Bullinger, our especially dear sir and good friend. Zürich.</p>
