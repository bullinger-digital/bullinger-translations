      <p>Greetings. As far as the translation of your books on the grace of God is concerned, I wrote to you a little while ago from Neuburg, hoping that my letters have now reached you. I will send the expenses of my Jonas to Hieronymus Papus in Lindau; he can undoubtedly send the money to Zurich securely and safely. In the meantime, please appease my creditors with gentle words.</p>
      <p>Doctor Gereon Sailer, the physician, says that he has found a tutor for his son from your city, who is now being called back to his homeland for the ministry of the gospel. Since I intend to entrust my Jonas to Gereon's care for a few months and to have him study with his son, I beseech you to either allow the former tutor to remain in Augsburg longer or to send someone else to us in his place, whose services can educate the boys. We will compensate him for his efforts. Farewell. Written very quickly from Augsburg on the 20th of March in the year 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Fr√∂lich from Lomnitz.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned and pious lord Heinrich Bullinger, head of the Christian Church in Zurich, my dear lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
