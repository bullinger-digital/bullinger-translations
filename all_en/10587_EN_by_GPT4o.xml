      <p>I, Heinrich Schlittler, bailiff in the Ergau, currently at home in Niederurnen, and the entire community of Niederurnen, etc., offer you our most friendly and willing service beforehand, dear Master Heinrich.</p>
      <p>We inform and let you know that we have been lacking a preacher for a long time; for our preacher has departed from us through death. And it is our friendly request to you, that you would be so kind as to help us with another one. We will be grateful to you for this.</p>
      <p>And our request and desire is now for Herr Augustin, that you would kindly send him to us. This is now especially our request to you, and if we as an entire community can be of service to you, we will be eager to do so. Nothing more, then we commend ourselves to God.</p>
      <p>Given at Niederurnen, in the land of Glarus, on the Tuesday after Laetare, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Bailiff Schlittler and the entire community of Niederurnen.</p>
