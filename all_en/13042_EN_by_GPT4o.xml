    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian has received back the collection of documents [about the events in Prague] that he had sent to Bullinger [with No. 2989] [with No. 2992]. It is pleasing that Bullinger has already been informed about these events by others, especially since such communications are valuable to him and his associates. What particularly pleased Vadian, however, is that Bullinger showed him the same gratitude as to the informants who had preceded him! Since, according to the proverb, one can never be cautious enough, Vadian will continue to inform Bullinger at his request.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The shipment intended for Ambrosius Blarer [not received] by Bullinger has been forwarded by Vadian. What Bullinger informed him about the events in Constance and Augsburg, he did not yet know. Bullinger can count on his discretion. Here he sends back the two sheets with thanks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In St. Gallen, several rumors about an alliance of Bern [with France] are circulating. If this is true, it is likely a kind of preparation for the alliance that the French King Henry II is currently trying to conclude with the other Swiss cantons. Vadian would welcome the king with open arms if he committed to also coming to the aid of [the Protestant cantons] should they be attacked because of their faith. Without mutual assistance, neither France nor the Swiss Confederation will be able to withstand Emperor Charles V. It would be advantageous if the Swiss cantons did not negotiate separately but together and pursued a common plan, so as not to give the impression of disunity to the emperor, who might thereby be prompted to a bold undertaking against them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Vadian has allowed the St. Gallen Steucheler to ride to Zurich in disguise and together with a colleague [...] to provide entertainment there until the coming Sunday [August 21] [during the shooting festival]. Bullinger should keep this to himself so that the surprise succeeds.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Ten o'clock in the morning, only an hour after Bullinger's letter [No. 2992] has arrived.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have received what I sent, most learned man, and I am very glad that you have already received all these things from others with the same care and diligence. For they are such that it is worthwhile for you and through you for yours to know them. And indeed, for this reason alone, it is far more pleasing to me to be understood as the last to inform you than if I were understood to be the first; for you have equal gratitude for him who wished to inform you, had not another anticipated him, and for him who made it so that the diligence of others was not needed. Meanwhile, the solid German proverb remains: "Good caution never comes too much." Therefore, I will be no less diligent in informing you (since you so command) than I have been before.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have taken care to deliver your package to Lord Ambrosius Blarer with utmost fidelity. I was completely unaware of what you informed me about Constance and Augsburg, nor should you doubt my loyalty to you in any way. I return both sheets and thank you greatly.</p>

      <p>There is much rumor among us about the alliance of Bern, but nothing certain. If it is so, I indeed interpret it as a kind of preparation for the alliance that the King of France is seeking with the remaining cantons. However, it would seem advisable to me to embrace the French king with open arms, as it is said, provided he (as I hear) would not abandon those sought for the sake of religion; for without mutual assistance, neither the French can bear the emperor nor the Swiss. But in this deliberation, it would indeed be best for the cantons to be separated as little as possible, to unite rather and act with unanimous counsel, so that no suspicion of discord could confirm his insolence in any part.</p>

      <p>Our Steucheler will ride to Zurich by Sunday in disguise and with a colleague to provide entertainment for the good lords and companions (at the shooting festival), etc.; I have allowed him along with his companions. However, let it remain with you, so that he appears unexpectedly (surprisingly).</p>

      <p>From St. Gallen, on the 17th day of August, at the 10th hour of the day, when your letter was delivered to me at the 9th hour, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most distinguished Antistes of the Church of Zurich.</p>
