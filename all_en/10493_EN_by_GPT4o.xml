    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the dedication of the "Epitome" and the copy delivered by the printer Christoph Froschauer. Blarer has expressed hopeful views about the Reformation in Württemberg, about Osiander, Melanchthon, and Grynäus. Sends a booklet by Bucer and one of his own and asks for Vadian's opinion on Bucer's. Opposed the efforts of the Abbot of St. Gallen to remove reformed pastors. The bailiff of Frauenfeld, Christoph von Sonnenberg, persecutes the evangelical confession.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You bind me, esteemed man, with many benefits, and I acknowledge that I owe you much. You have inscribed to me the "Epitome," both most pious and most learned, at the reading of which the most learned are utterly astonished. They so admire those rare gifts of the Lord in you. Thanks to the Lord, who gave them to you, partly so that through you, He might greatly benefit His church, and partly so that He might grant you eternal and immortal glory among the saints. Furthermore, the bookseller, by your order, presented me with the "Epitome," for which I return to you the greatest thanks. I will indeed hold it dearer, as the memory of you and your name is more sacred to me. May the Lord preserve you for us through long ages!</p>
      <p>Blaurer writes these days that he has recanted nothing. He confesses the same with us, that in the supper, the body of the Lord is eaten by the faithful in the manner that faith is accustomed, etc. He writes that he desires nothing in the prince, hoping that things will turn out excellently. Osiander is now acting in Stuttgart, who is now endowed with a somewhat milder spirit than before. They expect Philipp Melanchthon and Simon Grynaeus. Melanchthon wrote very amicably to Bucer, offering friendship. Osiander offered the same. I send you Bucer's booklet "On Christian Doctrines" against the insults of Abricensis, as well as our booklet "On Both Natures in Christ." Some of ours are received into the ministry of the word by the prince more willingly than others. In short: Ambrosius promises the best, Bucer promises the best. Indicate what you think of his booklet.</p>
      <p>I am moving every stone, attempting everything, to resist the efforts of Antronius among us and to teach the retention of the ministers of the word. Would that I might achieve much! There are those who have almost despaired. There are those who act more wisely. The people of the mountains are exceedingly proud. The bailiff of Frauenfeld, Christoph von Sonnenberg, does not sluggishly persecute our religion. May the Lord be present to those who call upon Him!</p>
      <p>Live and farewell. There was no time to reread.</p>
      <p>October 16, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most prudent Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed patron.</p>
