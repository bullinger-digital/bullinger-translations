      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you, dear friend. We have received your letter, written to us on the eighth of July, along with the news, and we understand that we must await the peace at Passau, whether it is made or not, as well as all other matters in the Almighty's providence, praying for His glory and our soul's salvation. As for the letter, since you request to have it delivered to the old Lord Jacob through our servant, we are inclined to do so graciously; however, you undoubtedly know well how we have had to manage with few servants in our current situation, and of those we could send, one has recently departed from us, some have been sent here and there on various errands, and one has just returned home; we daily expect to have them at hand for our unavoidable duties, especially at this time, and to dispatch them as required. Moreover, we have graciously communicated the instructions to the aforementioned Lord Jacob, who has indicated that he will follow the instructions and seek our cousin Duke Christoph, who, as we are informed, is not in Tübingen but traveling here and there according to his pleasure and is currently uncertain to be found. Thus, even if we were to send a servant, it is doubtful, and we are certain, that you would not receive a response in this matter within eight days. Therefore, we cannot comply with your request this time. If the church, which would like a response from Lord Jacob within eight days, can bear this with patience in its situation, as we believe one Christian should with another, we will arrange for your letter to be sent to Tübingen at the earliest opportunity, so that it may reach him if he is there. We wanted to inform you of this in response to your letter, graciously; for we are inclined to your favor. Dated Schaffhausen, the 9th of July, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] o[f] Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
