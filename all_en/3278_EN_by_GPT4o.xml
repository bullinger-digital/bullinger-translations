      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, dearest brother in the Lord Bullinger, in which you ask me what I think about the confession of Mr. Farel and Beza, written this summer in Göppingen about the Lord's Supper and presented to the Prince of Württemberg. When you sent it here to Mr. Haller, my compatriot, I could hardly believe that such a thing had been done by these two dearest brothers in the Lord. But now, since our Calvin sent it, received from Beza himself, to Peter Martyr, I am greatly distressed and wonder intensely what necessity compelled them to compose such a confession without at least the knowledge of the principal colleagues and to preface it with the title that it is taught in this manner in the Swiss and Savoyard churches. These two brothers are worthy of being held in esteem, both for their piety and learning, and because the elder one, a veteran soldier of Christ, has served the cause of propagating the truth faithfully and skillfully for many years, not without fruit. Therefore, their action disturbs me all the more, as they have created trouble either for us or for themselves, if the colloquium is to proceed, which makes me embrace them all the more lovingly in the Lord. However, what they write about the substance of Christ, namely his flesh and blood, and his presence in the supper, in my judgment, provides more material for a dispute, which could be stirred up among us, rather than for reconciliation with the Lutheran brothers. Therefore, I do not approve of such expressions, just as I do not approve of the statement that the manner of this presence is known only to God and yet is said to be believed by us.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours entirely in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
