    <p xml:id="regest1">Meyer undoubtedly stirred up the spirits of the [Zürich pastors] and not only brought a great disgrace upon himself but also upon the profession and harmed the church. However, he has recognized his grave guilt and has repented. - He asks the people of Zürich to forgive him like the prodigal son, according to Christ's admonition to forgive one another; for the Lord has also forgiven him, as he feels the power of the Holy Spirit stronger than ever before. - He also asks to be readmitted to the synod. - If the [people of Zürich] forgive him as the Lord has done, they will not regret it. - May the Holy Spirit fill the hearts of the [people of Zürich] and protect them from evil. - [Entry by Bullinger in the "Acta synodi" of May 5, 1545:] Lorenz Meyer, formerly pastor at Stammheim, has answered for the accusation of abortion and served a prison sentence for his adultery in the [Zürich] Wellenberg Tower. From Bavaria, he brought good testimonials from the councils of Duke Ottheinrich, preachers, and officials. Therefore, they approached the [Zürich] authorities with a request to keep him longer. This was granted, and the synod of Zürich readmitted Meyer at his request.</p>

      <p>To the holy congregation of the servants of God, bishops, doctors, and evangelists of the churches of the Zürich region, peace and steadfastness through Christ our Savior.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt, most excellent men and brothers, that I have greatly disturbed your spirits, having been overcome and oppressed by many temptations, and that I have branded not only myself but also your most honorable order with a significant mark, and have offended both your churches and my own, and have almost been a common plague to all. Punished by the hand of God and severe judgment, I have paid the penalty and borne the heavy burden of my sin, so that I might be awakened from the sleep of impiety, recognize my sin, and repent. I know and acknowledge with absolute certainty that all these things have happened.</p>
      <p>It came to my mind, and I decided to offer my letters to your candor, so that they might speak with you in my place and plead for the guilty hero.</p>
      <p>I have sinned, brothers, I have acted badly, I repent. Forgive the wretched one for the offense I have committed against you all, not forgetting the words of the Lord, which urge us to forgiveness, so that we may be easy to appease and forgiving towards those who, led to a better mind, have sincerely repented and seek pardon. For I have been convinced by many most certain signs and arguments that the Lord has been reconciled to me and has erased the offense with His great mercy, among which is not the least that I feel in myself a greater force and power of the divine spirit than ever before. Indeed, I have endured more labor in a short time in divine matters, not without, as I hope, great fruit than before in a longer time. Nevertheless, I write these things to inform you of the clemency and love of the deity towards me, with which He embraces me, a wretched one, and to incline and soften your spirits towards the forgiveness of the lost son, your former comrade-in-arms, and even today your most devoted one.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the world has nothing that I desire more than for your forgiveness and former goodwill towards me to be renewed, raised, and recovered.</p>
      <p>Therefore, by the mercy of God, I beseech you all, bowels of compassion, hear the wretched and tearful one, forgive, receive, be reconciled to me, mindful of human weakness. What is easier than to fall? Bend the severity of judgment into kind forgiveness, I beseech you, do not be harsh, but easy, humane, and kind to remit the offense, so that I, a wretched one, may hear joy and gladness: that the holy synod has returned to grace with me and been reconciled. O most desired voice! O blessed hour and most fortunate day, a happy message, letters worthy of many kisses narrating: "You have found grace, you have been reconciled, your affairs have been brought to port, it has been dealt with more gently with you!" This now, most excellent men, I wish with the most ardent prayers and supplications: Receive him whom the Lord has saved. Forgive him whom the Lord has forgiven. Give peace to him whom the Lord has helped, so that he could scatter this most sorrowful war of Satan and avoid his snares. You will indeed do a work worthy of your profession before the Lord and most pleasing to me. And if I have anything in the future that I can offer you, I will take care diligently.</p>
      <p>But may the God of all hope and consolation fill your hearts with His holy spirit and guard you, lest you fall into temptation, but deliver you from evil. Amen. May the spirit of Christ always be with you. Be mindful of me and forgive, so that your errors may also be forgiven through the mercy of God.</p>
      <p>Lorenz Meyer (Agricola).</p>
      <p>In the "Acta synodi, held on Tuesday, which was the 5th day of May, in the year of our Lord 1545" (Zürich StA E II 1, 311-316), Bullinger writes (f. 315f): Lorenz Meyer, formerly pastor at Stammheim.</p>
      <p>He has excused himself before our lords for the accusation of abortion, so that they are well at peace and have given him a letter and seal. He has also done penance for his adultery in the Wellenberg according to the statute. He also brought good testimonials and recommendations from Bavaria from the councils of Duke Ottheinrich, preachers, and officials, that he has conducted himself well and accomplished much useful work; therefore, they have written to our lords and have requested further, which has been willingly granted to them for a year or more, etc. Since he also earnestly requested to be reconciled to the synod, he has been received and favored again in a general synod as a penitent and Christian brother.</p>
