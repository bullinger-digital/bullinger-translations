      <p>I received your letters, my father, along with the German translation of that Defense, which I immediately sent to the Lord Admiral, to commend to him the zeal and diligence of your church as well.</p>
      <p>As I indicated in my last letters, when he saw the Guises coming to court with such pomp to seek what they call justice from the king, he first offered himself, through his brother, formerly a cardinal, now Count of Beauvais, to appear voluntarily before all impartial judges whenever it pleased His Majesty.</p>
      <p>If they preferred to settle the matter by arms, he, along with his two brothers, relying on their innocence, would fight either separately or together with as many Guises, if it pleased His Majesty.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, he also gathered his friends and relatives, who certainly responded so promptly that within eight days he assembled two thousand noble horsemen.</p>
      <p>The king, by his authority, ordered both sides to lay down their arms and each to return home, adding a penalty for those who did not comply.</p>
      <p>The Paris Senate was deprived of jurisdiction over the case, and judges were appointed from the so-called Great Council.</p>
      <p>Thus, there is great hope that with the enemy's plans exposed and broken, the Admiral will soon be completely freed.</p>
      <p>The king finally entered Paris and sharply rebuked the Senate and municipal magistrates.</p>
      <p>Weapons were taken from everyone, and chains, of which there are an infinite number there, were removed from the streets.</p>
      <p>Many are being investigated, and there is great hope that the leaders of the seditious will pay just penalties.</p>
      <p>We do not doubt that once the submission of the Parisians is heard, the other cities will also become more peaceful.</p>
      <p>The best and indeed incredible things are reported to us about the king.</p>
      <p>And certainly, unless he is corrupted, from such a character, which I myself have observed in him, the greatest things can be expected.</p>
      <p>The other churches are being peacefully and happily advanced.</p>
      <p>But in many places, the plague is so severe that it has already consumed the greater part of the cities.</p>
      <p>These are the scourges of the Lord, simultaneously destroying the wicked and chastising His own.</p>
      <p>Would that, with our sins finally erased, He would look upon us kindly and that we, in turn, would seriously repent.</p>
      <p>As for us personally; everything is well here by God's grace, except for the perpetual illnesses of our Calvin, whom I wish the Lord would soon restore to us.</p>
      <p>I am sorry for what you write about your catarrh, from which I hope you are now freed, and may I have wished well.</p>
      <p>We eagerly await what response the people of Basel will give us. Farewell, my most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe, along with all the brothers and colleagues, whom I bid to greet with you, and to persevere strongly to the end in the work of the Lord for the benefit of the whole church.</p>
      <p>Geneva, October 20.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>Many reports have long been brought about the death of the Duke of Savoy. However, I do not think he is dead.</p>
      <p>But I gather that there is little hope of life for him, from the fact that 32 companies of infantry are not far from Lyon, whom there is great suspicion will cross into Piedmont, although they are said to be sent against the still rebellious Provincials.</p>
      <p>A large part of them are from our people, so that there is nothing for the churches to fear.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed father, truly faithful pastor of the Zurich church.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
