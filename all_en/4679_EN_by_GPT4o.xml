      <p>Greetings. While our people were in Neuchâtel, among whom was our Diesbach, that bundle was brought in which copies of your books on councils were bound; therefore, we could not open it until he himself returned. Upon his return, he opened it and distributed the copies to us, for which I give you great thanks. I am also glad that you write that you will remember my request concerning Daniel.</p>
      <p>What was done in Neuchâtel, you might learn from Mr. Diesbach, who himself attended that meeting, or (though I do not know) our people might write to your magistrate about it.</p>
      <p>For at this hour, Diesbach informs me that if I wish to write to you, I should prepare the letters; for the messenger is about to leave immediately. But what he carries or what our people write, I do not know.</p>
      <p>This is the summary of what was done in Neuchâtel: At first, due to the high demand of the duke, no answer could be given, for my lords said they had to do what they did, and if he did not meet them otherwise, they could do nothing but commend the matter to God; they acted in a way that they hope can be well defended before all reasonable people. Thereupon, the duke's envoys pressed hard that they should engage in negotiations.</p>
      <p>Our people had no command to do so, and when they wanted to postpone it to another day, the duke's people insisted that something should be done, and they should seek orders from my lords. Therefore, the envoys excluded Mr. Diesbach and Mr. Steiger; they returned here on February 13 and informed my lords what they understood from the duke's people. Thereupon, they deliberated for two days, the 14th and 15th, and finally decided to conclude what they proposed. Thus, they rode back to Neuchâtel.</p>
      <p>The first question was who to choose as arbitrators, also about the place where they would meet, and the scribe who would sit there. The duke's people proposed as arbitrators the King of France, the King of Spain, the place named Solothurn or Baden, and as scribe the city scribe of Solothurn or the country scribe of Baden. The matter was again written back to my lords.</p>
      <p>Thereupon, the council and citizens met on February 18 and rejected both kings, as they are so closely related to the duke, as arbitrators, and there were various suggestions: 1. to propose the 11 impartial places of the Confederation; 2. since the 6 places are in alliance with the duke, they should not be included, for it is well known how they are disposed towards my lords; 3. they should not engage in any way unless the duke first relinquishes the land to my lords, etc. The first was the majority opinion; it was argued as best as possible: The Confederates had previously given a common judgment in the matter; if some places were now excluded, it would cause great displeasure. In summary: they must always be at the forefront and make peace for us, who are our greatest enemies. The places Solothurn and Baden, as well as the same scribes, were completely rejected, and instead Basel or Neuchâtel and also the same scribes were proposed. I hear Basel has been confirmed and another day has been set for May 10 next. The places will be written to and we will hear how it will go.</p>
      <p>The citizens here are very impatient and unwilling, now again against it. But easily (which I fear) they will be induced by the arts of others.</p>
      <p>I pray to God that He may intervene and interpose; otherwise, I fear much harm to many churches. I know well what they are aiming for; but I fear many will fall far short of their plans. From France, we hear other news again.</p>
      <p>Some say the edict of religious freedom has been lifted again; others say it is not valid, as it was issued only under the king's seal and not that of the crown or the imperial parliament. Some say the King of Navarre is as firmly in power as before.</p>
      <p>But I do not know it for certain yet.</p>
      <p>I hope Diesbach will write everything more clearly.</p>
      <p>I wrote these things very hastily, having been warned by him to write, and did not reread them; therefore, take it in good part and at least recognize my intention.</p>
      <p>I write nothing to my brother now; you can communicate this to him and greet him in my name along with all yours. Bern, February 25, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>I return those three miserable things.</p>
      <p>I also received the same from Glarus.</p>
      <p>I hope they will not be accepted by either side.</p>
      <p>I pray the Lord to provide otherwise for His church. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and most esteemed compatriot.</p>
      <p>The day in Neuchâtel in February and next in Basel on May 18, 1561.</p>
