      <p>Grace and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>There is no reason for you to be surprised, most excellent Bullinger, if in these days I have not sent you letters, except for those which I sent to you from the Chur of the Rhaetians. Do not think that I have done this because I have forgotten you or because I have no regard for you, since, as I hold you in the highest esteem, forgetfulness of you cannot occupy me. The reason for this was partly because there was no convenient messenger available, and mostly because my affairs were in such a state that I had nothing certain to write to you about. But now, when both convenient messengers are abundantly available and my affairs are in such a state that I can write something certain to you, I could not refrain from briefly informing you about these and other matters. And so that I may make you fully aware of everything and nothing may be hidden or escape your notice, know that after I sent my previous letters to you, I awaited with the greatest hopes the decree of those lords, or rather of God through their mouths. Finally, after many tricks and schemes were made and constructed by the adversaries against Christ and His gospel, especially by those who ought to have stood by our side, indeed who have always stood by us before, an edict was issued by the magistrate gathered and assembled there, that a certain decree previously made, that no preacher or Christian schoolmaster could remain in the Valtellina for more than three days, should be observed. "In the meantime, until the next diet, what will happen," you ask, "to us, who are neither public preachers nor schoolmasters?" They have decreed that this should be in the power of the communities, as they say, so that whichever opinion the majority departs to, that should prevail and be observed by all.</p>
      <p>I omit the most false slanders that reprobate men, already condemned in themselves, as Paul says, have particularly fabricated against my person. But let us return to the matter. I came to Tirano, truly according to its etymology: nowhere has greater madness against the gospel been seen. They present the edict to the praetor, as they say, according to custom. A council is held by all the citizens, not one alone for the gospel; all cry out for our destruction and that of the gospel. The praetor, who had already given his name to Christ for many years, confirms everything and corroborates it with his authority, indeed even with his seal. But if you ask where such a change in the man comes from, some say he was corrupted by money, others that he is trying to satisfy the Bishop of Chur; for he is his relative and kinsman. You will know the outcome of the matter.</p>
      <p>The praetor, now a slave either to money or to the bishop, has expelled these most excellent and outstanding men and women, who are now coming to you with my letters. He did this against all law and right, indeed even against the faith already given. But I, with my companion, am left alone; and they are also seeking my life. What will happen to me, I do not know. The Lord has not yet declared to me where His most righteous and just will inclines; as soon as it shines upon me, I will follow it. In the meantime, I preach on feast days; on other days, I read. - You have understood in what state my affairs are and how they stand. Now hear the rest: I commend to you these pious, faithful brothers, Christians in name and deed. I know well that they will be highly recommended to you on their own; nevertheless, you will do me a most pleasing favor if I understand that through my recommendation you have achieved and advanced something for them with you. What I ask of you is this: that you give them letters of recommendation to Master Calvin; for they intend to go there and think of living there. I would bind my faith to you if you were reluctant to give them these letters; but because I know you to be humane and to have some faith in me, I will refrain. I only ask you again and again to commend them to Master Calvin and other ministers of better note, whom they may meet on their journey.</p>
      <p>There is nothing to write to you about my books. For as long as the Lord has not declared His will to me, they can remain safely with you. Regarding my money, which that sewer has absorbed, I pray that you remind the host not to neglect this matter. I have written and I write that I will give him that part which you will order and decree. In my name, greet Master Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, Frisius, Gessner, Christoph, and all those good and pious men; especially commend us all, and me in particular, to your church, so that He may make us abound in every spiritual blessing. Our church greets you. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe. Amen. In Tirano, on the 5th day of October.</p>
      <p>Brother Celso Martinengo.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich and always most revered by me in the Lord Jesus.</p>
