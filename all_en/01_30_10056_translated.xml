  <input>Gratia tecum.

Remitto ad te librum illum tuum quidem, sed iam meum quoque factum tua dedicatione, charissime Heinryche, simul ac gratiam habeo diligentiae tuae non meo solum, sed omnium pie studiosorum nomine, quos tibi, mihi crede, tam sancto labore singulari quodam beneficio unice devinxisti, tametsi prius quoque devinctissimos. Ego profecto, posteaquam hunc magna voluptate et aviditate pellegi, non dignum modo, sed necessarium propemodum iudicavi, qui omnium manibus versaretur, quandoquidem hinc plane intelligent vel simplicissimi, in quam caducum murum inclinent isti quidam impudentes et inepti vetustatis iactatores, qui se putant omnium errorum suorum felicissimum patrocinium ab illis petere posse, qui Christi et apostolorum temporibus - - - p[rox]imiores [?] fuere, cum re diligentius perpensa adeo nos non premat illor [um au]thoritas, ut consentiat etiam nobiscum doctrinae ipsorum veritas, unde multa et inevitabilia tela in adversarios mutuemur. Fac igitur maturetur utilissimi libri omnibus profutura editio, nam quod ad typographum adtinet, non inviderem ingens hoc lucrum Spitzenbergio nostro, nisi multorum magis quam sui unius rationem haberem. Formulas habet parum elegantes, quarum hic ad te specimen mitto, praeterea hebraicis ac gręcis characteribus omnino destituitur, et quanquam meditatur iam instructiorem officinam, incertum est tamen pro hominis infelicitate, quando illa paretur. Nolim vero sui [!] compendii causa tot studiosorum expectationem diutius remorari, sed liberum tibi facio, ut vel Wolfio vel alii cuipiam librum hunc quamprimum excudendum committas, modo emendatior prodeat quam superior ille, qui tua recognitione opus habuit. Caeterum, mi dulcissime frater, nunc temporis spatio velim nolim excludor, quo minus ad te multa pro animi votis scribere possim. Sed paucis sic habe me, quantuluscunque sum, tuum esse nec unquam mihi quicquam gratius et iucundius fuisse tua illa syncęra amicicia, qua me tibi iunxit comunis in Christum, communem servatorem, ardor, iunxerunt itidem aliae honestissimae rationes cum occulta quadam, sed efficaci animorum consensione. Utinam sit aliquando, quo tibi per occasionem aliquam pectus hoc tui amantissimum declarare pariter et totum effundere possim! Nunc Christo me christianice commenda, in quo bene vale.

Ex Constantia nostra, calendis septembris. Saluta meis verbis venerabiles abbatem et oeconomum vestrum. Mox plura ad te scripsero; nunc casu incidi in tabell[ionem] Tyguricensem. Salutat te germanus frater meus Thomas. 28.

Tuus Ambrosius Blaurerus.

Heinrycho Bullingero apud Ceepellam [!] Tygurinorum, amico tanquam fratri charissimo.</input>
  <output>Greetings to you.

I am sending back to you your book, which has now become mine as well by your dedication, dearest Heinryche, and I thank you for your diligence not only on my own behalf but on behalf of all the devoutly studious, whom you have so singularly bound to yourself with your holy labor, though they were already very tightly bound. After I read it with great pleasure and eagerness, I not only deemed it worthy, but almost necessary, that it be circulated among all, for from it plain even the simplest can understand how frail a wall those certain shameless and foolish praters of antiquity lean on, who think they can obtain the most fortunate patronage for all their errors from those who were closest to the time of Christ and the apostles—when, on more careful consideration, their authority does not so oppress us that even their doctrine's truth agrees with us, from whence we can draw many and inescapable arrows against our adversaries. So do let the very useful edition of this book, which will be of benefit to all, be hastened, for as far as the printer is concerned, I would not begrudge our Spitzenberg enormous profit from this, were it not that I must take the interest of many more into account than his own. It has a few clumsy formulas, of which I am sending you a sample, also it is completely lacking in Hebrew and Greek characters, and although he is already making preparations for a better printing office, it is uncertain, however, unfortunately, when it will be ready. But I do not wish for the sake of his own expedience to delay any longer the expectation of so many students, so I leave it up to you to entrust the printing of this book to Wolf or someone else, as long as it is issued in a more correct form than the first one, which had need of your revision. Lastly, my sweetest brother, now I am excluded, whether I like it or not, from writing to you as much as I would wish from the depths of my soul. But understand this about me, however small I may be, that I am yours and never did I find anything more pleasant and agreeable than your sincere friendship, which united me to you in a common love for Christ and our common saviour, as well as other most honourable reasons, along with a certain hidden but effective harmony of souls. Would that there were some occasion by which I could make known and fully pour out my most loving heart to you! Now I commend myself to Christ in a Christian way, wishing you well.

From our Constance, on the 1st of September. Greet the venerable abbot and your steward with my words. I shall write more to you soon; just now I happened to bump into a courier from Tygurice. My brother Thomas sends his greetings.

Your Ambrose Blaurerus.

To Heinryche Bullinger at Ceepell Tygurinorum, a friend who is as dear to me as a brother.</output>
