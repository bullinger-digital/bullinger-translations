    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blankenheim does not know if the letter [not received], in which he expressed his gratitude for the hospitality shown to him in Zurich, ever arrived. Therefore, he thanks once again, as he does not want to appear ungrateful.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Rudolf [Funk] and the other [Zurich students in Marburg] will report on the current war turmoil and the plague in Hesse, as well as everything else.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blankenheim certifies that the students studied diligently during their studies, behaved decently, and did not indulge in excesses in drinking or otherwise. If only the other students would follow their example! May God continue to support these Zurichers in the future. It is probably unnecessary to ask Bullinger to promote them and remain favorably disposed towards them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The young Blankenheim may be forgiven for any inappropriate remarks in the present letter. He is happy to continue serving Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] Greetings to Rudolf Gwalther, Theodor Bibliander, as well as to all who once studied in Marburg.</p>

      <p>My entirely willing, unwearied service beforehand, venerable, highly learned, most gracious, commanding lord and beloved in Christ. I have previously written to your worthiness, in which I have expressed my utmost and most diligent thanks for the good deeds done to me, with the assurance that according to my limited ability, if I could, I would repay the same. Now I do not know if you have received that letter. If you have not received it, I wish to once again express my utmost gratitude for all the good, with the request not to attribute to me the vice of ingratitude for not having written to you more.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In what danger of war and death we sit in this land and what else is present, my special good friends, Rudolf [Funk] and the others, will report further to you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>So that you and other, my gracious lords, also have my testimony on how your envoys have behaved here, I give you to know by my truth and loyalty that during the time they were with us, they conducted themselves with their studies very diligently, piously, and decently. Would to God that our students studied and conducted themselves in a disciplined life as they did! For I have never been able to perceive any excessive drinking or any other excess from them. May God continue to grant them His grace so that they may continue to honor His divine majesty and do good to their neighbors. Therefore, I have requested most dutifully, although you will do so without this, to have them in favorable good promotion and recommendation, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>All this I did not want to withhold from your worthiness's dutiful good opinion. I ask, if I have written anything inappropriate, to consider it as coming from a young fellow and to understand it in the best way. For I am entirely willing and ready to serve you and yours according to my limited ability, and hereby commend myself to your worthiness, as to my lord. Given in Marburg, the 20th of February, in the year, etc., 47. Your willing servant Lorenz Blankenheim subscribed.</p>

      <p>If it would not trouble your worthiness, to greet my lord Gwalther, with the indication of all good, likewise Theodor Bibliander and other my lords who have been with us, I ask diligently to show them the same and to commend me to them as their servant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the divine word among the Zurichers, his lord never not to be honored.</p>
