      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church in Zürich, Taddeo Duno, physician, sends greetings.</p>
      <p>We have already written to you several times about the state of our church and about the threats and terrors made by our most illustrious lords of the Seven Republics. We have also written and assured you in various ways that we are not infected with Anabaptism, of which we were accused, nor with any other heresy, nor are we as our adversaries portray us. Therefore, nothing remains but to pray unceasingly to the Lord to deign to have mercy on our church and to direct the hearts of our lords to His glory and the salvation of our souls. We have understood that there is a danger threatening the alliance and society of all our lords because of us; whether this is the case or not, we truly do not know; but since it could happen, our church, having gathered the brothers, has decided to implore our lords not to expose themselves and their affairs to such great dangers on our account, but rather to commend all the care of our church to God and to preserve the old friendship among themselves. For we are certain that the Lord Himself will not neglect us, but will guard and support us wherever we are on earth. However, if you can bring us any assistance without harming your friendship, do so courageously, because this befits the faithful of Christ and fraternal charity demands it. What will ultimately happen and what end our cause will reach there, only the Lord knows; we are prepared to bear patiently, by God's grace, whatever persecutions He Himself places on our shoulders.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we doubt it will be necessary to leave our native lands and seek foreign lands, but we hope in the Lord that He will not leave us orphans nor forsake us with His grace and His spirit. I beseech you, commend us and our letters to our lords, and if possible, inform us of the dangers impending upon us. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, amen. Locarno, November 5, 1554.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed bishop of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
