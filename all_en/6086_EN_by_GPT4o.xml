      <p>Grace and Peace through Christ.</p>
      <p>Your letters have been delivered to me, most distinguished man, for which I give you the greatest thanks and I am glad that my response pleases you. As for the defense of the Augsburg Confession, I never undertook it with this intention, hoping that contentious quarrelers would cease to be like themselves, nor did I ignore that the true opinion about the Lord's Supper, which we profess together with you, is fortified by stronger testimonies of Scripture and antiquity than to need the support of the Augsburg Confession. But I have tried to show, as much as I can, that the adversaries deceive the unlearned populace with the mask of the Augsburg Confession and invent many things under its pretext daily, of which the Augsburg Confession does not mention even a single point. If we can persuade the public of this or at least render the Augsburg Confession contentious and disarm the adversaries with this prejudice, and reduce them to the point where they engage with us from the Scriptures, I believe much will be taken from them and much will be added to us.</p>
      <p>Necessity has driven us into these straits, from which I am very glad to hear that your churches are free. I hear that the people of Frankfurt have decided to remain silent; if they attempt anything, I hope a just defense will not be lacking for me.</p>
      <p>They have met me several times at this market, but with averted eyes, they pretended not to see me.</p>
      <p>I saw and bought the theses of Smedelinus, in which he plays with the terms Majesty and Economy, but I trust that the mask will be removed from him. I have not yet had the opportunity to read Brentius's majestic recognition, whose dreams will soon vanish. There were some other writings in Frankfurt sounding the trumpet, namely a booklet by Heshusius (who, although living in his homeland, calls himself an exile of Christ) against our Catechism, a brief writing by Illyricus against the sermons of Olevianus, a bitter and virulent writing by a certain preacher from Oppenheim against the papists and sacramentarians, dedicated to King Maximilian. These people seem to seek only one thing, that we move from books to arms, but I hope God will have mercy on His church. The Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg has requested a colloquium between his theologians and those of our prince about ubiquity and the Lord's Supper, which is expected to take place on the fifth of April, and I ask you not to cease praying that God may graciously direct it to the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Ochino, who unjustly but gravely slanders you, is traveling to Poland. Yesterday, Sebastian Pecchius was here with me, if I am not mistaken, the Pole well known to you, I believe, who brought me some new writings published in Poland, and took several copies to Basel, which you might be able to receive from Borrhaus, unless they have already been sent to you.</p>
      <p>In these writings, the people of Zurich, Geneva, and others are openly ridiculed, and the Lutherans are counted among the Zwinglians and papists, and indeed they are said to lack the foundation of the church, etc.</p>
      <p>There are three new tables.</p>
      <p>One has the image of the true church (as they think); in it, the foundation of the true church is the manifestation of the three in Matthew 3, while the false one is one God in three persons, one God in essence, etc. The second table teaches that in religion, extremes are always impious and heretical; in the middle is piety, which is one God the Father, one Lord Jesus, the Son of God, one Holy Spirit, in whom we cry: Abba Father, etc.</p>
      <p>The third shows the ways in which Satan has abolished the one true God, the Father of Christ, etc. Furthermore, the title of a certain booklet is: Tower of Babel; another is titled: A Song to John Calvin and the Pious Brothers, whose author is thought to be a certain Gribaldus; the title of the last one is: A Monitory Letter of Gregory Paul, Minister of Krakow, to the Ministers of Zurich and Calvin, where he also publishes his confession about God and the Son of God, then about the Holy Spirit against the slanderers.</p>
      <p>From these, you can easily gather what Satan is planning and what great disaster is to be expected for the church. May God have mercy on us for the glory of His name! Meanwhile, as long as we breathe, we will not cease to freely and steadfastly profess and defend the eternal truth, which has stood against the gates of hell until now and will continue to stand.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, most outstanding man, and do not hesitate to convey many greetings from me to the fellow ministers of the church of Zurich. Hastily, in Frankenthal, on the first of April, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your most loving and devoted Petrus Dathenus. To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and teacher in Zurich.</p>
