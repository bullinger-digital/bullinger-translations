      <p>S. P. D. I received your letter, most illustrious man and father in Christ, to be revered with the highest respect, in which you express your opinion on the book about the flesh of Christ. I would have responded sooner than I did, had I not been waiting for such letters from the Frankfurt market, from which I could have communicated something new. But I see from your letters, received from you yesterday, that you are by no means unaware of all those things which I intended to write as unknown. I entirely judge that the times are at hand, which seem to simultaneously bring about those great assemblies of the Lord Christ, which Daniel, Christ, and the apostles foretold. Therefore, I give you the greatest thanks for your humanity, for writing to us abundantly about the common calamities that are in view. This utmost diligence of yours, if nothing else, at least causes the pious to lift their heads and seek eternal deliverance with pious groans. All the winds, as many as philosophers count, if they were to make an assault on Germany with the greatest and combined forces, would not seem to me to bring as much evil as the furies and tumults that rush upon us from all sides. To say nothing of the other things you mention, I entirely agree with you that the Milanese army and the execution of the Council of Trent and the fasces of the empire are being sought. May the Lord, without whom no one can take anything for himself, deign to direct all things to the glory of His name and the salvation of the most afflicted church. Amen.</p>
      <p>As for the testimonies collected about the flesh of Christ, as I wrote before, so now I simply commend them to your judgment and will. I added the testimonies of Dr. Eber and Major, as they could not easily be refuted, to the rest, and in the preface, I touched on the part and reason they could be refuted, namely under the pretext of the omnipotence of God. But I hear the reason why you judge they should be omitted, and I willingly comply with your advice; for whoever is not moved by the preceding will not easily be moved by the votes of these.</p>
      <p>I did not add Brentius's treatise, as you can see from the form and comparison of the writing itself, to the opinions of others, so that it would be published together, but so that I might hear what you yourself think, although I see that the Heidelbergers have added the words of both Eber and Brentius to their protocol. Whether my name is explicitly expressed or entirely suppressed, as I also showed before, I do not care; for what I present is not mine, but belongs to the church and its lights. Therefore, in this too, you will do what seems best. If you are going to submit it to the press, you will let me know, so that it can also be published in German at the same time.</p>
      <p>It remains for me to modestly and reverently ask something of you in my name and in the name of the brothers. For many years, synods have been held among us, but with such negligence that what has been done and decreed in even the most serious matters is by no means retained by most, because no one has noted anything. Hence, quarrels sometimes arise among the brothers. The synod also lacks written statutes and canons, which it cannot do without altogether. Therefore, the brothers pray that you would at least be willing to communicate some general constitutions of your synods to us, so that we may extract from them those that will be useful for our use. Because we trust that this will be useful for establishing greater concord and union, we hope you will not reluctantly assist our simplicity in this part. I indeed wander here as if in a still unknown region, because I have not been involved in the affairs of the brothers until now, and in these thirty years, during which I have been absent, everything has been changed into another form and appearance. But so much for this; I pray to the Lord with all my heart that He may wish to preserve you for a long time as a comfort to His most desolate church. Amen. Greet in my name and in the name of the brothers and friends all our fellow ministers and brothers. Farewell. Given hastily early in the morning on April 17, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>I pray you, venerable father in Christ, if the booklet on the flesh of Christ is to be published, that it be done with the testimony of your judgment also prefixed, and of others, who love me as brothers.</p>
      <p>I will diligently ensure that the letters to the countess are delivered. To the most illustrious and most adorned man with every kind of learning and piety, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his father in Christ, to be greatly revered.</p>
