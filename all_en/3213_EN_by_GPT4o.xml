      <p>High-born, illustrious prince, gracious lord. Your princely grace is my willing, completely humble service at all times. It would have been quite appropriate for me to have delivered a letter to your princely grace long ago regarding the booklet that your princely grace sent to me. But your princely grace should believe me that it was not possible for me due to many affairs and sometimes the weakness of my head and other incidents.</p>
      <p>Now, however, I send it with humble, friendly request that your princely grace may read my letter at a convenient time when it would be suitable for you. I have noted in the briefest manner (as I well recognize that prominent persons, burdened with many affairs, do not always have time to read long books) the main points contained in the booklet of the highly learned Dr. Jacob Andreae, from which your princely grace may easily discern how far we agree on this matter or not. God willing, we would agree more closely.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, this writing of the doctor (who is otherwise unknown to me) is much different and more modest than that of the Saxon preachers, from whom previously and now again entirely immodest books have been published and printed. Mr. Joachim Westphal from Hamburg has compiled many church confessions in Lower Saxony and had them printed against our church and doctrine this year, in which we are also called and presented as heretics and otherwise improperly treated. Moreover, an old man (as I hear) Erasmus Alberus in Neubrandenburg in the land of Mecklenburg has published a very immodest, crude book against our church, our forefathers Zwingli, Oecolampadius, etc., and against us, which all honorable good people are appalled by such immodesty. Therefore, we can expect little union or concord with such and hope for it. Yet nothing shall be lacking on our part, as long as otherwise some moderation is found among those fierce people and we are not forced to accept or approve what does not agree with the true word of God according to the right Christian understanding, but rather contradicts it, and if something fruitful could be handled in writing or orally through moderation, setting aside all fury and stubbornness. For we have never had any desire or will for discord and quarrel, and what we have written and answered so far, and will write and answer in the future, we have done and do out of our unavoidable necessity, would much prefer, as far as they would rest (though the matter would not be better), to be unhindered in our affairs by them, also not to give our common adversary, the papists, any joy with our strife, and not to cause any offense to simple people. We also pray to God, who searches all hearts, that He may prepare a remedy for this matter, remove offense, and grant grace, peace, and unity to His church.</p>
      <p>Since, however, in this my writing, which I now send to your princely grace and based solely on the presentation of Dr. Andreae, I have mentioned much of my answer, previously, about a year ago, to several Saxon booklets, of which 5 or 6 were published against us at that time, more have been printed since, I have also added them, in case they might not come to your princely grace later. I ask your princely grace to accept everything from me graciously; for, wherever I could serve your princely grace in truth, I would always willingly and diligently show myself. So also my gracious prince and lord in Hesse, my old lord and faithful patron, through some of his preachers, has asked me some questions, which I have explained in this my writing, added to Dr. Andreae's booklet, in the briefest manner, I have also prepared a copy for his princely grace along with the aforementioned answer. I ask your princely grace to send it to his princely grace as expediently as possible, as I will always, where possible, willingly show myself with willing services.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God graciously preserve your princely grace in His grace at all times. Your princely grace, let my lord mayor Hab, who was recently well received and honorably treated by your princely grace, convey his greetings and all good things, etc.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, the 15th of June, 1557. Your princely grace's willing servant Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the high-born, illustrious prince and lord, Lord Georg, Count of Württemberg and Montbéliard, etc., my gracious prince and lord.</p>
