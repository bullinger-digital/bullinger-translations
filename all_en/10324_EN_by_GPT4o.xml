    <p xml:id="regest1">Explains the function of the five authorized, secret council messengers of the five places, who constantly met in Lucerne during times of crisis, such as during the recent Solothurn Reformation turmoil. Complains that the reformed places distrust each other and cannot negotiate anything in secret. Disunity among the five places. Bullinger fears that the rapprochement between the Pope and the French King will have a disastrous effect on the Confederation, against which the reformed places, in their weakness, can hardly do anything. Writes in German so that Myconius can give the letter to a patron to read. Leo Jud will respond to Wolfgang Wissenburg's letter. Recommendation for Oswald.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>Who the five are, dear brother, and what they mean, note as follows. The Immontani are warriors and know what is being discussed in the communities, also in councils among many people, so that it is not kept secret at all, and when the council plans (consultations) are revealed, great harm arises from it, as the enemy knows how to adjust accordingly. So when there must be council plans, if one wants to undertake such matters, they have appointed 5 men, one from each place, to Lucerne with full authority to make council plans before our downfall years ago. So you have who they are and what they do. Now, as those from Solothurn have come into discord, the quinqueviri Luceriae are again, so that it is well to understand what they have done, or what they intend, from previous actions. But if they are still there, you ask. No, I cannot understand that they are still there, since the matter is now settled. They sit there (when something is happening), have their knowledge, experience, and information everywhere. After that, they arrange everything quietly, the reason why we always hear nothing when they prepare themselves, and when they think it is good, they proceed. They have the communities (Landsgemeinde assemblies) ad votum. With chatter, they bring to pass what they want. Meanwhile, no one can learn anything useful from them through any speech (reconnaissance), and wherever one goes, one always learns nothing but peace, yet everyone should be prepared. For the councils also know nothing of the common councils. So it goes when they expect (anticipate) or must fear something. Haec in genere.</p>
      <p>We are not to be brought together. So no one trusts the other. If entrusted to particular persons, the community will not tolerate it; they also want to know what is being dealt with. If it goes wrong, there must be secret traitors. If one handles something new without particular persons, it is all talked about and a confusion. Moreover, we are all so poor that one hardly knows whom to trust. Truly, truly, the last times: 2. Timoth. 3[1ff]. Those who are not given to hypocrisy are daunted by pusillanimity. Everyone thinks it is wise to take care of themselves, to be silent, not to involve themselves in the holy business. Meanwhile, the wicked prevail and carry everything away at once. Now I know nothing of their actions, hear nothing that they are particularly acting now, except that they are very hostile to each other, though secretly. There are animosities.</p>
      <p>Ennius has well prepared them. Now he is gone, and the lords are united, for whose sake the 5 places were previously divided, and now they seem to be of the matter, etc. However, I fear that something of the greatest evil will arise for us from that alliance of the king and the pope. If you have any certainty about it, let me know. If they are united about Milan, it will lead to a running away and disobedience among us. If they are otherwise united and not opposed to the emperor, it will lead to a persecution. If they win Milan for the emperor, we will have no peace from their arrogance. If they are defeated, they will be sought once in the next. If we help, we are done for; if we do not help, they are done for, and we gain nothing from them. Where now from? You see the vengeance of the Lord hanging over us bloodthirsty. You see the word of the Lord is true: "Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed" [Gen 9, 6]. What we now begin with our own, there is no unity, there is no satisfied heart, although some, yet very few, who can bring it nowhere, and if it is brought somewhere, it costs the pious and the scoundrels come away with it. They then suppress everything. In these we are narrow. Therefore, God is to be called upon, that He may have mercy on us and help, which I also trust faithfully. For I see otherwise not much honesty in the world. Today so, tomorrow so.</p>
      <p>You know why I write to you in German, in case you might show these to our patron to read. Otherwise, take care that they are not offered to any mortal. For I have poured into the bosom of a dearest friend whatever troubles me night and day. Briefly, I see it is over with Switzerland: We were Trojans. No council will help there. Everything goes backwards. I fear the time of vengeance is at hand, the Lord hastens, confounds all councils. Meanwhile, however, we must not cease, try everything for the fatherland, but above all pray to the Lord, if perhaps, as once, there may be peace in our days. But always the times of Josiah stand in the way, to which ours are so similar. Perhaps we are now acting under Zedekiah.</p>
      <p>Your letter written on November 23 was finally delivered on December 3, so do not wonder if I have written later. Leo responded to Wolfgang's letter. It was not allowed to write to Wolfgang. Greet the man and excuse us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>December 4, 1533.</p>
      <p>Have this Oswald commended to you.</p>
      <p>Entirely devoted to you</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
