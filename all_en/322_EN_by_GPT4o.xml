      <p>Greetings. You truly console and bless me wonderfully, my esteemed and dearest Bullinger, with your letters that so breathe the power of the Spirit of Christ and penetrate the very marrow of the heart. May the Spirit Himself give you thanks for them and repay you with the most effective comforts of His full anointing, which will be useful in the day of affliction that certainly awaits all who wish to live piously in Christ. I would bear all that has happened more lightly, although very grave things have occurred, if impiety had not already begun to reign throughout the city and if it were not now a vile harlot prostituted to all, which a little while ago was to be presented to Christ as a chaste virgin betrothed to Him. Ah, ah, how great and truly immense is the ruin of that house not rightly built upon the rock, ah, how all its beauty has departed from happy Zion, never to return (for I greatly fear). May the Lord have mercy on His own, whom He still recognizes. Commend me to Christ, the best of shepherds, whose proven goodness to His own makes it so that in these greatest pains and sighs I sometimes experience consolation and a certain hope of things otherwise impossible, which may it someday overcome through His omnipotence, when it yields. For indeed, at almost the same time, I both hope and despair, since innumerable reasons for both almost entirely occur. What you wish for me and others who are in the same ship with me with such fervent prayers, I will never cease to pray that the munificence of the heavenly Father may happily grant us. As for your offer of advice, help, effort, and all the duties of a Christian brother and best friend, we do not doubt that you do so sincerely and from the heart, and therefore we rightly count this singular benevolence of yours towards us among our chief goods.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ in turn encompass you with His perpetual favor and supply you abundantly with all the goods of both body and soul to enjoy, and most kindly bless you with His temporal and eternal gifts. Now, as you are so concerned to know what I have decided, I truly assure you as if to my own heart that I have decided nothing at all yet, but I entrust myself entirely to the Lord, to whom I belong, and with resigned spirits await what He will decide about me.</p>
      <p>Here, however, if what is hoped for happens, I will winter. The gifts you proclaim in me more as a friend than truthfully are by no means as great as you perhaps think. But knowing myself more deeply, I know entirely how scant my resources are, to which even my now advanced age, having passed the fifty-sixth year, denies that my strength will long suffice for great labors. Therefore, if I can be useful in the ministry of the word and it seems so to the Lord, I would prefer to serve some small and obscure little church rather than a famous and distinguished one, leaving great things to the great.</p>
      <p>My brother, after staying here for a few days, returned to his estate, which he has near the city, to remain there for some time with his wife and part of his children. My cousin also left here, perhaps returning to us tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Both lament not so much their own overturned fortune as this loss of public piety now utterly extinguished. For although there are still not a few sons of God in the city, their virtue cannot be so conspicuous, being oppressed by impiety?</p>
      <p>Now, towards night, I receive your letters through Hieronymus, who has not yet met with me. However, it greatly pains me that you are not well, and I pray to Christ, our most blessed physician, that He may restore you to yourself, indeed to us, and thus to Himself and His church, firmly and vigorously healthy as soon as possible, lest from the infirmity of your one body the sickness of many souls soon arises. Mangold delivered yours to me on October 22, Curio coming here on the 25th. Hopper indeed brought a letter, but none from you to me, which raises not a little suspicion in me, especially since he also brought none from our Haller, unless it could have happened that those you sent through this Walther of mine you now write in error corrected that you sent through Curio. Therefore, I earnestly pray that you free me from this anxiety with your next letters. What you so diligently urge about commending to the heavenly Father the wandering sheep of Christ exposed to the jaws of wolves, I easily see how great a necessity lies upon us to do so. May Christ Himself kindly grant us the spirit of holy prayer, that we may deserve to obtain what we ask. Your vigilant and pious concern will ensure that we may be safe here, or at least be timely warned of danger. Conrad has now returned here and sends you many greetings in the Lord and diligently commends himself and his to the patronage of your prayers. You rightly judge about the confession of the eagle; certainly more danger would arise from it being printed here for the printer than utility for the reader.</p>
      <p>My sister with her dearest husband very reverently and dutifully greet you and your household, and they earnestly pray through Christ that you assist them with your pious prayers. Sch√§rer left here again the day before yesterday.</p>
      <p>Zwicky, when he greeted you with the treasurer, was at Rorschach with Theodorich. I send what that most pious woman Sabina wrote she would send on the first of January next, but now at last they have been brought. I commend to you her brother, the good old man living there. May all yours with brothers and friends be well and may they continually assist us with the support of their prayers before Christ. Farewell, my soul.</p>
      <p>Griesenberg, October 27, late at night, 1548. I commend this Walther of ours with all our matters to you lovingly. Take care, as you can, to be well, and inform us as soon as possible about your health, and likewise whether you have sent any letters through Curio. He hopes to be called next month by the Bernese to the ministry of the church, unless perhaps what he announced without letters from Haller and you is false, which I reluctantly suspect about a not bad man.</p>
