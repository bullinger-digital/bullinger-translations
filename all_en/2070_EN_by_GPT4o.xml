      <p>I have no more convenient means by which I can send letters to the Reverend Mr. Vergerio than through you. Therefore, in your kindness, you will do both of us the service of ensuring that this packet is delivered to him by some trustworthy messenger, which can be done at your convenience.</p>
      <p>This will certainly be most pleasing to both him and me. Farewell, my dear Mr. Bullinger, and bid the reverend fathers and brothers there in the Lord to greet me. Chiavenna, 12th of November, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Francesco Negri.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by him.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
