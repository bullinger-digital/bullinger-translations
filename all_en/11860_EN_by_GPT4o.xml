    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger puts a stop to the many false opinions regarding the relationship between the eating of the body of Christ and faith in his commentary on John; the small group of believers is grateful to the Zurich theologians for their work. [In the Bern church] reformers are pushing for the introduction of excommunication; while French-speaking pastors hope to promote the acceptance of the Gospel through stricter discipline, German-speaking theologians wish to enforce their idiosyncratic teachings in this way; such an untimely measure could endanger the cause of the Gospel. Kaspar [Megander] will report on the discussions in Neuchâtel [regarding the stance of the pastors of Montbéliard on the new Lutheran church order]; Ritter asks for advice.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>I give thanks to my God, who through you has abundantly fulfilled my desire, which has troubled me for a long time. I longed for a simple and clear exposition on the eating of the flesh of Christ, since I believed that in it lies the sacred anchor by which any controversy in the matter of the Eucharist can be resolved and all errors can be precluded. Indeed, there are many who vigorously teach that the eating is spiritual, but they do not explain this allegory, although they seem to themselves to be the most faithful interpreters. Many say that the body of Christ is eaten through faith, etc., but no one teaches what it means to eat. One says that eating is not just believing, but receiving the power of the Holy Spirit into oneself, as if faith were something other than the power of the Holy Spirit; another says that eating is the fruit of faith, which we achieve by eating, as if the faith by which the body of Christ is eaten could be without fruit, even though Christ speaks most openly about justifying faith, attributing the same fruit of faith to eating: "He who believes, etc., has eternal life." "He who eats, etc., has eternal life." However, the overly cautious fear what Christ did not fear, that people will imagine a dead faith for themselves. The fear of the papists is not dissimilar, who are afraid to attribute righteousness to faith alone. But you, in your latest commentaries, which you have meditated on in John, have delivered everything so clearly, so simply, and so solidly that nothing is hidden from the pious and truth-loving, imitating in this the most candid teacher of all, Christ.</p>
      <p>Therefore, do not be deterred by the arrogance and contempt of some haughty individuals, who judge nothing sincerely, who do not consider themselves to be imitators of those whose deeds and words are sometimes so impure that they cannot be followed without danger. Therefore, continue as you have begun, cheerfully; for there are those who hear and recognize the voice of their shepherd, Christ, in you, and they congratulate themselves on your labor and that of your brothers who work in Zurich, by whose benefit the church of Christ has received a great part of purer doctrine. Even if the greater part worships the Antichrist and mocks Christ in his little flock, there are and will always be those attending to the promise that Christ gave: "Do not fear, little flock. For it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom" [Lk 12, 32].</p>
      <p>Here we suffer much from the spirit of innovation, which has seized many of the brothers, both French and Germans, so that they anxiously labor for the introduction of excommunication, not all led by the same reason, but by very different ones; for the French, who act in the province of Savoy, seeing the Gospel received more slowly by their own, think they should be compelled by ecclesiastical censure, although they are not entirely without it; for they have some form in consistories, which many very famous churches do not have and which is so burdensome to many that they would prefer this yoke to be shaken off their necks, and they are constantly seeking a way by which they might be freed once and for all. It is indeed a most imprudent plan to think of a stricter discipline, when the former can scarcely be retained in office, and thus put the whole edifice in danger. The Germans, however, more seized by their innovations, seeing their novelties not being accepted, think they have an easy path through excommunication, by which they might finally achieve their desires; for if anyone does not subscribe to their nonsense, he can immediately be compelled by excommunication. Oh, how foolish and pernicious these plans are, and although they torment themselves in vain, it is nevertheless to be lamented that - having left much graver matters and those which would have more importance for planting piety - they torment themselves with these vain and impossible things for our time, alienating the minds of many from the truth and putting the whole evangelical cause in extreme danger. May the Lord have mercy on us and his church.</p>
      <p>You will understand the rest of what has transpired these days in Neuchâtel from our Kaspar. Farewell and give advice on what I should do in these matters.</p>
      <p>From Bern, November 13, 1543.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, to be greatly respected in Christ.</p>
