      <p> Greetings. I recently wrote to you, my most kind Mr. Bullinger, on the 11th of December, and now I am performing the same duty again, that is, sending you letters from Mr. von Stetten. I do not have much to add at this time, except for one thing: eight days ago, I received letters from our Lydius of LÃ¼beck, in which he thanks me for the effort I made in sending both your letters and mine. He also asks me to inform you that he eagerly awaits your letters, even more eagerly because he recently wrote to you through a certain Polish baron, whom he believes did not enter the city due to fear of the plague. If you wish to write to him and lack someone to deliver the letters, send them here; I will gladly ensure they are delivered as soon as possible. Regarding the diet (assembly), we cannot yet write anything certain except the usual disputes over lodgings, and it is expected to be very well attended, as one prince is said to bring 700, another 600, and another an unknown number of knights. But you have Mr. von Stetten, who will write to you about these and other matters of this kind both thoroughly and verbosely. As for the rest, I wish that the coming year will be as happy as possible for you and yours, and for Mr. Gwalther (to whom I would like you to convey my many greetings in my words), and I will pray to the Lord, the best and greatest, for this, which I will not cease to do, and I trust you will do the same for me in return. I would have added something of my own to the New Year's gift sent to you by Mr. von Stetten, if I either suspected you were in need or if I myself had abundance. </p>
      <p> Now I hope you will be content with my goodwill and my eagerness to please. Farewell. Augsburg, on the first day of January, in the year 1566. </p>
      <p> Matthias Schenck, yours. </p>
      <p> To the best and most prudent man, Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, my esteemed lord and friend. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. </p>
