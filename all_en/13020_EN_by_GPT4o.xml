    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] There are many rumors, especially written and oral reports circulating about a campaign against the Swiss Confederation. All foreigners [in Basel] are also talking about it. It is believed that it will happen next year, as Emperor Charles V must replenish his exhausted troops, which consist of barely more than 12,000 men, with new soldiers and make other preparations if he wants to defeat the previously almost invincible Swiss. The latter should really consider how they want to confront this successful enemy in time! They tend to prefer preempting attacks rather than being caught off guard, which the Swabians believe they know very well. During the last meeting in Ulm [June/July 1547] regarding the conclusion of a new [Swabian] League, the representatives of many cities declared that they had not received any authorization in this regard. However, they told their friends that such an alliance would be their death. For if the ever-ready-to-fight Swiss were to learn of it, they would recognize the danger associated with the alliance and immediately attack before the Emperor could come to their aid. All Swiss should heed this, for it could well be to their homeland's advantage!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Emperor has convened a Diet in Augsburg for September 1st. Due to the plague, he is said to still be staying in Neuburg an der Donau and in Landsberg am Lech. A French envoy [François de Chatillon, sieur d’Andelot] was with him. After his arrival, all the nobles [at the court] seemed depressed. It was even said that the Diet would not take place.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Yesterday, Myconius had a visitor from Strasbourg coming from Constance. This visitor told of a fire in Constance that destroyed five houses and was allegedly set by the enemies. Since the arsonist Duke Heinrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel is at large, this is not surprising!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] According to a letter from Peter Scher the Elder of Schwarzenburg, he learned by letter that the Bohemian city of Prague, along with its privileges, artillery, and ammunition, had submitted to King Ferdinand. However, today Gabriel [Arnold], whom Bullinger knows, told that Ferdinand's soldiers lost several banners in a battle with the Bohemians. Until he is taught otherwise, Myconius prefers to believe this news, especially since it pleases him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] King Henry II of France is said to have written to the Swiss that he has hired German mercenaries for their protection. Bullinger should provide more details on this, as well as on the question raised in Myconius’ last letter [No. 2967].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] How good it is that the worrying affair about Rudolf Gwalther’s “Endtchrist” has calmed down! May God grant that it remains so! Had the Five Places persisted in their stance, the Gospel would be in a bad state throughout the country.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Yesterday, a letter arrived reporting on the great progress of the Gospel in England.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] When the Basel [Johann] Lukas Iselin was with the people of Uri, he participated in a conversation about the upcoming council. As a Basel citizen, he was asked to urge his authorities not to decline any invitation to the council. Since he had difficulty following the conversation, he did not understand everything. Perhaps Bullinger will learn something about it from the [Zurich] envoy [Hans Heinrich Spross] returning from Locarno.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings, also to Rudolf Gwalther.</p>

      <p>S. Many rumors are circulating, especially that Switzerland is going to be attacked. This is written, this is said, and all conversations of all foreigners convey this. "Perhaps nothing will happen this year," they say, "but next year. The Emperor has soldiers who are completely exhausted, and indeed they are few (the number does not exceed 12,000). Therefore, it is necessary for him to replenish them and prepare the rest anew, which is needed to conquer a nation that has been almost invincible until now." Knowing this should have stirred our people to finally think about how to confront an enemy who has been so successful up to now, in time. Some Swabians think of us in such a way that if we were like that, we would not be caught off guard, but we would preempt. For at the recent meeting held in Ulm, when a new alliance was reported, most cities responded that they had no instructions regarding any alliance. However, they privately told their friends: "If the Swiss were to learn about this matter, because they would interpret it as being against them, we would perish before the Emperor could defend us with a new army. For we know their readiness; they do not delay when they have something in mind to do, especially when danger is to be avoided." If only everyone would consider these things properly and faithfully! Who knows whether this would be for the common good of the homeland?</p>

      <p>The Emperor has called his people to Augsburg for the first of September, although he himself is not there due to the plague beginning to spread. They say he has stayed in Neuburg and Landsberg until now. A French envoy is said to have come to the Emperor. What he brought is unknown. However, the faces of all the nobles were seen to be dejected, and the rumor began to spread that perhaps no Diet would take place.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, someone from Strasbourg came to my house from Constance. He said that five houses in Constance had perished in a fire. They think the fire was set by enemies. I immediately said: "After the arsonist from Brunswick was released, what else could we expect?"</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Peter Scher the Elder wrote in recent days, informing that Prague in Bohemia has surrendered to the royal majesty along with all its privileges, artillery, and fortifications. Today, Lord Gabriel, whom you know, came and reported that several royal soldiers were diminished by the Bohemians in a battle. I believe what pleases me until I learn otherwise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I do not know what some are saying about the French; for I heard in passing: he wrote to the Swiss that the soldiers he has gathered from Germany were collected for them. Tell me at your leisure if you have anything; and also about those things I asked about recently.</p>

      <p>I am wonderfully glad about the quieting of Gwalther's Antichrist! For that matter had greatly moved my mind from the beginning. For besides other evils, if the Five Places had persisted, the Gospel would have been poorly advised throughout Switzerland. May the Lord prevent that evil from ever returning.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>In England, the word of the Lord is making great progress, as was written here yesterday.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>At Uri, Lord Lukas Iselius, our citizen, heard a discussion about the future council, and he was diligently asked that if the matter ever comes to us, we should not refuse anything. However, he found it difficult to hear and did not understand the conversation. Therefore, he could say nothing else. This is mentioned in case you perhaps hear something more certain from the envoy returning from Locarno.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell in Christ with yours. Greet Gwalther. Basel, July 30, 1547. Yours, O. M.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, the most faithful minister of the church of Zurich, his esteemed brother and lord. Zurich.</p>
