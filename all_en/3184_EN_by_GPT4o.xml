      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful minister of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Greetings. The reverend lords and brothers, Mr. Farell and Mr. Baeza, were kindly received, heard, and dismissed by the most honorable magistrate of this city. I served as an interpreter in the senate. They obtained everything they desired by the grace of God and departed directly to Schaffhausen and Basel. However, the matter stalled somewhat here. For, as it seemed best to the people of Zürich, Bern, and Schaffhausen that individual envoys be sent to the king, the people of Basel did not agree unless a council was held first. Therefore, our people wrote to Bern about this. A council was convened and held in Aarau by the cities on May 9th. And by God's grace, they came to a beautiful agreement among themselves. Therefore, an embassy will be sent to the king, with one envoy from each city. Our envoy has already been chosen and is waiting. However, it could not be obtained as our people had wished, that the envoys would now proceed directly to the king. For since Mr. Farell and Baeza have gone to the German princes, it seemed most imprudent to the Swiss to precede them: and that all hope would be cut off if the Swiss envoys were rejected. Now indeed, the combined Swiss and German envoys would achieve more with the king. Therefore, we are now waiting daily for our brothers, Mr. Farell and Baeza, to hear from them what they have accomplished with the German princes. If they also prepare an embassy, the Swiss will soon indicate the place and time where they will meet. If they do not wish to send, then the Swiss will hasten without delay, who will also urge the Germans to hurry. Meanwhile, Bern is sending a messenger and letters in the common name to Piedmont to Mr. Brisacius, beseeching him, if anything more severe is to be executed against the faithful, not to hurry: for they are already prepared for the journey and will proceed directly to the king to act on behalf of the faithful with the king, etc. May God grant success. We earnestly insist that this be done with public prayers.</p>
      <p>The royal envoy commended to me by you, a truly pious man, I received with the greatest kindness I could and commended him to our most honorable magistrate. I also commended him to the brothers in Chur and offered myself entirely to him. I can send him letters every week through merchants. He promises to respond in turn. While he was staying with us for two days due to the rainy weather, the bishop of Troyes, the prince of Melphi, came from Rome, a man, as far as I could gather from conversation, not alien to our religion. May God give him the courage to dare to do what he knows should be done someday.</p>
      <p>I promise nothing more about my journey to you. My lord and brother, you know my feelings towards you and yours, even though I never greet you in Geneva. My affairs are now such in many ways that I cannot travel.</p>
      <p>The Polish council has been dissolved. And the Livonian war, which is believed to be waged by the king, has caused the matter of religion to be neither legitimately handled nor concluded. Therefore, the debate and the whole cause still hang in the balance. Although in the meantime, innumerable people are daily added to the word of God. So a certain doctor who came here from Krakow the day before yesterday reports to me. Perhaps the Lord wishes to gather and strengthen his church not through royal edicts but through weak preaching.</p>
      <p>The most illustrious man, Mr. Andreas Hyperius of Marburg, in letters sent to me at the end of April, testifies that a colloquy is to be held in Worms on August 24th. The supreme president of this will be King Ferdinand or his deputy, the bishop of Speyer: the assessors appointed for the colloquy are the elector duke of Saxony, the duke of Württemberg, one of the electors bishops, and the archbishop of Salzburg. The colloquists are Melanchthon, Schnepf, Pistorius, Machabaeus of Holstein, Brentius, Onolzbachius. On the opposing side are Julius Pflug, Sidonius, Delphinus, Gropper, Pfeffer of Leuven, Peter Canisius the Jesuit. The notaries appointed are Eber and Goeppingensis, also the provost and secretary of Mainz.</p>
      <p>They have added several supernumeraries and auditors to the colloquists on both sides. There will also be a deliberation on what to do with the secretaries. He adds that Melanchthon is coming to Heidelberg to reform the school. For he has been called by the Palatine. He also adds this: throughout the whole of Belgium, the fire of persecution is raging terribly. The same is written to me from Augsburg: the prisons of all the cities are filled with the faithful: in Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp, and other more famous cities, some are being killed, and these meet death with great constancy. The same Hyperius does not promise himself splendidly about that Vangian colloquy, because many powerful people desire to have some religion for themselves from the gospel and papism, such as was once imposed or introduced to the Galatians from the gospel and the law, etc.</p>
      <p>What truth seems to you, reverend brother and friend? Have you seen what our Africa has brought forth for us again? I meant to say Saxony. You thought there were few who followed that gross opinion of corporeal presence. You wanted to render the sense of the Augsburg Confession tolerable. And in this cause, our Lasco followed you. We advised you not to trust yourselves to this sea, etc. Now all rush out in troops, they bear arms, all rise against us, all defend Westphalism. They all deny that the Augsburg Confession has that sense. In which matter, with your permission, I agree more with them than with Philip, whom I know will not declare himself in such a way that they will not triumph as victors. But what then afterwards? The Augsburg Confession is not the gospel. However, Erasmus Alberus surpasses all other Saxons in madness and vituperation. He has written a copious book in the German language against Carlstadt, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, you, Lasco, me, and our churches. So far in this contest, I have seen nothing written more intemperately, indeed more furiously. And so it will be your duty to ensure you have it: to have it translated into Latin as far as it concerns you, and to consult on what needs to be done.</p>
      <p>The senior Landgrave partly, partly Count George of Montbéliard, has imposed on me something to do singularly. The Hessian asks: if the body of Christ sits or moves in heaven, and does not return to earth before the judgment, how then did it appear to Paul at Damascus? And they infer a true vision of the flesh from 1 Corinthians 15. I desire to hear your judgment on this place as well, my lord and brother. You will have responded soon enough if you write to me within the next month. Count George sent a German booklet by the preacher of Göppingen, Jacob Andreae, doctor of Württemberg, which he wrote about the supper to the Palatine. And this doctor Jacob Andreae is Brentz's. Brentz prefaced it and testifies that this single booklet can satisfy all the pious. The prince desires that I write my judgment on the whole book to him promptly. And I suspect he is somewhat moved by this book. He treats three questions in general: 1. What is the substance of the supper? 2. What does the impious receive in the supper? 3. What is the use of the supper? He treats them in such a way that he first presents Luther's opinion on each, then ours, and finally what should be thought.</p>
      <p>1. The substance of the supper is not only bread and wine, but with the bread and wine, the body and blood of the Lord. There is a disagreement about the manner of being.</p>
      <p>Luther explains it as corporeally, we as spiritually. But the word spiritually does not sufficiently explain the mystery unless one understands by spiritually a heavenly and ineffable manner by which the true flesh is understood to be present with the bread. However, nothing hinders this doctrine from the article of the Lord's ascension and the property of Christ's human nature. For with God in heaven, there is no place, all places are one place. Therefore, it is written that Christ ascended into heaven and above the heavens, and Paul saw Christ at Damascus. Therefore, the doctrine of heaven as if it were a place of Christ's body is a most vain comment. For there is no time in heaven with God, as it is written: One day is as a thousand: and the voice of the preacher can be at the same time in the ears of many thousands of listeners and in the mouth of the preacher.</p>
      <p>The right hand of God fills heaven and earth, therefore also the Son of Man sitting at the right hand, so that he can be ineffably perceived truly and corporeally by all when he fills all things. In the meantime, however, one should not imagine that filling as if it were natural, but divine and by which the truth of human nature in Christ is not denied. Similar things are narrated in the scriptures, that Elijah and Moses were on Mount Tabor, whom it is certain did not leave heaven. Angels always see the face of the Father and do not leave heaven, and yet they are present with us on earth. The soul is whole in every part of the body. And when they migrate through death, they are immediately in heaven, without any need for movement. 2. He says the impious eat the true body of the Lord, and not only is this offered to them but perceived. Here he imagines two effects in Christ, one of life, the other of judgment.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Christ eaten by the pious gives life. The same eaten by the impious judges. And therefore it is said. He who eats unworthily eats judgment to himself. For just as the same gospel is to some the odor of life unto life, to others the odor of death unto death, so also Christ and the Eucharist. Just as the flesh of Christ works life in the pious, so also death and judgment in the impious. Therefore, those who deny that the true flesh is eaten by the impious deprive Christ of the majesty and glory of judging. Nor does he only judge in the final judgment, but daily, as is clear from 1 Corinthians 11. The truth of the sacrament also does not depend on our faith or perfidy, but on divine institution and truth. Therefore, even if one approaches unbelieving, the food and host are always ready.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we err gravely who deny that the impious, because they lack faith, do not perceive the true body of the Lord. Nor is this ignominious to the glory of Christ, etc. 3. He deals much with use and abuse. Of which there is now no place to speak. I have detained you long enough. However, you would do a pleasing thing if you would note a few things about all these and send them to me promptly: especially about the impious eating the Lord himself[?].</p>
      <p>These things, once worn out, do not move me: but nonetheless, I seek your judgment. I have detained you enough.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell with all the brothers and ministers. May the Lord bless you. The fellow ministers and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>I wrote in great haste. Therefore, forgive the haste. Zürich, May 16, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
