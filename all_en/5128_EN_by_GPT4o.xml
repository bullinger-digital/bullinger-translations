      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>What shall I say, dearest brother? With hands, feet, and my whole being, I resist, dissuade, and discourage you from accepting Castalio, not only because he is ungrateful to the people of Geneva and you can expect perpetual conflicts from him, but because Castalio, although not unlearned, seems to be full of foreign opinions, which he will spread if he ever gets the opportunity. It is also said that he associates with all the innovators and troublemakers who come to Basel and pass through there; all those who are interested in foreign questions know him and recommend him.</p>
      <p>What do you want, my dear Haller? Beware, beware, beware. For God's sake, do not get involved with that unlovable man.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that the wise men in Basel can do without his presence and perhaps advise others to call him. If you must drink St. Bernard's foot water, then may God bless you all the more.</p>
      <p>Recently he was with us in ZÃ¼rich; we unwittingly received him at a meal. Afterwards, many faithful people reported to me about him, which if I had known before, he would never have been received at a meal by me.</p>
      <p>As for your promise to be faithful here, I implore you, by your singular faith, to fulfill it for me; for I like to be untroubled and without quarrels with all people. Therefore, destroy this letter.</p>
      <p>I also fear that the synod, if it proceeds, will bring more disturbances than peace and perhaps give much courage to the adversaries. May the Lord be with you.</p>
