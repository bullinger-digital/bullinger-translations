    <p xml:id="regest1">Duke Ulrich of Württemberg wrote to Basel and the other reformed places of the Swiss Confederation after the reconquest of his land and offered an alliance to protect the evangelical cause. The people of Zurich should not give such a cowardly negative response as they did to his first offer, but rather, after a discussion with Bern, Basel, and other cities, make a well-considered, wise decision; this is the wish of the friends in Basel. Bullinger should inform them of the outcome of the matter. Greetings to Leo Jud, and a recommendation for his relative Hans Heinrich Winkeli?.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The Duke of Württemberg wrote to us, that is, to Basel, about his situation, namely that he has finally regained his homeland. He asks the senate to consider how, through an alliance, the evangelical cause can be strengthened as much as human power allows. He also wrote to you in the same manner. He mentions this in our letters. There is now a fear that perhaps in responding, you might be like you were recently, when he asked the same of you regarding the letters, which you know about, and through rashness, or rather the fear of the Cantons, you might immediately refuse what he requested. Here, good men wish the matter to be handled very prudently. However, this will happen when the common matter (for we, the people of Bern, and others are similarly asked) is referred to a common consultation. The matter indeed requires deliberation, and indeed careful deliberation. I do not doubt that you have already given a response. I would wish that it had not been given unless it has the prescribed form. If you can do anything here, make every effort to ensure that nothing is done that will later cause regret. If a response has been given, let us know. This is not from myself.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, Basel, May 30, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your O. M.</p>
      <p>I sincerely wish Leo Jud well, please receive his relative Hans Heinrich Winkeli? well and honorably, I ask, etc.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the chief minister of the people of Zurich, his very esteemed brother.</p>
