    <p xml:id="regest1">The loss of the pass [Ehrenberg] caused by the negligence [of the Schmalkaldic League] is annoying, as it opens the way for the Italian army to Swabia. This gives the Imperial forces good reason to hope to recapture all the places they have lost so far.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse should no longer be near the imperial camp, as part of the [Schmalkaldic] army is moving towards [Maximilian of Egmont, Count of] Buren.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- In Ensisheim, people were called to prayer because the imperial army would soon run out of provisions. If it comes to that, it would be good, because hunger [can achieve a lot]! If only the [Schmalkaldic League] would remain vigilant!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger will have already heard about the almost completely destroyed Mechelen; as well as the even worse news from [Lecce in the Kingdom of Naples and] Sicily. It is also said that the Bohemians have captured [King] Ferdinand.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Why do the [Swiss Protestants] remain inactive?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Pope [Paul III] is said to have sent beggars to poison the wells. The new arsonists were already known. All this is clearly attributable to the Antichrist! May those who plan such evil deeds fall victim to them themselves!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings, also to Gwalther.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am deeply troubled by the loss of the pass once again due to negligence, as it seems to many. The way is open for the Italian army to Swabia. Therefore, that place should have been defended with greater care. Hope is given to the Imperial forces regarding all the places lost so far, namely that they will be restored.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>They say that the camp of the Emperor has been abandoned by Hesse and the army divided. One part will remain, the other will go to meet Buren. I do not know what to think about this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In Ensisheim, it was requested from the pulpit that the Lord be invoked, for it is expected that supplies will be cut off from the Emperor's army. This would be pleasing, provided our people are cautious. For you know the strategy of hunger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You have heard about Mechelen almost being lost. More cruel things are reported from Sicily. I believe these are known to you as well. It is said that Ferdinand has been captured by the Bohemians.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Why do we remain idle amidst these events? Lord Jesus, be present with your church!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The well-poisoners are said to be beggars sent by the Pope. The new arsonists are evident. The arts of the Antichrist! May the Lord look upon us who are despised for His name and by His power ensure that the saying, which has retained its truth for so long, is not rendered false: "Evil counsel is worst for the counselor."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell in Christ with your family and Gwalther. Basel, 13th of September, 1546. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned brother in the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable friend.</p>
