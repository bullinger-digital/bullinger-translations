    <p xml:id="regest1">A messenger delivered the letter that Bullinger had sent with his cousin [...]; he could not support the latter, but asked Mayor [Hans] Welser to do so on his behalf. Agrees with Bullinger's remark about the ban. Vadian has conveyed a letter from Myconius; Myconius' remark in the [enclosed] copy of a letter from Bucer, that Blarer seems not to be interested in news from him, is incomprehensible to him, Bullinger should defend him. There is nothing new to report from the Diet [in Nuremberg]; [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle was received in Augsburg with his three sons [Jérôme, Antoine, and Thomas?] and then traveled on to Nuremberg; [Duke Wilhelm of Jülich-Berg-Cleves-Guelders] is in armor, as is Emperor [Charles V]; it is said that Wilhelm of Fürstenberg is only pretending to defend the Gorze Abbey against France; new atrocities from the Turks are heard repeatedly; may God assist us! Bullinger should take care of his health. He has received Bullinger's second letter with the writing of the Confederates to the Emperor and the Imperial Estates and praises their love of freedom. At the request of [Martin] Frecht, he forwards a thoroughly bad Schwenckfeldian song ["A beautiful new song about the divinity and glory of our Lord Jesus Christ"], which Bullinger should send on to Vadian; these bad people are not worth a response. Sends a letter with a request for a prompt return. Greetings; apologizes for the hasty writing due to his constant letter writing.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The letter you sent to me through your cousin was delivered by the servant of a mercenary innkeeper, and that too in a stranger's house on the 16th of this month during lunch, so I could not extend any courtesy to him, as he met me only when he was about to leave. However, I wrote a note to Mayor Welser, asking him to provide any additional support if needed, assuring him that I would make it up to him here; for I could do nothing else, except to earnestly request that he visit me on his return. For your sake, I deeply cherish anyone who is dear to you in any way.</p>
      <p>Regarding the ban, it is as you write, and we expect nothing else if these judges continue, except for the sacred and the profane to be confused at once and the earth to be mixed with the sky. Our most excellent Vadian recently sent letters from Myconius and, although it was not necessary, he faithfully advocated for you, for which I owe you great thanks. In Myconius' letters, he was very grieved because at the end of Bucer's letter, which he had copied for me, he added these words in his own hand: "I would have written more; but until now I never understood that my letters were pleasing to you." From this, I easily infer that this distinguished man, whom I have always held in high regard, has been led into some suspicion, as if he has been either despised or neglected by me until now, which is as far from the truth as I am accustomed to greatly revere and embrace in the Lord brothers of far lesser piety and learning than he is. Therefore, I earnestly request your advocacy here, my Bullinger; for I will not be able to bear it if you do not relieve me of this more than grave burden, and that as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new that we could write to you about the Diet. Lord Granvelle, the Emperor's envoy, was honorably received in Augsburg with his three sons and was then sent to the Nuremberg Diet. The Duke of Jülich is entirely in arms; meanwhile, the Emperor is also enlisting an army. Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg is believed to be defending the Gorze Abbey, three miles from Metz, against the French more in pretense than in earnest, so that when peace is made, the soldiers will remain with the French; thus, everything today is done with deceit. We constantly hear that the Turk is not asleep but is planning the most atrocious acts against us. May the Lord grant that, having first slaughtered the domestic Turks, we may also overcome that most savage and cruel enemy in His name.</p>
      <p>Amen. O Savior and Peacemaker Jesus Christ, have mercy on the miserable fate of your afflicted church and take it under the shadow of your wings for protection; indeed, pour out your deserved wrath on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name, lest they say: "Where is their God?"</p>
      <p>Take care of your health, my Bullinger, so that you may be able to do what you do for as long as possible. These excessive labors of study and writing exhaust your strength and weaken your body before its time, so that everything collapses at once unless proper moderation is applied, which those who devote themselves entirely to such labors in this way hardly admit.</p>
      <p>Your second letter is now presented with the writing of the Swiss to the Emperor, the King of the Romans, the Imperial Estates, and the judges of the Imperial Chamber, where I now have great gratitude for your diligence and faith. I am pleased with the steadfast pursuit of freedom by your people, which I wish all would turn to the glory of God.</p>
      <p>I am sending a Schwenckfeldian song, which Frecht, a most learned and humane man, gave to me these days, asking that I also send it to you.</p>
      <p>Ensure that you also send this to our Vadian; for Frecht also requests it. It often errs not only in its sentiments but also in its numbers, and it is very poorly written. I do not think it worthwhile for anyone to respond to these mischievous people, whom Satan stirs up in this matter, so that those attempting far better things are unfortunately hindered by such trifles to the great detriment of the Christian and public good, etc.</p>
      <p>Some letters are now being returned, which I send to be read with the condition that you promptly return them.</p>
      <p>Commend me to all the brothers, to Pellican, to Gwalther, my special friend, to Theodor, to Erasmus, to Megander, and especially to your household; for I very much hope and desire to be aided by your pious advocacy with the heavenly Father. All of ours greet you. Consider this hasty writing kindly; for I am almost killed by the constant writing of letters, nor do I suffice for even that one labor if I try to respond to each one. However, for you, such a friend, who has long been accustomed to our unpolished writing, I am not moved, even if I write very poorly. Farewell again and again. February 24, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
