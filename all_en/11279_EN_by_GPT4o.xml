    <p xml:id="regest1">At the Baden Diet [of February 25], the Appenzellers once again complained about the excessive tolls of the St. Gallers as well as about [their contestation of their provisions for] collecting pledges for outstanding interest and reported on their negotiations with [Jakob] Büchler; against Vadian's statement about [lost Appenzeller] banners and pennants, they emphasized that although they once lost a pennant in Bregenz, they had never lost a banner. A good friend advises the St. Gallers not to pursue a legal procedure in these contentious matters of the city and Vadian, but rather a conciliation process and to subsequently only accept tolerable articles of agreement; if these were then rejected by their opponents, their case would be better off anyway. Bullinger is concerned about the [Schmalkaldic] League, which grows daily by admitting not always reliable members; Zurich once also relied on human strength and weapons instead of the power and grace of God, but the more the alliance grew, the weaker it became. Fears the punishment for their sinful life and hopes for God's mercy. Has no news. Thanks for Vadian's letter and asks to continue writing. [Postscript:] Asks Vadian for a critical reading of the enclosed booklet [„De origine erroris“].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus. Highly learned, honorable, and esteemed lord, knowing that nothing special has been reported from Baden beyond what has been written to you, except that your adversaries have once again raised two articles: namely, that the toll has been burdensomely imposed on them and the collection of pledges for outstanding interest, etc.; as you understand better and there is no need to elaborate with many words. This has now been left as a matter of discussion, etc. Furthermore, they have reported what they have negotiated with Büchler. Your statement concerning the banners and pennants is not thought of otherwise than incidentally. They do not hope that it will be found that they have ever lost their banners. And understand well, it is said in passing, they are known for the pennant and that in Bregenz it was a pennant, and not a banner, etc. Now, a good friend's advice would be: since your neighbors and it is well to assume, if one relies on the legal decision and the peace, much displeasure will arise, which will not subside for many years, and therefore the honorable man thinks it good and useful if you amicably settle both matters concerning the common city and your person with the banner and pennant; yet that you always resist with kindness until articles are established that are bearable and agreeable to you. If perhaps your adversaries do not accept; if you then accept, your case would be better, etc. Let me know what your disposition and intention are.</p>
      <p>Regarding the league, which grows daily, I am in worry and concern. Speaking with you: I fear it is not all pure and that some are accepted who are not sincere. Our example frightens me. The more we grew in our alliance, the weaker we became. I fear they trust in human strength like we did, and God will show, as with us, that His word is not preserved in arms, but in His grace and strength. Our great sin also frightens me. I fear the punishment is at the door. May the Lord have mercy on us for the glory of His name. I have no particular news at this time; thank you kindly for your writing and ask that you continue to write to me as before. If I can serve you, I would do so faithfully and be yours. Dated Zurich, March 7, 1539. Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Please consider the small gift I offer you kindly. I confess, I owe you greater things. Read, please, and if anything seems imprudently said or not carefully or dangerously handled, let me know.</p>
