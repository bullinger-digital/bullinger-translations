      <p>Greetings. Your letter, dearest brother in the Lord, has greatly disturbed me because of the intolerable abuse of oaths, which does not sanctify with the filth of idolaters, but defiles and makes guilty in the sight of the Lord not only the people swearing to the Lord, but also our own, if they consent to such an oath under any condition, even if they remain silent about the part of the saints.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in the holy place, in the churches of Christians, in the very ears of the faithful, a form of oath is being uttered that conflicts with the word of the Lord, by which we are forbidden to swear by those who are not gods.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, what is the necessity that compels our people to allow such a thing to happen in their churches? Is this to be joined with allies and not rather to bear with lords? How frivolous is the excuse that it is thought this must be endured, as long as we are not forced to swear ourselves according to the form of words by which we are adjured? Is it enough to remain silent at the profanation of the name of the Lord our God and not required to contradict? And that in our own churches and in a matter concerning and binding us?</p>
      <p>The words of the one adjuring bind the adjured, not the one adjuring. The one who adjures us will say "as God and all the saints help me," he will say this not for himself, but for us.</p>
      <p>If we must remain silent, to what end will he utter it? Surely the spirit of darkness does not ignore that such consent of ours constitutes us guilty of a most grievous sin before the Lord and that it will not go unpunished. These things disturb me no less than if our people consented to have the papal mass joined to this oath in our churches. Therefore, I pray to the Lord to give our people an unbroken spirit, so that they do not allow themselves to be led to do things whose guilt their consciences will never be able to bear. Forgive me for troubling your already disturbed mind even more. As for the Diet of Augsburg, I have nothing else than what you write and what I predicted at the beginning of it. Farewell excellently, dearest brother, October 5, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, whose hand you know.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
