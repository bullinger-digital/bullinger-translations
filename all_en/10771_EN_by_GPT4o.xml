    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not heard anything from him yet, but invites him on the recommendation of the people of Constance and with the approval of Leo [Juda] to a meeting in Basel on February 1st; if this cannot take place due to the Bernese campaign to Savoy, Myconius will notify him. Although he welcomed Bucer's writing "Ad Monasterienses" because it dispelled the suspicion that he had joined Luther, he cannot approve it unreservedly and refers to his own recent expositions of his doctrine of the Lord's Supper, which are in harmony with Bucer's "Enarrationes." Sends an unpublished treatise by Zwingli on the sacraments. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I believe you have received my response to your letters, dearest brother Bucer, through our city's public messenger. Since he has not yet returned, I do not know if it was pleasing to you. Meanwhile, I receive letters from the people of Constance, who strongly urge me to hear you and, since I am planning to go to Basel, to call you to a meeting. They complain that we avoid meeting you, and that there are things you would like corrected in our churches; you will not ask anything impious from us. I have shown the letter to Leo, and by common consent, we invite you to Basel on February 1st. However, we have written to Myconius to inform you if it is not safe to come to Basel due to the war started by the Bernese or others. For then we will not come either; we invite you to us. We cannot promise anything about others. We do not know who will come. Today, the Bernese are moving with a proper army against the ruler of the Allobroges to lift the siege of Geneva. May the Lord have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>The people of Constance also urge you strongly because I once approved your book to the Monasterians in a certain letter. Ah, my brother, I approve all things that can be shown by all scriptures. I overlook those things which are more obscure in any author, especially if I know him not to be impious. Meanwhile, I have explained more than once since that letter what I think about the Eucharist. I have published commentaries on 1 Corinthians, where I have explained my opinion, which you also approved in a written letter. Our confession was presented to you in Constance, to which I subscribed. I sent a letter when you were in Augsburg. I wrote an apology for Zwingli, which I prefixed to the Open Articles. What I confessed in these, I confess today as well. These, I believe, agree with yours, which you wrote in the Expositions of the Gospels. Therefore, so far, I do not disagree with you. Meanwhile, you seemed to speak more obscurely in the booklet to the Monasterians. However, you seemed to say the same thing regarding the substance of the matter as we do. Therefore, I said that the opinion was not displeasing and that you had given testimony to my spirit, which had hitherto fluctuated between hope and fear. For I feared that you might completely defect to Luther, asserting a carnal presence. Yet I hoped that you would not entirely desert our side. Therefore, when this book was offered to me, I seemed to have found what I was seeking.</p>
      <p>I am sending here Zwingli's most accurate treatise on the sacraments, which has not been seen until now. If it satisfies you, our meeting will be shorter.</p>
      <p>Farewell. January 21st.</p>
      <p>Greet Capito most dutifully in my name. Leo wishes you well. 1536.</p>
