      <p>To us indeed, as the purpose of peace, provided it is established with an equal balance, it is not displeasing, so the dissensions arising around religion do not offend; but the matter itself speaks that these courtly clamorers are allowed everything, while they would not even want us to mutter. However, what they say about the manner of presence, as if it is investigable to us while we remain in this life, is not pleasing; for what consolation or what fruit would we bring back from the supper, unless we believed Christ, our guest, to be present to us in spirit, grace, and operation?</p>
      <p>Let us concede indeed that the Brentian Utopia is investigable. But more on other matters, when I have gathered the opinions of the brothers. - We have nothing about the Italian army that is hidden from you. I add this one thing: our priests raise their crests and now even triumph before victory, indeed even so trusting in their Antiochus, they shamelessly say that the papal mass will soon be restored in the Church of St. Martin. May the Lord deliver us from these most hidden snares. Lord Karl von Hohenbalken testifies to God that he has so far smelled many harmful snares; but he can by no means comprehend what the present ones mean.</p>
