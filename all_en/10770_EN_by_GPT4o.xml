    <p xml:id="regest1">Capito seems to hold the Basel pastors in low regard, as he did not send anything for them with the letter bearer. Myconius, citing the people of Constance, urges caution towards Bucer, but with his warning in Basel, he has rather achieved the opposite. He is annoyed that the people of Strasbourg have learned about the upcoming meeting.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Capito has not sent even a jot to us through this bearer - a sign of contempt, as I interpret it, for the Basel ministers. Beware for the sake of the pious admonition of the people of Constance. For I am stuck. The more I speak here about Bucer's diligent caution, the more, I believe, they favor him. Although I have said nothing to anyone except to my father, Grynaeus, and Marcus. Come now; indeed, as God will grant, I will act. It is tiresome that the people of Strasbourg send us nothing but trifles. I do not know which evil demon has given everything about the upcoming meeting to the people of Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Farewell and consider this annoyance, which harms no one, with equanimity.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
