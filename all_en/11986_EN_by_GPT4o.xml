    <p xml:id="regest1">He can rely on Bullinger's willingness to help, but he only seeks his assistance where it is truly necessary and does not overstrain Bullinger's strength; he asks Bullinger to support the young and pious bearer [Bartolomeo Paravicini], who is coming to Zurich this summer to learn German, with advice and assistance, which would please all Italians striving for the [evangelical] faith; furthermore, Renato hopes that Christ will triumph throughout Italy, as in Valtellina, after the destruction of the Antichrist, which can easily be achieved through joint prayer. Greetings and a request for an occasional letter.</p>

      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Camillo Renato sends greetings and best wishes in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Truly, there is nothing I cannot promise myself about you, as a most Christian man and a great lover of us; nor should you think that you should be asked for something where it is necessary, which either I should not ask for or you cannot provide. Our young man here, who, as it should be most pleasing to you, especially at this age, is very devoted to Christ and true piety, has set out to you to learn to speak and write in German, and this at no expense to you; therefore, for your and your utmost love for Christians, I ask and urge you to assist the young man with your zeal, diligence, effort, and advice in whatever matters are necessary. This will certainly be most pleasing and delightful not only to us but also to all Italians, especially those devoted to Christian teaching. Furthermore, we hope that in this Valtellina Valley, as they call it, and throughout all of Italy, Christ Jesus, our Lord, will someday triumph with the Antichrist defeated, which we can easily achieve if you also pray for the same. Farewell in the Lord. Greet for us the ministers of Christ and the church, which is there, in the Lord. Indeed, I ask again and again that you write to us sometime when you have leisure; that would be most pleasing. From the Valtellina Valley, July 6, 1544.</p>
      <p>To the best man and most faithful minister of the gospel, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
