      <p>Greetings. I have read, with as much diligence as I could, almost everything you sent to me. The writings of Calvin and the ministers of Geneva, which they have organized into specific articles about the power and nature of the sacraments, are very sharp. Viret's dissertation is, in my judgment, learned; but it is always painful that we do not adhere to one simple faith or a consistent explanation of the mysteries, especially in churches so close to each other, which could easily maintain complete unity before anything is published. Is it really permissible for curious minds to examine all, as they say, without agreeing with others, but to bring forth something exceptional and frothy, as he said, when the apostle rightly requires that, since we are regenerated by one spirit into the doctrine of Christ, we should all be animated by the same spirit, not thinking differently or contradictorily, but the same for our one and the same faith? And it is certain that no other dissension encourages the enemies of the gospel of Christ to oppress us more than this very one, about which there is still most unfortunately controversy, the discussion of the Lord's Supper. But perhaps, as the same apostle testifies, there must be such sects, so that those who are approved may become manifest.</p>
      <p>The most honorable council of Bern is acting rightly, as, since foreign and diverse little birds have flown into their territory from various places, whose varied song I have learned from Haller's letters, they take the utmost care that the doctrine is not torn apart by the genuine curiosity of these people and that the sheep of Christ, who obey their command, are cared for miserably. For all ancient history testifies that the French are superstitious, and we owe the sophistry that has oppressed the churches of Christ for the last three centuries to no other land. But enough about that. I pray for this one thing, that the Lord does not disdain to grant our Switzerland the spirit of concord, whether it is required for the unity of doctrine or the integrity of civil administration; for I see that everything will collapse from dissension, which cannot be shaken by consensus.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the day after the calends of May, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>I am sending a poem along with this, which has the spirit of Philipp, against Isleb, worthy of reading, which you will return at some point.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>I commend to your faith the bearer of these letters, a most upright and truly learned man, Dr. Johann Walther from Bavaria, for whom I would very much like some honorable position to be provided through Dr. Haller, with you as a patron; he is a man of integrity and pure of crime and has a very honorable and pious wife from St. Gallen. Whatever service you bestow upon him, I will receive as bestowed upon me with great gratitude.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of ZÃ¼rich, my lord and as a brother.</p>
      <p>You will soon return these letters.</p>
