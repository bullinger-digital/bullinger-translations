      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most beloved man, along with the sealed package, and I give immense thanks to your kindness for that exceptional goodwill with which you treat me. I read the letters immediately and rejoice that everything is finally leaning towards the possibility that the cantons can return to mutual favor without harming piety; this is demanded, and even tearfully requested and prayed for, by our ancestral and hard-won LIBERTY, as well as the chastity of wives and children. May the Lord open the eyes of the people of the mountains, so that they may finally know and rightly weigh the efforts of their ancestors! I will return the acts themselves with the utmost fidelity as soon as I can, and I will read them diligently, so that I can recount everything to our senate orally without citing the author. This will not happen without the intervention of an oath; for our consuls are accustomed, whenever matters worthy of silence are reported in the senate, to remind everyone of the oath taken and to seriously forbid anyone from mentioning anything of the matter, which is entrusted with utmost fidelity, outside the council with any word.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I am returning the letters of Gastius enclosed here. What more? The Spaniards are not only striving for the monarchy of the Christian world but also for the miserable servitude of all of Germany, that is, of all Germans. The tribunes of Constance are already experiencing how much it benefits the good to flee into the arms of the Emperor with even the slightest hope of better things. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In St. Gallen, as much as business allowed, on the 4th day of February in the year 1549. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>Commend me to the most honorable men, the lords consuls, and greet my colleagues in my name. It is strange where the affairs of our Musculus have fallen; you are so completely silent about him in your letters. You are guilty if, through your efforts, such a humane, learned, and pious man is not doing very well; but by your very silence, I am persuaded not to doubt that he is doing well. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>I will diligently take care of the letters to Laetus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most magnificent city of ZÃ¼rich, my ever-honored lord.</p>
