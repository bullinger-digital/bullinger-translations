      <p>Peace and grace be with you.</p>
      <p>My friendly greetings and heartfelt trust, dear cousin Master Heinrich. I want to let you know that we are all fresh and healthy by the grace of God, and we always like to hear from you and yours.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I want to let you know that much trouble and sorrow, and additionally costs and damages, are growing and coming upon us because of my brother, and especially I feel much discontent and have to endure much that I have never experienced before, and all this for no fault of my own. Therefore, I call upon you as a friend, for friends are known in times of need, as you have been helpful to me before and my trust is placed in you, you will not let me down; for I must now pay 6 guilders for the claim of those who have a legal matter with Heini, I must provide them with such money by this coming Sunday. But if this does not happen, I must endure severe punishment. Therefore, my friendly request to you is whether you might help me with such money. I promise to repay you honorably with such similar money or if you could perhaps pawn the fur and lend such money on it until you sell it; for I know no refuge other than you. Therefore, I ask you to be helpful to me so that I do not suffer further damage and punishment. Where I can, I will repay such to you.</p>
      <p>I have much more to write to you, but I do not have the time. Nothing more, except God be with you, and greet your family for me.</p>
      <p>Given on the 20th day in the year 35.</p>
      <p>From me, Uli Bullinger in Brugg, your cousin.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear cousin, to be delivered.</p>
