      <p>Greetings. John Bale, formerly the Bishop of Ossory in Ireland, a refugee for Christ as you write, renowned for his writings and illustrious in piety, came to us along with Richard Turner and their wives. We welcomed them especially in the name of Christ and then in your name without hesitation and treated them as well as our modest means allowed. They spent the night at my place.</p>
      <p>Our Hamman also came to me, who did not fail to contribute his service to such an honorable company. He sends you heartfelt greetings.</p>
      <p>I sent my wife to Zurich to assist the wife of Anthony Spr√ºngli in her upcoming childbirth.</p>
      <p>She will undoubtedly inform you of my physical infirmity and excuse my absence. Both of us long to see each other's face with equal desire.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that what we desire may come to pass in due time; I have not yet resolved my mind. I earnestly request... this desire, at least in part, as far as it can be done now, and send with the present messenger Maurice if you have any notes on Jeremiah; for I have nothing left with me. On September 7... he began to describe the punishment itself due to sins, etc.</p>
      <p>I have this account and nothing more.</p>
      <p>Do not delay, I beseech you; send with the present messenger. Furthermore, I hear that your thoughts on the matter of Christ's atonement are printed.</p>
      <p>If this is true, let me know; I will make sure to have it myself. Moreover, write if there is anything I need to know, and farewell, incomparable friend.</p>
      <p>Our Hamman sends you greetings again.</p>
      <p>Greet your family in my name.</p>
      <p>Given at Lenzburg, December 14, 1557. Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my old and best friend and most esteemed brother in Christ.</p>
