      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, I received a bundle of letters sent by our Linero, which also contained those you see addressed to you. I wanted to add mine to yours because they contain certain things worth knowing, which perhaps Mr. Stettanus did not write in yours. The state of the city of Augsburg is most deplorable, and I wish the condition of affairs were not almost the same everywhere. You will be amazed, I am sure, at what Zündelinus writes; I think these people are mad with reason. Was it not enough to have offended God for several centuries with papal superstitions, that they must also bring back the gods of the nations? Surely Neptune and Mars will defend them against the rage of the Turks. And what is more ridiculous than to display victories and triumphs after losing Cyprus and bringing Crete to the brink of disaster? But who is a liar if not the antichrist? What wonder, then, if his conspirators also seriously play with God and feign victories amidst calamities? I would like Zündelinus's letter to be copied, and I think Mr. Wikius will gladly do this work for us; for it is a matter worthy of being included in the annals. You will keep everything for my arrival. We are all well, and the little daughter, freed from fever, is also better.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed father, with the whole family, whom you will greet in my name.</p>
      <p>Urdorf, August 25, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, etc., Zürich.</p>
