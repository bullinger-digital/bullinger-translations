      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Here in Bern, my dearest Bullinger in the Lord, Bartholom채us Metzler from Konstanz visited me. He received a promise from the senate of a future appointment, as soon as a suitable position becomes available for him; for at present, there was nothing that could be assigned to this excellent man. The lords also gave him travel expenses of 2 crowns. Therefore, he remains in his place, where he has stayed until now. Until he is called. I wish that our Gervasius would also be provided for according to his age, dignity, and learning. My godfather Haller is now beginning to pursue his case, since the appointed term has passed, as he says. He can be persuaded to stay here if a certain and increased stipend is given; the lords ought to do this of their own accord, without being reminded. It is not my place to remind anyone, lest I seem to be acting beyond propriety and pursuing my own affairs. I do not wish him to leave; for he is of great benefit to this church in maintaining peace and already has experience in those matters which must be dealt with almost daily. The decision of your senate will stand, provided that the necessary stipend is considered.</p>
      <p>Everything else here is quite comfortable, even in my own home. I wrote recently about my wife and do not doubt that you have received it. The children are beginning to recover by the grace of the Lord, who does not abandon those who hope in Him. Farewell very well, dearest of men.</p>
      <p>Both my wife and children send their warmest greetings to you and all of yours, and Z체rich is constantly on their lips.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all the lords and brothers and to our Gervasius. Bern, May 26, 1549.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours entirely in the Lord</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian M. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the church in Z체rich, dearest and most esteemed lord and brother in Christ. In Z체rich.</p>
