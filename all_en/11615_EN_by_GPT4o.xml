    <p xml:id="regest1">In view of the upcoming grape harvest, but even more so in view of the rampant plague, they have decided, with the approval of the council, to cancel the upcoming synod. The dean is to inform the preachers of the chapter in good time and admonish them to perform their duties conscientiously, as befits them as role models for the faithful; God's punishments threaten if we do not improve our bad way of life; the army of King [Ferdinand] has been defeated by the Turks at Buda; from all sides, the Turks and other evils are pressing upon us. If a preacher has made himself so guilty that the case cannot simply be handed over to the next synod, the dean is to report this in writing. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Until now, we have been accustomed to celebrate the synod in the city twice a year according to the holy and useful rite of the old church, dearest brother in the Lord, and indeed this very month a set day will come when the other would gather in the Lord. However, because of the impending tasks of the grape harvest, and especially because of the plague beginning to spread almost everywhere, it is better and more useful for everyone to remain at home and with the church entrusted to them. It has pleased all of us, with the consent of our magistrate, to completely cancel the upcoming and now imminent synod.</p>
      <p>We inform you of this, dearest brother in the Lord, so that you may inform each of the brothers through the chapter in good time and exhort them in the name of our Lord Christ to serve Christ faithfully in their office, that is, to feed the sheep entrusted to their faith with the word of truth, to teach repentance with faith, to urge constant prayers, and finally to live holy and blameless lives, as befits examples of the flock. For the greatest and most numerous scourges of God threaten our necks unless we amend our worst ways with a better life. The army of King Ferdinand has been defeated by the Turks at Buda, the enemy of the faith triumphs and becomes insolent, and indeed threatens very gravely, and many other evils rush upon us from all sides.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore turn to the Lord, that He may in turn turn to us according to His promise through Jeremiah in chapter 18 [7f].</p>
      <p>If any of the brothers has sinned more grievously either in function or in life, so that it is not appropriate for his case to be deferred to the next synod, indicate him by letter, so that his case may be known and what needs to be done may be deliberated. Farewell with all yours in Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich, the day before the calends of October in the year 1541.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful minister of Christ, the dean of the chapter of Bremgarten, dearest brother. Bremgarten.</p>
