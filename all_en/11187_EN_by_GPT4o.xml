    <p xml:id="regest1">The official duties are burdensome; Vogler and his wife regret the illness of Mrs. Bullinger. Thanks for sending the farewell [of the Zurich meeting] and urges Bullinger not to grieve over the discord. He was in Strasbourg because of his son [Hans], where he also met with fellow believers; he realized that the city, as well as Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse], is well-disposed towards Zurich. It is said that King [Christian III] of Denmark and [Margrave Johann of Brandenburg-Küstrin] have been admitted to the Schmalkaldic League, but King [Francis I] of France has been rejected, while King [Henry VIII] of England has not succeeded in his request because some members do not want to anger the Emperor; the theologians are said to have made a submission concerning, among other things, church property. [Kaspar] Hedio reported that Elector [Ludwig V] keeps an honest preacher [Heinrich Stoll] and shows tolerance regarding the marriage of priests; he is strongly influenced by his mistress [Margarete von der Leyen], who leans towards the Gospel. The French king, after being rejected by the Schmalkaldic League, has cunningly tried to invest money in Strasbourg; at least he does not seem to harass the evangelical refugees returning to France. It is said that Count [Anton of Oldenburg] has occupied land of the Bishop of Münster [Franz von Waldeck], whereupon the allied Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] was called for help. Emperor [Charles V] and King [Francis I] are said to have parted ways; there is talk of a truce. In Ensisheim, troops were raised against the Turks, for [Sultan Suleiman I] changed his intentions after the murder of [Ludovico Gritti]; Venice has dismissed its mercenaries. [Gabriel] Salamanca is said to have become bailiff of Ensisheim again. Hans is now learning better and did well in an exam; he sends his regards to Bullinger. Vogler would like the coat of arms to be sent to him via Myconius. In the matter of his cousin, he can report nothing new, as his letter only reached the Rhine Valley late through bailiff [Diepolt Kolb]; he has heard that Gotthard [Richmut] sent his sons [Jakob and Konrad] with [Johannes] Haab [to the Rhine Valley], sends regards to [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, and hopes that the girl finds a good husband. Thanks for the news and asks Bullinger to share the present news with Lavater and [Diethelm] Röist. Asks to write again soon, and sends regards to Bullinger's family and the maid [Brida Schmid]. A good successor [Matthias Erb] has been found for Erasmus [Schmid].</p>

      <p>God's grace be with us.</p>
      <p>My beloved lord and brother, knowing of our well-being, yet with the heavy burden of office. That your dear wife is ill is a heartfelt sorrow to me and my wife; may the Lord grant her patience and bless your entire household.</p>
      <p>I thank you for your friendly sending of the farewell, foremost to God the Lord, who can well endure that His children often strive for His honor, each thinking to a better end, and when the quarrel lasts long, the housefather can lay down such a struggle to His praise and to the terror of all those who rejoice in discord, and unite His children; yes, through this He also teaches us to recognize His goodness. I ask you, for your person, as always, to let no bitter root grow, for strangers praise and trust you for others.</p>
      <p>I was in Strasbourg for the mass, on behalf of my son, and also to visit the city. Truly, the brothers have shown us much honor, especially mentioning and inquiring about you, also Leonhard. They speak much, much honor of all. Although the beginning of Joseph's appearance seemed rough, the end was to God's praise; for I have no doubt that the pious, honest city of Strasbourg is well-disposed towards my gracious lords of Zurich with great patience and endurance, yes, even the Landgrave and others, in which our hearts should rightly be thankful to God.</p>
      <p>I think you are well informed about some Schmalkaldic dealings. It is said that the King of Denmark has been admitted to the Schmalkaldic League, and another lord, whose name I have forgotten. King Francis of France has requested to join; he was rejected. Likewise, the King of England has also requested to join, but again could not succeed. For they say, some do not want to anger the Emperor (like Augsburg), which some think cannot last, to serve two masters, Christ, etc. Also, the servants of the word of God have submitted common articles to Schmalkalden, concerning, among other things, that one should not burden oneself with the goods of the church against God, etc.</p>
      <p>Hedio and others have truly told me that the Elector has an honest preacher with him, well known to him, Hedio. Also, some of his people have requested a preacher. He asked where they knew one?</p>
      <p>They said they knew one, but he had a flaw. He asked: "What flaw?" They said: "He has a wife and child." He said: "Yes, take him in," etc., although the marriage was before Peter. Because of this, other surrounding lords and cities are secretly alarmed; for they almost all look to the Elector. May the Lord God increase it. But it is a wondrous judgment of God at the Elector's court. His servants bring him much to the Gospel; for they love the word of God and have access to certain preachers. They prepare much for him, it is said.</p>
      <p>Also, they tell me confidentially: When the King of France also requested to join the Schmalkaldic League, being rejected, he is said to have cunningly requested Strasbourg to allow him to invest some money in their city; but they do not trust him, I hear. Yet he now allows those who were exiled for the sake of faith and have returned to France to rest in peace. We still hope that France will fall to the voice of God.</p>
      <p>Also, it is said that a count near the Bishop of Münster has taken some lands from the same bishop, etc. However, since the bishop has an understanding with the Landgrave, he thinks to help him. The Landgrave is also preparing, as are some others, who are stationed before Münster. Yet one thinks it requires good vigilance; it might well be a bad plan. It is also said that the Emperor and King have parted ways; whether there is a truce, they talk about.</p>
      <p>Also, in Ensisheim, some soldiers, who have given some money in this region, have been mustered against the Turks. Some have come back. They say that one, whose name I have forgotten, has killed and harmed a close relative and acquaintance of the Turk. This is the reason the Turk has been turned away. The Venetians have also dismissed their soldiers, who were against the Turk, and paid them honorably, etc.</p>
      <p>Finally, it is said that Salamanca has become bailiff of Ensisheim again and this one (the previous one) has taken leave. It seems that many have very little joy.</p>
      <p>My son Johann initially learned poorly, but now satisfactorily. The lords of Strasbourg have examined him and others; he has fairly pleased them in the test. May the Lord bless him further. He sends you friendly thanks and greetings.</p>
      <p>Also, I would gladly endure that the coat of arms were made; for it has been long delayed. Yet when it is made, I ask you (if no one comes down for my sake), to send it to Basel to Myconius as soon as you can, by a good friend, where it is kept, and write to him that he then informs me or sends it by good message, as often as he comes to Colmar, to the inn Zum Plumen. He will then send it to me.</p>
      <p>Regarding my cousin, I can give no information at this time, because neither she nor her brother have entrusted or informed me of anything in response to my letter, which I sent to them. But the letter arrived too late, which I sent to the bailiff at Platten from the Rhine Valley; it was, as I hear, sent directly from Zurich to Pfäffers. What has been handled since then, I cannot know; I must wait until I can deal with someone. I find enough friends, while I had those who had much good; I would always like to have friends who are friends in need, as I have indeed found some, thank God. I hear Gotthard has sent his sons with master Haab. I believe he is so skilled that he would still like to have a bird, etc. Send my friendly greetings to Lavater. I pray to my God that this daughter may become one to the praise of God and her salvation, etc.</p>
      <p>I ask you to kindly thank bailiff Lavater for his friendly writing of the new news. This you will inform my lord Röist and him of the news.</p>
      <p>Write to me again soon. Ask my brother-in-law, the provost, about the message (letter delivery). My wife sends you, your wife, mother, and children, also the maid, friendly greetings, until God helps us together again someday. Master Erasmus has taken leave with him. We have an honest man in his place.</p>
      <p>Written in Riquewihr, on the 9th day of July in the year 1538. Your willing Johann Vogler, steward in Riquewihr.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my beloved lord and friend, to his hands, etc.</p>
