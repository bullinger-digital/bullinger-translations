      <p>The grace of the Lord and the increase of faith, along with my willing services, I wish you beforehand, dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>How the matters of faith in the Confederation will stand with time, the wonderful, strange things at this time well show, which are now happening in the Confederation. If the good Lord and Father does not protect us, I fear we will soon experience it with great sorrow. Now I recognize (know) that you, along with your brothers and many pious people, bear not a little concern for such things, but unfortunately cannot change everything with such pious people. Of these things, if I were with you, I would have much to discuss with you, which I have not been able to entrust to the pen at this time; however, I have attached something (of such matters), though not everything, to this bearer, my good friend (who otherwise had to go to Zurich on his business), to discuss with you, whom you should trust. He will speak confidentially with you. You may also do the same with him (as if I myself were there) and let the same and the matters of the Gospel be faithfully entrusted to you, as I know you yourself are very willing and inclined to do. I hereby commend you to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greet Leo Jud, Pellican, and the brothers in general, the old abbot of Wettingen, Steiner of Zug, also all who love the Lord from the heart, and, if possible, Lavater as well.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, the last of September, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your willing Jacob Meyer, former mayor of Basel.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and before God well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the Lord's word in Zurich, my dear and in the Lord brotherly friend, to his own hands.</p>
