      <p>[...] partly so that you might learn about those new Italian writings composed by Mr. Lentulus for your and our benefit, and understand with amazement how servilely the Venetians present themselves to the Turkish emperor, and partly (as you have already heard at length from the same Thomann) so that you would not be unaware that the seat of this third, and hopefully final, judgment has been moved to the bishop's castle, not without particular annoyance to our people. The proceedings began yesterday, namely on the 24th of July of this year 1573. The first to take the risk was Baptista von Salis, who (as they say) proved with truthful witnesses that he had been oppressed by false testimony in the Thusis judgment, especially by those who said he had wished the point of the sword upon all the Rhaetian preachers and that, if the homeland wanted peace, all should be removed. For the expenses incurred, a thousand gold coins were decreed for him to spend, which he is rightfully allowed to demand from those whose testimony had suppressed him, who are also today summoned by public letters sent to them to account for their testimonies. Thus, the papal leader was freed and did not suffer any loss of honor or reputation. - Mr. Lentulus wishes to know what the costs would be if Mr. Froschauer were to print the book. I wish to know, even in brief, whether Mr. Haller has returned from Baden. If you wish to have the main points of the Helvetians' actions, I will send them. 1573, 25th of July.</p>
