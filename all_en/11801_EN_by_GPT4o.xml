      <p>Greetings. I am sending you here, most learned and dearest Bullinger, the books that I could find, and I will send the rest in due time, if I can obtain them in any way:</p>
      <p>On the Authority of the Word of God 8 rap.</p>
      <p>Idioms by Witzel 8 rap.</p>
      <p>C. Julius Hyginus, freedman of Augustus 6 batz. Church Order of Schwäbisch Hall 2½ batz. Julius Firmicus etc. 9 batz.</p>
      <p>Soon I will also send the anatomical book. There will be three books: 1. It will have everything that pertains to the structure of the human body, described most accurately; 2. It will be an epitome and illustrated with its own large figures; 3. It will be in German, which I have not yet seen, but is already being prepared for the press. If you want all three, I will procure them. Indicate with just one word. After the index to the main volume has been completed, you will have it, if I conveniently come across a courier, and I will assign the price and, as much as I can, buy it at the cheapest, yet fair, price from the doctor, who also sends you his regards.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Greet Theodor and Phrisius. June 15, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, esteemed teacher. Zurich.</p>
