    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius has risen from the dead, but not immortal like the Lord! He thanks Bullinger for having so thoughtfully prepared him for the path to the Lord. May Bullinger experience something similar when he needs it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Johannes Gast reports [with letter No. 2832] in more detail. Today, a scholar shared the questionable news that Emperor Charles V had written to the XIII Cantons and informed them that he was very well informed about their negotiations at the last and the current Baden Diet. The Confederates should beware of undertaking anything against him or the Empire. If they behaved as they have so far, he would be a good lord to them. Does Bullinger know anything about this?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The people of Strasbourg will only accept peace with the Emperor if they can maintain their freedoms, their religion, and their alliances, and also do not have to pay homage or accept a garrison. Landgrave Philip of Hesse intends to follow this example if he is offered peace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Elector John Frederick of Saxony is fighting successfully. Two mercenaries report that they survived a battle in which the Elector defeated Duke Maurice of Saxony and Margrave Albert Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In a letter from the Rector [Wolfgang Lazius] of the University of Vienna to Johannes Oporin, it is stated that King Ferdinand I had again ordered persecutions of Lutherans at the university and that three respected scholars were discovered and expelled.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Pope Paul III and the Emperor are at odds. But since both are godless, let the devil count on them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, also to Rudolf Gwalther and the other colleagues. Myconius writes from his bed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] Thanks to Bullinger for the explanation regarding Gwalther's [“Endtchrist”].</p>

      <p>S. I have come back to life, but not like the Lord, who will never die again. I will face death when it pleases Him. I thank you for your concern for me, through which you have tried to make me as well-prepared as possible on the path to the Lord. May the Giver of good things also reward you on my behalf when you need it most.</p>

      <p>Gastius will report the rest; I will write a few things. A learned man told me today that the Emperor wrote to the thirteen Cantons (as he called them) that he knows what they have done in the recent assemblies and will also know what they are going to do in the current ones. They should be careful not to attempt or dare anything against his person or majesty or against the Empire, for if they do otherwise, he will not tolerate it. But if they remain as they have been, he will be a good and kind Emperor. I wonder if these things are true. If you know anything, let us know.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>If the people of Strasbourg manage to secure the safety of their freedom, their religion, and the loyalty of their allies, they will make peace with the Emperor, but only on the condition that homage and supplication are waived and no garrison is sent. Landgrave Philip of Hesse will follow the same reasoning if peace is offered.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Elector is fighting successfully. Two soldiers reported that they fled from a battle in which the Elector achieved victory against Maurice and Margrave Albert. It is certain that they said so. The whole world should pray for the Elector's safety and success.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From the letters of the Rector of Vienna to Oporinus, it is clear that the King has ordered a new inquisition at the university against the Lutherans and that three learned and great men have been found and exiled.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Pope and the Emperor do not agree, and the Emperor seems to be embittered against the Pope, but since both are godless, let Satan trust them.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I cannot write more. Farewell in Christ with Gwalther and all the other pious brothers. From Basel, from my bed, on the first day of March in the year 1547. Yours, Os. Myco.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>You did a great favor by explaining Gwalther's matter so clearly. I thank you for that.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and pious brother and most esteemed lord in Christ. Zurich.</p>
