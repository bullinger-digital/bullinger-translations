    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich can complain about the lack of letters just as rightfully as Bullinger [in his not received letter]. Both excuse the difficult times. Frölich would have plenty of (completely harmless!) news to report, but he lacks the courage because decent people have already been terribly punished for such transmissions of news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">German freedom is lost. It can (God willing) only be regained over time. The imperial princes must remain in Augsburg against their will and are being worn down by the high expenses. On the side of the Emperor and [the imperial estates], there is much negotiation about the so-called Landfrieden, the Imperial Chamber Court, tax levies, and the Imperial League. However, there is no decision or announcement about this yet. The ruined imperial cities are burdened with much. They will hardly recover from it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">During these long and hard negotiations, many crimes are happening everywhere. The moral decay and the harsh persecution of supposed heresy have even been introduced by the Augsburgers themselves into their city! Many good people hope and pray that a heavenly judgment will put an end to it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Meanwhile, there has been extensive consultation on how to behave in the churches until the council is convened [uniformly]: Charles V will apparently grant [the Protestants] the marriage of priests, communion in both kinds, and the Regensburg justification doctrine [of 1541]. The Protestant churches do not have to be burdened again with idols and may continue to forgo certain rites such as the consecration of water and salt. Free preaching also remains allowed, provided the respective confessions do not slander each other. As always, however, the Papists are not willing to introduce any change in their communities but want to tolerate that the Lutherans adhere to the [Interim] ordinance. The Emperor is said to be disappointed by the lack of obedience of his [Catholic] subjects but continues to seek [an agreement]. Oh, may they refrain from this so-called Interim and follow the advice of Gamaliel [namely to leave the judgment of the confessions to God]. Then there would be hope that the [Catholic] devil's doctrine will soon collapse.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Frölich thanks Bullinger for the book gift [«Series et digestio temporum»]. The title alone suggests the great usefulness of the writing! He has so far only read the dedication letter with the reference to [Rudolf Gwalthers «Οἰκέτης sive servus ecclesiasticus»] and is pleased with the obvious friendship between the [two] theologians! [Of the other copies sent to him] he handed one to Wolfgang Musculus, who had already received the writing from Johannes Haller. He could not safely transmit the third copy to the [imprisoned] Duke Johann Friedrich I of Saxony (who in any case does not take great pleasure in Latin reading). Therefore, he handed it over instead in Bullinger's name to [the Augsburg city advocate] Nikolaus [Müller, called] Maier.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">He has heard nothing about the release of the Duke so far. Certainly, he will not be released from captivity because many fear his great steadfastness [in faith]. Regarding the rumor that Landgrave Philip of Hesse will soon be released, Frölich knows nothing reliable.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">He was slandered by [the Augsburg] privy councilor Hans Welser (to whom Bullinger had dedicated his commentary on Matthew [correctly: commentary on Luke]) and is therefore now in a very dangerous situation: He is accused of having accused the Emperor of breach of word and disloyalty. Bullinger thus sees his distress: The Augsburgers, to whom he has faithfully served for twelve years, are putting him in such great distress instead of protecting him and his family! He is much too cautious for such improper expressions. He has never slandered the Emperor but has always duly honored him! Why then is Frölich facing a life of sadness? Will he even one day be brought down by envy and slander? What misery! But God will also put an end to this. [Until then] Frölich will find comfort in Bullinger's book gift.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">He does not hold it against Christoph Froschauer the Elder that he does not want to print the writing [«De bello germanico in laudem Ioannis Pedionaei»] directed against Johannes Pedionaeus' work [«De bello Germanico Liber»] by [Thomas Naogeorg] as a precaution. The [general] circumstances are already dangerous and repugnant enough!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Frölich has not yet been able to deliver the six copies of the «Eidgenössische Chronik» by Johannes Stumpf, which he received from Froschauer, to the intended recipients. However, he will soon settle the debts [for the books] with him, as he has already informed him. Bullinger should ask him for some patience.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">Frölich congratulates the Zurichers on their [secure] situation. He himself would also like to finally be freed from his unbearable situation, be it through exile or another position!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">Sebastian Schertlin, as heard in Augsburg, has committed himself to King Henry II of France and thereby [once again] betrayed the Emperor. If that is true, new difficulties also await Frölich, his close confidant. He will be accused of having traveled twice to Schertlin [in Constance] at the risk of his life. He had advised him against approaching France. A great misfortune!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">As far as Frölich can assess, the Emperor is striving for peace and forgiveness. It is therefore hardly to be feared that he will launch a liberation strike against his enemies this year. Rather, he will ensure calm and general peace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">The Zurichers should support the weakened Augsburgers with prayers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">Wolfgang Musculus and Sebastian Lepusculus will hopefully be able to hold on in Augsburg. Little is to be expected from the other [pastors]: They are uneducated and do not maintain a decent way of life.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">May Gwalther, Haller, and the Zurich pastors fare well. Frölich includes Zurich in his prayers. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">He received Bullinger's letter [not received] on April 10, 1548.</p>

      <p>S.P.D. As you accuse silence, I rightfully accuse the same, my most desired Bullinger. However, the difficulty of the times will excuse both. I would have almost infinite things to write. However, I lack the audacity to write, even though they are such that they could not rightfully offend any good person. Let us therefore yield to the horrible examples that teach how easily even the best can be punished.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It is now over for the freedom of Germany, which no one will easily recover unless time, whose duty it is to change (yet only if God allows and ordains it), intervenes. The princes of the empire are held here most unwillingly. They consume much and squander. Indeed, they themselves are consumed! Much has been discussed here and there about public peace, which they call provincial peace, about the judgment of the Imperial Chamber Court, and about contributions. There has also been discussion about the league, but nothing has yet been concluded or published. I see many burdens miserably imposed on the wretched cities, which, as they are utterly ruined, will hardly ever flourish again.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Meanwhile, while everything here is conducted for a long time and indeed severely, many robberies occur almost everywhere, many murders, and we have planted the very Sodom and Sorbonne of crimes in our city. Many good people hope and pray that fire will fall from heaven and finally put an end to such great evils.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Furthermore, there has been much and long discussion about religion, namely how and in what manner to live in the churches in the meantime until a council is convened. The Emperor, as I constantly hear, would grant priestly marriage, both kinds of the sacrament, and the article of justification, as it was long ago reduced to form at Regensburg. He would not burden the temples with idols and would admit free preaching of the gospel, provided that one party does not slander or criticize the other, and would leave the consecration of salt, water, and such things free. But the Papists (always the same!) do not want to yield even a hair, but they say they will allow the Lutherans to live by that order, while they themselves will keep their rites intact. This, as it is said, displeases the Emperor greatly, as he had promised himself much piety and obedience from his subjects, but now experiences nothing less in reality. Would that these discussions, which they call the Interim, would fall into oblivion and that everything would be conducted according to the most salutary advice of Gamaliel. From this, I would hope shortly that the doctrine of the devil would vanish in itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I give you immortal thanks for the gift of the book, which, as the title suggests, will bring nothing but great utility. I have at least seen the dedicatory letter, whose mutual exchange and reciprocal dedication greatly pleases me. For I truly rejoice from the heart that there is such good agreement among the teachers of the word and that the sweetness of friendship is thus exercised. I gave one copy to Musculus, who replied that he had already received one from our Haller. I presented the third in your name to Doctor Nikolaus Maier (the Duke of Saxony is not safely approached nor is he greatly delighted by Latin reading).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I still understand nothing about his release, due to his outstanding constancy, perhaps also for the reason that his virtue is formidable to some. There is a rumor that the Landgrave will soon be released. But I know nothing certain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Consul Welser, to whom you dedicated your Matthew, throws me into extreme dangers by impiously and falsely babbling about me, as if I were saying and pronouncing that the Emperor stands by no promises and keeps faith with no one. Behold, my brother Bullinger, in what miseries I am involved! For those to whom I have subjected my soul, whom I have served so faithfully for twelve years with so many labors, whose patronage should make me and mine safe and sound, are oppressing us foully. I have, by the immortal God, so moderated my words and governed my mouth that nothing of the sort has ever come from my mouth. I know indeed that the king is not to be maligned, just as in this I am not only innocent, but have always duly revered the Emperor. What then will Laetus do in this age but spend the rest of his life in utmost sadness or be miserably killed one day by the envy and slanders of calumniators? Oh, my man, how bitterly I suffer. However, the Lord of all things will also put an end to these. I will take consolation from your book sent to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I do not blame Froschauer for fearing to print the writing in Pedioneum and refusing. The matters are quite unworthy, dangerous, and odious.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I received six (if I am not mistaken) copies of the Chronicles from Froschauer, which I still have in my house and have not yet been able to share with those I intended. I therefore beg you to ask Froschauer, a most excellent man, not to take the delay in counting the money badly, but to wait a little more patiently. I have made myself his debtor and will pay the debt in good faith. I also wrote to him, almost in the manner that is pre-tasted.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I congratulate your fortune as much as I can. Would that the Lord would finally free me from my more than intolerable function and transfer me either into exile or another servitude. I indeed bear unbearable things. May God sustain the excessive burden! Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>There is a rumor here that Sebastian Schertler has gone to France. If so, I am ensnared in new nets. For since Schertler has regarded me as a brother, but now has designed something, however small, against the Emperor, I will be the first among the suspicious, not considering that I have been with him twice at great personal risk and have done nothing other than to dissuade the man from committing himself to the French sea. Thrice, therefore, I am unfortunate.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>As far as I can conjecture, the Emperor is striving for peace and clemency. Nor would I greatly fear that his majesty will seek revenge on his enemies this year, but rather that he will consult for common peace and tranquility.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Help our weakness with your prayers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I hope Musculus will remain steadfast, as well as Lepusculus. I promise nothing about the rest, for they are neither learned nor of good life.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>I sincerely wish that Lord Gwalther, Haller, and the whole crown of the Muses are safe. I pray for all happiness for your republic from the Lord of things. Farewell. April 10, 1548.</p>

      <p>Your letters were delivered to me today.</p>
      <p>Yours, G. L.</p>
