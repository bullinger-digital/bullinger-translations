    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller is concerned about the situation of the Reformation in Solothurn, which is endangered by the Anabaptists and Catholics, but he doubts the justification and expediency of the death penalty against the Anabaptists, especially since the Catholics went unpunished. He repeats his request for an interpretation of the term "conscience" in Romans 2:15 and for the prompt dispatch of the printed Zofingen records.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Our Symlerus undoubtedly delivered the letters I entrusted to him, dearest Heinrich.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, nothing else has happened except that the defection of the people of Solothurn greatly disturbs us. The Anabaptists dominate there, even those who boast of supporting part of the gospel, disregarding all ministers of the word, so much so that I fear nothing more than that soon both the Anabaptists and the Catholics will entirely abandon us. The common people everywhere, even though they have cleansed the temples in 24 parishes, are afraid for themselves. No one is ashamed to have denied the faith of Christ, even if they know it. The Anabaptists harass us excessively and gather more freely and openly than before in the Solothurn area. In our area, the more secretly they act, the more the common people are drawn to their gatherings. It concerns me, as I wrote to you before and understood your judgment on these matters, that everything is permitted to the Catholics, even if they neglect sacred gatherings, mock the word of the Lord, and speak ill of the entire business of Christ. Even though vices have their penalties, they still have their defenders. No one strives to enforce what the magistrates have decreed, as the lawmakers are not only the first transgressors but also connive with the transgressors, and those who seem to have devoured the gospel have become very lukewarm and contentious among themselves. Those who are from the Anabaptists avoid vices, attack them, meet very closely among themselves, and are most devoted to their laws and hypocrisy. They also greatly deceive the simple-minded, even though many hope to be freed from tithes and taxes through them.</p>
      <p>If they are now to be punished with death because they err, because they cause turmoil, why should not the same law be applied to the Catholics and the vicious? I have no doubt about their error, having been informed by you in many ways, but I am not yet certain about abolishing it by the sword, as their death confirms the error in many and their number rather increases than decreases, while we, who are of the gospel and should expect persecution from all for Christ's sake, also have those whom we persecute, who should rather glory in the cross and affliction. Thus, I am accustomed to pouring out my feelings to you, which you can more easily address because you are also very well-versed in the reading of the ancients.</p>
      <p>Therefore, what is conscience, where it is broad, narrow, disturbed, erroneous, bad, good, and right, I have recently prayed for you to explain when you have leisure, and now I beseech and implore you to indicate.</p>
      <p>If the acts of Zofingen have been printed, urge that they be sent to us as soon as possible. Delay is dangerous and indeed very great. Megander said he recommended to both you and Leo that you apply your refinement, and I wish it has been done!</p>
      <p>Now farewell, and may all who love Christ with you and love you in Him also fare well.</p>
      <p>Bern, 12th of September.</p>
      <p>Your B. Haller.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his kind, beloved lord and brother.</p>
