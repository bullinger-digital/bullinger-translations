      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dealing with the Anabaptists in an orderly manner is half the work. They are also so easily led astray right at the beginning that they cannot proceed further in the matter. Now, my advice would be to deal with them as follows.</p>
      <p>First, it is important to define with which weapons this battle is to be fought, so that in the action itself, what should have been clear and defined does not obscure and disturb the whole matter. Therefore, after prayers and a preface, you will immediately propose this proposition:</p>
      <p>When disputes and arguments arise among Christians concerning faith, they should be decided and clarified with the holy biblical scriptures of the Old and New Testaments.</p>
      <p>However, you should present this proposition plainly. As soon as it has been publicly read, you will call out: If anyone thinks differently, let them come forward. You will thus force out, wherever it may be hidden, the denial of the Old Testament.</p>
      <p>If they then come forward and begin a disputation, introducing arguments to suggest that the Old Testament is abolished, you should in your responses hold firmly to the truth, not allowing yourselves to be led away from the position, and only defending what needs to be defended. Then take note of the arguments they introduce, and strive with all your might to always clearly prove that the introduced sayings are not against your position, nor have they invalidated it, and always keep an eye on the position. Secondly, do not allow yourselves to be led away from the scripture, nor from the cited sayings, until everyone sees that they have done violence to the introduced saying and that it does not serve their purpose. And there, accept nothing lightly and press them and hold them to their position. Do not let anything pass, only ensuring that their objections are answered. And no more words!</p>
      <p>But first, be wary of the word: law. In this lies the greatest contention of this part, and they will shamelessly abuse the ambiguity of the word. For they will reason thus: "The law is abolished, Heb. 8 [13]. Therefore, there is no authority of the Old Testament in disputation."</p>
      <p>Behold, in that place Paul spoke only of the ceremonial law by synecdoche, of sacrifice and priesthood, as is evident from the preceding and following, especially from chapter 7. Again, they will infer: "The law condemns; therefore, the Old Testament condemns." For they do not see that the law is here used by metalepsis for sin, which is revealed by the law Rom. 4 [15ff]. 7 [1ff]. Therefore, the law, insofar as it is taken for scripture and the perpetual will of God, is not abolished, unless you establish a trope in the word "abolished," which can be used for "fulfilled." Therefore, ensure that you soon put them in a dilemma through etymology and the name of the thing and the word, so that it is always clarified what "law" means in the introduced saying. For if it does not signify the holy scripture, the place will no longer fit.</p>
      <p>If you have sufficiently examined them on the article, do not let them introduce anything else, then say: "Do you know nothing more?" If they know nothing more, and you know more than they do, then show it with your answer. For this greatly benefits the people.</p>
      <p>Finally, hold on to this and say: "Now we want to show you our foundation, our position, to inform you further or to hear if you can bring anything new against it, which you have not been able to establish against our opinion so far." And here ensure that you have presented your foundation in the shortest, strongest, and clearest way, only presenting the best, and then report them all, one after the other in order. And when they are all reported, then return to the first foundation, report it again and say: "If anyone wants to overthrow it, let them do so with scripture." If they then come with the previous chatter, say it is answered according to the state of the present matter. And do the same with all the following foundations.</p>
      <p>Finally, ensure that you are strong and energetic in the collection, on the opinion: "Since it has been found with God's word that one must endure the scripture" etc. (here briefly recount what has been proven so far and with what arguments), "we now hope to have achieved that all disputes should be decided with the Old and New Testament, and ensure that this is now written down and maintained in all disputation and not acted against" etc. And there accept nothing lightly!</p>
      <p>If you require some support and testimonies for the Old from the New Testament, take these. You refine, illustrate, and arrange them:</p>
      <p>1. 2. Tim. 3 [14ff]: "But you, continue" etc. Ask, what are the sacred letters in which Timothy was educated, since the New Testament was not yet written. But soon follows the explanation: "All scripture is God-breathed." But which is that? Peter answers 2. Pet. 1 [20f]: "All prophetic scripture" etc.</p>
      <p>2. The gospel is the testimony about Jesus Christ. But Christ says: "Search the scriptures, and they are the ones that testify about me" [John 5:39]. Therefore, scripture and gospel fall into the same.</p>
      <p>3. Paul says he is "set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures": Rom. 1 [1f].</p>
      <p>4. Christ himself, revealing the source of error to the Sadducees, says they do not know the scriptures and refers back to the prophets: Matt. 22 [29].</p>
      <p>5. The same in Luke reveals that Abraham answered: "They have Moses and the prophets" etc.: Luke 16 [29].</p>
      <p>6. In the transfiguration, Moses and Elijah appear together with Christ: Matt. 17 [3].</p>
      <p>7. Paul says he preaches nothing other than what Moses and the prophets taught: Acts 26 [22]. But in Galatians, he denies and denies teaching legal things.</p>
      <p>8. The Bereans tested everything with the scriptures: Acts 17 [11].</p>
      <p>9. Christ opened the scriptures to the disciples: Luke 24 [27].</p>
      <p>10. Paul hands over the scriptures to the churches: 1. Cor. 15 [3f].</p>
      <p>11. The evangelists confirm their writings with the scriptures.</p>
      <p>12. Paul says everything was written for our sake: Rom. 4 [23f].</p>
      <p>There are countless others of this kind, but these are incidental.</p>
      <p>Once the article has been conquered, with what weapons one should fight, it will then be necessary to also agree on how to use the weapons. Secondly, therefore, you will dispute about the genuine sense of scripture. For in this there is great dispute, as one says: "Thus I understand it," but another: "Thus I." With this, one cannot know who understood it correctly or not. Here you can now set this position:</p>
      <p>But the scripture should not be interpreted according to human pleasure and spirit, but with and through itself, also with the rule of faith and love.</p>
      <p>Or you can say, you want to know whether the scripture should be understood according to the letter or whether it should be interpreted. If they say it should be understood according to the letter, then argue against them: "The Father is greater than I" [John 14:28], "This is my body" [Mark 14:22], "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man" [John 6:53], "Pluck out your eye" [Matt. 5:29], "He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet" etc. [John 13:10]. So it must be interpreted. But how? Here it is disputed. Let them show the method. If they show a false one, attack it! If true, write it down! And ensure that you make everything clear there, as sufficiently mentioned in the first article, that you always do your utmost in the end. What I have in this matter, I share with you.</p>
      <p>It is proven by examples that scripture is to be interpreted:</p>
      <p>1. Of Christ, who interpreted the law Matt. 5 [17ff], the place of Isaiah from chapter 61 [1f] in Luke 4 [17ff], the scriptures to the disciples Luke 24 [27].</p>
      <p>2. Of Peter, who interpreted some places in Acts and epistles, but also testifies that some understand Paul with a perverse sense: 2. Pet. 3 [16]. Therefore, there is a correct and true sense.</p>
      <p>3. Of the Church, which interprets Psalm 2 [1f]: Acts 4 [24ff].</p>
      <p>4. Of Philip, who interpreted Isaiah to the eunuch: Acts 8 [35].</p>
      <p>5. Of Paul, who in Acts many, in Romans about Abraham and others some, in [1] Corinthians [5:7] the Passover, in Galatians many chapters 3.4.</p>
      <p>6. It is very clear in 1. Cor. 14 [28]: "But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church" etc., and: "Do not quench the Spirit" etc.: 1. Thess. 5 [19]. What, I ask, is clearer with these words?</p>
      <p>Now we will teach from the holy scriptures themselves how it is to be interpreted:</p>
      <p>1. It is not enough to have produced one place unless others are opposed. Otherwise, the devil would have prevailed: Matt. 4 [1ff]. The Sadducees: Matt. 22 [23ff]. They indeed brought scriptures, but also opposing and clearer places are opposed.</p>
      <p>2. Therefore, clearer ones must be applied to obscure ones, as Peter teaches 2. Pet. 1 [19ff].</p>
      <p>3. The place itself must be interpreted according to circumstances, faith, and charity. I prove: Thus Christ acts with the bill of divorce, Matt. 19 [3ff], Paul with the word "imputed," Rom. 4 [3ff], 1. Cor. 12.13 [?], James 2 [21ff].</p>
      <p>From these it now follows that this one, supported in the scriptures, is extracted and brought forth from the scriptures. Likewise, where less by more, more obscure by clearer, everything is directed according to faith and charity.</p>
      <p>Here, above all, ensure that they cease to dissent in these, but agree, and do not depart from here until they subscribe. For this will be useful so that later in the disputation itself they neither dare to boast of their spirit nor use the bare letter, and if they produce places of scripture, they must not only prove the sense from the scriptures but also seek testimonies from the scriptures.</p>
      <p>Then you will always be able to mock freely, always saying: "Now prove the understanding with scripture or I will turn your understanding with scripture." These indeed require a man exercised in the scriptures, but the victory is to be hoped for with certainty.</p>
      <p>Also beware, lest they heap up similar places under the guise of exposition. These places, with which we want to interpret, must either be clearer than the one about which the dispute is, or contrary, so that everyone can see from the contradiction that there is another sense underlying than the one the words present. There the circumstances, preceding, following, faith, charity must be examined.</p>
      <p>So far, this.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, take the articles in hand, and you will find that the work will be easier. And if they do not want to come to it and want to leave it beforehand, then show them that it does not happen out of any deceit, but to avoid future disputes and that one may act bravely, securely, and truthfully.</p>
      <p>This is what I have now held, that I advise you. May God give you, Caspar, and Franz, and other dear brothers wisdom, understanding, and victory by His word.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
