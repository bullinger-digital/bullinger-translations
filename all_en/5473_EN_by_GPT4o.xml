      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>We have written to you, most illustrious men and brothers in the Lord, about our troubled churches due to Stancarus, not only concerning the cause of the complete mediator Christ the Lord, but also in the doctrine of the Trinity. For he connects and defends both in such a way that he simultaneously overturns both.</p>
      <p>He confounds the Trinity and from it creates a threefold God, to whom he also appoints the Son of the same Trinity as mediator. However, he divides against the one Christ and leaves him the name of God in the Trinity.</p>
      <p>He removes the man outside the Trinity, to whom he assigns the roles of mediator, servant, and intercessor to the Trinity: which heresy Athanasius describes on folio 91 of Basel. Where the true and real distinction in the Trinity is to be retained, he wants none except of names: where unity is to be retained in one Christ, there he separates. Then he corrupts so many places of scripture with his Judaism (by which he confounds the Trinity for the sake of his mediator man and takes away divinity from the Son of God) that it cannot be discerned who is God the Father, who is his only Son, in whom all salvation is placed according to (John 17).</p>
      <p>Thus he interprets 1 Timothy 2: One God, one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, where he interprets one God as the Trinity. That they may know you, the only true God, i.e., the Trinity, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent, i.e., the man.</p>
      <p>You believe in God, i.e., the Trinity, and believe in me, i.e., the man. That we may know the true God, i.e., the Trinity, and be in his true Son.</p>
      <p>Whatever you ask the Father, i.e., the Trinity, in my name, i.e., the man, etc.</p>
      <p>We, however, can never interpret these places about the Trinity, but about the Father and the Son distinctly, just as those: So God loved the world, i.e., the Father, that he gave his Son.</p>
      <p>God did not spare his own Son, i.e., the Father.</p>
      <p>God reconciled all things to himself through the Son, i.e., the Father, not the Trinity, as Stancarus wants, etc.</p>
      <p>Just as other places speak of the Son alone: The Word was God. We are cleansed by the blood of God.</p>
      <p>Thus Romans 9 speaks of Christ alone: who is God blessed forever.</p>
      <p>My Lord and my God.</p>
      <p>Thus 1 John 5. For as we see the name of God simply attributed to the Father in the scriptures, so it is never given to the Son except with the explicit mention of his name, or the Word, or the flesh, or the blood. For the Father is simply God, begotten by no one.</p>
      <p>The Son of God, however, is God, but from God, and therefore true God because from the true God, just as he is true man because from true man. Hence he is consubstantial with God the Father because from the Father, just as he is consubstantial with us because born from true man, eternal, omnipotent, because from the eternal and omnipotent.</p>
      <p>Against Stancarus, however, because with his confusion he not only corrupts the true Trinity but also wants to abolish the Son of God, God from God, we object to the distinction observed everywhere in the scriptures: the form of baptism, the Apostolic Creed, a thousand places of scripture, and especially that place of Paul in 1 Corinthians 8, where a distinct confession about God the Father from whom all things are, and a distinct confession about the Son of God is made, and others about the Holy Spirit: about which we have written more extensively in our letters to you. Thus we explain other places which he adduces for his confusion: The Lord your God is one, and similar ones, which we understand about the Father, not about his confused Trinity, according to Paul's clear interpretation in 1 Corinthians 8, and of Christ himself in John 8: Whom you say is your God is my Father. John 3. Romans 8. etc., where the name of God is attributed only to the Father, just as in other places of scripture the name of God is attributed distinctly to the Son alone. Nor do we have only the testimonies of scripture here, but also of the fathers who lived with the apostles or followed the apostles.</p>
      <p>Thus Irenaeus in many places, book 4, chapters 1 and 2, book 3, chapter 6. Where he attributes the places of scripture: I am who I am, to the Father. Thus he calls the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and invokes him. Thus in book 3, chapter 9, he so often calls the one God the Father and in a thousand other places.</p>
      <p>Ignatius also speaks most clearly and distinctly about the Trinity in Epistle 9, 5, etc., and there is not one place where he speaks confusedly.</p>
      <p>Thus Tertullian in the prescriptions against heretics, where he sets forth the rule of faith inviolate except by heretics.</p>
      <p>Also writing the first book on the Trinity, he sets forth a confession about God the Father and similarly cites the testimonies of scripture about him, then about his Son Jesus Christ our Lord and God, and finally about the Holy Spirit, where he also contends with heretics about the word One, which is not used in the scriptures for two or three persons, but only in the neuter gender One, against Sabellius, folio 631 to the end. Thus there he deals excellently and most clearly against the same about the same distinction, and about the fact that they do not introduce two gods who distinctly believe the Father to be the true and one God, and also the Son of God, God from God: just as the Nicene Creed against Arius teaches. But he who introduces two principles, or two fathers, or two sons, or one not of the same nature as the begetter, introduces two gods, which also Hilary, Basil, Athanasius, etc. teach, nor is diversity or plurality of gods introduced in any other way, except in this one way, if a different nature is introduced, where now the Father would not be the principle of his Son, but there would be two principles, two unbegotten, such as Marcion was, etc. Thus Justin also teaches distinctly that it is to be believed, in the little book against Trypho the Jew, where he also does not fear to say that the Son of God is another God in number from the creator. Just as Basil denies that there is one God in number, and Cyprian in Epistle 141 in the Creed.</p>
      <p>Hilary also (book 7 on the Trinity, folio 128) defends this most clearly and speaks thus: One and one God, unbegotten God, only-begotten God.</p>
      <p>About the Father and the Son, he says, not two gods, but God and God. Thus in God the Father and in the Son you will not count two gods, because each is one, nor will you proclaim singular because each is not one. Therefore, the apostolic faith does not have two gods, because it does not have two fathers nor two sons, etc. He also censures the impious opinion of Sabellius who dared to proclaim one God the Father and the Son with impious confusion, etc. He also produces distinct places of scripture about God the Father, about the Son of God, God from God.</p>
      <p>Thus Basil teaches that it is to be spoken distinctly about the Father and the Son (against Sabellius, Volume 1 folio 503), and he says that Sabellius falls and Anomius is crushed by this very thing: One God and Father, one God and Son, not two gods: for the Son is similar to the Father. For I do not see one divinity in the Father and another in the Son, nor do I place one nature of that one and another of this one, etc. Thus Athanasius to Epictetus and against the followers of Sabellius, Nazianzen, etc.</p>
      <p>But we see that those who followed the apostles speak much more purely about the Trinity, not yet have various heresies obscured the truth with their dregs, which happened later by the later ones. Some object: If God is one who is the Father, then the Son is not God.</p>
      <p>We think Tertullian has answered sufficiently in the book on the Trinity and elsewhere: then Hilary in book 9 on the Trinity folio 176, and others. For just as the Son, who is called Lord, does not take away from the Father that he is also Lord, so the Father, who is called one God, did not take away divinity from the Son, whom he brought forth as God from himself.</p>
      <p>Just as the Son, who is called God in Romans 9, 1 John 5, John 20 (for it is said there of Christ alone), does not take away divinity from the Father. Thus it is said of the Son alone in Acts 20: We are cleansed by the blood of God, i.e., of Christ alone, not of the Father, and yet divinity is not taken away from the Father by this.</p>
      <p>Thus John 3: So God loved the world, i.e., the Father, that he gave his Son who alone has a Son, and yet in this place neither is the Son excluded from divinity, nor from the love with which he also loved us supremely to give his life for us, as John and Paul testify in other places.</p>
      <p>Thus Christ speaks of himself alone: Before Abraham was, I am, and yet it is not denied in that place that the Father was before Abraham, indeed neither Noah nor Adam is excluded. Therefore, just as the true Trinity is to be believed not confused, so when scripture speaks distinctly about God the Father, about the Son of God, God from God, about the Holy Spirit God, it does not corrupt one place with another, nor does the divinity of the Father annihilate the divinity of the Son, etc. But now I cannot write more as the messenger is pressing, nor do I think I can anticipate the letters of our superintendents with these in which they ask you to respond to Stancarus' little book sent to you. I see the Lord wanting to cleanse our churches with his Judaism.</p>
      <p>There are certain impure and Sabellian songs, where the confused Trinity is invoked through Christ as the fourth. The Trinity is asked for its Holy Spirit, when it is only the Spirit of the Father and the Son. We are said to be children of the Trinity, when we have one Father, Christ is our brother and we are his members.</p>
      <p>There are many good ministers who do not understand this. Therefore, they must be advised and urged that only psalms be introduced into our churches instead of these songs and that the Trinity be taught distinctly. I ask through Jesus Christ that, if I err in any way, you teach us here who teach piously and holily, as the chief instruments of Jesus Christ, and I honor and esteem you highly as commended to me by Mr. a Lasco, that most distinguished man.</p>
      <p>Respond quickly so that the church may not suffer any harm, and indeed in such a way that you have regard for no one, seek the glory of no one, except that of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and beware lest the furious take up the sword who defend themselves with your authority. I await your response with the greatest desire.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and guide you with his Spirit.</p>
      <p>The summary of scripture before the Bibles both of Geneva and Zurich was written with this distinction piously observed. Krakow, September 24, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your brother from the heart, Gregor Pauli, Superintendent of the Diocese of Krakow and Minister of Krakow.</p>
      <p>It was not even allowed to read through.</p>
      <p>Forgive me.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and most upright men, Mr. Peter Martyr and Heinrich Bullinger, faithful instruments of Jesus Christ, brothers in the Lord most to be observed and venerable teachers in Zurich.</p>
