      <p>Dear son, herewith you have for yourself and honorable people examples of my three months' work. I ask you to read them diligently and to send the examples to Schaffhausen and greet them all, apologize; for I am currently occupied with writing.</p>
      <p>May all your people be safe.</p>
      <p>Saturday, February 21, 1573.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
