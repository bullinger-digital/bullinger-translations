      <p>Revered, highly learned sir, my obedient and faithful service to you first. In truth, I have sought for many years the opportunity to write to you; for I acknowledge my debt to you and to Herr Pellicanus, among other theologians. To speak without hypocrisy, I have learned much from your and Herr Pellicanus's commentaries, thank God, and have preached from them for 17 years in Windischland. Therefore, the devil has often fiercely attacked me and wanted to imprison me physically. But the Almighty has miraculously pulled me out of his clutches. And although you and your peers with your books are the reason that I must be in exile and deprived of my homeland and three good, strong benefices, I am not your enemy because of it, but rather I am fond of you, honor you from the heart, observe you, and pray to God for you as for my fathers and teachers, etc.</p>
      <p>The reason, however, why I write to you is this: Herr Vergerius, my lord and countryman, who 12 years ago was my Saul, but now, thank God, has become Paul, has dealt much with me this year, urging me to translate the New Testament from Latin and German into the Windisch language, which he, after recognizing me as unfit since I do not know Greek or Hebrew, declined until it was imposed on me by the entire church of my homeland. And when I had translated Matthew alone, Herr Vergerius wanted to have it printed immediately for several reasons and sent me money so that I could get a corrector for him, but I could not find one either in our country or hereabouts. Once again, we earnestly requested the gentlemen of Kempten, who allowed me to come here to Reutlingen to print Matthew alone, which, thank God, has now been done with 2 bales of paper; for printing more and staying here longer is not my situation, I must return to my service. And so it is and not otherwise. This small print truly costs Herr Vergerius a lot of money because he had the printing press brought here from Tübingen at his own expense due to the death there. I write these things to your excellency, who undoubtedly understands the reason. Otherwise, when I have both the opportunity and a reliable messenger from Kempten, I will write more to you. Meanwhile, I wish and pray that your piety, together with Herr Pellicanus and your spouse and offspring, may always fare well in the Lord, and I ask you to commend me and pray to God for me, that He may protect me from the snares of the papists. From Reutlingen, September 13, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your reverend lordship's most devoted Primus Truber, minister of the church of Kempten.</p>
      <p>To the revered and highly learned Herr Heinrich Bullinger, pastor and preacher in Zürich, etc., my esteemed lord and teacher, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
