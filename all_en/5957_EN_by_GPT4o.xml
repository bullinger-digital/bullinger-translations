      <p>Antoine Vincent to Heinrich Bullinger, Greetings.</p>
      <p>Although I have not conferred any benefit upon you when I was a student of Johann Wolf there, nor have I rendered any service to you since I returned to us, which I am nevertheless eager to do with the utmost zeal when the opportunity presents itself, I have not hesitated even now to write this letter, in which I impose upon you, in my usual manner, the task of receiving both my brother and cousin and their teacher, who have set out there to devote themselves to the humanities, into your trust and friendship, and to assist them as foreigners in all matters with your effort and diligence. If you do this, whatever service and effort you bestow upon them, I will consider it as bestowed upon myself, and I trust, with God's good help, that I will not be ungrateful in the future. But because I have convinced myself that, given your humanity, you will never fail to support their interests for my sake, I will not say more to you, but will conclude my writing and pray to the most good and great God that He may be the guide and supporter of your good counsels. I greatly desire that greetings be conveyed to your family in my name; love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Lyon, on the first day of December.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>As I have been struggling severely with a cough and catarrh for three days now, I could not come to you, my dearest relative.</p>
      <p>Some Frenchmen came to me, seeking a host. Since I am keeping myself indoors during the holidays and not going out, I ask you to take care of them. You remember Barbara Kofflia asking that some modest men be given to them. However, I do not remember or know who these Vincentii are. They have turned to the Stork; they have already left me. Here you also have Beza's letters, which you should return along with these.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>God be truly praised, that you are rejoiced; that is Elisabeth's bread and butter.</p>
