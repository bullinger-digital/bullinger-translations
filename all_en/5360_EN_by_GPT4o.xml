      <p>May God be with you, most excellent man, and bless all your affairs, and moreover, grant you that peace which the world cannot give, I sincerely pray. I received your letter on the 27th of May, which filled me with incredible joy, especially when I understood that mine had already been delivered to you. For my mind had been in doubt until now, but now it is finally at rest.</p>
      <p>The care you take in educating my sons is most pleasing to me, and may God grant that some opportunity may occasionally present itself to repay you for that kindness. The boys write to me that they have already been sent to the baths.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in my previous letters, I wrote that I considered it inconvenient to make any decision in this matter, so that they might be moved by you to any place, but now that the matter is settled, it is well. Nothing here moves me, especially if they have someone who keeps them in duty, and I earnestly ask that their health be considered, in whatever way that can finally be done. However, as I wrote in previous letters, if it seems to you that they should go to Leipzig for the sake of the language, I ask that it be done by your efforts, so that they do nothing rashly. But if it seems that they should be retained in the same place where they are now, let them seek no lodging elsewhere nor attempt anything, but rather remain with you and use your advice in all matters, which if they follow, I think they will not go astray. But if (as you write, everything there with you is bought at a high price) you cannot provide them with sustenance and other bodily comforts at the price they lived before, let Laurentius satisfy you in all things, for he has this mandate from me, so that you may not suffer any loss on my account. For it would be unjust for me to be branded with the mark of ingratitude in this matter, burdened with such benefits from you.</p>
      <p>I thank Mr. Frisius, the boys' teacher, for the kindness with which he embraces my sons, and especially for dedicating a book to them, and at the same time, let Laurentius ensure that some small gift is presented to him in my name. I believe the money I send will soon be delivered to you, and from it, as it seems fit, something will be given to him. As for your books, I am grateful to you, those which you send to the Palatine of Vilnius have not been delivered to me, otherwise, I would ensure they are conveyed.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, may God govern and inspire you with His Holy Spirit for His praise and the propagation of the Church of Christ. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given at Krakau, on the 9th of June in the year of our Lord 1562.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellence, Stanislaus Czikowski of Wosławice, by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, much beloved friend.</p>
      <p>Given on the 9th of June, 1562.</p>
