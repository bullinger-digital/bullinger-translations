    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Wyttenbach learned from his son-in-law Hans Wunderlich that Bullinger is dissatisfied because he has recalled his son Josua (whom Bullinger regards as his own son) from Paris. However, he did not make this decision alone! Others, including scholars, advised him to do so. In two years and five months, Josua spent 352 écus there, and not always in a prudent manner. Even wealthier fathers would have found this too much. Moreover, Wyttenbach could never learn anything specific about Josua's studies in Paris. Therefore, he is now being sent to his tutor Rudolf Gwalther and to Bullinger. Both are to investigate what progress the young man has made and what he would be best suited for. Bullinger is to communicate the results quite openly. Wyttenbach will act accordingly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger may forgive the long silence. It is solely due to Wyttenbach's limited education and poor writing, especially since Wyttenbach could never forget Bullinger's love and friendship. He thanks the Lord daily for his talents and steadfastness.</p>

      <p>By God's grace and salvation, with the expression of all my capabilities willingly prepared beforehand. Honorable and especially well-learned sir and brother, I have understood from my son-in-law Hans Wunderlich how you are dissatisfied with the fact that I have recalled Josua, your and my son, from Paris. Truly, I did not do this on my own, but rather on the advice of learned men and others. For in a short time, he has spent so much money there that even a much wealthier man than I would have found it burdensome. In two years and five months, he spent 352 écus, which suggests that he did not use the money wisely. I have also never been able to learn anything specific about his studies. Therefore, I am sending him to you and to his tutor, Mr. Gwalther, as to my particularly trusted sir and brother, so that you may endeavor to ascertain how much he has progressed and what he might be suited for in the future or what further actions should be taken with him. For you can well perceive and learn from him what further can be built upon him. And whatever you decide with him, please inform me and do not withhold his aptitude from me. I will, God willing, follow your trusted advice and act accordingly.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother, please do not be burdened by the fact that I have not written to you for so long, as it is solely due to my lack of skill and poor writing. For the love and friendship you have shown me and mine will remain unforgettable to me for my entire life. I thank the Lord daily for endowing you, His servant, so richly and for your steadfastness. May God, the Lord, bring His work in you to completion for His praise and honor!</p>

      <p>With this, I commend you faithfully to God, the Lord. My wife sends her warm greetings. From Biel, the 30th day of March 1547. Yours entirely, Niklaus Wyttenbach.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned sir, Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of God in Zurich, his especially beloved sir and brother.</p>
