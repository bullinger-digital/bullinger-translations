      <p>In utmost haste, truly can do nothing; so much has happened. I have received your letter, thank you diligently. My brother writes at night, the Reichstag will soon come to an end. The Emperor is in a hurry; one does not know what he has in mind.</p>
      <p>3000 horses are supposed to come from the Netherlands to accompany Maximilian to Spain; however, it is said that something else might be behind it. May God arrange it for the best.</p>
      <p>The one from Lier has been dispatched, it is said, to Pregetz, Lindau, Überlingen he is supposed to come; some say it is because of Savoy; the other rumor is that he is going to the Landgrave to persuade him about the Interim; otherwise, he cannot be relieved.</p>
      <p>Esslingen has just on the 25th of May made an agreement with the king, must give 13,000 florins; had demanded 25,000.</p>
      <p>Memmingen now gives the king 14,000 florins along with Buchshaim, the charterhouse, and a large part of their jurisdiction in the city.</p>
      <p>Duke Maurice and Margrave Hans of Brandenburg have departed from Augsburg. Margrave Hans is said to have told the king, when they wanted to persuade him to accept the Interim: he is good imperial; but in religion, he will not let himself be forced by God and his word. Duke Christoph of Württemberg has also arrived in Augsburg; what will he accomplish there?</p>
      <p>There is intense negotiation with Augsburg, that they want to precede others and make the entrance with the Interim; but it is assured that it will not be able to increase at all with the community; may God! In Hildesheim, the common people are completely restless against the authorities, demanding the annulment of the reconciliation. Magdeburg also now incites the common people; otherwise, they would have been expelled. May God yet throw in a hook, so that we do not come so miserably from this precious treasure of his word!</p>
      <p>Our envoys sent the entire Interim to my lords last night; they will hear it these days. I have not yet seen it, will see how I can manage to have them allow me to copy it for you, etc. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated the 28th.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
