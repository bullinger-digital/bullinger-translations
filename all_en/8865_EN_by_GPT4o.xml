      <p>S. D. Your letters have greatly disturbed me, making me anxious and worried; for I seem to foresee the danger of division, namely that you might disagree among yourselves, which will dissipate all benefit and bring about very serious dangers. Therefore, we must pray to the Lord that He may direct and moderate this grave and dangerous matter. The standard-bearer of Clavenna delivered your letters along with the enclosures; now I have also received new articles, in which I do not see what might be lacking, unless something hidden, which I do not see, is enclosed. If everything aims to remove δςροξαγια, they do not seem to prescribe unfairly; however, this one thing seems harsh, if those who have received pensions until now, while it was allowed to all, are now brought into danger. But if they are compelled to renounce them in the future, I think that is neither harsh nor unfair. I confess that such a great change of affairs will be dangerous; but I know that dangerous diseases are cured only by dangerous remedies. But if it seems to pertain to the safety of the Confederates to keep inviolate the treaty struck with the kings of France, it can be done even without gifts or pensions. It will also be easier to exclude those favoring the Spanish, to whom joining the Confederates would be not only dangerous but also pernicious.</p>
      <p>The Spanish have already declared in many places over many years what they expect from them, not being entirely foolish. I consider the Spanish to be the most present pest and poison of the human race and the scourge of God; but in the meantime, I know that they too have their appointed period, etc. I say nothing about the treaties, because I do not understand what and of what kind they are. However, let it be guarded against, lest, while pensions are taken from the powerful, equivalent benefits are meanwhile granted to the common people.</p>
      <p>It would seem safest to me if an amnesty were sanctioned regarding the pensions received until now, unless someone had sinned against the common fatherland or sold rights and laws. There are difficulties on all sides, which God presents to them in His just judgment, who, blinded by greed, seek profit everywhere and mock God under the pretext of evangelical profession. But you, my brother Tobias, be more courageous as dangers press closer; be prudent in speaking. Pray to the Lord to give you a right mind and a prudent mouth, which may speak holy things and maintain moderation in matters.</p>
      <p>God will also bring an end to these things and will transfer the times to better ones.</p>
      <p>I certainly wish to have the bull; for I immediately sent back the one you sent to me at your request.</p>
      <p>Would that the Engadiners would not come with their standards! There is enough turmoil otherwise.</p>
      <p>Let justice be done by incorrupt judges, not by a raging mob. May the Lord have mercy on you and on all of us, etc.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, letters written on March 19th from the most illustrious man, Mr. Petrus Ramus, in Paris, were brought to me; the one who brought them affirmed that there is peace in France; the papal legate has departed with the matter unfinished; the marriage between the King of Navarre and the king's sister is proceeding and now the wedding is being prepared in Paris at great expense; for both kings, I mean the King of France and the King of Navarre, are coming there. May the Lord bless them and grant us peace!</p>
      <p>Farewell. The Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 11, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable and dear brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
