      <p>To the man endowed with all learning and education, indeed also with piety and integrity, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, father, Matthieu Coignet wishes peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Although I feared that I might interrupt you, most revered father, heavily burdened with business and occupations, with my letters, since I sent you some of my letters a short time ago, yet when I considered your remarkable love and benevolence towards me, I persuaded myself that you would either seek my letters or, if I were to send any to you, they would be pleasing and delightful to you. Besides, my duty also advises and encourages me to do so. Having thus seized this opportunity to write, I wanted to take advantage of it, lest it slip away and not easily occur again, even though I did not have much subject matter left to write about. There are especially two reasons for this, the first and foremost being that due to the insignificance of my letters and the weak and feeble powers of my intellect, I can offer you nothing worthy and appropriate; the other is that I have long been deprived of your letters or rather the supreme happiness of your letters, which made my mind quite anxious and troubled for some time, so much so that I even feared that due to the severe illness I understood you were suffering from, I might be deprived of two of my greatest benefits: first, the benefit of your letters (which conform me to the true worship of God and to the greatest doctrine), and then that which I receive in writing letters to you in return, which if God Almighty had deprived me of, I would consider that I had lost a great part of my happiness, and indeed not without reason. But now I rejoice with great joy, having learned that you have recovered and regained your former health, in which I clearly perceive the goodness and mercy of God towards His own, who did not wish it to be enough to have once appointed you as the leader of His flock, but also deemed it wise in His prudent counsel to have you confirm those already led on the path of truth and bring them to the true knowledge of God, so that the administration of the republic may be all the more holy and happy. I indeed feel how much I have been endowed with the gift of God Almighty, who willed that I should fall into your hands as those of the best father to embrace the word of God with a true and sincere mind.</p>
      <p>Hence, I feel that I owe so much to you, a man endowed with the highest piety and virtue, that I cannot even think of repaying any part of your merits, let alone actually repay them.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would very much like to offer you something that could respond to your benefits; but since I know for certain that I cannot achieve this, I will strive with such zeal and diligence that, being educated in virtue with the help of letters and disciplines, I may satisfy you in some part or at least be able to delight your old age. I will not write now about which readings I am devoting my effort and study to, since I do not doubt that you have understood them from my recent letters. As for my health, I now enjoy it, which I greatly wish for you and yours. I have not yet received any letters from my father; but my mother wrote to me two or three months ago, informing me of my father's severe illness, which is very distressing to me. But I expect to receive something at this fair, and, as I hope, something better.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that my father is involved in the greatest miseries and calamities; but, as Homer says in the Odyssey, "easily indeed can a god save a man even from afar." Indeed, God can easily save a man from afar.</p>
      <p>For He is our common parent of all, who, just as fathers never abandon their children, even in the danger of life. I have nothing new to write to you; I will only ask you, if it can be done with leisure and opportunity, to send me some of your letters, provided it is not troublesome to you; for they not only refresh my mind with the joy of learning something about you, but also with the benefit and usefulness, as your letters are so filled with learning that it is impossible not to derive much benefit from reading them.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Always keep your Coignet commended to you. Given in Heidelberg on the 8th day before the Ides of September.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and erudite man, endowed with the highest piety and integrity, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, most revered by me.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
