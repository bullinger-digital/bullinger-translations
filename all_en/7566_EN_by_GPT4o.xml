      <p>Greetings. Since I have learned from your letters, most esteemed sir, that my writings hastily compiled about recent events were pleasing to you, I can easily further gratify you in this matter, indeed, if I ever learn something that I think should be communicated to you. The same things are said and feared here about France as you write. I am waiting to see what the people of Milan will respond to yours. I am saddened to hear that Arianism is reviving, and I did not believe it until I read your letters. I am now expecting the book you mentioned, which your people are writing against them. I hear that among other errors, they also assert that women are not human beings, but a peculiar kind of creature and lack a soul, and therefore are not baptized by them. I have received Wegmann kindly and still treat him as such, as he himself, I believe, will not deny; I do not communicate a word with him about all that has been done with you. I have never been anxious that my son Albert would lack anything with you, but rather that nothing beyond what is suitable for him should be in excess. Now, you will perceive from the attached note what the rumor about the state of affairs is here.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, August 14, in the year 1568.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Georg von Stetten. To the venerable, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
