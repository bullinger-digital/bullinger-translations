      <p>S. P. D. While I have eagerly awaited your response, dear father, to my recent letters in which I proposed my plan to you about undertaking the degree of Master, and with that response absent, and the time of the promotion of Masters approaching, I again, as I always do, sought the advice of Master Philipp, who gave this counsel: since your will, whatever it may be, was not sufficiently clear, and because it could conveniently be postponed for many other reasons, I should defer to the next upcoming promotion. I, who attempt nothing of this sort without your knowledge, gladly agreed to this advice as the best, yet I asked him to discuss this matter with you more fully and diligently in his letters, which he promised to do and now fulfills with these present ones. Therefore, I entrust this plan and the whole business to you, dear father, to consider and deliberate, so that you may decide, with your paternal benevolence towards me, what you think will be most beneficial for both you and me.</p>
      <p>Regarding the rest of my life situation, I wanted to inform you of this: I am sending the summary of my expenses for this half-year, which I know you will be surprised and indignant to find greater than they should be; however, I hope you will accept them with a more equitable mind if you hear the reason why I spent such a large amount of money. With the advice and persuasion of learned men, and considering my honor and benefit and that of the whole family, I had decided to undertake the honorable degree of Master, and I bought books for myself, some of which I needed most at that time to complete my undertaking, namely those containing the doctrine of the liberal arts, and others theological, which I would use after the promotion, so that, having undertaken this degree, I might in some way leave certain studies of philosophy and turn to theology and lay some foundations in it; for that reason, I bought those books.</p>
      <p>I bought a bed for this reason, because this whole year that I have been here, I was forced, not without great detriment to myself, to spend four talers for beds borrowed, receiving little benefit from them. Therefore, I thought it would be better if I bought one for myself, which I could always sell at the same price, and I bought one quite good and, in the judgment of others, at a moderate price, namely 7 talers.</p>
      <p>I also spent some money when I was ill, on food and drink, medicines, and other things serving me, all of which I noted in the account book. Now, by the grace of God, having been restored to my former health, by the advice of Master Philipp, the order of the doctor, and also your order, dear father, I have decided, with God's help, to make an excursion to the nearby mining cities, and I especially want to see those cities by the advice of Master Philipp. Therefore, I received five florins from my creditor bookseller to complete this journey.</p>
      <p>I send these and other things I have spent at this time to you recorded on paper and beg you, most beloved father, to kindly bear these great expenses; I also promise that I will never do such a thing in the future, but will live in such a way as not to trouble you further with such great expenses. However, what I briefly touch upon here, Master Rodolphus Collinus himself will report to you in my name, to whom I have communicated everything concerning my life situation and what I wanted to be reported to you, and I commend him to your faith as my dearest brother and esteemed teacher, and I beg you to extend your help to him in all things you can and to show him some acts of gratitude, so that he may see that we have not been unmindful of his many benefits, which he has bestowed upon me, your son.</p>
      <p>Finally, dearest father, I also commend to you this student, an honest, pious, and learned young man, Heinrich Stiel from Treysa in Hesse, who was here in Wittenberg as a companion of Master Collinus and rendered all the services of a good friend to me, wherefore you will greatly gratify me in this matter as well if you bestow some benefit upon him, so that he may see that my recommendation to you has been of some advantage to him. And let this suffice for now. May the Lord our God keep you, most beloved father, with mother and the whole family safe forever.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Master Paulus Eber, my most learned teacher, a public professor here in Wittenberg, sends you many greetings, who has often confessed to me that he would most gladly, if he knew it would be pleasing to you, establish a friendship with you through letters and has asked me to open some way to it for him as best I could. I, when I said that the friendship of learned men is most pleasing to you, he promised to write, but being hindered at the time when Master Collinus was leaving and overwhelmed with many affairs, he could not fulfill that. Therefore, what he could not signify through letters, he entrusted to Master Rodolphus to inform you. Furthermore, all the learned men, Master Caspar Pencer, Doctor J. Millich, and others, send you greetings. Now farewell again and in my name greet the sisters, relatives, and the whole family very much, etc.</p>
      <p>Your beloved son Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and outstanding man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most beloved father. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
