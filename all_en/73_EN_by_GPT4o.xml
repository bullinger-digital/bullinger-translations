    <p xml:id="regest1">[...] Regarding his writing [«De Naemanni adoratione»], Serin would still prefer it to be published [under a pseudonym], as he had previously requested in a letter [18028]. If that is not possible, the dedication letter should be changed as he had already suggested: His name should not appear on the title page, but only under the dedication letter. However, if possible, Serin's professional position and the name of the city of Ulm, from where he writes, should remain unnamed. If that is also not allowed, then God's and Bullinger's will be done! If it is absolutely necessary to mention Serin's place of origin, then under the dedication letter it should say «Leonart Soer von Wasserburg [am Inn]» or, if his office must be specified, «L. S. yetz am khirchendienst zu Ulm», or better yet «L. S. yetz am khirchendienst doselbst». If Serin really must be named as the author, the painter's [N.N.] image at the end of the print template should be omitted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Bullinger should urge the printer to return the manuscript to Serin [after the printing work is completed] and also include the [previously ordered 30] copies in the shipment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Serin's caution should not surprise Bullinger! He fears the powerful and the slanderers. They will accuse him of vanity, even tell him that he should have left this task to others. Indeed, he recently learned something from Martin Frecht that he did not know before: The topic of the Nicodemites, which he only briefly and superficially addressed in the fourth part of his work, was already discussed, albeit only in French, by Johannes Calvin in his writing [«Petit traicté monstrant que c'est que doit faire un homme fidele, congnoissant la verité de l'evangile quand il est entre les papistes»]. Serin therefore fears that his opponents will seize the opportunity to slander him in every way. But one should only fear the devil, who can destroy both body and soul [Mt 10, 28]. [When printing his writing] Serin would rather [use a pseudonym and] forgo mentioning his real name and hide his God-given [theological] skill, than possibly gain fame for his writing but lose his life in the process.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Serin is pleased if his writing is printed in the Confederation and not elsewhere, so that it does not appear as if he belongs to another [than the Zwinglian] party. He does not want to support this only secretly. Bullinger should therefore not think that Serin is too fearful. [...]</p>

      <p>[...] Regarding the publication of my writing, nothing would please me more than for it to be published as I previously wrote to you. But if that cannot be done, the dedication letter must be changed as I prescribed: I beg that my name not be placed at the front of the book with the title, but at the end of the dedication letter, unless it is absolutely necessary to do otherwise. And if possible, I greatly desire that only my name with surname be placed, without mention of my position, also omitting the name of Ulm, from where I write. However, if this is not allowed, let not my will, but the will of the Lord and yours be done. And if they absolutely want to have my place of origin, then I am known as Leonart Soer von Wasserburg. If they also want my position, I prefer the title «L. S. yetz am khirchendienst zu Ulm», or rather, omitting the name of my homeland, «L. S. yetz am khirchendienst doselbst», namely where the letter is given. And if my name is added, then the figure of Apelles placed at the back must be omitted.</p>

      <p>Do not be surprised, my Bullinger, at my careful concern: For my weakness fears both tyrants and rivals. For they will say that I, a common man, am seeking glory and popular favor and that I should have left this work to others. And indeed, these days I heard from Frecht, something I never knew before, that Calvin had already addressed this topic, which I only briefly and incidentally touched upon in the fourth part, about the Nicodemites, although only in French. I fear these people, lest they, having gathered slanders from everywhere and seized opportunities, rage against me. But let us fear only Him who can destroy both body and soul. Otherwise, I would certainly prefer to suffer the loss of my name rather than my body and to hide this small talent (even if some praise would come to me from it).</p>

      <p>I will be pleased if I see my work published from Switzerland, lest, if it were published from elsewhere, I might seem to stand with their party. For I do not wish to secretly favor you. Do not think this makes me overly fearful. [...]</p>
