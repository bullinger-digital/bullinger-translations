      <p>Greetings, most delightful Mr. Bullinger. I received your letter written on August 26th on November 21st, at which time indeed new and severe edicts were published against those who either disdain our ceremonies or refuse to observe them.</p>
      <p>May God turn it to good and have mercy on all the churches of Christ! May God ensure that a snake does not lie hidden in the grass!</p>
      <p>I give great thanks for your most learned book, written about the persecutions of the church, translated into Latin by our Simler, which I received not so long ago. The German version never reached my hands.</p>
      <p>You write that you are seventy years old: if only you could finally become a centenarian, even for the sake of the church itself! I have certainly almost completed my sixty-third year, a climacteric year for me. My wife is a girl of sixty-seven years and more, as she herself reports. I rejoice that all is peaceful in Switzerland. I do not grieve that things have gone so unfortunately with the mercenary soldiers.</p>
      <p>Before the feast of Bartholomew, the harvest had not begun here in Norfolk; it was very wet and rainy: there was hardly a clear day in the entire harvest, so that no small part of the crops was lost to us; but through the tireless diligence of the workers, the greatest part was saved. Not only grain, but the cost of all things is very high here. Why this high cost, you ask? Because charity grows cold among us. Before the feast of the purification, we saw no snow here, we hardly felt any frost: now we have an abundance of both.</p>
      <p>Please greet all my friends in my name, and Julius himself, not the least among friends. Woe to Thimelthorpe, the worst collector by far, who does not allow me to collect anything for friends. But I hope for better things.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you and all my people in Zürich. Amen. Hastily from Ludham, February 6, 1574.</p>
      <p>My wife and I greet you and yours. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zürich.</p>
