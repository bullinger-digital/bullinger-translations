      <p>Greetings. I wrote recently to Mr. Gwalther through his son, sharing what I had; I know he shares these with you. Meanwhile, I have learned nothing else of significance; however, I have received what you wished to communicate to me through my brother.</p>
      <p>For these, I thank you, as well as for your homilies on the conversion of the eunuch of Candace, which you sent to me, certainly an elegant, pious, and useful work. If I can ever repay you for these and all that you do for me, I will do so gladly and diligently. These young men are in a hurry, so I cannot write more now. One of them lived here for a while with Mr. Musculus, he is a very honest, learned, and pious Belgian; he is traveling to Frankfurt and wishes to see and greet you before he goes, taking advantage of this letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 22, 1570.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller the Elder, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
