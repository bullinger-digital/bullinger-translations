      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most honorable and dearest lord and godfather, with great joy and I thank you immensely for it. I pray to the Lord that we may always receive such things that contribute to the salvation of His church. I am sending back to you, as you requested, the document about the election of the King of Poland, about which there is still a consistent rumor among us, but nothing is reported about the conditions under which he was elected. It is to be lamented that the matter has come to such a state in almost the entire world, that all dignities and any offices are usually sold and bought for a price and indeed by such people who are seen to lead kingdoms and states more to ruin than to benefit.</p>
      <p>But may God, the ruler of all things, to whom these matters must be entrusted, direct everything to the praise of His most holy name! I think our adversaries have something that affects their minds; but whatever it is, they whisper it quietly among themselves, lest we find it out. Hence, we hope that their affairs in France are not as fortunate as they had proclaimed a little while ago; for if they had perceived something that was against us, then they would proclaim it everywhere on the roofs and streets, but since the matter perhaps stands otherwise, they are very cautious not to let anything slip out rashly. I ask you, as you usually do, to always inform us of how things stand, and you will do us a most welcome favor.</p>
      <p>All good people greet you, especially my wife. Hastily. In Glarus, June 24, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Hugo in Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable and exceptionally dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zürich.</p>
