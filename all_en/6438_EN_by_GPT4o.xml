      <p>Greetings. I read your letters, reverend father in Christ, and it was pleasing to hear about the well-being of all of you. I assume your consul has already returned.</p>
      <p>The matter is not yet resolved; everything is still pending.</p>
      <p>The letters that have been sent to the Engadin several times could best be obtained from the Landammann Schuler, as he has written and arranged them all.</p>
      <p>In summary: Firstly, they have written to them in a friendly manner and admonished them to lay down their arms, as their actions are not in accordance with the alliance.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, since the French alliance was made with more hands, they want it to be valid as well, but where it does not suit them, they intend to use the offer of the French lord rightly and not undertake anything forcefully. However, if there is any disorder in the lands, it should be resolved with order and not with rebellion, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they want to attend the appointed day in Davos, etc. The Engadiners gave a reasonable response: that they are not inclined to use force against anyone; what they have done, they were driven to by necessity; as some few in the lands are selling the land for money, etc., whom they want to punish.</p>
      <p>They promised to attend the appointed day, which also happened. In Davos, besides the envoys, there were about 80 men from the Engadin, most of them with banners, where the lords, the Confederates, used all seriousness and spared nothing. The Engadiners, however, noticed how they were led behind the light by the Salic people (or were otherwise glad that they had someone to vent their anger on), engaged reasonably; yet they laid down their arms regarding the military preparation, gave no final answer, but promised to send the same to the lords, the Confederates, to Chur.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, as the lords awaited a favorable response from the envoys, the Engadiners attacked Cläven by night, where they then abducted Rudolf; as the cost has now run up to 25,000 guilders, they need someone to pay it. Hereupon, since they attacked Captain Rudolf on the common territory of the Three Leagues, it was considered an outrage. Therefore, the lords sent Wolff Wüsten, the overseer, with letters to them again, in which they complained that the Engadiners had not fulfilled their promise, also admonished them to hand over the prisoner to the common Three Leagues and to let him receive common justice; for if he is mistreated, no one is against him receiving his deserved reward, only that it should happen with order, with justice and not with force. To this, the Engadiners responded quite defiantly and cunningly to the lords, the Confederates, also accused them of being partial; furthermore, they refused to hand over the Salic man. Hereupon, the lords, the Confederates, wrote to them seriously on the 11th of April, the day they also departed, sufficiently answered their raised objections and gave an account of their orderly actions, against which they proved their disorderly actions with many words and then requested a final answer from them, which they should give to Zurich on the 18th of this month, etc.</p>
      <p>If you read the last letter, which you might have from Mr. Müller, if the lord of Cham was not at home, you will find in a short recapitulation all the actions; I have not yet taken care to copy it; I do not have it and am now pressed by the burden of sermons. Thereupon, as the envoys of the Confederates departed, the common Three Leagues, who had previously also written to the Engadiners with all seriousness, made an extraction, as they call it here, that is, took out 3,000 men, of which 130 men are assigned to Chur, if the Engadiners do not fulfill the writing of the lords, the Confederates, to act further in it.</p>
      <p>But it is said that the Engadiners will proceed with Rudolf and will not look at anyone for it; but riding around in the God's House, they claim they want to act with his advice; requesting assessors in the right.</p>
      <p>From Chur, they have not requested anyone; but as they rode through here in the 4 villages, which also belong to the God's House, and our city judge met them before the gate (who knows the 2 envoys) and asked why they bypassed the city of Chur and, since they intend to set a right for Rudolf from the common God's House, they do not also address it, they answered: they do not consider the Chur people as God's House people anymore, as they have attached themselves to the Zurichers and thus showed that they no longer want to be league people, etc. You see, the matter is just beginning.</p>
      <p>They have indeed taken out, and the Salic people would like to see that they go to war. But since the Salic people and the Engadiners were one shortly before and caused the unrest, they cannot bring the common man far.</p>
      <p>Thus, everything is stuck.</p>
      <p>The Engadiners know this, and if the lords, the Confederates, do not bring the matter to a conclusion, I see no end.</p>
      <p>The Engadiners, although Rudolf is deserving, do not do what they do out of love for justice, as they already knew before, when they took up arms at the instigation of the Salic people, by whose instigation this was done, etc. Yesterday, Friedrich von Salis was with me.</p>
      <p>He explained his entire business; he writes to you himself.</p>
      <p>I reproached him for defending the Engadiners before the Swiss. He admitted that he was wrong and gave some reasons for his actions, hoping that his people could be appeased; but in vain, he was mistaken.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I cannot say more.</p>
      <p>Chur, 15th April, in the year 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
