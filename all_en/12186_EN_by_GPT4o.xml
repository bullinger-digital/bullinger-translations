<letter xml:id="file12186"><summary><p xml:id="regest1"> Gast is very touched by [Bullinger's] helpfulness. Certain people would like to ruin him, but he holds his ground bravely. The [letter bearer] will report on Gast's situation. - Sends Osiander's [“Apologia”] directed against the Zwinglians. If only Theodor [Bibliander] had not treated this man so gently in his [“Relatio fidelis”], but had criticized him more openly! - For a Latin edition of Oecolampadius's works, no one is probably more suitable than [Rudolf] Gwalther, who has edited Zwingli's works so well. He would be a good translator of the Eucharistic writings, as he is likely to still have the appropriate terminology in mind. In no case is one dependent on Bucer's advice! Either Gast will inform Gwalther of the [to be established] order of the books, or Bullinger should do so; nothing will be undertaken without his advice. Oporin wants to print [the works of Oecolampadius]; when is still uncertain. Luther's works are also being printed. - Gilbert [Cousin] inquired by letter whether Bullinger was pleased with the gift. Cousin's brother will be visiting [Gast in Basel] for a few days. If Bullinger wants to write to Gilbert Cousin, he could do so through the letter bearer, the barber [Jakob Schmid]. Gast has issued the latter a baptismal certificate for his son [Heinrich]. Some want to pay [Schmid] the [money due to him] only if they are sure that the little son is alive. - Enclosed is the baptismal certificate. - Greetings to Bibliander, Pellikan, and Gwalther. - [P.S.:] Since Gast believes that Bullinger already possesses Cochläus’ “Epilog” against the “Antibole,” he has not sent it. - [Baptismal certificate:] Gast certifies having baptized Heinrich Schmid, born on [March 13], son of the Basel citizen and barber on the “Kuttelbruck” Jakob Schmid. The child is healthy and lively. It is also recorded in the baptismal register. </p></summary><body><div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1"><p>Greetings in the Lord. I am immensely grateful to you for consoling me so Christianly in my temptations and for offering your house and everything you possess. You cannot imagine how much joy your letters have given me and still give me every time I read them. If certain people could, and they would gladly do it, they would completely ruin me.</p><p>They gather every little thing to fuel their hatred against me, but I still stand like an immovable rock. The brothers know what they are doing in my case. But soon you will have a living letter with an imposed catastrophe.</p><p>I am sending you the most vile pamphlet written by Cacosiander against the Zwinglians. Consider how this sleepless man affects our churches with disgrace and stains them with so many lies. Is not that beast finally worthy of being depicted in various colors? Our Theodor [Bibliander] touches him only slightly and lightly in his little book; if only more openly, so that he would know that we also have a pen!</p><p>As for who will translate Oecolampadius's books into Latin, I know no one but your Gwalther, for whom it is not a difficult task to translate the sacramental writings, since he has most successfully rendered Zwingli's works and still has the figures of speech at hand. We do not want any advice or commentary from Bucer. I will inform him of the order, or you should arrange the books; for without your advice, we will do nothing. Our Oporinus wants to print them, but I do not know in which year; they will be huge volumes and require great expenses. If only they were printed! Luther's works will also be published soon.</p><p>Mr. Gilbert wrote to me that he is very eager to know whether his little gift was pleasing to you and whether you received it with a cheerful face. His brother will stay with us for a few days. If you have decided to write to him, you can do so through this good man, who is delivering this letter and who asked me to testify that I baptized his son, who is still alive. Some people are holding onto some money and do not want to give it unless they are sure that his son is still alive. The boy's name is Heinrich; his father is a bathkeeper.</p><p>Farewell. I will write in German on the other page, so you can read it to others who are trying to harm him.</p><p>Basel, April 18, 1545.</p><p>Greet Theodor and Pellikan with Rudolf in my name, and I pray that you pray to the Lord for me, so that I may emerge from these evils. Yours sincerely, Gast.</p><p>You might have Cochläus' writing, or rather the epilogue against the Antibole. Otherwise, I would have sent it, so that you could respond to him with a public letter. For the beast dares to challenge all the learned men who live in our time.</p><p>Farewell again and again. I, Johannes Gast, assistant at St. Martin in Basel, acknowledge with this my handwriting, at the request of Master Jakob Schmid, barber on the Kuttelbrücke, citizen of Basel, the bearer of this letter, that a child was born to the aforementioned master on the Friday before Laetare. His name is Heinrich, whom I baptized, and he is still healthy and fresh as of today.</p><p>Given on the 18th day of April 1545.</p><p>I wanted to announce this at the request of Master Jakob. All this is also written in the baptismal register.</p><p>Basel.</p></div></body> Note: Proper nouns have been translated into their modern German equivalents where applicable.</letter>
