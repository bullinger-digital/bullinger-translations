      <p>Greetings in Christ. The fact that I write less frequently to your piety, dearest Mr. Bullinger, you will attribute to the past wars and the interrupted trade with the Netherlands. I received your books on the Origin of Errors and Councils last year, for which I also give great thanks.</p>
      <p>Those dissensions in our London-Dutch church, (about which you wrote to me,) have been settled by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>The judgments of your churches have been very beneficial to us. In our neighboring Netherlands, Alba (Duke of Alba) is exercising outright tyranny. All the wealthier people, regardless of their religion, live in extreme danger; for people are being dragged to punishment daily, especially the richer ones, with no form of law observed. You know everything better about French affairs. We, by the grace of God, are in great tranquility, although Alba threatens us. The Dutch trade was interrupted in this way. Last winter, Spanish ships, which were bringing money to Alba from the Pope through Genoese merchants, were driven by storms into our ports, which we have many and very safe. The total was, I believe, 300 thousand crowns. Our queen, as if sent by divine providence, wanted to borrow this sum from the merchants themselves, with sufficient security given for the principal and interest to be repaid in due time, which has often been customary among other princes. Upon hearing this, Alba had all our merchants along with their ships and goods arrested in the Netherlands; our people did the same to the Spanish and Dutch. Therefore, our people are now forced to conduct their trade in Hamburg, a place not so convenient, and this not without damage to the whole of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>In nearby Scotland, everything is conducted under the auspices of the young king, as before. The administration is in the hands of the excellent man Mr. James Stuart, Earl of Moray, the king's uncle, to whom the other nobles, who previously resisted, have now submitted themselves. There was no question about the matter of religion among them; for both parties professed and still profess the doctrine of the gospel, even when they were most at odds.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Scotland, who is still held with us under quite honorable and free custody, does not consider this governance of Scotland valid and thinks she is being wronged. Therefore, she urges her people as much as she can, but unless she is aided by external help, she will not easily be able to recover the kingdom.</p>
      <p>These are the things I wanted to write about our affairs and those of our neighbors at this time. Mr. Horn, Parkhurst, Jewel, Cox, Sandys, Pilkington are all well and asked me, in their name, to greet your piety if I ever wrote back. Please greet Mr. Rudolf Gwalther and your other colleagues on my behalf. Commend us to the Lord in your prayers. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for us and His church for a long time, most esteemed and dearest brother in the Lord! At Fulham on the banks of the Thames, August 13, 1569.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted in the Lord, Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>Our brother John Abel exchanged this life for a better one a few months ago after long suffering from kidney stones.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend in Christ Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich and dearest brother in Christ. In Zurich.</p>
      <p>To be delivered to the Zurich printers at Frankfurt.</p>
