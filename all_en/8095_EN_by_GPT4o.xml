      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters, most reverend sir, and indeed the latest ones with a more peaceful mind, as they embraced prospects far more favorable than the papists would have wished. As for my previous failure to fulfill my duty of writing, various obstacles, which usually occur at such fairs, were the cause. Moreover, with a certain diligence and effort through the consul, I did not want to send anything, lest, if things did not turn out as they endeavored to arrange, I might appear to anyone as an intrusive and curious negotiator.</p>
      <p>Henceforth, however, I will gladly make up for any neglect with frequent letters to you, and now I will also respond in order to everything that is rightfully and deservedly required of me in your most courteous letters. First, regarding that Mr. Andreas, a man outwardly impressive, there were indeed certain vacant positions to which he could be appointed, if only the language and dialect did not differ somewhat from ours to the ears, and also, since the man seems to be extravagant and well-dressed, I fear that the modest stipends of the Rhaetians might not suit him well. Nevertheless, we will take the risk and promote him to the church of Rhynwald, as he is recommended by you. - Then, concerning the most tedious business of our bishop, I wish it were prepared with good outcomes. The arrangement is such; the bishop must pay 1800 gold coins, the rest by the Salicea family and those who converted the remainder of the sum for their own use. The Salices have promised not to derogate from these Swiss conditions, but to stand by them willingly and diligently. But since the same conditions include that they can then reclaim the expense from the syndics, who, while the disturbances arose and lasted, were always sent away by the communities, they should see to it that they do not attribute new disturbances to the Salices, if the syndics, who received the money as a reward and payment, refuse to return the received funds; for they will report this injustice to the people by whom they were sent, who will then make a new business for the bishop so difficult and unpleasant. But someone might say the syndics received more than was just; therefore, if they return what they received out of order, nevertheless, a great sum will remain, which neither the people nor the syndics will ever pay. Hence new disturbances, hatreds, plots, and finally, I wish not the bishop's downfall. From this occasion, the Upper Saxons are already threatening, and almost all other communities, who would refuse to pay tribute and revenues to the bishop who does not pay, are attacking more fiercely. In summary: the situation will soon be worse than ever before, according to the judgment and prediction of many. The bishop will never be at peace unless he soothes the offended minds of the peasants by paying this sum.</p>
      <p>For what favor would these actions generate, what friendship and alliance: to summon the Swiss, to make foreign expenses, and, unless the House of God obeys, to renounce the alliance, to demand letters back, and to cut off supplies? Certainly, he has incurred an implacable offense here and there, which he will never lay down except at the greatest detriment to the bishopric. I hope that God governs everything so that he cannot insult us and our churches more insolently, who otherwise naturally favors us poorly, and being wonderfully entangled with very wealthy families, secretly works his affairs with feasts and banquets. The composition of the Swiss would indeed be tolerable and such that it would serve peace and concord, if only the burdens were not allowed to be shifted onto others by the Salices, which will kindle many disputes. - Our royalists are murmuring about several thousand of those nobles who have so far wanted to join no party, but have left and fled France back and forth, until the outcome of the war appears, now having joined the admiral, because their castles and goods were also being attacked by the royalists; the king has never been seen more sorrowful. - It is reported from Milan that a very severe edict has been promulgated there against Christians, not only against locals but also against foreign Rhaetians and Swiss; whoever is found in Milan or around, whether Rhaetian or Swiss, for whatever cause or business, if he is a Lutheran, he is to be handed over to the inquisitor immediately and burned without any further legal proceedings.</p>
      <p>This edict was recently confirmed when they again imprisoned a man from Plurs, who is, however, a papist, but has evangelical parents. The whore of Babylon has taken away all commerce from our people, etc. Unless the Rhaetian lords intervene, I do not know where the matter will finally erupt. This is what I had to write to your most esteemed father; that you will forgive me for my haste with your incredible kindness and that you will have us and our churches commended to your faith, I pray.</p>
      <p>Both consuls greet you, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, Mr. Charles, who is absent, and all good men and women. Your most honorable consul was very friendly and generous to me. I was first appointed by the magistrate to have a meal with him for the sake of honor, and later he twice received me into his hospitality even against my will. Farewell. 1569. Chur, December 5th.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned doctor of the church of Zurich, his lord and patron, to be honored with eternal and perpetual respect.</p>
      <p>To the pastor of the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
