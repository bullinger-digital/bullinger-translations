      <p> Greetings. For your work, most esteemed lord, I give you the greatest thanks for the effort you put into my little book. If only I were the one who could repay you! However, what now takes away all other thoughts from me is that French misery, about which I think you too have learned more and more certain things these days. What I have been able to hear and learn so far, I send to my brother; he will share it with you. Meanwhile, our magistrate writes to yours; since they are more certain than mine, I do not want to add more. In summary: it is misery upon misery and greater than anyone can imagine. </p>
      <p> May God have mercy on His believers and rid us of the faithless, murderous practices. Meanwhile, my brother sent me a note in your name containing some things about the Belgian affairs, which are at least in some way still more favorable than these. We hear that Hannibal Empsanus is leading an army through Savoy; many ominously predict bad things for the Genevans in these troubles; others think he is heading to Belgium. The Genevans certainly fear for themselves more now than ever before, and it is no wonder; for we hear that the best of the French leaders have fallen. But the Lord knows by what means He wishes to help His own; we will invoke Him earnestly. </p>
      <p> Farewell. </p>
      <p> Bern, September 6, 1572. </p>
      <p> The messenger is in a hurry to leave today; therefore, I cannot write more now. </p>
      <p> Johannes Haller, entirely yours. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. </p>
      <p> Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. </p>
