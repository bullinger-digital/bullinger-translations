    <p xml:id="regest1">Later returns to Bullinger's generosity; sends a report by [Konrad] Zwick about [the Imperial Diet at] Regensburg with a request for immediate return. Under no circumstances should there be dealings with the enemies of God; the council and citizens of Konstanz are still steadfast in faith; one must pray to God for assistance. Greetings; thanks for a silver portrait of a prince. Apologizes for thoughtless writing. Urges caution in handling his candid writing; in Regensburg, the negotiations are kept as secret as the Eleusinian Mysteries; [Johannes] Zwick sends further news that his brother [Konrad] has communicated to him [No. 1540].</p>

      <p>Greetings again and again, venerable and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Regarding your utmost kindness and generosity towards my wife and me, which binds me to you even more than before, I will speak of this elsewhere. Now I send you what we have hastily copied, partly by myself and partly by others, from what Zwick sent here from Regensburg four days ago; you will read it with difficulty, I know, but you will read it nonetheless. I ask you to return it with this messenger, whose departure to you I learned of too late. We have no other copy.</p>
      <p>You will see, my dearest brother, the prodigious vanities of the sons of men, whose plans are beautifully thwarted by the truth of the divine spirit, even though some of them are the most learned and prudent, and no less pious men among us, whom these impostors obscure with some kind of fog, who with their various and tortuous artifice make anything appear from anything, so that a considerable danger would threaten us from them, if the Lord's kindness did not meanwhile show others the simple face of truth and at the same time demonstrate how great a sea of evils would overflow us, if we were to begin to collude even a little with the adversaries, whom we have long since denounced with great constancy in our churches as antichrists and the most pernicious enemies of God.</p>
      <p>I would rather die ten times than design such a thing or arouse suspicion of designing it with my actions. Here, by the grace of God, the senate and the people are endowed with such constancy and such trust in the Lord, that we seem ready to risk our property, life, and everything for the strong defense of the once accepted knowledge of truth, which may the Lord grant us to have perpetually. Amen, amen. Ah, let us humbly implore the heavenly Father not to lead his church into temptation, let us diligently perform our duty, urge solid repentance, and extort better fruit even from the unwilling, before the wrath of God overwhelms us!</p>
      <p>Farewell, my heart and sweetest soul, and never forget me before Christ our Lord, so that he may make me, by his grace, a happy servant, that is, a truly suitable minister of his gospel. My little wife insists that I greet you and your wife most accurately in her words, and she never ceases to extol your kindness. The silver gift is most welcome, not because it is silver, but because it bears the image of an excellent prince, and also because it was sent by an excellent friend, to whom I wish I could reciprocate as much as I desire! Commend me to the highest men, friends, and best brothers. Farewell again. June 29, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer. Forgive, I beseech you by the Lord, the most careless writing.</p>
      <p>Be careful, my brother, that what we have written here does not become a harm to us or any of ours. We can hide nothing from you, even though these matters in Regensburg are treated like the Eleusinian Mysteries with secret judges. Our Zwick will add other things that his brother has written to him. Return this with the messenger.</p>
