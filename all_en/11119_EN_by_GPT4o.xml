    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a letter. His brother [Konrad] would have been glad if [Konrad] Klauser had been left to him [as a tutor]; asks for information if another candidate is available. Leo [Jud] cannot write himself due to lack of time, but wishes to have information about Michael [Back?], as he possibly wants to send him as a preacher to Baron [Balthasar] von Kuenring. Sends back [Osiander's] booklet on oath formulas as soon as he has read it.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>I thank you for your letter, dearest brother in the Lord. However, there is no need for me to respond to it, except for this one thing: it would have been a most fortunate message for my brother if you had allowed Klauser to offer his services to us for a while. We are indeed searching everywhere for someone like him, but in vain. I therefore ask you very much, if there is anyone else with you whom we could appoint to educate the boys, please do not hesitate to inform us of such a person. Now, the messenger is about to leave, so I cannot add anything more than that I am yours.</p>
      <p>I had also intended to write to Leo, but I spent the whole day visiting the sick, and now, as I return home, the messenger is ready to depart. Therefore, please ask Leo to describe to me as soon as possible the character, manners, judgment, learning, and anything of that kind about this Michael. For the Baron von Kuenring is urging again and again to send a minister of the word. If this Michael seems to be of some judgment, I might decide to send him to the Baron, but I will wait for Leo's opinion.</p>
      <p>Oh dear, the messenger wants to leave through the gate. More about other matters another time. Farewell, my heart.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>I have not read the booklet on oaths; I will return it once I have read it.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and dearest brother.</p>
