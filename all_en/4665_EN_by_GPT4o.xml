      <p>To Lord Bullinger, my most esteemed friend and patron, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>If there is any news that I could inform you about, you have already learned it from the letters of our Fabricius, and therefore I am more sparing in writing. I only wish you not to be unaware that as soon as I received your last letters, in which you briefly advised that we should not allow the most nefarious Jesuits into our regions if we wish to take good counsel for the true religion, I have postponed all other business and focused on this. And it so happened that I had to speak against them before my illustrious lords. Thus, they have been expelled from our borders, their college destroyed, and it has been ensured that they do not approach us again. What more can I say? It turned out as desired, by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>Even though I believe you are aware of these things, I still wanted to write to you myself. We must pray to God to continually restrain His enemies from us.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, what has been done with our bishop, our same Fabricius has informed you; therefore, I pass over all these matters in silence. I remember, however, what you once discussed with me, which is quite relevant to our age, and I have not neglected my duty, though I have not been well-received, even though I have given salutary advice. The Lord God is the one who moves and directs the hearts of men where He wills, and may He deign to arrange all things for His glory. At this moment, I am about to set out towards Engadin and from there directly and quickly to Chiavenna, where I will remain in office for about two more months. However, how much I wish to be restored to my former freedom and, having resigned from office, to return to my kingdom, I can hardly say. I will write to you more often then, as I will not be hindered by continuous business from doing so. But for now, you will have me excused, as due to the pressure of time, I could barely write even these few words. Farewell forever, my most esteemed Lord Bullinger, and I ask and beseech you to love me in return, as I love, honor, and respect you uniquely, and if I can do anything in your favor, command me; for I am yours as much as anyone can be. Farewell again and again, and commend me to all learned and pious men.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur, February 14, 1561.</p>
      <p>Forgive the rough pen. I wrote in haste and did not even reread it.</p>
      <p>The same, as above, your most devoted Friedrich von Salis, commissioner of the county of Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most pious colleague of the Church of ZÃ¼rich and my ever-esteemed lord.</p>
