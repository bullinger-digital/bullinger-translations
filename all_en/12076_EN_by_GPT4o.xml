According to a rumor, the Swiss have had a battle with the English and won not without the greatest loss; others claim that many of them are wandering around scattered; Gast does not know what is true; the Spaniards are spreading this news, but were not involved. What hurts the most is that the Spaniards and Italians are enticing and taking away the best young men with great promises; these will have to bitterly realize the reliability of the Spaniards after crossing the Alps. Oporinus has published a new, expanded Pasquill [“Pasquillorum tomi duo”]; humanity loves and buys such writings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wanted to send a catalog of the books brought from the Frankfurt Fair, but when I searched through all the bookstores, I found no good book worthy of being included in the catalog, except for medical literature. Oporinus is already arranging his catalog of books, which you will have once it is printed. However, that you respond to Cochlaeus, a coarse and earthly creature, you undoubtedly do for the sake of the church; otherwise, such a stupid creature would not have been worthy of any response, as he speaks so crudely about divine matters and thus brings forth the writings of the ancients with a deceitful mind. He has published a booklet on the manner of prayer used among the ancients, but in German, which I will read, and if he attacks you or our churches in it, I will inform you shortly.</p>
      <p>A rumor is spreading among us, but with an uncertain author, that our Swiss have fought a battle with the English; our side was superior, not without the greatest loss; some say our men have been scattered and are wandering around, I don't know where. But what to believe in this matter, I do not know. The Spaniards are spreading this, who should not be believed, as they were not involved in it.</p>
      <p>What pains me the most is that the Spaniards and Italians are taking away the best young men, even some of our mercenaries, with them, promising them much, even promising them golden mountains, until they cross the Alps; then they will know what kind of faith the Spaniards keep, or they will sell them, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all yours, long happy and healthy in body and soul. Basel, November 1, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Our Oporinus has published a new Pasquill, but not new, rather expanded in many places with some very ridiculous pasquils added. The world loves and buys such booklets to have something with which to pass the time.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
