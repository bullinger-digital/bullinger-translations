      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you, dear friend. We recently made a friendly request to the mayor and some of the council's secret members in Zürich, considering that the compensation or goods have not yet been significant or substantial, only a goodwill gesture of a small friendship. They should have given us a clear and willing response before our departure, and thus far they have persisted. But until now, no written or verbal response has been received. Therefore, it is our gracious request that you would kindly make the appropriate inquiry with the aforementioned for a willing response, as you would also write and urge them in a friendly manner. And you can be assured that you will not refuse us this goodwill. We commend you to the protection of the Most High. Dated in Basel, by our hand, the 10th of September, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>We trust in dear God, and do not doubt, even though the devil is restless along with his commanders, you will soon hear good and new tidings. Nothing more for now.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich, to be delivered.</p>
