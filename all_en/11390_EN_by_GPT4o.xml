    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Johannes Haller will come to Memmingen again, Schuler can send with him what he promised to send to Bullinger, although it has not yet been copied. The linen, which he [Balthasar] Funk was tasked with delivering, has probably already been sent to Lindau. Best wishes. Greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna]. Bullinger should send back [the writings]. Greetings from Bartholomäus Bertlin and the pastors.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Johannes Haller arrived late in Memmingen and is soon departing for Zurich, dearest Bullinger. If he were not returning to us again, I would not have been able to send you these writings, which he is now bringing, for you to read, as I promised, because the messenger was in a hurry to leave; and I, being occupied with many things, could not copy them. Let him be a living letter to you. He will handle everything in my name in person.</p>
      <p>I believe the linen has been sent to Lindau; for I entrusted it to Funk, who is eager to do a favor for both you and me in this matter.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ keep you safe for His church, and especially for me, for a long time. May He grant you many thousands of good, blessed years, but the best in that time when we will surely see each other with joy.</p>
      <p>Greet your dear wife a thousand times also in the name of mine.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, January 5, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius.</p>
      <p>Except for the response from our council, please send back the rest with the present messenger, I beg you; for there are no copies available.</p>
      <p>Many greetings to you from Bartholomäus Bertlin and my fellow pastors.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
