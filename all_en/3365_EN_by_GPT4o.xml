      <p>Greetings. Three days ago, I wrote to you through a certain neighbor of mine, whose name is Jakob Schockanus. However, I do not know whether you have received my letter, and if you have not yet received it, you will certainly receive it; for the messenger is very trustworthy. Moreover, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, since I have found such an opportune messenger through whom I can send my letters to you, I did not want to miss the opportunity to greet you with this letter. Therefore, I greet you and your entire family again and again, and I wish you all, along with my son, perpetual safety and well-being. Furthermore, the bearer of this letter is also my neighbor and a singular friend, whose name is Andreas Genatius... a minister, who is especially dear to me because he was my son's first schoolmaster and gave him faithful service, teaching him according to the tender age he was at as a boy. But he is far more commendable to me for the exceptional learning he possesses.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask that you, on account of his eminent virtue and outstanding learning, consider him recommended and place him in the list of your friends and those devoted to you, which would indeed be most gratifying to me.</p>
      <p>As for the fact that he is the person I describe, distinguished in virtue and learning beyond his years, you will discover this yourself from mutual conversation with him; for he will reveal himself. Through him, you may also write to me; for he is traveling to Basel and will return shortly. I have nothing new to write; for if I had anything, I would have mentioned it in my last letters to you. Therefore, it remains, my excellent and most esteemed Lord Bullinger, that you and your entire family may fare well, and that you may always hold me and all of mine in your commendation. Given at Samaden on the Ides of October 1557. Please inform me, my Lord Bullinger, if my son needs anything supplied by me, whom I continually wish to be most commendable to you and all good people. Again, farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>A certain Alphonsus Conradus Mantuanus has at hand commentaries which he is publishing on the Apocalypse, and he has shown them to me and will shortly, I say, submit them to the press. He has seen your sermons on the Apocalypse and praised them greatly.</p>
      <p>I have agreed with him that as soon as his commentaries are published, he will send me a copy, which I intend to send to you. Yours and your family's most devoted, Friedrich von Salis Rhaetus.</p>
      <p>To the man of complete learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed and revered lord and patron. ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.</p>
