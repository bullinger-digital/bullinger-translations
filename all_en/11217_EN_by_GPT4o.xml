    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a letter and promises to study diligently. Reports on the style exercises with Grynaeus; Myconius and Otto [Werdmüller] also support his studies. Hans Holbein has come from England to Basel and has reported pleasant news about the conditions there; Bullinger can send something with him upon his return. Gwalther sends Vives’ “De institutione foeminae christianae”; he cannot deliver the Orosius yet, as Platter is still in Frankfurt. Lists new prints from Froben, Cratander, Walder, and Robert Winter. Grynaeus is marrying a wealthy widow [Katharina Lompart]. The plague is still rampant. Bullinger's brother Johannes should write to him. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Your letter has reached me, esteemed teacher, in which you encourage me to continue in my studies, which I promise to do diligently and to the best of my abilities, I will never cease. For I will strive, as long as I live, not to appear to have been supported by the church for so long and at such expense in vain.</p>
      <p>The main part of my studies is the exercise of style, in which I practice daily by writing both declamations and true and fictitious narratives.</p>
      <p>In this matter, Grynaeus, the pride and support of the Basel academy, is by no means lacking for those devoted to letters. These days, he has broken his long silence with great pleasure for the young students and, I hope, with no less utility. With the highest erudition and exceptional ease of teaching, he lectures on both the catechism and very brief but most useful oratorical instructions, and with examples taken from Livy, Cicero, and Vergil, he sheds a certain brilliant light on all, to whose imitation all others must write either simple narratives or forensic speeches for practice, which he examines with the remarkable dexterity of his genius, pointing out and correcting errors.</p>
      <p>All other matters concerning my affairs are in excellent condition. Dr. Myconius does not cease in his begun kindness, but confirms it more and more every day. The most learned and best men and professors do not deny the same, who receive me into their company with the most humane spirit. Our Otto also spares no effort on my behalf, who is never lacking for me in dialectics, if ever I fall into a perplexing difficulty.</p>
      <p>Recently, Hans Holbein came to Basel from England, proclaiming the very happy state of that kingdom, and after a few weeks, he will migrate there again. Therefore, if you have anything that was omitted at these fairs due to the turmoil of business, send it to me; I will see to it that everything is taken care of.</p>
      <p>I send to you, dearest patron, the book "De institutione foeminae christianae" by Ludovico Vives. However, I could not send Orosius now, as our Platter, whose help I use in this matter, has not yet returned from Frankfurt. Therefore, I beg you not to take this delay badly.</p>
      <p>Very few new books have been printed with us. Froben has published Ambrose and Isocrates in print and has Erasmus's works already in the press; Cratander has printed Aegineta and some other medical books; Walder has put the final touches on Ptolemy; Robert Winter, Oporinus's colleague, has brought to light the book "De anima" by Ludovico Vives. Besides this, there is nothing that I know of which I think you might desire.</p>
      <p>Grynaeus has exchanged his celibate life for the married state and has married a widow who is, as I hear, quite wealthy; however, the wedding has not yet been celebrated. The plague is exerting its strength more and more every day, spreading through all parts of the city here and there, but I hope its strength will cease with the advent of winter.</p>
      <p>I wonder why the Muses of your brother Johannes are so silent; I ask you to encourage him in my name to finally break his silence and write back, so that some literary monument of his mind, which I know to be very friendly to me, may exist with me.</p>
      <p>Dr. Myconius wishes you well, and his wife sends many greetings to your mother. Please greet in my name Wernher Lithonius, Theodor, Pellicanus, and the other leaders of the Zurich college, and especially your entire family, whom I always wish to be very well. Farewell, and may God keep you safe with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>From the house of Dr. Myconius in Basel, on the 20th day before the calends of October 1538. Rudolf Gwalther, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in both learning and piety, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the Zurich church, his patron and most esteemed teacher.</p>
