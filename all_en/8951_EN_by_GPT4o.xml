      <p>Greetings in abundance. In the previous month of March, I sent my letter, dated the 18th of February just past, to my son Barnabas, to be delivered to Mr. Christopher Froschauer at the spring fair in Frankfurt for you, which I hope you have likewise received from the same Froschauer. Since that time, I have received two very friendly letters from you, and indeed very ample ones; the first written on the twentieth of December, the latter on the twelfth of March just past; and included in them another small paper, in which you write to me about what you received in Venice concerning the slaughter of the Turks, and what you mention about the state of Germany and the persecution being quelled, etc. For which letters and news I give you the greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>From the time of the same fair, I also received from you other letters to certain of our bishops, which I delivered with equal faith and diligence to Rodolph Gwalther and Heinrich Bullinger, so that, since they also had other matters to transact with the bishops (who are now attending the public assembly, which we call Parliament in English), they might deliver them to each one; as they have informed me they have done, except for those you wrote to Mr. Jewel of Salisbury, who, since he is dead, I delivered them to Mr. Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich, according to your will. But do you hear? I do not know how it happened: but neither then nor since have I received the exhortations you mention, neither Latin nor German books; so that now I do not know what else to answer about this matter. In the meantime, however, I thank you for those two German and one Latin copies, which you decided to have transferred here to me. Indeed, the same Rodolph and Heinrich also have nothing certain about those books. But I received those others published in Latin by Rodolph's father with those letters, which the same men distributed to those men to whom Rodolph's father wished them to be distributed; whom I ask you to thank in my name for the book he sent to me, and the very friendly letters he gave me on the tenth of March of the last month.</p>
      <p>As for the thirty-two gold coins you write to me about: my son Gerson paid sixteen at the last winter fair held in Frankfurt to Mr. Christopher Froschauer for those ten crowns of the most reverend Bishop of Winchester, which you mention. The other sixteen were for another ten crowns, which the Bishop of Ely counted here to the aforementioned Gerson, so that he might recount them to you: moreover, my son added that at the same time he paid the same Froschauer ten gold coins for Julius Sancterentianus, which the most reverend Bishop of Ely had previously paid him here to be paid to the same Julius. But as for what you write to me in these words, ("by a similar error or doubt it happened at the spring fair, that twenty-seven thalers were brought here by Froschauer, given to him at Frankfurt and brought from England"), in this matter I do not know how to satisfy you, because you do not write to me whether my son Barnabas, who was also at the same fair in Frankfurt, counted those twenty-seven thalers to Froschauer.</p>
      <p>Your grandson Zwingli departed from this most corrupt world to God here in London on the... day of June just past, and has been joined to the assembly of saints, where he sings praises to God the deliverer. But Rodolph Gwalther together with Heinrich Bullinger have now returned to Cambridge, from where they came here at the beginning of Parliament with the Bishop of Norwich, whom I hear is a singular patron to Heinrich Bullinger; to whose mother or friends with you I ask you to signify, that he says he has received no money from them since he came to England. Therefore, when he was sick in Cambridge, and a little before, I lent him two pounds and ten shillings of English money, which are worth in German money thirteen florins and five batz: which I beg you to receive from her, and keep twelve florins and twelve batz for yourself, for the eight French crowns which the reverend Bishop of Norwich sent to me together with that note which I included in these letters. And I would like you to give the other eight batz to some poor student. But it is fair (as I wrote to you before) that those who send their sons to England should first pay their money in advance at Frankfurt, rather than asking others to pay for them here in England first, and then demand it at Frankfurt. Heinrich Bullinger's mother, as he himself told me, lives in Lindau.</p>
      <p>On the second of this month, the Duke of Norfolk, having been condemned for treason long before, was deservedly beheaded in London.</p>
      <p>I rejoice that you write in the same letters that you live and are well enough by the grace of God. In the meantime, however, I grieve that you are oppressed by the high price of provisions and all things. I hope, however, that after your publicly instituted supplication, God will be willing to look upon you in his mercy, and avert that paternal correction, which he is wont to inflict more often on those he loves most. I also grieve that you suffered from such a severe catarrh for the third week before you wrote these letters to me. But in your wisdom, you know that God himself visits those more often whom he wills; whom I pray to grant you patience, and, as you yourself write, may he mercifully grant you what is of his good will. My wife sends you many greetings, and prays that you commend her to God in your prayers, as she is much oppressed by the contraction of muscles and nerves, which we call spasm, and the pain of stones in the kidneys.</p>
      <p>This year a treaty was entered into between our most serene Queen of England, France, and Ireland and the King of France, solemnly sworn by both parties on Sunday, which was the fifteenth day of June just past, in the cathedral church of St. Peter at Westminster.</p>
      <p>On the twenty-fifth of June, I received your first letters from Zurich dated the first of October, in the year 1571, and sent by Mr. Friedrich Conders, a nobleman whom you commended to me. And if I can help him in any matter without inconvenience or trouble to myself, as you ask, I will do so most willingly. Furthermore, I add this to inform you of what news I have received from Lower Germany, which is under the dominion of King Philip: namely, how at the end of March just past, a certain nobleman of Belgium, named Monsieur Lumell, invaded a certain maritime city in Holland called Brill, and took it by force from the obedience of King Philip.</p>
      <p>Then we also understand that a thousand Spaniards and Walloons, subjects of King Philip who speak the French language, entered a city called Middelburg, and that they ravaged a certain village of Zeeland called Arnem on the way. There is also a large crowd of soldiers gathered in Flushing from France and England and other neighboring regions; but I have not yet heard of any great action taken by the Spaniards against those who are in the aforementioned Brill or Flushing, except what will be said later: but a very brief exhortation was recently brought here from Flanders, printed in both the French and Belgian languages, in which the Prince of Orange used the same titles of dignity and authority that he used in Lower Germany before his exile; and he urges the Belgians, who have now resisted the Spaniards, to show themselves as men now or never against the tyranny and unjust exactions of the Spaniards, and against the bishops of that region and the clerics who are their associates; and he encourages them, if they wish to show themselves as men, that they can easily remove the heavy yoke of servitude, which the Duke of Alba with the aforementioned Spaniards and bishops has most unjustly imposed upon them, not only against the republic or the common safety of the same region, but also against the honor and faith of King Philip.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in the past month of May, the city of Valenciennes in the county of Hainaut in Belgian Gaul defected from the rule of the aforementioned Duke of Alba, and expelled the Spaniards and all the principal men who were in charge there, and allowed Count Louis, the brother of the Prince of Orange, with eighty or a thousand armed soldiers (the majority of whom are French) to enter and fortify the city for the use of King Philip, as they pretended, yet they do not accept the authority of the Duke of Alba or his associates. But from that time, because the said soldiers did not capture the citadel of Valenciennes, they were forced to flee again from there, and leave the city to the Duke and his soldiers, who have recently come with a large army.</p>
      <p>Then we have certainly heard that a certain city called Venlo, which is a very small city in Gelderland, has also sent a message to the Duke of Alba; and just as Brill and Flushing, so many other cities in Lower Germany have defected, and have abandoned the Duke of Alba because of the tyranny he has used there in these recent years.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as I have been certainly informed, two small ships have arrived here in our Thames from Flushing, in which letters were brought, indicating to certain Belgians staying here, that there was a great naval battle in the last week on the coasts of Lower Germany not far from Sluys. The citizens of Flushing, whose strength and power now seem to consist in newcomers, then seized 15 or 16 ships loaded with spices and rich goods, and also with money, which ships came from Spain and Portugal, and were about to set out for Antwerp together with another thirty or forty warships and cargo ships that carried the Duke of Medina Coeli with a thousand and two hundred Spanish soldiers, who accompanied the Duke, and landed in Lower Germany. For King Philip has appointed this Duke of Medina Coeli as his deputy in Lower Germany, because the aforementioned King Philip, as it is said, has decided that the Duke of Alba will return from there home to Spain.</p>
      <p>Then also, as it is rumored, and for certain, the same citizens of Flushing drove two or three other ships of those ships they captured onto the shoals, and forced them to be shipwrecked there, and furthermore burned two or three other ships, and consumed them with fire. But, as many here say, these two or three ships mentioned just before, which were burned, were loaded with Spanish wool, and were about to set out for Bruges, and were among the number of those 30 or 40 ships that came from Spain under the protection and conduct of the aforementioned Duke of Medina Coeli, not among the number of 15 or 16 ships that were about to set out for Antwerp, and were captured in sight of Flushing and Middelburg. To me, however, it seems lamentable that the merchants of Antwerp (who undoubtedly do not love that impious and cruel Duke of Alba more than those who are now acting in Brill and Flushing love him) and the merchants of Spain and Portugal should be thus despoiled of their goods and merchandise, and perhaps the greater part of their sailors killed, drowned, or hanged: so that now it is to be feared, lest in the regions of the said King Philip there should be so little trade, or commerce, as it is called, traffic, in the future for several years, and so great and so great civil wars there at last, as there were a few years ago in France, unless it pleases the best and greatest God to avert his indignation from Lower Germany, as he is to be prayed for in his mercy not to do. Farewell: and may the best and greatest God preserve you for the promotion of his glory and for the edification of his church for as long as possible!</p>
      <p>London, the 10th day of July, in the year 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours, Richard Hilles.</p>
