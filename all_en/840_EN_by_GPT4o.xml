      <p>Greetings. Although I certainly bear my fate with an even mind, it pains me that in my concession there is no mention of my return. For, to pass over all other things, it would be most unjust and ungrateful if it were so closed to me that, should I be cast down here again by chance, I would not know where to retreat to and to what condition. I see that everything has been hastily arranged and composed... only so that I would be excluded, and it has been carefully ensured that my matter would not be devolved to the deacons, by whom I had been received. Come, it has succeeded for those who wish to place their own in my position; but whether this is to act piously and ecclesiastically and legitimately, which they always accuse me of, let them see for themselves. The Lord knows what each one seeks. I am quite content and give thanks to the Lord, who deems me worthy to serve in the ministry of His church; I acknowledge that the reward for my labors is stored up with Him; from the world, I expect nothing but ingratitude. Thus, He gradually teaches me in this arena to be an apostle, to leave worldly things for His sake, and that in small matters, so that later I may also be able in greater matters, so that if wife, children, and finally life itself must be left. To Him be glory forever. Therefore, there is no need for you to fear that I will henceforth wish not to be of Christ or to perform my duty, as is fitting. By no means will I learn with the apostle to be content with what I have, to abound and to lack, to be able to do all things in Christ, who strengthens me. This one thing I ask of Him, that He may inspire me with His grace, so that I may be able to sustain the most difficult and laborious duty with dignity. But, as I said, regarding my return, I would like at least this to be granted to me, that I may have the freedom to return to my condition and this very one, which I now leave, for any just and legitimate occasion. I see that the customs of the Bernese have not allowed anyone to preside over this church with peace for long, the people being given to factions. I see that the late Mr. Megander and others... I would have hoped that consideration for me would have been held here. But if perhaps it has been neglected through haste, I would like you, if you love me, as I trust, to obtain this for me from the senate, or I will come and humbly request what was previously in my power, and if I cannot from the senate, I will see if I can obtain it from the deacons. There is nothing new, except that a certain rumor says that the younger Duke of Savoy has been stabbed by the son of the Emperor; however, I would not wish to affirm this seriously. What is happening in Strasbourg, you know yourselves. I am eager to finally learn what the Ulmian writes from England. I thank you for your homilies. You will greet your wife and children from me and mine, Mr. Musculus and his family. May the Lord keep you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 18th February 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord and esteemed compatriot.</p>
