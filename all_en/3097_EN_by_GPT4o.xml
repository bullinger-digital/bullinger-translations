      <p>S. D. In response to your recent letters, as well as now, I have written promptly. Meanwhile, having carefully considered those matters I mentioned in my other letters, I realize that you have wisely and prudently omitted Brenz's response, and his long-discredited childish, not to say fanatical, arguments are not worthy of being addressed individually. Indeed, all the pious, whom you know mostly stand with you here in Heidelberg, acknowledge that you have vigorously refuted all the arguments of your adversaries.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we must always give due thanks to our God first and then to you. Our prince, being poorly educated and not yet possessing sound judgment, would gladly follow the Wittenberg church. Hence, he diligently seeks the old and original Lutheran. Thus, he has finally chosen Illyricus from among many to be the bishop of the Heidelberg church, etc., and if anything whole is found here, he will destroy it, as many here feel.</p>
      <p>All the states of the empire have agreed to a colloquy; however, the manner, place, persons, and time cannot be agreed upon; I believe it will be postponed indefinitely.</p>
      <p>Margrave Albert ended his life in Pforzheim on January 8th most happily and indeed in a Christian manner, so that, considering the course of his past life, it should rightly be regarded as a miracle of God, praise be to God.</p>
      <p>The priests sing praises, undoubtedly before the victory. I do not promise myself anything good regarding the affairs of the empire. The fall of the Saxons is wandering in the streets. The garden of the Zurichers flourishes among all the sincere. The orders will provide Turkish aid to their own ruin.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the most holy council, fellow students, and other friends and brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Soon, God willing, I will depart for Regensburg, where I will have to spend my noble time uselessly. Farewell and greet Dr. Peter Martyr by name from me.</p>
      <p>I will endeavor to bring Philipp Melanchthon here, although perhaps I will labor in vain.</p>
      <p>From Heidelberg, January 13th, in the year etc. 57. Yours, Georg Fr√∂lich (Laetus).</p>
      <p>Epitaph: Here lies Albert, prince, duke, margrave, a great terror to the priests and a hope and honor to the pious.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the pious and faithful overseer of the church in Zurich, to be delivered. Zurich.</p>
