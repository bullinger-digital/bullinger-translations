      <p>S. D. What I hope from the emperor, you will forgive me, most honorable men, if I say it right from the beginning. For I see that the outcome of the diets depends on this, as the main person. And I wish my conjectures would deceive me. The emperor of the Turks is said to have left Constantinople and approached closer to the mountains and to winter in Adrianople, and there to consult about leading a great army through Hungary into Austria in the spring or summer, because the Austrian prince has wantonly violated the agreements. However, since the Austrian emperor knows he is unequal to such a powerful and well-equipped enemy, this aims to entice the German princes into a war alliance by any means. Therefore, at present, he will promise them anything until he has won. Once he has won, and has received greater strength [and an external enemy is not to be feared], he will not show himself towards the true religion as he pretended before the victory. If he is defeated, all of Germany, entangled in war, will experience what it is to want to recover Ramoth Gilead, if only things turn out as kindly for us as they did for King Jehoshaphat. You know the history described in the 3rd book of Kings, the last chapter. Why do I think he will not show himself as many hope towards [the truly pious and towards] the true religion, these are the reasons: After he was elected by the electors and returned home from Frankfurt, he sent a delegation to the pope with Count Helfenstein, who prostrated himself as a supplicant before the pope in the assembly of cardinals and worshiped that beast. This unfortunate beginning will not have a happy ending. Besides, he has a Spanish wife most hostile to our religion. What indeed and how much such wives can do with their husbands, not only the history of Ahab and Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, but also daily experience teaches. To this is added the great hope of someday obtaining the kingdoms of Spain, since King Philip's sons are still minors, and she herself is said to have already sent her two sons to Spain. But in the meantime, he knows that there is no nation under the sky more hostile to the gospel than the Spanish. [For the princes are mad] and the entire clergy is furious. He knows, therefore, that he has lost all hope if he joins himself as a patron or ally to the evangelicals. Moreover, he has recently bound himself by affinity with the Italian princes, whose relatives and kinsmen are cardinals and bishops, and finally, whose soul is the pope?</p>
      <p>Who, therefore, would believe that such an emperor would help so that the pope would plead his case as a defendant before a council governed by prophetic and apostolic scripture? To all these things is added that due to excessive expenses, he is quite exhausted, while the pope and the papal clergy are very wealthy. What these largesses (which they lavish to retain their religion, or rather superstition, and to either oppress or hinder our true religion) can do is known to all. The examples of past times rightly terrify, etc. Although all these things are so, the most illustrious prince does very well, for in his piety he tries everything and hopes to achieve something with the emperor. Those who support his plan with advice, writings, and prayers also do well. All things are possible with God. And the plans of the enemies of Christ often fall far differently than they had wanted and thought, therefore we must labor incessantly, leaving the outcome to God. If it does not meet our expectations, we still know for certain that we have God as our own and that our pious labors are not in vain. God can save his own in any way, even if it is unknown to us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I also gladly offer my service to the most holy prince, although I frankly acknowledge this to be very small. Yet in great matters, it is enough to have willed. I also see that my service is not very necessary. From the proposed points and the name of the most illustrious prince sent to me, I easily infer that there are excellent men with the prince, who are neither lacking in words nor matters and can explain them far better than I. And since the arrangement of the speech is to be deferred until the very diets themselves, to be moderated according to the ease of the proposition, occasion, or other circumstances, I will gather nothing else here than some material for the prescribed points, if perhaps from this, whoever will have arranged the speech for the time, place, persons, and matters, may have taken something suitable for his purpose. And I pray you to consider this small effort of mine favorably. For I love you sincerely and for your sake, most illustrious prince, I will devote all my efforts. Commend me to the most illustrious prince. May the Lord preserve and promote him. Farewell to you too, most honorable men, in Christ the Lord. Given on December 12, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely.</p>
