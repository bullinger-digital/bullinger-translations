    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not written for a long time, as he did not dare to disturb Bullinger in his more important studies; now, however, his situation compels him to do so, as he has decided to explain the prophecies of the Prophet Daniel to the people in his sermons; he already possesses the commentaries of Hieronymus, Johannes Oekolampad, and Konrad Pellikan, but wishes to acquire Bullinger's and Theodor [Bibliander's] explanations as well, if they are available in printed form, or to borrow them if they only exist in manuscript form; he would handle the manuscripts with the utmost care and return them intact. The zeal for the cause of the Gospel is [in Graub√ºnden] only feigned, as the French party is gaining influence against the powerless opposition of the pastors; many have gone into [foreign] military service, and some still intend to do so. Request to forward the enclosed letter to Johannes Pontisella. There is nothing new to report from Italy and Lombardy; request for news from Germany. Greetings, also from Johannes Blasius and Nikolaus [Pfister]; greetings also to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], Kaspar [Megander], and [Johann Jakob] Ammann. Regret over the death of Leo [Jud].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. For many days now, as it seems to me, I have refrained from writing to you, most esteemed Bullinger. Although I have been very eager for your letters in the meantime, I did not dare to tire you, who are dedicated to better studies than mine, so often. But now necessity compels me to write again. I have decided to explain the oracles of the Prophet Daniel to our people in my sermons. I have the commentaries of Saint Hieronymus, Johannes Oekolampad, and Konrad Pellikan. Additionally, the annotations of our Bullinger and Theodor [Bibliander] are desired, if they have any, or if they can be purchased in printed form with money, or if some writings can be lent for friendship; I will preserve them with the utmost diligence and ensure they are returned intact. I do not wish to write about our affairs; for the zeal for the Gospel, which we have falsely pretended until now, is now entirely and sincerely turned to the French shields, and we, who announce the Gospel, are despised as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. Many have gone into military service, and many finally wish to go. May the best God at last grant a fitting end to this tragedy, I hope. We ask that those letters you have attached be sent, if possible, along with yours to Johannes Pontisella through you; perhaps this will be convenient for you at the upcoming Frankfurt fairs. From Italy or Lombardy, we have nothing at all of new things that are worth knowing. If you have any from Germany, please write to us briefly. Farewell, most excellent man. From the court of Rhaetia, on the eleventh day before the Kalends of September 1542. Johannes Blasius and Nikolaus wish you well. Give many greetings to Pellikan, Theodor, Kaspar, and Ammann brothers. Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>We hear that our Leo has migrated to Christ; we indeed mourn the loss to the church, but we congratulate his happiness. May the best and greatest God deign to preserve you, the remaining ones, for us for many years.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety and doctrine, Master Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
