    <p xml:id="regest1">Did not intend to spark a debate with his previous letter, but merely wanted to resume correspondence, as there was no longer any obstacle to it; the criticism hinted at in this context regarding Kunz’s earlier doctrine of the Lord’s Supper was not based on slanders from his opponents, but among other things, on a writing about the Lord’s Supper that was circulated with Kunz’s knowledge, as well as on the targeted dissemination of [Bucer’s] letter to Comander in Bern; however, these matters should no longer be discussed. He is pleased that Kunz finds nothing contrary to Scripture in his [Matthew] commentary; he deliberately avoided expressions like “unio realis/sacramentalis” and “exhibitio” as they give rise to scholastic discussions and disputes, and he generally rejects terms that obscure the doctrine; he refers to his interpretation of Mt 3, 11. By “faith,” he always means the living, effective faith; however, this does not cause Christ to be physically present. The act of the Lord’s Supper signifies what God truly offers: the communion of the body of Christ and the forgiveness of sins, which means that believers are united with Christ and with one another into one body. Regarding the [First Helvetic] Confession and its explanation [in the letter to Luther dated January 12, 1537], the circumstances of its creation should be considered; at that time, it was reserved to protect against misinterpretations through further explanation. Since Kunz agrees with [the Zurichers] that Christ sits bodily at the right hand of God and is partaken of spiritually by believers in the Lord’s Supper, they wish to be united in Christ. Greetings to Eberhard von Rümlang; apologizes for his hasty writing. Johannes Zwick has succumbed to the plague.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>I did not want to explain to you, dear Kunz, the many not unreasonable causes of my silence, lest I provide you with ample opportunity for disputing, explaining, and purging, and thus impose upon myself, already sufficiently occupied, the burden of responding. Therefore, I simply proposed in a few words what I then wanted and sought: to renew the long-interrupted duty of writing.</p>
      <p>For that which hindered the familiarity of letters and somewhat disturbed friendship has been removed. And here I had incidentally added that you seemed to me to have spoken rather perplexedly about the sacred Lord’s Supper, etc. But you think that this suspicion or opinion conceived about you arose in me from the virulent suggestions of certain slanderers, especially since I heard you in Zurich openly and sincerely propose the truth’s opinion, which I approved. However, I do not know, my dear Kunz, who your enemies or slanderers are; certainly, in my mind, none of your slanderers or enemies have instilled a slanderous suspicion about you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I bid you here to be entirely secure. I myself read a booklet presented not by enemies, but by brothers, and titled in the name of a certain layman, not yours, about the Lord’s Supper, but communicated to some not beyond your conscience. I also know of a letter circulated in Bern addressed to Comander and written against me, never sent to me, indeed not even communicated to all among you, but only to trusted friends, lest the mystery be divulged, which you highly recommended, though you are not unaware of what the author of that letter writes and thinks about the Lord’s Supper and the body of the Lord in heaven. I do not write these things to reproach you with anything, but so that from these few you may understand whence I drew what I wrote about you in my letters, and you may cease to suspect and be angry with virulent tongues. Nor do I desire that you respond scrupulously to these things. Rather, if you truly love me and wish for our friendship to be confirmed sincerely, let all these things be. For we do not wish to reopen those old matters, whether arising from just causes or suspicions, but rather to pray to the Lord that, wherever we have sinned, He may forgive, who offers Himself wholly to those who love peace and turn to Him.</p>
      <p>However, I greatly rejoice, dear Kunz, that you have found nothing in my commentaries that you understand to be contrary to the truth of the Holy Scriptures and orthodox faith. And indeed, I have simply and with a good conscience expressed my opinion on this, believing from the heart as I have openly professed with my mouth, and I think I have said everything that pertains to a just, moderate, and sober understanding of this matter. Indeed, I deliberately said nothing about union, whether real or sacramental, or about exhibition and similar matters, which in my opinion seem to entangle the simple mind of the listener more than to explain it, and thus I would wish that some words of this kind had never been introduced into this sacred matter.</p>
      <p>For from the word union arise innumerable scholastic and contentious questions, just as the word exhibition seems to introduce some mixture between the sign and the thing signified, so that only the most exercised minds understand what is said and how the matter is to be grasped.</p>
      <p>However, I think that both words and opinions that introduce doubt or obscurity should be avoided, not only in this cause but in any matter of faith and doctrine concerning our salvation. Indeed, I see that the ancients were not without reason cautious, lest in this cause ministry be mixed with power, sign with the signified. Of which matter I am reminded also in the 3rd chapter of Matthew, where I explain the words of the Baptist: “I indeed baptize you with water” [Mt 3:11], etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, whenever I speak of faith, I mean true, living, effective, working faith, not torpid, empty, foolish. For the Lord says: “He who eats me will live because of me” [John 6:57 (Vulg. 58)]. He eats who believes; “the just shall live by faith” [Gal 3:11]. Likewise: “He who abides in me and I in him, he bears much fruit” [John 15:5]. He abides in Christ who, taught by the Spirit of God, trusts in Christ and believes His word; he certainly works good works. Hence faith is not a vain speculation and bare thought, but also a living and effective operation. Meanwhile, it does not accomplish what some in our age and time have attributed to it, asserting that by faith the Lord Himself is presented corporally, yet invisibly.</p>
      <p>Hence it is no wonder if simple brothers and lovers of truth are found who abhor those excessive praises of faith, always fearing lest something alien to the nature of faith be mixed in and offered to the unwary. Indeed, just as no good person diminishes the just powers and just praise of faith, so nothing alien is attributed to it. By faith in the Lord, we are justified; by faith, we truly eat the body of the Lord and drink His blood. The sacraments exercise this faith, admonish and testify. These should not be attributed or affixed too much, but through them, we should transcend to higher things, etc.</p>
      <p>However, they agree well with themselves, dear Kunz, when I say that bread and wine are signs, but the thing itself is the communion of the body of Christ or the forgiveness of sins or the body and blood themselves, which are set forth because by them we have obtained fellowship with Christ and the forgiveness of sins. The action of the Supper signifies that the faithful are united to Christ by faith and with all the saints, who are the body of Christ, with whom and with all the saints the faithful have communion. And although this communion is signified, it is not exhibited - that is, conferred - by the action of the Supper, yet the faithful who partake of the Supper with true faith are united with Christ and the saints not putatively, but truly. However, God confers or exhibits that gift to faith, by whose benefit we are sons of God and fellow citizens of the saints.</p>
      <p>Regarding the confession and declaration of the Basel Confession, I am entirely secure; for I know by whom and for what purpose it was written and that we have retained for ourselves in every way the free, just, and sober faculty of interpretation, if anyone should try to explain our matters differently and draw them away from what we had established. But I am dealing with these matters more extensively than I had intended.</p>
      <p>Things are well, dear Kunz, beloved brother; you confess and teach with us that the body of Christ sits at the right hand of the Father and will never come into the world except for judgment, and that He acts in heaven in a certain place because of the true mode of a true body, meanwhile being eaten and drunk by faith in the church by the saints who believe His word and partake of the sacraments, so that they fully enjoy Christ and live in Him, as He lives in them, by spirit, not by flesh, by power and virtue, not invisibly and miraculously present. For Christ dwells in our hearts by faith, and the sacraments testify, exercise, and admonish the church, etc. Let us therefore be united in the Lord and confer all our matters in His pure truth, so that the concordant church may finally flourish and reign with Christ. May the Lord Jesus preserve us all by His spirit and grace.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet Eberhard von Rümlang diligently. Pardon, I pray, the poor handwriting; for I wrote hastily.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 30, 1542. In recent days, the incomparable man, Doctor Johannes Zwick, has passed to the Lord, taken by the plague. May the Lord preserve His church!</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
