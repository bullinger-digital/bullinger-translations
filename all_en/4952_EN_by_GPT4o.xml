      <p>Greetings. When I had written the other letters and just handed them over, they came back to me late in the evening at home; because we cannot inquire about our own due to the bad signs that are with you, therefore few of ours are going down. Meanwhile, my honorable mayor has handed me the correct original, as it will be sent to the communities (which is supposed to happen tomorrow), where we noticed that they initially had it translated word for word and then sat together with the priests and put everything in better order. Therefore, we had it copied last night, as it is very important to you, as you will understand yourself. And so my honorable mayor will have his son-in-law ride to Ragatz early tomorrow morning to deliver these letters, because it seems necessary to us that you have the correct original of your presentation, so that you can understand it better without any impudence. Therefore, our entire humble request to you is that you would send a copy to Mr. Hans Haller and other evangelical cities; because we have not been able to do more this time, and it stands that we will not have any more messages in the next 14 days; so things cannot be arranged here that one might use couriers; because nothing is hidden with us, the old council is sick. - May Almighty God have mercy on us and open the eyes of yours, so that they may begin to see what fruits follow from their actions (but, as I am told, some still do not understand); because if one had used greater seriousness in the Glarus matter, we would now be above all these things. But if one wants to anger no one over all this and proceed nicely, nicely, gently, then God have mercy. Yet I hope that God will preserve His word in these lands and give ours so much grace that they will do what is fitting for pious people, and will one day give the mediators their reward. May God have mercy on them and give them understanding.</p>
      <p>In all these things, the true knowledge of the most good and great God comforts me, from which I have learned that nothing is so bad that God cannot bring something good out of it. Do your best, as you have faithfully done with your collaborators so far.</p>
      <p>What God sends us to suffer beyond that, we will also bear patiently with His grace, in good hope that He will not abandon us, but will faithfully protect us with His shield. If it is possible for someone to come to you at the market again, which we might not know, let us know if our letters have reached you. But also and again, see to whom you entrust the letters.</p>
      <p>I write this late at night; therefore, forgive me. Chur, the day as above or now in the year 1561.</p>
      <p>You know my hand.</p>
      <p>Here with us, everything is safe; they would rather desire weapons a thousand times than comply with such unjust demands. Eglinus writes, who conducts himself excellently in Davos, that there is great hope; and I have found from those who were here with me that they are very steadfast. What happens with the others, I do not yet know, etc.</p>
      <p>The foul practices, long brewing, will now come to light.</p>
