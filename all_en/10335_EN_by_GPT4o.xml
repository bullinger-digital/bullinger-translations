    <p xml:id="regest1">A delegation from Basel visited Bern and negotiated, among other things, the restoration of unity between Bern and Zurich. Bern is ready to take the first step and send a delegation to Zurich. The Mayor of Basel, Jakob Meyer, wants to negotiate this secretly with trusted reformers in Zurich, although the Five Places will certainly be outraged by this. Bullinger is to prepare the matter: on one hand, quietly inform those affected, and on the other hand, proclaim the Christian commandment of forgiveness and reconciliation from the pulpit. Greetings from Markus Bertschi.</p>

      <p>S. As I recently wrote to you, our delegates were in Bern. Among other things, they diligently pursued matters concerning common concord. They were driven by the fact that they saw our discord and that, due to some peculiar fault, one speaks and believes only the worst of the other, thinking the strength of the Cantons to be tyranny, continually supporting and increasing it against all good people. However, they found this among the Bernese, so they were moved to come to you to see if they could accomplish anything for the benefit of the word of God and all of us. Therefore, one of the consuls, that father of the pious, will come to Zurich on the Saturday or Sunday following the birth of Christ and will deal with this matter to the best of his ability. May the matter result in the praise of God and the advancement of the gospel. The reason I am sending this message to you now is this: Because, by God's ordinance, almost all who were our friends and acquaintances have been killed, he does not know whom to approach first, with whom to deal, whom he can trust, and how to arrange the matter so that it achieves the desired end. Therefore, it will be your task to prepare in such a way that, once he arrives, there are those whom you can point out as good, proven, and discreet men, until the time comes to do everything openly. See what kind of spirit our people have acquired here: They know that nothing is hidden, especially in these times, and that they will hear the worst once that effort reaches the enemies. Nevertheless, they are so devoted to the common good, and especially to the divine cause, that they willingly undertake these things and without trepidation. Therefore, you will tell those you forewarn everything we advise, but remain silent towards the others. Publicly, however, in sermons - for I now impose this other duty on you - you should establish a discourse that exhorts to forgiveness, even if someone has gravely sinned against another, to good hope, even if you have often been deceived. For this is the duty of those who bear the title of Christ and his gospel. But you will establish this latter part according to your prudence, as it seems conducive and to keep the matter secret. Therefore, my Bullinger, pursue everything in such a way that our visitor feels your diligence, and we can all rejoice together when it results in what we hope for.</p>
      <p>Farewell always.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 20, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Our Lord Markus Bertschi diligently asked me to send you his greetings in his name.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his kind, dear lord.</p>
