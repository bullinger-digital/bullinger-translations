      <p>Greetings. The issue of the pensioners and mercenary soldiers troubles and burns me no less than it does you, and I seem to foresee the most certain destruction of our dearest homeland. For greed and luxury have occupied everything far and wide.</p>
      <p>Blood touches blood, and to all this is added the contempt for the eternal word of God. For we hear the will of God, we see better things, yet we follow worse.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we cannot have calm minds and be free from great fear. I set no limit for you, my brother.</p>
      <p>You have the rule of the word of God; you know that we must prudently announce this for edification.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord that you may do this, and do what the Lord commands you to do. - In Lyon, a papal bull was printed for three cardinals, Lorraine, Bourbon, and Castiglione. A cruel royal edict was added concerning the power of these cardinals, that is, concerning the severe inquisition and persecution of the faithful. An example was sent to me, so that it is no longer obscure what is reported about the persecution, etc.</p>
      <p>If this matter is conducted in Frankfurt, we will soon see Germany falling into the gravest dissensions and, because of the beastly title, collapsing with mutual arms, and that will be the right reward for always wanting to have the image of the beast. "Ferdinand is to act in the assembly concerning aid; for the Turk, contrary to the given faith, has led away several thousand captured from Hungary. Also to act concerning religion, lest any disturbances arise in Germany in the meantime because of this; therefore, he tries to leave the free use of religion to each party."</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, March 25, 1558.</p>
