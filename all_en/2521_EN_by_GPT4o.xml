      <p>The one who will deliver this to you, most excellent Bullinger, is half of my soul. What more can I say?</p>
      <p>Charity has drawn him from the middle of Italy in such a winter to this place, just so he could see me.</p>
      <p>Embrace the man who is traveling through Zürich to see you. The brothers from Strasbourg write to me that our prince's money has been distributed among the English; whether consideration was given to those who are there, I do not know; I certainly obtained it primarily for their benefit. The Duke is now providing other funds for translating the New Testament into the Slavic language, a work I wish to discuss with you before undertaking; I would have come now, indeed, if a very important matter had not detained me; but I hope to come.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Roman king has entered Augsburg for the sake of the diet, but no prince has yet arrived, ours is still at home. I spoke with him the day before yesterday and with the count, who returned to Montbéliard, hoping to marry the landgrave's daughter.</p>
      <p>Be silent, when it is opportune, I hope you will learn the whole matter. Antiochus, to entice aid for the war he is about to wage in the east and west, has arranged for it to be dictated, by the immortal gods, with what cunning. I have stated my opinion, not even if an angel from heaven should be received. The first point is about the Anabaptists, the second about the Zwinglians, namely that they should be completely dismissed and not admitted. But I have written more than I intended, yet read it under the condition that you do not speak a word of it to any mortal.</p>
      <p>You can write back to me through the rider who brought my brother there; I ask you to do so, and in detail and liberally. If a small barrel full of books comes from Strasbourg, take what you want, then give it to Laelius. I wish Zwingli, Lavater, Simmler, and all the brothers well. Still, seek the catalog of heretics and your letter to me, which I earnestly ask of you, brother. The prince saw something I recently composed about that reverend father of nonsense, Gregory, and seriously urged me to beware of the antichrist.</p>
      <p>"Hardly," he said, "will he endure you provoking him so often." I will be cautious, but my hope is in the Lord of hosts.</p>
      <p>I would write about the Osiandrian cause, for it is being discussed now; but I also praise you for abhorring this kind of contention, as I do. Farewell and pray for me. Tübingen, on the first of January 1555.</p>
      <p>Brother Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Write to me about Locarno.</p>
      <p>I earnestly ask you, send now through this rider the Italian booklet by Giovanni della Casa on the praises (honor be to the word) of sodomy; my prince wishes to see it, because the cardinal of Augsburg, with whom he recently conversed, denied it was ever written. I also ask you to send the pontifical; I will return both faithfully.</p>
      <p>[To the] most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of Zürich, [my] honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
