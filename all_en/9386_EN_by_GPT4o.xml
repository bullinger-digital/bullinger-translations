      <p>Greetings. Today I received your letter, and regarding Mr. Steiger, I could not inform him of the matters concerning him so quickly, because he is away from the city, residing in his estates and properties. Nevertheless, I am sending you two French coins, which I will collect from him when he returns. We have not received anything from Beza either.</p>
      <p>Recently, Mr. Zuleger from Solothurn visited here, hoping to find Beza here; however, disappointed in that hope, he stayed only half a day and then hurried to Geneva. We could not extract from him what business he was conducting, and he had no news that was not already widely known.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a nobleman of great, as they say, renown, Mr. de Cusin, also came to these parts, who reported with certainty that peace had been made in France; however, he could not report on the conditions under which it was made due to his swift departure from Paris. We are still very doubtful about this matter until we receive more certain information from elsewhere, and if I have it, I will also inform you. I cannot say more now, because the messenger thinks he will leave immediately, and I have to prepare myself for the sermons tomorrow and the day after.</p>
      <p>Therefore, farewell. Greet all friends and brothers, especially those of your household.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 18, 1573.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
