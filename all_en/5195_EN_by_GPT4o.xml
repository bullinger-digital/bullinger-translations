      <p>S. I thank you greatly, most kind Mr. Bullinger, for once again sharing with me what perhaps you would not have shared with anyone else, and therefore I return it in good faith. However, due to the lack of reliable messengers, I could not return it sooner; for I did not want to entrust these matters to the coachmen. Furthermore, I am equally grateful for the booklets you sent me and the library as a gift. Leodegar also received his.</p>
      <p>As for your request for my opinion on it, what should I write, most learned man? For if I wanted to say what the matter truly is, I might perhaps seem to be flattering or speaking to gain favor.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I will briefly say what I feel.</p>
      <p>I am very pleased with the modesty you use in this booklet, which will undoubtedly move the hearts of many; for in this world, more is achieved with these people by gently presenting the matter than by mocking. Furthermore, I approve that you did not remain silent about Brentius's foolish book, lest the adversary becomes more insolent by attributing victory to himself, and thus it becomes clear to everyone that even the most learned often make serious mistakes and are less revered as gods.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it will be a joy to many that you have presented this matter in such a way that everyone can easily understand the mind of our churches, using the strongest and most irrefutable arguments in this matter, so that no one of sound mind will approve of Brentzius's opinion, but will disapprove of yours. But why do I use many words? I cannot present my judgment in writing as it truly is. As for Mr. Erastus, it seems that he simply and candidly proposes the Lord's communion with us and also conveniently explains the words: "This is" etc. through the apostle's opinion: "The bread which we break" etc., and also sufficiently aptly proves and firmly requires spiritual eating in the supper and not carnal. And I am amazed that a physician presents the matter, which is much disputed by theologians, in such a way that anyone can easily understand what is true or false and easily extricate themselves from this controversy. There is nothing new to write.</p>
      <p>What has been done between some princes and Guise is not certain; there are those who say that Duke Guise is seeking to be received into the king's favor, promising to assist him in all things, as he sees Navarre seeking his own. Others defend Navarre, attributing his proposal to prudence; for thus it is ensured that war is not waged against France. But I dare not affirm anything certain here.</p>
      <p>Our consuls urgently pressed that I should ensure we receive the response of your most honorable magistrate; for they believe it will greatly benefit the matter if our magistrate agrees with your response.</p>
      <p>I proposed the main points of the response written to me, and our response will not be dissimilar to yours. But I cease to trouble you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, who may preserve you for us for a long time, safe and sound, along with other learned men. My fellow ministers greet you and the other learned men.</p>
      <p>We are now dealing with the matter of who should be appointed in place of Simperthius; there are those who claim we lack learned men and wish to summon them from elsewhere, but the people of Schaffhausen, who never agreed with our predecessors. We urge the retention of concord in the church among the ministers, although not so learned, yet faithful. But you will soon hear what has been done.</p>
      <p>On March 11, I will descend through Basel to Strasbourg to visit our students and send some to Heidelberg; some are called from Wittenberg, who will sometimes come to you, God willing. To the most illustrious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, a lord and brother in Christ, much to be respected. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
