      <p>Grace and many blessed years I wish you and all yours from God our Father through our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, I inform you, dear godfather, that upon your writing and earnest insistence, my lord treasurer Haller has again sent to me and requested a final answer as to whether I intend to stay with them or not; for if they perceive my will, they are considering sending an embassy to Zurich to further my request, and that in due time, so that if I refuse them, they can make other arrangements in time. To this I have now briefly answered them: it is not for me to say or refuse anything in this matter at present; however, I have made a contract with my lords regarding my service in Zurich, from which, as long as I am not otherwise provided for, I cannot and will not deviate; as long as my lords in Zurich allow me to remain, I will not show disobedience in further permission. What they have advised in response to my answer, an embassy has been arranged by the council and citizens, which will come shortly and bring this matter to my lords. Now I am quite firm in the matter. You have insisted much on the matter of payment, as I understand, which I would rather have been omitted; for your letters are widely known and have caused more displeasure than furthered my cause; for, as and what one writes, you are well aware. In summary: no one has dealt with me about this matter, but has shown much more displeasure; only the treasurer has privately given me the comfort as before: they can secretly favor me more than another, but not everyone must know this. Which, however, is not enough. Therefore, I will not and cannot deviate from my position in Zurich, unless they take it from me by letter and seal, which I do not hope, and I am therefore more satisfied than ever, that I see the great ingratitude, and that they are not serious and that your writing has not helped more than it has made me stink before them. Therefore, I have no desire to stay, also because I feel and experience that they go behind my back; for the envoys have no command regarding the condition I attached, but that they simply and always desire me, and promise much, which is nothing. And if I were to be granted to them by my lords, I would sit nicely between two stools. Therefore, I am compelled to write something (although I do not like to do it) to my lords; I hope they will not resent me when they see that I offer myself to serve further, as long as they allow me to remain by their promise.</p>
      <p>For I will not build a little house here, nor do I like it if someone does it on my behalf, since I see how it is received. Therefore, I desire that either my lords take me home according to their promise, since now Musculus has been appointed here to preach with all approval and Knechtenhofer has also been called here to the diaconate; or if they still want to promise me further, that my position remains open as before.</p>
      <p>For if not, it is not possible for me to stay, as you know yourself, and neither Musculus nor I can be helped, who need it more than I do.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you to let my matter be presented to my lords; I trust you as good and do not conceal anything from you. But I am surprised that you never wrote to me what you are dealing with the treasurer on my behalf.</p>
      <p>The envoys who are coming are Junker Gladi Mei from the council and Stürler from the citizens.</p>
      <p>Junker Gladi is secretive and friendly to me, but heavy; I would not like him to be involved in the matter of payment. Stürler is the most arrogant and wicked of all Bernese, who nevertheless aspires to the highest honors and whom I fear most in the republic, an enemy of the gospel and ministers; I cannot sufficiently wonder that he has been appointed to this legation. From him, I warn you, beware; for as soon as the matter of payment is brought up with him, it would be immediately shouted among all his kind.</p>
      <p>When they will come, I do not yet know for certain; however, I think around January 12. You will inform the lords in advance, if you consider it advisable, and me if you ever have me recommended at this time.</p>
      <p>Regarding Gervasius, I still know nothing from Biel, how it stands. Jungius, whom they would like to have, has gone to Aarau. I have recommended Gervasius to the senate in Biel; I hope he will be called. Dr. Montio has received an answer similar to that in Zurich.</p>
      <p>In the Wädischwyler matter, your writing and my insistence have achieved as much as in my matter; it will not go; that makes me not a little displeased. Further, I have nothing to write to you at this time, until next with the envoys, God willing. With this, I commend you to God. My wife greets you along with yours, likewise Musculus and his wife; wish you all a good and prosperous year. Dated Bern, January 2, 1550.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful servant of Christ and the church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
