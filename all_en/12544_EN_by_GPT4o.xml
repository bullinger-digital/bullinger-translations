    <p xml:id="regest1">Haab thanks for Bullinger's news [not received]. Unfortunately, he does not have much time. Bullinger can learn everything Haab reports to the Zurich Council from Hans Rudolf Lavater. Due to lack of time, Haab cannot write separately to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Remarkable things are happening that suggest divine providence. However, there is also a fear that the Seven [Catholic] Cantons of Switzerland have been bribed by the Bishop of Constance [Johann von Weeze]. For everything that [the Protestant Cantons] have accused the Seven Cantons of in the past, namely that the latter could upset the Emperor [Charles V] by sending their mercenaries to [Francis I], they now accuse the [Protestant Cantons] of, even though the situation is entirely different. Bullinger should urge people to pray, as there could be a great betrayal [in the Confederation]. The Bernese seem to be playing a double game. They keep their soldiers at home and say they do not want to recall the [Confederate] mercenaries [from Germany]. Meanwhile, they claim to have no one there, but why? The Zurichers do not want to recall anyone at all!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger should not hide anything from the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs]; he is trustworthy.</p>

      <p>Revered, highly learned, gracious, honorable, dear sir. I thank you kindly for the effort and work you have taken to inform us with the latest news, surpassing yourself, etc. And although I have much to write to you, I do not have much time, as you will learn everything from my dear lord and friend, Hans Rudolf Lavater, that we report to our lords; whom you should also greet very kindly for me, telling him not to be angry that I do not write to him separately, as I truly do not have the time.</p>

      <p>Remarkable things are coming to light, where one can clearly see that God Almighty intends to carry out this matter wonderfully. Praise and thanks be to Him! I fear that the Seven Cantons have been anointed with much money and oil by the Bishop of Constance! God have mercy! For everything that we accused them of in past wars, when they were said to be siding with the French, they now accuse us of, even though the situations are not at all the same, etc. Urge the people earnestly to call upon God, for I fear great betrayals are present and forthcoming. May God graciously protect us! I cannot come from Bern. They keep their servants strictly at home and yet speak boldly, not recalling anyone. They claim to have no one in the field, although we are also not at all willing to recall anyone. However, it seems to me that they are playing both sides. May the Almighty be with you and all of us.</p>

      <p>Do not hide anything from the city clerk, as I trust him very well. In Baden, Monday, the 12th of July, 1546. Your old trusted friend and neighbor Hans Haab, citizen of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the revered, highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Minster in Zurich, my especially dear lord and friend.</p>
