      <p>To the most learned and kind man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>Since a week has already passed since we informed you about the state of our affairs, most learned Bullinger, and yet in the meantime you have not sent us any reply, our minds are distracted by various thoughts, not knowing what to suspect about your silence, whether you are estranged from us or offended. Although your unforgettable kindness and humanity towards us, by which you have abundantly provided us with the necessities of life throughout this entire winter, forbids us to think this, we must explain why we suspect your mind is alienated from us. And, since we are not conscious of any wrongdoing, we have finally come to the conclusion that, if you are offended by us (which we do not so much believe as suspect), it is because of our inconsistency or instability, as we seemed to have feigned humility before, but now appear to have become more arrogant. We would like to remove this scruple from you before we bring up other matters, so that you may attend to the rest with a more benevolent mind. Therefore, first of all, know, most reverend Lord Bullinger, that when we wrote that last letter to you, we were more fervent due to some insult (which we will explain later) that moved us, so that we dared to hope we would easily deserve an excuse for our haste and agitation of mind even from a common person, let alone from a most learned and equally kind man.</p>
      <p>For we wrote on the same day we received your letters, so that the brevity of time might deserve an excuse, we wrote as young men, so that our age (which is often more insolent) might excuse us, and we wrote somewhat agitated, so that you might attribute something to our grief; for it was very bitter for us to be rejected by you as unworthy, not so much because of food as because of dignity; for we would rather have a large crowd of others suspect us badly than you, than your, I say, Lord Bullinger, kindness. You know that nothing is more serious or troublesome to noble minds than to have good people suspect them wrongly. Therefore, since we wrote with a disturbed mind not as prudently or cautiously as we should have, we certainly deserve some excuse. But even if we imagine we are dealing with a very strict man who wants to deal with us with the strictest justice, who considers no regard for a disturbed mind, age, or brevity of time, we still think it sufficient for our excuse that our action can be defended and excused by legitimate reason.</p>
      <p>Therefore, what seems to have been written arrogantly is not so much truly the case as it appears externally to someone viewing the matter from afar. For nothing is so well said that it does not appear otherwise externally than the matter itself is, so that it is very true (as Erasmus says) that everything is an inverted Silenus. Therefore, what seems arrogant is so far from the truth that nothing is more so, and if it cannot be perceived otherwise, at least it can be sufficiently clear from this, that we have not been ashamed to bear the name of poverty until now. Who does not know how disgraceful, how contemptible the name of poverty is? And since we have voluntarily taken on this matter, which makes us extremely contemptible and abject, what arrogance can there be in us? Therefore, the matter is far different in seclusion than it appears on the surface. I will therefore say by what reasoning we were moved to write more arrogantly. The main intention of our mind was to ensure that you would regret as little as possible the benefit conferred upon us, and also to remove all suspicion of luxury from us, since we now live more lavishly than the condition of the poor allows. To that end, nothing was more conducive or suitable than to somewhat magnify the state of our condition, even if indicating it more than expressing it and covertly rather than openly. For otherwise, we could indeed have been accused of luxury if we had acted beyond our custom and above our dignity.</p>
      <p>Therefore, what we did was not so much out of willfulness as necessity, nor so much for the sake of arrogance as for removing the suspicion of luxury. But why do I try to show you the reasoning of our letter, when I am dealing with a most learned man, who himself would admit that a sentence should not be apprehended by itself alone (which is the work of slanderers), but that the preceding and following and the context and purpose of the whole speech should be considered. Unless this is done, anyone can twist even the best things said or written into a wrong meaning. Therefore, since what we did was useful for the defense of our utility, I will add that it was necessary, unless we preferred to be defamed for luxury in your dignity, we do not think you are any longer disturbed by this matter, since you now clearly perceive and sufficiently know the sincerity of our mind. But perhaps this might somewhat offend your mind, why we did not say we were rich before as we do now. Know, Lord Bullinger, that we did this not out of malice, but out of a certain prudence (as it seemed to us). For we thought it would be indecorous if we, living professedly in poverty, were to boast of the name of wealth, and for that reason we would be made a laughingstock and subject to suspicion of lying, as if we were feigning it deceitfully.</p>
      <p>Now, however, since we can speak the truth more without suspicion of lying after the alms have been removed, we have finally deemed it right to manifest it. In which matter, if we have erred in judgment, we ask you to consider it pardonable, since we did it more out of inexperience and simplicity than out of cunning. We, moreover, having no further doubts about your candor and benevolence, are confident that you will be such as it befits you to be, well-favoring and well-wishing towards us. But we are convinced that these so small and trivial matters could not have alienated your candor from us, although we wished to address a few things, so that we might have a more prepared way to defend greater matters, which we have already heard have been reported to you about us. We do not think it unknown to you, most reverend Lord Bullinger, that such a desire for slander is rampant everywhere in this most ulcerated age, that no one can live so piously, integrally, and incorruptly that they are not exposed to the detractions of men. Therefore, it would seem strange to us if we had escaped the slanders of others, especially as foreigners, who, besides other inconveniences, do not know this language to defend ourselves and are also dissimilar to them in diversity of customs (which is often no small cause of hatred). Hence, we are especially surprised that only our hostess (who, if she were pious, as she wishes to appear, should defend and benefit us in all things) has spoken ill of us. For Lord Fliner, from the region of our lodging, once a preacher, summoned us and informed us how our hostess had complained about us not having been to the holy communion, and also that our books contain nothing of this religion (which she said she heard from her son) and therefore we do not agree with this religion. We will prove the former to be false by naming those who administered the eucharist to us and to whom we seemed; you will say the latter is false if we offer you our book to inspect and read.</p>
      <p>Since she dared to falsely complain about these two major things to the said Lord Fliner, we think you will easily judge that other things (if she said any) are falsely fabricated about us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we ask that if anything else has been said secretly about us, you would deign to inform us, so that we may manifest what is false and preserve our reputation unblemished; for nothing is dearer to us than reputation, nothing more precious, so that we would rather have anything taken from us sooner than have our reputation tarnished. We bear this more lightly because it was done by a woman (to whom, because of her garrulous tongue, desire to slander, and inability to control her hatred, even a wise person would not easily lend an ear), and also because we have demonstrated and can firmly demonstrate her to be false and a liar in two and those the greatest matters, as she recanted what she had said about us not attending the communion to the aforementioned Lord Fliner. Therefore, most reverend Lord Bullinger, we would like you to be persuaded that we are such as we are and have always been, that is, noble and most concerned with the integrity of our reputation, and that you should suspect what might be reported to you about us behind our backs and after our departure. We especially wanted to offer this excuse of our innocence to you, to whom we are most bound by benefit, so that our integrity might be most clearly known to you, lest you ever think your benefit was exposed in vain. But having indicated these few things (which can be more fully explained in person), we have decided to signify nothing more by letters except that we will always be mindful of you for your benefit, and wherever we can gratify you or anyone in your name, we will do so eagerly and promptly, and we desire nothing more than that we may someday have the opportunity to express our gratitude to you not only in words but also in deed. Farewell.</p>
      <p>We confess that we cannot repay you with deserved thanks for the great benefits bestowed upon us.</p>
      <p>But God, the high-sounding creator of heaven and earth, will return great thanks, nor will our Thalia cease to be mindful of you, as long as life leaves the body and we freely depart into the eternal airs, and as long as the bold dog hunts the timid deer; for just as a fervent flame is not usually extinguished but rather grows, so will our gratitude increase.</p>
      <p>Always most observant to you.</p>
