      <p>Greetings. It has already been fourteen days, reverend father in Christ, since I responded at length to your letters full of goodwill and paternal benevolence, and I believe they have been delivered. The main point was that I often thought of offering some remedy for your sorrow with words, but my reverence for you has so far prevented me from daring to do anything of the sort, as it might seem as if I doubted your strength and constancy, which are praised in a remarkable way by all your people, if I attempted such a thing. Eight days ago, I also wrote to Mr. Lavater.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I have received no letters from either my people or yours, and I am very doubtful about the situation of my people, whether everything is safe; certainly, such a long silence is suspicious to me.</p>
      <p>But I commend you and all your affairs to God in my prayers, I can do no more. He is our Father; therefore, it is necessary that He decides about us in a fatherly manner.</p>
      <p>Here, there is clearly nothing new; the market is small, no one from Valtellina was present. The envoy of the republic paid one pension; nothing has been done yet; it is awaited what will happen among the Swiss.</p>
      <p>I hoped it could be persuaded to our people that they themselves would settle separately with the French apart from the Swiss; but the envoy insists on the contrary; but what will happen, I do not know, except that most are watching to see what the Swiss will do. I am sending letters from Mr. Friedrich, so that you may understand the concern of friends for you. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that He may graciously preserve what remains of your family. Give my regards to Mr. Lavater and all your other people.</p>
      <p>Chur, November 20, 1564.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and much revered father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
