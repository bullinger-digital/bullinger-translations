    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has received three letters from Vadian.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In the first [No. 2380], Vadian expressed his opinion on Bullinger's writing "De sacramentis". He also sent his German translation of the letter directed by the bishops of Germany [against Pope Gregory VII] and the poem written in German about the Council of Trent, with which Vadian takes a stand against the [bull] "Laetare Hierusalem". At the moment, Bullinger does not want to publish his writing. The good, because not literal, translation of the bishops' letter will appear in the [“Swiss Chronicle”] by [Johannes] Stumpf. The poem [about the Council] was excellently liked by [Johannes] Haab and others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- In the second letter [No. 2400], Vadian reported that Pope [Paul III] had promised Emperor [Charles V] 20,000 guilders to subdue the Germans, which is not really surprising, as it is in the nature of the Antichrist to distribute treasures. [Johannes] Haller wrote from Augsburg, however, that the bishops gathered in Trent intended to depose the Pope because he was distributing the money intended for the fight against the German heretics to his relatives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Vadian was of the opinion that Luther had been buried in Eisleben. However, this is not true. Luther's body was buried with great pomp in the Castle Church in Wittenberg. The poem on Luther's death, written by a scribe [Christoph Arnold], is well-liked by Bullinger. More mourning songs or poems will probably appear.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- After Bullinger showed Vadian's [satirical poem] on the [deceased monk Otmar] Gluß to [Rudolf] Gwalther, he also composed such a poem. Vadian may have already received it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger is pleased that [Martin] Frecht has returned home safely, especially since the murder of Juan Diaz by his brother Alfonso in Neuburg an der Donau clearly shows how dangerous it is to oppose the beast. Vadian will probably have heard that Alfonso, with the help of his servant [Juan Prieto], murdered his brother, just as Cain killed Abel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- In the last letter [No. 2411], Vadian reported how God punished those who massacred the Waldensians [in 1545].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The Emperor is supposed to hurry to Regensburg. On the way, he summoned Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] and [Elector Frederick II] of the Palatinate to Speyer. What he demanded from them is not really known. The Emperor has only one goal: to harm the [Schmalkaldic] Diet in Worms and the alliance of the Evangelicals. If they listen to the little fox, it is over with the freedom of the Germans!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Bullinger sends a pasquinade shared with him by friends [Matthias Erb and Gerold Meyer von Knonau the Younger] to make Vadian laugh. He should send it back.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The messenger [...] wants to continue. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- At the [Diet] in Baden, the request of the [Schmalkaldic] League [by the deputies] was taken for further consultation.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I have received three letters from your kindness, a man always most esteemed by me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In the first, you express your opinion on my book "De sacramentis", interpret the letter of the bishops of Germany, and present the German poem "Laetare Hierusalem" against the Council of Trent; for all of which I give you great thanks. For certain reasons, I will not publish the book "De sacramentis" now. The letter of the German bishops will be included in the books of Stumpf. I approve of your translation, which is not bound to the words. A good translator cares more for the sense than the words. Consul Haab read your German poem and greatly approved it. Many good men have been delighted by it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In the second, you report that the Pope promises the Emperor twenty thousand gold coins to subdue the Germans. I expect nothing of peace and good from either. It is characteristic of the Antichrist to distribute treasures. However, Haller writes from Augsburg that there is a rumor that the fathers in the Council of Trent will depose the Pope for saying he collects treasures to defeat the German heretics, but distributes them to his sons and grandsons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You think, informed by the letters of friends, that Luther was buried in Eisleben. But I understand that his body, carried with great pomp to Wittenberg by carriage, was received by the university and city and placed in the church of the castle, buried among the mausoleums of the princes of Saxony. His epitaph, written by a certain scribe, pleases me greatly. It is elegant. Nor do I doubt that more learned men will compose elegies and epitaphs for him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>When I showed your poem on Otmar Gluß to Mr. Gwalther, he also wrote one; if you have not received it, you will shortly. Christ is always present with his church, suppressing the ferocity of adversaries. He should be prayed to diligently, that he may always defend us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I am glad that Frecht has returned home safely, especially since that Alfonso Diaz, judge of the apostolic rota, has shown by the most cruel parricide how dangerous it is to oppose the great and manifold beast. You undoubtedly know the story, as he struck his brother, Cain to Abel, Mr. Juan Diaz, at Neuburg on the Danube with an axe through his servant.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>In the last, you narrate the truly astonishing punishment, taken from heaven, of the parricides of the Waldensians. By this, our king has again shown how much he cares for his church. To him be praise and glory!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>We hear the Emperor is hurrying to Regensburg. On the way, he summoned the Landgrave and the Elector Palatine to Speyer. What he demanded from them is unknown to all; some speculate. His whole aim is to impede the Diet of Worms and disturb the alliance of the Evangelicals. If they listen to the little Spanish fox preaching, it will be over with German freedom.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I received this pasquinade from friends. I share it with you to make you laugh; but you will return it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The messenger hurried. Therefore, I cannot write more now. Farewell with all yours. Zurich, April 17, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>In Baden, the request of the League was taken for further consultation. The people do no virtue. I hear ours are very ready in spirit.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Joachim Vadian, my always most esteemed lord. St. Gallen.</p>
