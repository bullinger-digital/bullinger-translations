    <p xml:id="regest1">Fears that the decision [of Elector Johann Friedrich] of Saxony and [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse to support [Duke Wilhelm of Jülich-Berg-Cleves-]Guelders militarily will mean great harm for Germany; this could mean the strengthening of the enemy of Christianity [Francis I], who is far more warlike than Emperor [Charles V]. Sends a copy of a resolution [“The commendable city of Zurich's order and recognition against harmful wars and mercenary service”], which Blarer can share with friends and also [Johannes Welser], but should not otherwise disseminate or even print, as only a small number were printed for presentation in the churches. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter written on November 21st immediately, venerable and beloved brother Ambrosius, in which I was most alarmed by the news that the Saxon and the Hessian are raising an army to support the Guelders. If this happens, war will threaten all of Germany from the Emperor, unless the army, frightened by a new enemy, more easily accepts the conditions of peace with the Prince of Guelders. Meanwhile, it is regrettable if no one has come to his aid, if a prince, apparently not a bad one, must be expelled from his kingdom. Certainly, the Emperor's power will grow, and thus he will more easily attack the Hessian, the Saxon, and the remaining confederates. I wish the Guelders had given no occasion to the Emperor; but they say he joined the French army ravaging Brabant and thus provoked the Emperor's arms against him. If this is true and he himself gave the Emperor the occasion to wage war with his injuries, I fear that the Saxon and the Hessian may join a good cause. Certainly, the Frenchman will laugh when he sees his side growing; they will grow remarkably if the Saxon and the Hessian attempt to prevent or deter the Emperor's army from its purpose with arms. But I wish no good man would support the French side; for he is an enemy of Christ and more corrupt than Belshazzar of Babylon. Although indeed the Emperor neither loves Christ nor cares for His word, he would prefer peace to war; the Frenchman desires nothing but wars. But such a people as we are deserves such princes. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us to turn to Him, so that He may turn to us and bring peace among the princes bearing the name of Christ and then deliver us from the bloody hand of the Turk, from whom we will certainly not be liberated without repentance.</p>
      <p>Here you have an example of the decree against mercenary military service issued by the senate and people of our city. You can share this with friends and especially with your Augsburg consul, a most holy man, but do not let it be widely spread or printed again; the magistrates did not care to have more printed than was needed in the city and countryside, where it will be read in each church on December 3rd. I almost stole one or two copies. Pray to the Lord that He may always confirm our people in the truth and piety, which they seem to diligently seek and care for.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours. December 1st, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Ambrosius Blarer, most esteemed pastor of the church of Constance, his lord and brother.</p>
