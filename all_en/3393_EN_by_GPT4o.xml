      <p>Pinczów, November 4, 1557.</p>
      <p>Greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ forever. I do not doubt, most esteemed lord and dearest friend of all, that you are anxiously and eagerly awaiting joyful news of my safe arrival in Poland. By the grace of the most good and great God, I happily arrived safely and unharmed in Kraków eight days ago and from Kraków to Pinczów. I found Mr. Jan Łaski, a man to be respected in every way and most loving towards you, safe and sound. He received me very kindly on account of your recommendations and diligently pursued my cause with the Duke and the Palatine of Vilnius through letters.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that I will obtain the privilege. Therefore, I will set out directly from here to Vilnius to the Duke himself and the royal majesty in a few days. I find as a travel companion Mr. Wilhelm Marlow, formerly the Bishop of Bath in England, whom Mr. Łaski wishes to join me.</p>
      <p>From Vilnius, I will diligently write to your kindness about what I have achieved. There is no news other than the victory of the King of Poland over the Livonians; however, it can be called a surrender rather than a victory, although they were forced to surrender.</p>
      <p>The conditions of peace are these: The Livonians had accepted that they would pay the war expenses, namely forty thousand gold coins; but the king generously forgave them this. They will provide a certain number of horsemen to the king for military service; the number is not certain, although some think it is four thousand, whenever he needs them. They will send the murderers who killed the king's envoys to the King of Poland.</p>
      <p>If they have taken anything by force or deceit from the Duchy of Lithuania, they will restore it all. These are the conditions of peace.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, since I know your kindness eagerly expects a certain and clear opinion of Melanchthon on the humanity of Christ, I send you this, which Mr. Łaski gave me to transcribe.</p>
      <p>It is extracted from the lectures of the man and dictated, and these are what the Lutherans wanted him to recant at Worms. May the Lord grant grace that he may openly and publicly defend the truth.</p>
      <p>Here in Poland, by the grace of the most good and great God, the truth is taking deeper root. Mr. Łaski confidently teaches the nobility, today he gave a sermon for two hours on the true and genuine understanding of the words of Christ, "this is my body" at the noble's table. He converts many and confirms the true, non-Lutheran opinion.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord that it may be confirmed.</p>
      <p>He has already been with the seventy-year-old prince of Kraków, whom he led to truly confess that the pope is the antichrist and that he cares for nothing but the abuses into which ecclesiastical goods are turned, and the genuine understanding of the Lord's Supper.</p>
      <p>Regarding ecclesiastical goods, that they may be turned to pious uses, they will easily agree, and gradually, as he absorbs the true understanding of the words of Christ, Mr. Łaski hopes.</p>
      <p>Commend both to the Lord in your prayers. For if he could be won over, there is great hope for all of Lesser Poland.</p>
      <p>Farewell well with your entire family.</p>
      <p>Please share these, whatever they may be, with Mr. Johann Wolf, Mr. Sebastian, your family, and the Polish nobility, to whom I send my dutiful greetings. Yours, Burcher.</p>
      <p>I commend my wife to your patronage.</p>
      <p>To the noble, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, my gracious lord in Zürich.</p>
