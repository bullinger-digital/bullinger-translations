      <p>May the Almighty God and eternal Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ preserve you through His Holy Spirit in the true knowledge of His Son, through whom salvation has been restored to us and eternal life reinstated, so that you do not tire in promoting the building of His church. They say opportunity has hair on its forehead, but afterwards it is bald. Since this is the case, I have considered it my duty not to neglect this opportunity of our friendship, which has been offered to me by you, through carelessness, as it would be in vain to seek it again if it were lost. Although I have no doubt about the strength of your steadfast spirit, that you will continue to hold the love you have begun to show towards me, even if I remain silent for a while, it is indeed in my interest to comply with this so kind a fate, so that I may follow you as a faithful Achates. However, it was not my intention, most learned Bullinger, to address you with this light and succinct writing in haste. For I wanted, and still intend, to respond extensively to your letters, which you sent to me through our Lysmaninus, so that you may also know my mind on these questions, and how much it aligns with yours. However, since I could not dispatch this so quickly due to the sudden departure of these messengers, Lysmaninus has forced this writing from me and compelled me, though I was entirely reluctant. Since it contains nothing but greetings, I have decided to end it with greetings as well, excusing the long and tedious omission. Therefore, farewell, most kind Bullinger, and accept me, who embraces your whole heart, into fraternal love and Christian fellowship. And while you are there in peace, help us, who are in turmoil here for the sake of the Gospel, with prayers to the heavenly Father. Live and farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>From Iwanowicze, 18th day of August, in the year 1556. Herr Lysmaninus wants me to write in German as well, which must happen at a more convenient time.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted brother in Christ, Alexander Vitrelinus, minister of the church in Pinczów.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zürich, most esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Polish letters, October 1556.</p>
