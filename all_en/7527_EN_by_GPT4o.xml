      <p>Greetings. What these bring, you will learn from them. The people of Geneva have taken much upon themselves in explaining and organizing these theses; but at the same time, they have also taken much time for themselves; for they stayed there for a whole month. We are amazed that this people cannot be driven to concord by so many calamities and that such a schism arises over such trivial matters; we are amazed that they explain such a small matter with so many twists and theses that never end. Our people from Lausanne had subscribed to the exposition of the Genevans; but since it was dangerous and not without offense to the magistrate, if he could have known, it would have been done, we managed with a suitable reason to extort the writing of the people of Lausanne from them again, and we gave them the common writing in the name of the church of Bern, under which Lausanne is also included, which you will see what it is like. I think no one can blame us for this, and we think you will also use the same caution. Otherwise, I have nothing to write now. Peace in France is proceeding moderately. The king threatens force even to his papists, who do not want to keep it. Meanwhile, neither Cond√© nor Admiral are yet at court. The plague in Geneva is growing stronger and stronger; hence, many are leaving. Today we expect here the son of the Palatine Prince, Christoph.</p>
      <p>Steiger, Diesbach, Gravenried, Manuel, Zehender, and my father-in-law greet you very much; the same does Blasius, my son-in-law, who is here and through whom we conveniently extorted the subscription of the people of Lausanne from these legates again. I pray for blessing and health to all of yours. Your brothers and fellow ministers also greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 13, 1568.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, forever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
