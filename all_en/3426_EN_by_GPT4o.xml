      <p>Grace of the Son of God be with you.</p>
      <p>Our prince, on the fifth of December (after he had spent almost fifteen days with us here and was preparing his journey to Montbéliard), entrusted these letters to you through a messenger who happened to present himself. I forwarded them to our Hospinianus, who is now in Basel and whom I know to be a devotee of your name. We have heard nothing certain about the colloquy, perhaps you know more than we do; our adversaries mockingly call it idle talk. Philipp was for some time in Heidelberg, where he was honorably received by the Elector and the students of its academy, and there he received the sad news that his wife, with whom he had lived pleasantly for many years, had passed away. He returned to Wittenberg with the Elector and with strong and great escort.</p>
      <p>They say new assemblies have been instituted among the people of Ulm, where Ferdinand is to come with the electors. Even now, the Emperor will send envoys there to resign the insignia of the empire, the scepter, and the crown. This will certainly be a seedbed and occasion, unless God averts it with His usual mercy, for many evils among the dissenting bishops and princes. The eternal kindness of the gracious deity must be continually invoked, so that He may preserve His church, which He has sanctified, provided we are penitent and patient. Farewell, most excellent Heinrich, with your family and colleagues, whom you will greet all by name. Riquewihr, December 6, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his lord and dearest brother in Christ. Zürich.</p>
