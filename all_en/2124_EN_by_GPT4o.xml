      <p>Greetings. Since this packet addressed to Mr. Vergerio has been here for two days and the person who brought it from Venice claims it is of some importance, I thought it should be sent to you, so that, if you can in any way, you may ensure it is delivered to Tübingen. I do not involve you in these concerns of my own accord; but while I wish to serve our mutual friend, I am compelled to consider your lesser occupations than I would otherwise do for my own sake.</p>
      <p>It has been written to me that the Genoese have suffered a double defeat, one on land, while they attempt to conquer Florence, and the other at sea with the loss of five galleys in a shipwreck. Farewell. In great haste, Chur, 7 days before the calends of January.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Fraxineus, Bishop of Bayonne. To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, dearest friend.</p>
