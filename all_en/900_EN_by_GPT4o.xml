      <p>Venerable, highly learned, dear sir and friend, I received your letter with great joy and pleasure on the 15th of February, recently appeared, read it and understood its contents. God, our Lord and Savior, knows that such prosperity in religion and matters of the magistrate greatly rejoices me; I wish that I, a simple man, could spend the days of my life in such a community with wife and children, for the sake of an untroubled conscience. I must commend it to the Lord, who knows well how to deliver the captives deprived of their freedom.</p>
      <p>Further, that your reverence has informed me of the lucubrations (writings) published over 24 years, I accept with great thanks (with the expression of my inclined will).</p>
      <p>The commentaries on the New Testament, together with the works of Zwingli translated by Gwalther, I have received from your reverence, praise be to God, further the little book "On the Authority of Scripture and the Church," also the Preface affixed to the Bible; your other works, my most humane Bullinger, are missing to me, for which I am greatly desirous, besides the Homilies of Gwalther, and the lucubrations of other most excellent men, of which your letters make mention. I give and hold to you, most reverend Antistes, my greatest thanks, for having commended me to your own and for the mutual salutations of the most excellent men, who have deigned to honor me, weak as I am, through your letters.</p>
      <p>If it were possible to visit you, it would be a more agreeable journey granted to me, so that I might see a spark of true religion enclosed within me, and might refresh myself with such through friendly conversation in these troubled and dangerous times, in memory of future things, because more dangerous times still await us. My diligent request to you, gracious sir and friend, is that you would greet my special (unknown gentlemen, as mentioned in your missive) most kindly on my behalf, as I might do in person before them. I hope they will accept my gracious will in this way. I wish to have myself always kindly commended to you with the attached request, whether Froschauer might send me the books I lack, as listed above, at whatever value they might be, together with the books of Gessner and other works, and where they might be delivered to me in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>I will strive to deserve all this to the best of my ability. May God preserve your church together with your most vigilant magistrate from the assaults of the Antichrist, unharmed and stable through the anchor of faith, and likewise all of us.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, most beloved Bullinger, and write back, I pray, and consider my hurried letter, written amidst the noise of the court, kindly, I ask. Given in Landshut, May 6, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Anton Simburger, procurator and advocate of the ducal consistory there.</p>
      <p>To the most humane Antistes of the Christian Church in Zurich, my esteemed lord Heinrich Bullinger, to be presented.</p>
