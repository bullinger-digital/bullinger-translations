      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my dearest and most esteemed lord and godfather. Greetings. I wish I could write better and more auspicious things at the beginning of the new year, sweetest lord godfather: but as things stand, I am compelled to write very tragic news. The ministers of Lausanne, as I recently wrote to you, did not come due to Viret's poor health and the severe cold, but excused themselves to the senate through letters. However, in these letters, they again included such things that the senate, newly agitated, wrote to the classis to immediately choose other pastors in place of the ministers of Lausanne.</p>
      <p>The classis, having received this mandate, refused to choose others, but sent a delegation to the senate to plead that nothing harsh be decided about Viret. The Lausanne senate, understanding that Viret would have to resign, sent a delegation here to intercede for him. The senate, somewhat appeased by both delegations, allowed Viret to remain and simultaneously decreed anew that he should have the authority to summon to the consistory, with public authority, anyone he knew to be ignorant, impious, and insolent, and those of a more licentious life, and there instruct and rebuke them at his discretion. The delegates, having successfully accomplished this, returned to Lausanne three days before Christmas.</p>
      <p>On the next day, that is, the day before Christmas, the greater senate of Lausanne convened: the delegates reported what they had achieved. The ministers were also present.</p>
      <p>They, arguing that the time was too short and that it was not possible to summon those they wanted on that day, requested a postponement of the communion to another Sunday, namely the first of January. The Lausanne senate deliberated on this for a long time.</p>
      <p>The matter was debated with great contention throughout that day until midnight, which is called sacred due to the memory of the Lord's nativity, and with such contention that the prefect was forced to descend from the castle into the city. If he had not calmed them with his intervention, they would have almost risen against each other. Finally, when they said they absolutely did not want to administer the communion, they agreed to postpone it until the first of January. Thus, on the usual day of the Lord's nativity, they had no communion in the church of Lausanne.</p>
      <p>The prefect immediately wrote everything to our senate. Our people, newly exacerbated, immediately sent a messenger to the people of Lausanne by fast horses, forbidding them to celebrate the communion on the day they had set, under the penalty of losing all privileges, until something else was communicated to them by the greater senate, which they call the diacosiorum. After this messenger was sent, on December 30th, the whole matter was referred to the diacosiorum.</p>
      <p>They, almost furious, decreed that delegates should be sent there from the ministers, senators, and diacosiorum to 1. remove Viret and his colleagues from their offices, as had been previously decreed, 2. severely remonstrate with the Lausanne senate for daring to change the appointed day of communion, which is observed everywhere in our churches, without the authority of this senate, which had established it, 3. summon the classis and together with it choose others; 4. imprison those refusing to choose, and refer their case here. This was decreed on the day I mentioned.</p>
      <p>The delegates were finally appointed yesterday, namely January 4th. From the senators, Mr. Claudius a Madiis, from the diacosiorum, Mr. Simon Wurstenberger, the former prefect of Moudon.</p>
      <p>From the ministers, myself.</p>
      <p>You cannot be unaware of how burdensome this is for me.</p>
      <p>Today, with the other brothers, I asked the senate not to involve us in this tragedy, for it is not our duty to carry out and execute what has been decreed, nor do we see what our presence would achieve, except for our disgrace and greater disturbance of affairs.</p>
      <p>We are grieved by such an outcome.</p>
      <p>If we could intercede in any way, we would prefer to do so, etc.</p>
      <p>The senate replied that this was decreed in the presence of the diacosiorum and could not be changed except in their presence again. Therefore, they have arranged for us to meet with the diacosiorum tomorrow.</p>
      <p>We are preparing for that.</p>
      <p>We do not know what the outcome will be.</p>
      <p>You see the situation we are in and how much these troublesome people, with their actions, cause us offense and desolation, who nevertheless seem to think they alone are wise and Christian teachers. The whole matter was again in a calm harbor, and they had obtained more than ever before, if only they could have used it conveniently and not omitted that solemn day. Many suspect they wanted to do this in imitation of the Geneva church to gain greater favor with it. For it does not observe the memory of the Lord's nativity but exercises the solemnity of communion on the first of January. The matter has now come to the point where I see no remedy, nor does that gouty hand allow for a cure. These churches will suffer a severe rupture.</p>
      <p>We hear that the whole classis has conspired not to choose anyone, and if one of them has to leave, they all want to leave. Therefore, pray to the Lord for us and for these churches.</p>
      <p>I write this to you hastily and tumultuously through Mr. Crispin Fischer, who is again setting out for Baden for that Basel matter, about which you recently wrote to me. I have shared with him what you wrote.</p>
      <p>He promises his assistance and sends his regards to you in return. I understand from him that it would not be unwelcome if you were to write to him sometime.</p>
      <p>I only learned late that he would be leaving tomorrow. Therefore, take kindly what I write with a rather disturbed mind.</p>
      <p>As for the English, I have discussed what you wrote with Mr. Consul Negelin, Treasurer Tillger, and Steiger, and also with others, who are pleased with your advice to send congratulatory letters to the queen. Negelin has promised to propose this to the senate, but has not yet done so.</p>
      <p>Today I reminded him again; he sees that it would be useful to many if, with greater authority, the four evangelical cities did this together in one writing, and they would like your people to write about this to ours and also to the other cities, and they think there would be no difficulty here.</p>
      <p>You can therefore do what seems best to you.</p>
      <p>Hieronymus Bolsec, a doctor, whom the Genevans once imprisoned for contradicting predestination, has been with us again these days and is nurturing some unknown monstrosities. He threatens to bring the support of other churches to arm himself against Calvin: for we did not want to engage in any action with him. Therefore, I warn you to be cautious if he comes to you: he is a slippery man, of an arrogant and contentious nature, as we have learned from many of his actions so far. He is solely intent on avenging himself on Calvin.</p>
      <p>Although perhaps Calvin is also excessive towards him, everywhere proclaiming him a heretic. With the Genevans, a legal case will be held on the 22nd of this month in Moudon, concerning the pandects. I fear it will not turn out well.</p>
      <p>Before Christmas, one of the pandects killed a man from Geneva not far from the city. The perpetrator was captured and sentenced by the bailiff of Ternier.</p>
      <p>But when the sentence was sent (as usual), the pandects managed to have the sentence suspended, and a new trial was undertaken, in which the perpetrator dared to excuse himself, claiming he had to defend himself from being killed.</p>
      <p>Many other disturbances are also brewing daily between the two cities. May God turn it all to good.</p>
      <p>To my brother, I send the heads of the Geneva covenant. These are the things I had, which I would rather pour out than write.</p>
      <p>Therefore, take it kindly.</p>
      <p>I pray for a most prosperous and happy year for you and all yours.</p>
      <p>In Bern, January 5, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your I. H.</p>
