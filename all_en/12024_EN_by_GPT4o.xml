    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends Dr. theol. Albert Hardenberg, who stayed with him for three months with the consent of the [Arch-]Bishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied], during which he proved himself worthy of the praise of Philipp [Melanchthon]; Bullinger should encourage him; he is being called to high positions. As feared, various writings of the Zurichers and especially the renewal of the Lord's Supper controversy through their publication of Zwingli's works have so provoked Luther that great harm threatens the churches; the opponents will gladly seize upon the mutual accusations, but not what both sides rightly teach about Christ; they must answer to God for their mutual disdain, which offends His majesty. Wishes his admonition to be understood as a service of love and assures him of his esteem. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Dearest Bullinger, this theologian Dr. Albert Hardenberg wished to visit your church before returning to his certain vocation. He stayed with me for three months with the consent of the Archbishop of Cologne and proved himself to be as Dr. Philipp Melanchthon had previously proclaimed, that is, a man very learned, solidly pious, and most sincere. I must bear this testimony to him. Your charity will undoubtedly receive and treat him in such a way that he will be confirmed in faith and zeal for Christ. He is being called to distinguished functions.</p>
      <p>It has finally happened, my brother, what I feared: With all your public and private writings and efforts to renew the sacramental controversy through the books of Zwingli, Luther has been provoked and inflamed, which gravely endangers many distinguished churches and eminent men. Oh, if only you both would engage in the battles that many of us endure with the papists, you would not so readily provide them with the weapons of this internal strife!</p>
      <p>There are so many writings on both sides, from which anyone could have been sufficiently taught about this cause, even if this most severe battle had not been renewed. You will write and speak again, by which you will both be gravely slandered and defamed. You will find more who believe both sides than those who believe one, not in what you both rightly teach about Christ, but in what you accuse each other of evil. Such is the fate of this time. The Lord will be with us who seek peace; but we cannot avoid being burned by such a nearby flame. I ask and pray to Christ the Lord that He may always grant you both to think that you must give an account for every word and writing and that it cannot be considered anything but a crime against His offended majesty when you judge so freely - I say moderately - about each other's minds.</p>
      <p>I beseech you by Christ, take kindly what I advise you. I love and respect the gifts of God in you; therefore, I cannot and should not omit those duties of love towards you, which I would truly wish to be shown to me by you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, September 9.</p>
      <p>Greet the most excellent, learned, and religious men Dr. Bibliander, Pellican, Otto, and others, to whom my greeting is not unwelcome.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
