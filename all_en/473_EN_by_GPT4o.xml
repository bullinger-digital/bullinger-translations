      <p>Worthy and gracious lord, I hope we will soon know how things stand with the Emperor or where he intends to go. He has written to his commanders, and captains, as well as soldiers, are expected to soon receive orders and money. It is indeed believed that the Roman King has attacked Duke Maurice of Saxony and is taking over his mountain towns. He has hurriedly ridden home from the Prince of Spain to Heidelberg. The Prince is next heading to Trier to join the Emperor. That a council and citizens have decided not to ally with anyone has deeply shocked me; for when one has to fear an attack from the Emperor, especially since he is so powerful, one should rather quickly form alliances and cover oneself with good support.</p>
      <p>Instead, they are taking the opposite approach, as if they do not want to defend themselves. I fear we will also have unrest and punishment in these lands. It is happening just as it did with us in the Empire, where we could not fully form the alliance, and when the Emperor became aware of it, he attacked and completely destroyed it. May the Almighty have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>To speak frankly, you will not achieve such power alone, unless God performs a miracle, and when the Emperor realizes that you do not want to form an alliance with the King, you will certainly give him cause to wage war against you and thus be the initiators and causes of the war. May God bring better. It should be ensured in the capitulation that one is prepared for war and attacks, so that one does not have to rely on people, and the King would be willing, in case of your need, to send you people and money.</p>
      <p>I also believe and have understood a little that the King will allow Milan and Genoa to be taken by the Confederates if they desire it. Therefore, it is ill-advised not to send anyone today; one should send and point out the deficiencies, so that you are not suspected and considered the cause of the separation. You have seen, unfortunately (though I say this in confidence), what happened to many clergy in Constance. Had they accepted help from the King, many honorable men would not have been placed in such great misery and distress. Trust in God and do not forget the fist, sword, and human help. We have enough examples from us poor Swabians. I write to you as one troubled at heart and for the common good, asking not to take it amiss.</p>
      <p>I thank you most sincerely for your honorable offer and express my friendly thanks for the book, which I will read and observe on your behalf. May the Lord God keep us in His protection, amen. I unfortunately see a terrible fear among us; I fear your decision of the great council will also push others away.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, March 21, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your willing Sebastian Schertlin, knight, wrote this.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in ZÃ¼rich, etc., my gracious lord and friend.</p>
