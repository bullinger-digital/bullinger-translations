      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote about what happened in Augsburg. I doubt whether you have received it; I had entrusted it to Felix Lindiner from Zürich, who promised to go there directly; but a few days later, I found him here again. He said he had met someone else to whom he had handed it over to be delivered to you; therefore, write whether you have received it. In the meantime, we have received nothing more.</p>
      <p>Mecardus has not yet written anything to us, which we find very surprising. It is said that the King is in Metz, attacking the Mauritians and besieging Ulm, which adheres to the Imperial side, that the Württembergers have taken Asperg by force and slaughtered the Emperor's garrison, that the Emperor is leading large Italian forces through the Adige Valley into Germany, etc. But all these things are uncertain and spread without credibility; I do not doubt that you have something to share with us as well. Oh, how necessary are now the most frequent and fervent prayers to the Lord; for apart from ultimate destruction, I see nothing to hope for with that cause failing. I greatly fear the Emperor's schemes and the treachery of the Germans; I even seem to see what will happen, even if our side wins: there will be great dissolution and corruption both in religion and in other matters, unless the Lord graciously looks upon and moderates everything Himself.</p>
      <p>Here, our people are resting for now. Negelinus has entered a new consulship; 3 new senators have also been elected, one of whom is Beatus Jodocus von Mülinen, Negelinus's son-in-law, a popular and factious man, who, unable to be promoted in the noble tribe, turned to the craftsmen, whose tribe is the largest here and has many foot soldiers; with their help, he rose to this height.</p>
      <p>I write this so that our compatriots may be better known to you, should there ever be anything to be done with them. The other two are good men, as our age produces them.</p>
      <p>Musculus is meditating on nothing but Augsburg and is anxiously waiting to know what is happening. I keep pulling him back as much as I can; for the state of Augsburg will now be very different from what it was before. I hear that common letters are to be written to the princes on behalf of the people of Rottweil; we will wait to see what response they give.</p>
      <p>There is nothing about Fuchsberger, as they were saying he was killed. However, all those who come here from Piedmont testify that the Swiss soldiers are killing and wounding each other daily and, having no other enemy, are turning against each other.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Viret about distributing the French copies of "On the Perfection of Christians"; but although he replied to those letters, he has not yet responded to this point; therefore, I will remind him again. I would sincerely like to wash with you in Urdorf; but the visitations of our classes, which will take place this May, will prevent me. I commend to you the young man who came to you these days, Caspar Linder; he was sent in place of Valentin Ampelander; he is my cousin, and for that reason, I hope he will be more commendable to you.</p>
      <p>I also wrote to Ammianus for him, then to the provost, whose wife the schoolmaster sends a crown, so that she may be more benevolent in receiving and supporting our compatriots. I wanted to write to you again in haste, so as not to neglect any opportunity to reply. May all our people be well and greet you and yours, whom you will also greet in my name. Bern, April 22, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and faithful servant of Christ and the church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his venerable lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
