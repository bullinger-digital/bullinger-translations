    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Biel have received the letter concerning Beat Steinegger from the [Zurich] schoolmaster [Johann Jakob Ammann] and the administrator [Heinrich NÃ¼scheler] and have learned of Steinegger's laziness and negligence; they did not expect this from him. The [Zurichers], who have invested much effort and diligence in him, are not to blame for this. - Since they do not need Steinegger at the moment, they ask the Zurichers to help him find a livelihood, perhaps by providing [a parish position]. If that is not possible, they should send him back [to Biel].</p>

      <p>Our friendly greetings, willing service, and whatever we can offer in honor, love, and goodness, first of all.</p>
      <p>To the highly renowned, well-learned, especially dear lords and good friends, we have received a letter from the schoolmaster and administrator of the schools with you, concerning Beat Steinegger, and have understood from it how the mentioned Steinegger behaves so lazily, indulgently, and sluggishly in his studies, and despite numerous true warnings and admonitions, has conducted and shown himself so negligently and disobediently. We truly bear no small burden from this, as we had not expected this from him. For a good beginning can achieve or effect little or nothing useful unless it is completed with a fruitful, praiseworthy end. We also know and can well appreciate what great diligence, effort, and work you have borne on his behalf, and that all that has been useful and beneficial to Christian teaching has not been in vain with you. For this, we express our highest thanks to you, with the assurance that we are always friendly and willing to acknowledge such according to our ability.</p>
      <p>Therefore, our friendly request to you is that you always do your best, and wherever you might find it necessary to employ the mentioned Steinegger, where he might be able to accomplish something, whether in the city or the countryside, so that he might earn his livelihood, we would gladly grant and allow him to come to you; if that is not possible (since you currently do not know how to employ him), then please send him back to us immediately; as then we will otherwise look (see) where we might place (accommodate) him. We do not wish to withhold this entirely friendly and good intention from you; for wherever we can otherwise show you service, honor, love, and goodness, we are always ready and inclined.</p>
      <p>Dated Wednesday after Pentecost, in the year 1545. The mayor and council of the city of Biel.</p>
      <p>To the highly renowned, well-learned, and honorable master Heinrich Bullinger and other servants of the word of God, also schoolmaster and administrator of the schools in Zurich, our especially favorable, dear lords and good friends altogether.</p>
