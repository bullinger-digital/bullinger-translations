    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Erb encountered the young [Johannes Jud], who was in Riquewihr two years ago and now, during the grape harvest, came accompanied by the schoolmaster [Laurentius Montanus] from Mulhouse. He is talented and will likely be of use to the church one day.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Regarding the current situation: Physically, everyone is well, but as for the spirit, only the Lord knows how much one has to bear the present cross, especially as the [Catholic] neighbors threaten. However, nothing should be made of the plans of the barely so-called Emperor [Charles V] and his followers! God is on our side; He will protect and avenge us!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The day before yesterday [came] a letter from the Count [George of Württemberg-Mömpelgard]: The Emperor had moved at night from his entrenchment [near Marxheim] towards Nördlingen, but had barely made progress. The Schmalkaldic League is not as lively as the treacherous Spaniards, but they promptly set up in battle formation near Nördlingen. The cunning Emperor, however, sneaked back through the forest to his usual entrenchment near Donauwörth. Everyone fears for the future.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Perhaps Bullinger has heard of the treacherous attack on Sebastian Schertlin. Thank God he survived the assassination! There are other reports, but they are not confirmed. More on this on another occasion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings and a request for prayer.</p>

      <p>Grace of the Lord be with you. The boy who was with us two years ago, brought by our schoolmaster from Mulhouse, visited me during this grape harvest. I did not want him to return to you without a letter. In my judgment, he is of the happiest talent, likely to be of use to the churches one day, unless he disappoints everyone's expectations. I would like to commend him to you (as you yourself do).</p>

      <p>Regarding our affairs: We are indeed still well in body; however, as for the spirit, the Lord knows how much one is offended by the present cross, especially as many neighbors threaten greatly. We, however, make nothing of their threats and the unjust plans of the Emperor (if he is to be called Emperor). If God is with us, who can be against us? The Lord is the protector of our life; from whom should we fear? The hairs of our head are numbered. We are certainly afflicted with many insults, attacked with greater reproaches, but the Lord will one day be our vengeance, etc.</p>

      <p>The day before yesterday, our prince wrote this from the camp: The Emperor moved at night from his fortification in the manner of Callipides towards Nördlingen, and that with Spanish tricks. However, our men, who, although not as agile as those treacherous Spaniards, eagerly wished to engage in battle near Nördlingen with their forces arranged. But that cunning one, wandering through the densest forest hiding places, finally returned to his accustomed cave, not far from Donauwörth. Everyone anxiously awaits what will happen, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You may have heard about Sebastian Schertlin, how he was attacked by the swords of some traitors, etc., but by the grace of God, he was saved. Many other things are reported, but they are uncertain. Perhaps more another time, when there is leisure.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell, therefore, most upright man in the Lord, and pray to the Lord continually for us, etc. Hastily, in Riquewihr by the lamp on the 14th day of October 1546. Yours, Erbius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zurichers, etc. Zurich.</p>
