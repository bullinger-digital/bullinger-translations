      <p>S. After a long wait, I finally received your three letters: the first sent by our Samuel Telamon on February 16, the second from Baden on the 23rd of the same month through our envoys, and the third on the 24th of the said month through Roset from Geneva. As for the first, I begin by giving you immense thanks for your good will towards us; I also ask you to forgive me for having poured out my thoughts to you more importunately. This was done with no ill intent. I truly praise the honorable intention of your daughter and pray to the Lord to confirm her in it and grant you to live together as long and as holily as possible.</p>
      <p>Regarding my illness, it has never treated me more mildly than this time; if only it would finally leave me completely! I am very concerned about you, especially since I have experienced how painful those urinary and stone pains are; however, after the gout erupted, they almost completely left me. The bath in Bachbombelen, boiled with herbs, has done me particularly well, and I abstain from raw and strong wine, using only moderate and well-refined wine; as soon as I transgress this, I feel something in my kidneys. I also abstain, as much as I can, from cheese and dairy products. Meanwhile, I have encountered another enemy, which I bear more easily than the other, except that this one keeps me at home longer; the other tormented me more violently. In all things, however, I praise the Lord, who deals with me mercifully and would not do this unless He knew it would benefit me. Regarding the Turkish campaign, I have understood well from Baden what my lords intend; I know no one who is in favor of it, may God grant what will be decided by yours. Here, in recent times, the old campaign has been renewed in the city and country, and what was lacking has been replaced, but because of the Genevans, so that through the clamor of the campaign, the opposition, which was somewhat present (as reported), would be put to shame, as has also happened. Your consideration and advice to a good friend of the nobility, which you sent me, I have let some of my lords read, who were very pleased with it, and hereby send it back to you and thank you most highly for it, as well as for the news from Vienna, Augsburg, and the Pünten. In the other letter, which was held up for quite a while in Baden, your two booklets to me and one to brother-in-law Tilman were included, for which we thank you most highly. I read them with great eagerness, and I am very pleased with the brevity and simplicity; if only many would read them and we could learn from one to agree and live in simple truth here, and from the other to prepare ourselves for future glorification! I pray to the Lord to grant you a very long life so that you can continue to serve the church with your labors for a long time. Regarding the admiral's letters, this brings me new concerns, as I hear the king will again seek an alliance; we will have new negotiations there, and I fear that if the admiral urges this, it cannot be prevented among ours, as many of the magnates have long sought nothing but such an alliance, which has the appearance of good, under which, however, both servitude and foreign wars and the destruction of many and all corruption and that old mercenary or pensioner devil lie hidden. He now seems to have become evangelical and transformed into an angel of light. The impious, obstinate, confident in their own affairs, will seem to be fools and idiots who dare to speak or think otherwise. I fear greatly, therefore, that if ours are solicited, they will mostly agree, although I also know how displeasing it will be to many good men throughout the city and countryside. Until now, everyone has always said that the gospel cannot be promoted by arms; the Lord has clearly demonstrated this to us in Germany and France. Now these will again affirm the opposite, that our affairs are to be strengthened by this reasoning, thus promoting the truth, thus expanding the borders of the kingdom of Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>In summary, one will manage to achieve much here, I do not know how it is with you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Nîmes synod, I am greatly displeased, to speak frankly, with the canonizing, dogmatizing; I fear nothing good will come of it and it will go as it has from old times, that we will soon have to have a new canon law, and every day something will be set and newly devised. Soon they will come against each other, condemn each other, as has also happened in earlier times, as church histories testify. If they taught and built the church simply, I think it would bring much more. Moreover, it will be a strange condemnation and exclusion, as it is now with the Ganeo or Ganeso, who was a minister in Geneva (I do not know if you know the story), raised in Geneva and came into great esteem there because of his skill in teaching. He left Geneva because he opposed the authorities somewhat more vehemently against their exchange bank, which they set up there, and because of private disputes that arose between him and Beza. He has now stayed for a while in Lyon. The elders of that church have sent to him and admonished him to reconcile with the church in Geneva, or they cannot tolerate him. He has appealed to a synod, which was held in the same region; there he was excluded and excommunicated by the synod until he reconciles with Geneva. He has humbled himself and written to Beza, asking him to help him with a safe conduct to Geneva and back; so he will promise to reconcile. However, they were willing to give him the safe conduct there, but not back; indeed, they reckon that he acknowledges his wrong, since he also asks for safe conduct from there. Now he is a learned, well-bred man, and it is said he will find his following in France and may do great harm if he, out of bitterness, turns to the bad side. If people are handled in this way, what will come of it? What kind of discipline, excommunication, indeed tyranny, is this? For otherwise, neither in teaching nor in life, as far as I hear, can anything be drawn against him. Thus they will also do to our Coladonio, whom they accuse of having written much against Beza and the city of Geneva in France. We have warned him beforehand; for it would not be overlooked by him. I have digressed into this on the occasion of the Nîmes synod; forgive me if I have been longer than necessary. I wish to hear your advice. People here will not like to get involved much; yet I thought you have many students, as do we, who wander there. How would it be if you sent one and we sent one or each church sent two, who are more learned and of some judgment; they could be helped with sustenance and let go there as for themselves, not that they take up any matters, but only see, hear, make acquaintance with some learned people. They could learn as much as if they were sent elsewhere for half a year.</p>
      <p>I have not yet told anyone about this; it would not need much noise; yet I want to hear your opinion first.</p>
      <p>I now come to your third letter, which you sent through Mr. Roset. Attached to it were three bound booklets pertaining to both treasurers and Hagenberg, which I sent to them, who thank you greatly. In these, you write about the Saxon agreement and your judgment on it and write at the same time various things from which I cannot quite extricate myself. For you write that you promised to send them to me, but in the meantime, Pellizarios passed through there, to whom you handed over both the letters and the judgment; you then add: "Send it back to me safely; for I think it is enough for you if you read it once," etc. But how can I send it back when I have not received it, but you sent it to Geneva? You will explain this to me and at the same time, if possible (I have also written this to my brother), ensure that we can see both this agreement (for no copy of it has yet come to us) and your judgment and, if possible, the Jena adversary's writing. My brother will buy me copies, provided they can be found.</p>
      <p>Roset also had with him a certain writing in your hand about certain matters, especially Bavarian, which he nevertheless took with him to Geneva.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I received letters from Sulcer, who has not written to me for two or three years; among other things, he writes: "From Germany, I have received absolutely nothing, except that in some places the plague reigns; in others, the difficulty of provisions increases, while elsewhere the most impious dregs of the Jesuits are spreading in the churches, as in the Austrian duchy, which Charles, the emperor's brother, presides over, evidently because the unfortunate and incestuous Bavarian marriage produces these fruits, just as the same Bavarian, under the pretext of the guardianship of the orphan Philibert, the son of the marquis slain in France, also devastates churches in part of the margraviate of Baden, having expelled pious teachers and introduced nefarious corrupters of piety." These are those things.</p>
      <p>Thus they collapse there, also through Sulcer's work. I add the last about our Telamon, about whom you write that you hear he suffers something because of the economy he managed, and you wish to know the truth of the matter from me. But I can write nothing, as I have not been involved in his accounts nor do I willingly inquire into others' affairs. However, I know from one side that he has been ill-spoken of among the Bruges people and other neighbors because of his frugality, which they themselves told me when I was bathing in Baden and later when I was in Bruges, how something is continually deducted from the poor, etc. I freely admonished him about these things in the presence of the Bruges minister. He excused himself, saying that whatever he does, he is forced to do by the order of the magistrate. I, having returned home, also admonished the consul about this matter, that they should not show themselves harsher to the poor in this hard time, as clemency and liberality should now be especially exercised towards them.</p>
      <p>The matter later came to the usual accounts. There, some complained about him in completely different ways, that he is too extravagant, that he exercises his liberality there as if he were some prince towards everyone. He excused himself, objected to the various complaints of the neighbors, and how in his economy, besides the many buildings he erected there and beautifully, as you yourself saw, he contributed more to the treasury than any of his predecessors. However, all these things could not help so much as that he was removed from the economy, in which he had nevertheless completed six years. Later, when he had to move, he was also honored and treated more sparingly than any of his predecessors ever; his wife was also treated more indignantly because she had arranged for some linen to be transported home before it was seen or allowed by the examiners sent. However, the whole matter is settled, and he is held in honor and esteem, and, as I hope, will be elected again to the senate at the next Easter.</p>
      <p>Thus you see I have been quite lengthy once; I pray that you consider it kindly and do not cease to embrace me with your old love as your most loving one. The consuls, treasurers, Hagenberg, Wytenbach Joshua, father-in-law, all friends and brothers, especially my wife, greet you. The Zehenders are doing well, as are the Frischings; however, since they have little commerce with me, especially the latter, they therefore mention you less frequently.</p>
      <p>Ludwig Zehender acts as prefect in Interlaken and rarely comes here; not so long ago, however, he visited me and asked me to write greetings to you in my next letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, the last day of February 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours as always, Johannes Haller.</p>
