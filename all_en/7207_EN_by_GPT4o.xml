      <p>Since Mr. Zanchi himself is setting out to visit you, most illustrious and revered father, I could not let him depart without burdening him with my own letters as well. You will understand the reason for Mr. Zanchi's journey from him directly. I fear that he may be torn away from our bosom and embrace, although we will move every stone to retain him. The place Morbegno is full of dangers, perhaps, etc., and this is because of the monks, for whom it would be very easy to remove an adversary of the kingdom of the Antichrist by poison, unless he were defended by the singular grace and protection of God. I know that our most honorable magistrate will be easy and prompt in retaining Mr. Zanchi; I would hope for nothing but the best from the Ten Jurisdictions; I only doubt the Upper League and the Clavenna craftsmen. May the Lord Jesus not disdain to provide us with His protection.</p>
      <p>Mr. Herter wrote to me that Mr. Brunner, my old colleague, has been dismissed by the Elector Palatine, for some reason unknown to me, yet not dishonorable, and if Davos were still vacant, he would direct his course straight to us; now he is wandering among the Bernese. Today, however, to some neighboring brothers who had gathered here for certain reasons, I described this man to them; they affirmed for certain that Maienfeld would be vacant. If Mr. Brunner were without a position and did not bear a mind alien to our republic nor refused to live in Maienfeld under the same conditions as the others, he would be most welcome to us all as a learned and pious man, of which type our region is plainly devoid. The stipend is above 100 gold coins.</p>
      <p>[...] who today joined us for an honorary lunch with Mr. Zanchi, where we cheerfully dined on excellent fish given as a gift to the magistrate.</p>
      <p>Chur, August 25, 1567.</p>
