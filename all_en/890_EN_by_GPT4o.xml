      <p>Grace and peace through the Lord. As for how things stand with us in our League, I have informed you that the matter has been set for the middle of May.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Milanese are sending a delegation with great promises for the communities in our League; this is quite contrary to some. I think it will serve to make all the lords go idle, etc. Also, on the 24th of April, our bishop was summoned to Rome and is being accused there as a Lutheran bishop; therefore, he is not worthy to be a papal bishop, etc.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new from Italy. Dr. Vergerius is doing quite well in Vespera, etc. When I handed over your Decade to the bishop, I offered to have it bound; he replied that he wanted to read it once, then return it to me so that I could have it bound at his expense. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Comander and the other excellent men send you many greetings. Hastily, Chur, 26th of April, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Blasius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the most ample church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
