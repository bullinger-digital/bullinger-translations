      <p>Many greetings, most learned and dearest lord in Christ.</p>
      <p>Mr. Abel, an English merchant, wrote to us these days from Strasbourg; in his letters to us, there were others contained for you, for Mr. Simler, Gwalter, and Gesner, written from England.</p>
      <p>If they have reached you, I wish our letters in which they were contained to be sent here to us. If they have not reached you, I did not want you to be unaware of it: for we have already understood this from other letters of Abel written to us. Those letters, as far as I understand, were destined for you from England in March, and were sent to us in April; and now in May, we understand they have not been delivered. I also wrote to Mr. Fre[n]sham there with you on April 23; and I do not know if those letters have been delivered to him. And I am very eager to know about his health.</p>
      <p>Your excellence will deign to remind him of this matter, and at the same time to support his weakness, as much as you can, if he is in any distress. I am laboring here with all my might, and almost beyond my strength, in collecting the histories of the martyrs. In which matter, if you can, I would like you to assist us.</p>
      <p>You can, however, if you deal with Mr. Bernardino and the other Italians there, so that if they have any brief notes of such matters from Italy, they may be willing to share; then, if your memory also holds anything about events in your vicinity, you might be willing to record at least the names and towns in a few words. For although we are mainly working on British matters, we will not overlook the sacred histories of other nations, if they come to us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus direct your health, studies, and labors to His glory! Basel, the day before Pentecost, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, John Foxe.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic among the people of Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
