    <p xml:id="regest1">Missing in the directory of works intended for inclusion in the complete Latin edition of Zwingli's works are the letters printed in Basel [1536]; suggests also including the records of the Bern Disputation [of 1528], and inquires whether Zwingli's letter to [Andreas] Osiander [the Elder] [from May 6, 1527] will be reprinted. Basel [mercenaries] swim across the Rhine at night to bypass the guards; three captains who temporarily disappeared are now staying in Dornach and were unsuccessfully summoned back by the council; over 1000 disobedient Baslers are said to have fled from the city and countryside, and what the Zurichers will do can be inferred from the rumors; the mercenaries are returning because the way to the French [King Francis I] is blocked. Bullinger will have heard about the attack on the Nuremberg envoy [Hieronymus Baumg√§rtner] on his way home from the Diet of Speyer; Gast knows nothing about the perpetrators. A messenger from Wittenberg, who was in Breslau on Ascension Day [May 22], knew nothing about the arrival of the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I]. Greetings.</p>

      <p> Greetings. I received the catalog of Zwingli's books, but I do not find the letters printed in Basel there; will you not add them to such a holy work? What if you also added what the pious man debated in the Bern Disputation? Certainly, many excellent sayings and serious opinions can be found there. What if the entire Bern Disputation were added to those volumes? In my judgment, it would be an excellent thing, useful to the church and serving for edification. Are you not going to add the letter written to Osiander? Our people are completely mad against the will of the magistrates, against their oath: they swim across the Rhine River at night, even though there is a guard at all the gates to prevent them from leaving. Three captains from the citizens have been hiding in corners for a long time, but have now finally emerged; they are in the village of Dornach. Our senate sent letters to them and recalled them all, but in vain; they would rather go to meet the devil. Everything points to our eventual ruin, as there is no obedience at all, no fear of God. Seditions are spreading everywhere; they say more than 1000 have fled both from the city and our countryside. I can almost sense from the common rumor what your people in Zurich will do. The mercenaries are returning to us because they have no access to reach the French; all places are guarded, they cannot approach him. Thus, he spends a huge sum of money. </p>
      <p> You undoubtedly know that the Nuremberg envoy was captured while returning from the Diet of Speyer, one servant was killed and left half-dead, a boy was wounded, whom the horsemen took away with the envoy. I could not find out who they are. This is how public faith and imperial protection are maintained! A notary from Wittenberg was with us these days, who had not heard a word about the arrival of the Turks when he was at home; he said he was in Breslau on Ascension Day. </p>
      <p> Farewell in the Lord. June 25, 1544. </p>
      <p> You will greet Theodor and Gwalther with Frisius in my name. Yours, Gastius. </p>
      <p> To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, etc. In Zurich. </p>
