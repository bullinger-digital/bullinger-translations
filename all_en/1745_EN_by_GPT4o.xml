      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Due to more pressing matters, I was unable to respond to your recent letter, most esteemed Bullinger, for which I hope to obtain your pardon without delay. I could not in any way find the books you wrote to me about at that time among our people, and I think they are scarcely available in print.</p>
      <p>I am returning the letters to Maurus, the envoy of the French; for at the hour when your Theodore, a most distinguished man, entered our city, he peacefully passed away in the Lord after a long illness. The Lord also called from this world's misery our Myconius, the most vigilant pastor of the Basel church, who has already taken around two thousand people with his visitation and fatherly chastisement due to that dreadful plague, which seizes many everywhere.</p>
      <p>I have entrusted your letters to the envoy of the King of England to Michael Diller, a man most renowned in every field of knowledge and languages, who, called by Otto Henry, the most illustrious prince, from the Basel region to the ministry of the church, will diligently take care of them on his way to Heidelberg. I will soon send what you wrote to Erbio with a certain and safe messenger. What you write about the Turkish disaster is, alas, true; for it is reported that the Turk, fighting successfully against the Christians on September 29, killed more than fifteen thousand people. The Emperor is still around Lauterburg, Landau, and Neuburg, and few know where he will finally go. The Margrave of Brandenburg has occupied Hermelstein, the most fortified castle in the Trier bishopric, to impede the Emperor's passage through the Rhine; however, it is said that he is now advancing to prevent supplies from Alsace and Sundgau from reaching the Emperor.</p>
      <p>I have not yet heard what the French are doing. You will learn the rest, which uncertain rumors spread among us, from your Theodore, a most distinguished man, whom you will have as the equivalent of a very long letter. Farewell with your whole family and church. Basel, October 17, 1552. Lord Marcus Bersius and others send their regards to you.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Konrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
