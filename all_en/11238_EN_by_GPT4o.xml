    <p xml:id="regest1">Since the Emperor is not willing to yield in the case of the city of Minden, there will likely be war; yet Christ will ultimately triumph with His own. Recommends the people of Geneva, who are advocating for the [Waldensians] in Piedmont; should the other cities take any action with King [Francis I], Basel would certainly not hold back.

      <p>The grace of God and my friendly, willing service beforehand, dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>As for the situation with the city of Minden in Westphalia, you undoubtedly have good information. They will not be left alone. The Emperor is determined not to yield. Therefore, we expect nothing other than war. One will always watch the other; in the end, our house will also burn. The Lord allows Himself to be seen in many places with severe trials; however, the world cannot take the best part from us. The Lord Christ will ultimately triumph with His own and remain king forever.</p>
      <p>The brothers from Geneva will inform you about the pious Christians from Piedmont. They, along with others who love the Lord, wish to be commended. They are indeed our brothers. We are truly obliged before the Lord to help them where we can. We should fulfill our duty, which we have received from God. If He then decides otherwise, His will be done; thus, we are excused before Him. If other Swiss Confederates of the Christian cities do something against the king, I hope no lack will be found with my lords. We want to consider these matters seriously, as you undoubtedly are inclined to do. It cannot be delayed until the last emergency arises. For our adversary does not sleep. May the Lord show His mercy with us. Amen. It is truly necessary for us to pray earnestly.</p>
      <p>I hereby commend you earnestly to the Lord. May He keep you and your fellow workers in the word of the Lord in His grace, whom you shall all greet from me, along with Mr. Lavater and Mayor RÃ¶schen.</p>
      <p>From Basel, the first of November, in the year 1538. Yours, Jacob Meyer.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant in the word of the Lord of the Christian church in Zurich, my dear lord and friend.</p>
