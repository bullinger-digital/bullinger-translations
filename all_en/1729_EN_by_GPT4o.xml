      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, I have received letters from Italy from Lelio, whom I expect daily. He asks me to send you a packet, which you will see attached, and he sends you many greetings. I am sending an Italian booklet published by me and printed in central Italy, in which there is an opportune mention of Bibliander. When I come, I will bring more copies. Farewell and greetings to you with your whole family, school, and church. May the Lord bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, the day before Michaelmas 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my honorable brother.</p>
