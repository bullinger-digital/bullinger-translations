      <p>S. He delivered your letters to me here. However, I have nothing new to report other than what I wrote before, which I believe you have already received, regarding the mournful state of France. We continue to receive even sadder news. It is reported (but how reliable this is, I do not wish to affirm) that the king, with only 12 horsemen, has escaped the hands of Cond√© and the admiral and has come to Paris. What is being done by those remaining, we still do not know. The cause of this war is interpreted differently by different people; some blame our side, as I wrote recently; others say that the king has, by public proclamation, revoked the edict of peace and ordered all evangelicals to leave the kingdom within 12 days; hence these disturbances arise. Many poor, naked, and needy people are fleeing to Geneva. It is surprising that the Duke of Savoy allows them passage. The situation in Lyon is miserable. It is also said that a large force is gathering in Germany; their sign is white flags with two clasped hands, trustworthy; but no one knows whom they will serve. Some suspect the Prince of Orange, whose son is imprisoned in Leuven; others suspect otherwise. I hope to receive something from you soon. Whatever I receive, I will let you know. Herewith I send back your note and thank you greatly. I sent the letters to Beza, which were intended for him, and also to Mr. Steiger.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you; greet all of yours in my name as well.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 12, 1567.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my always esteemed lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
