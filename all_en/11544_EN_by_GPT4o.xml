    <p xml:id="regest1">After his return, he received their letter concerning Calvin; the letters to the Strasbourg pastors [No. 1489] as well as to Calvin himself [No. 1490] have already been delivered to the pastors and probably already answered by them [cf. No. 1502f]. He intends to present the matter to the council only after Calvin returns from Regensburg, but assumes that all parties involved will respond appropriately to Geneva's request [for the release of Calvin]. He is always at the service of the people of Zurich.</p>

      <p>Peace and grace from God the Father through Jesus Christ our dear Lord be with you, worthy, highly learned, Christian, kind, dear lords and friends, with the offering of my very willing and friendly service. I have received and read your kind letter concerning Mr. Calvin upon my arrival, but the other two letters, one addressed to my dear lords and friends, the preachers and proclaimers of the word of God here in Strasbourg, and the other to Mr. Calvin, have already been delivered to those aforementioned lords and friends before I arrived home. The letter addressed to them has been read by them, and as I assume, they have also written a response to you, and I have been told that Mr. Calvin's letter will be sent to you with the next dispatch. Indeed, I can recognize your Christian and good thoughts regarding Mr. Calvin, which you have written to me, as nothing other than Christian and fair. However, since Mr. Calvin is not here at the moment and cannot be fruitfully dealt with in his absence, I have not yet brought your dear request to the honorable council, but I intend to do so with God's help as soon as he, along with our envoys from Regensburg, returns to us.</p>
      <p>Good hope, my lords and the preachers, as well as Calvin himself, will steadfastly demand what is necessary for the improvement of the churches and the honor of God, and that the circumstances and capabilities of Calvin may be most fitting for this purpose, to which I also gladly wish to contribute and will faithfully remind the honorable council. And this not only for the sake of the matter, which I understand as nothing other than Christian and right, but also to please you, my dear lords, to whom I would gladly be thankful for the manifold goodwill you have all shown me. You will always find me willing to offer my willing and friendly service to the best of my ability. May the Almighty graciously and long preserve you and yours for His honor. Dated April 19, in the year 1541.</p>
      <p>Your always willing Hans Bock von Gerstheim, Knight.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, highly learned Christian lords Heinrich Bullinger and other pastors, readers, and servants of the word of God of the praiseworthy church in Zurich, my kind dear lords and friends.</p>
