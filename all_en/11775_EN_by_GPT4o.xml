    <p xml:id="regest1">Claude [d’Aliod] of Savoy will travel to Zurich on the same day, hence the short letter. Thanks for the mediation in the matter with Myconius. Regarding the wars, Bullinger judges like all good people, but in Christ, there will be peace. Has sent the articles [“Thirteen Notable Errors of Caspar Schwenckfeld”] to [Martin] Frecht and includes a letter from him; asks to give Frecht's letter and the Queen's defense writing [“Confutation and Refutation of the Queen Marie Sent on the Duke of Cleves' Alleged Defense...”] to the messenger [d'Aliod]. Apologizes for the hasty writing; greetings.</p>

      <p>Claude of Savoy here indicates during lunch that he will depart for Zurich today, so even if he had the leisure to write many things to you, he would still be excluded by the constraints of time.</p>
      <p>I thank you for your support with the most illustrious Myconius; for it has turned out most happily and according to my heart's desire.</p>
      <p>Regarding the escalating wars, you judge as all good people do; but in the Lord Christ, we will have peace, even though the world, soon to collapse, rages with its prince, long since feeble and weakened.</p>
      <p>I have taken care to deliver those articles you sent to our Frecht, who reciprocates with many things, etc. But I am sending his letter, which brings something new, as I think there is no danger if I share myself and all my things with you, my dearest head and part of my soul. This good little man, our fellow citizen, will return after spending a few days there, through whom I earnestly beseech you to send both Frecht's letter and the Queen's apologetic.</p>
      <p>I am very ashamed of the most careless and more than hasty writing; but whether I want to or not, I am called away, so I can do nothing else.</p>
      <p>Commend us to the Lord. Greet the whole household with all the brothers and friends. March 20, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. B.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
