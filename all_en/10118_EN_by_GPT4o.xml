    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks Bullinger for his substantial letters, praises Bullinger's abilities and Christian nature, and reports on the death of Philipp Grotz and others. Longs for a discussion with Bullinger; he should strive for the dispatch of a successor for Pastor Jakob Otter to Aarau.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Your letters are always more pleasing to me, dearest Heinrich, because they are not filled with empty words, but abound in piety and learning. I seem to become more learned from them and no less also to grow in piety. I do not cease to marvel at the Lord in you, His vessel, nor am I without concern in the meantime, lest you be attacked too much by Satan. Those who are given to vices and wholly to Satan have peace, but he does not cease with those who are enriched with so many and such great gifts of God and illuminated by piety. Therefore, my dearest brother, I do not cease to pray for you, I do not cease to fear for you, I do not shrink from advising you, so that you may use the gifts of that Lord perpetually in fear, without self-love and all ambition. I write from experience, and Zwingli did not bear it ill from me in the past. The whole world applauds you, that is, as many as have even a crumb of piety, even the papists of both cities. But what does Satan add! He offers a taste, imposes pride and I know not what other vices. May the Lord preserve you for us as He has given, as we hope. Proceed prosperously, may Christ reign through you, and live.</p>
      <p>There was a rumor among us that your wife and children had perished from the plague, but the messenger reported otherwise. However, Philipp Grotz was taken in Balsthal. Among us, many are suffering from headaches, many good men are dying.</p>
      <p>Moreover, as the messenger was in a hurry, I could not respond to everything, but I will do so when leisure is given. I did not want him to come to you empty-handed, in the hope that he will not return empty-handed from you. Those utterly mendacious pamphlets, if only they could be refuted by one, and that as brief as it is truthful from you, so that we are not slandered to the whole world by so many lies. Ah, if it were granted to converse with you to satiety even once. I fear I will not live to see this day. My hair is graying greatly, I am becoming quite infirm, and I would need the best health. Pray to God for me and farewell.</p>
      <p>Other Esling was called. Our senate allowed it for a year. Megander wrote to Leon, if anyone is among you, let him visit us, provided our language is not so barbarous. I would like Paul Rasdorfer, if he could come to us alone, so that we might hear him. Whom we otherwise know to be piously learned. We will take care of the travel expenses.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>April 20.</p>
      <p>Our peasants abhor the barbarous and Swabian languages excessively. Confer with Leon, and if you have any, indicate them.</p>
      <p>Yours, Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
