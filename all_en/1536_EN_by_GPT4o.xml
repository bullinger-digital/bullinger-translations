      <p>On January 13th, a strong northwest wind blew, causing the water here in Antwerp to rise so high that half the city was submerged, and the dikes in Flanders broke, as well as in Zeeland, and in many places much land was flooded, with most of Flanders under water. In many years, there has not been such a great flood, causing unspeakable damage, drowning people and cattle, and if the dikes had not broken, all the streets here in Antwerp would have been full of water. In Flanders and Zeeland, almost all the land where flax grows is flooded; therefore, in those places, no flax can be cultivated this year. The whole land is full of water. It will make for a difficult year in all things. May God turn His wrath away from us and be gracious to us! You would not believe the great damage the water has caused. There are many citizens here who have lost great wealth because of it, some up to 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and even 16 thousand guilders. The damage that has occurred is indescribable. Here in Antwerp, 10 houses have collapsed due to the water.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, we have no news, except that the French are strengthening themselves very powerfully by water and land. May God grant us a blessed peace! There is also a large assembly of cavalry and foot soldiers around LÃ¼neburg, Hamburg, and similar places; however, their army has not yet been named; but whatever comes, will be accepted.</p>
