    <p xml:id="regest1">Lening also read the letter from Bullinger, which was delivered at the Frankfurt [Spring Book] Fair, to Dionysius [Melander] and thus learned that Bullinger is not angry about Melander's long silence; that he regrets the death of Luther, acknowledges Luther's steadfastness, even forgives his harshness; and that he congratulates the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] on his victory [over Duke Heinrich of Brunswick]. Lening was pleased to hear Zwingli's prophecy about the Landgrave mentioned in the letter. He and Melander reported everything to the Landgrave during a shared meal. The Landgrave was pleased about this, but regretted the behavior of the Zurichers in the Lord's Supper dispute, as is evident from his letter [No. 2455].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- There is hardly anyone living among the Lutherans who has been as zealous in representing Bullinger's view in the Lord's Supper dispute against all hostilities for 15 years as Lening. When [Martin] Bucer, [Wolfgang] Capito, and Bonifacius [Wolfhart] arrived in Homberg on their return journey from Wittenberg [1536], he testified to them in the presence of Dionysius [Melander] that he would not recognize any concord that did not agree with Oecolampadius's "Dialogue." However, since then, out of love for peace, he has tolerated everything that could be reconciled with his conscience. He was very displeased with Luther's sharp writing ["Short Confession"]. But what could he have done? Privately, he never concealed his opinion from Luther's followers. The view presented in the [“True Confession”] of the [Zurichers] is also his. Yet he does not wish to condemn the Zurichers nor to judge Luther's opinion. Rather, he believes that both say the same thing with different words, even if, in his opinion, the Zurichers' way of speaking is more apt. He has also seen Bullinger's draft of the writing "De sacramentis" and recognized that similar arguments were made and the same goal pursued as in his [“Thorough Report from the Holy Scripture”], which he once sent to Bullinger. Of course, Bullinger's writing could be published if one did not have to fear powerful enemies! Only a few in Hesse and even fewer elsewhere dare to express their opinion freely and to praise Zwingli and his books. Even if Lening continues to strive for the unity of the church, no one will ever be able to forbid him from speaking or reading Zwingli's books.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- He has already explained to Bullinger [with HBBW XIII, No. 1710] why he does not want to write further about the matter of the double marriage. However, this point of contention does not diminish his affection for Bullinger. The opportunity for the present writing arose through [Philipp of Hesse], who commissioned him to draft the letter [No. 2455]. Greetings, also to the brethren.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, our Savior. I both saw and read your letter, which was given to our mutual brother Dionysius, my special godfather, at the recent Frankfurt fair. You interpret his long silence favorably for certain reasons, you lament Luther's death, acknowledge his steadfastness, forgive his severity towards you, congratulate our prince on his recent victory, and recall Zwingli's prophecy about our prince - in all of which you have my agreement. Dionysius and I reported everything to the prince while we were invited to dine with him, and he received everything kindly. However, what he desires from you regarding the sacramentarian dispute, you will learn from his letter to you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Oh, my dearest Bullinger, there is no one among those living under the Lutherans who has adhered to your opinion in the sacramentarian dispute with such great danger and the hatred of many for 15 years as this Lening, however he may be; who also solemnly declared to Bucer, Capito, and Boniface, upon their return from Wittenberg to Homberg in Hesse, in the presence of Dionysius, that he would accept and acknowledge no concord that did not fully agree with Oecolampadius's Dialogue. Meanwhile, however, to avoid offending many and for the public peace of the churches, he has until this day considered everything that could be done with a clear conscience. That most bitter writing of Luther's, which almost reopened old wounds, greatly displeased me. But what could I do? Privately, I never concealed my mind from any of Luther's adherents. Your apology has been published, which pleases me so much that I wish to die in no other faith. However, just as I cannot subscribe to Luther anathematizing you and your opinion, so I will not rashly allow myself to be driven to such madness as to condemn Luther's opinion as impious, since I find nothing else in my mind than that both mean the same thing, though with different words, even if I think you come closer to the mark with your words. I have also seen the draft of your book "De sacramentis," which you have prepared as armor, should anyone wish to engage with you again. I saw the order, which I once followed in my little book sent to you. I saw the same arguments and goal, and there is nothing I would rather have published than such a booklet, if we were beyond the throw of the dice of fear of other powerful and numerous enemies. There are few in Hesse, and even fewer in other regions, who dare to freely confess what they think regarding this tragedy and to proclaim Zwingli's name and books. But no one could ever silence Lening, no one could proscribe Zwingli's books with him - which I mention so that you understand that I am no less devoted to your name and Zwingli's opinion than to the unity of the churches.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I did not want to write back to your response on the matter of the double marriage for reasons I indicated in my letters. However, in the meantime, although we disagree on this matter, I have been no less devoted and loving towards you. My prince gave me the opportunity to write to you, at whose command I composed the letter you receive from him. And I poured out these thoughts to you very quickly and without premeditation, rather than writing them. Therefore, consider everything favorably and bid all my known and unknown brothers much health in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell. June 4th, from Spangenberg, in the year 1546. Your Johannes Lening.</p>
      <p>To my dearest brother in Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church in Zurich, much beloved and esteemed by me.</p>
