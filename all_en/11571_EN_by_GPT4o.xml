    <p xml:id="regest1">Refers to letters that he sent with Froschauer; inquires whether he [along with Johannes Haller and Johann Jakob Wick] should leave Marburg for the fair. A student from Leipzig on his way to Italy praised the University of Leipzig and particularly recommended [Bernhard] Ziegler as a professor for Hebrew; he would like to study with Ziegler, although [Sebastian] Münster in Basel and [Konrad] Pellikan in Zurich would also be good teachers; he does not yet feel ready for a position in the service of Zurich. Christoph [Rotacher] has stayed in Basel, while his colleagues [Christian Wirth and Konrad Suter] have come to Marburg; if he and his colleagues are not sent to Leipzig for study, they would at least like to be allowed to relocate to Basel; he asks for Bullinger's favorable judgment. Letters can be sent via the Frankfurt goldsmith Johannes Svicerus, who will come to Zurich, or via Constance and Regensburg.</p>

      <p>Although a few days ago I sent a letter to Lord Froschauer, written to you with many words, in which I included many things in a mixed and, I admit, somewhat incoherent series, nevertheless, since we have stayed in Marburg for some time and think we should proceed elsewhere by your command, I thought it necessary to ask you, Father Bullinger, to take care to inform us if we should leave before the fair.</p>
      <p>A student came to us from Leipzig, who has stayed in Marburg until now and is now about to depart for Italy. He highly recommended that school to us, not only because there are very learned doctors and masters of the arts and other faculties there, but also because everything is available for a small fee. He especially recommended to me the Hebrew professor Ziegler as a most faithful teacher. I think, Father Bullinger, that I would gain a lot from him, if only with your permission and that of others in whose hands this matter lies, I could be allowed to listen to him. For although I have had as much or certainly not less education and discipline from Lord Münster in Basel and at home from Lord Pellican, there I could combine the study of this language (to which you have inflamed and excited my mind) with practical experience. However, Reverend Father, if my plan displeases you and seems imprudently undertaken, I do not want to do anything against your will and will decide nothing here except by your command. I only ask this, that you do not allow me to be called home now, who can still be seen as not having departed; for I cannot return now in such a way that I could be of much use to my homeland, since neither my age nor my education is yet sufficient to fulfill any office, although, if my service is needed by the magistrate in any way, I will not fail, as I should.</p>
      <p>Christoph, whom you recommended to us, stayed in Basel; those about whom you wrote nothing have come; I wonder how that happens. I wish we were sent to Basel, unless you have decided that we should go to Leipzig or further. You, however, Father Bullinger, with your wisdom, will reveal what needs to be done, and if you have time, you will let us know what you think. I wrote this suddenly and I strongly ask you to consider it favorably. 1541, on the Nones of June.</p>
      <p>Johannes Wolf. Master Johannes Svicerus, a goldsmith from Frankfurt, will come to Zurich, through whom letters can be sent, or letters sent from Constance to Regensburg could be sent to us immediately.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant bishop of the most ample church of Zurich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most reverend father. To Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
