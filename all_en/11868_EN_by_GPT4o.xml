      <p>Greetings. It is written that Barbarossa has cruelly devastated Catalonia (I do not know what that is), Corsica, and Sardinia in the Mediterranean Sea, destroying many, indeed all, of the ships of those islands, plundering goods, and acting in every way as befits an impious follower of Muhammad. Furthermore, the son of the King of Tunis has gouged out the eyes of his father, imitating the emperor, just as Barbarossa did to his own father. I do not understand all of this; however, since it is written so, I could not hide it from you as it was written.</p>
      <p>This is certain from Hedio: The Margrave called Hedio, discussed with him various matters of the Christian faith, raising questions (as he is more astute in such matters) about the most hidden things from the scripture of God, indeed about the most calumnious things he could find, and this at the table. He secretly and seriously conferred about reforming the churches, visiting parishes, and establishing stipends for poor candidates of theology. What is truly in his mind, I cannot know.</p>
      <p>That man is great in the empire, he is still honored by the emperor both for his prudence and his old age, yet in the meantime, he has conducted himself in such a way that I cannot conjecture the truth of his actions. May the Lord turn everything for the best, that is, to His praise.</p>
      <p>Today, Mr. de Rischach reported, from Bebel, that someone came to Basel to buy Lutheran books, as they call them, for a certain cardinal for 300 gold coins. Then there was a serious tumult in Venice over the same books being offered for sale by someone, after the one who had exposed them and the senator who had ordered it were thrown into prison, and the tumult freed them both. I can hardly believe this, I will inquire myself first. These things, as you see from the paper, are written very hastily.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with yours.</p>
      <p>The first Sunday of December in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the best bishop of the people of Zurich, a very dear brother in the Lord. Zurich</p>
