    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The bearer of the letter, Blarer's cousin Konrad Zwick, has been sent by the council of Konstanz to the council of Zurich. Bullinger will learn the reason for this from Zwick himself. He should take good care of this in the public interest.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Augsburg has submitted to Emperor Charles V. However, Blarer does not yet know the terms of peace. Yesterday, some letters from Georg Frölich, also addressed to Bullinger, arrived, which Blarer has also entrusted to Zwick. God's wrath is revealed in the miserable failure of all [Protestants]. With the exception of Strasbourg and Konstanz, all cities have now surrendered, and presumably Konstanz will unfortunately soon follow this example as well. Blarer knows the disposition of the people of Konstanz all too well! The majority is unable to trust in God when no human help is in sight.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Therefore, the people of Zurich should work in word and deed to maintain peaceful, good-neighborly relations between Konstanz and Zurich, discuss everything confidentially with Zwick, and seek God's assistance. Blarer will do his best in this regard. It is much better to have peace with God and live in discord in the world than to enjoy a temporary worldly peace while standing in God's disfavor. However, Blarer knows how weak people, even God's children, are.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Surely Bullinger has seen the oath that the envoys of the cities [Biberach, Isny, Kempten, Memmingen, and Ravensburg] have sworn to the Emperor at the Zurich council. What does he think about it? Can such an oath be considered acceptable and excusable, especially since it means a betrayal of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse? Such a thing cannot be justified!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Likewise, Blarer does not understand why the [four Protestant cities] feel obliged to the other Confederates and thereby allow themselves to be drawn into godless actions and do not come to the aid of the people of Konstanz or the other [German Protestants]! Well then! Bullinger understands Blarer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] May the Lord grant his children the strength to carry out his will, so that they do not lead each other to ruin! Bullinger should pray for God's church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blessing and greetings, especially to the councilors. Greetings from Thomas Blarer.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, herewith you have the pious, Christian, dear man of God, my dearest cousin, who has been sent by my lords to yours for reasons you will learn. I commend him to you for the best, that you may speak to him in a friendly and Christian manner, not for his person, but for the sake of common matters, which he means entirely faithfully and sincerely.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Augsburg has also submitted to the Emperor; under what conditions, I do not yet know. Lętus sent me these writings yesterday, which were also addressed to you. What a great punishment it is and what great wrath of God it is, that everyone acts so despondently and miserably. Since now all cities have surrendered and no one remains except Strasbourg and Konstanz, I am rightly concerned that we, according to our city's situation and as I unfortunately recognize the people's disposition, will also follow and join the crowd, especially since we are completely deprived of all human means, through which we might hopefully be helped, and yet the people (I speak of the larger crowd) are not so disposed and reliant on God that they want to risk everything without means and expect His miracles.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Therefore, consider the matters for the best and do what you can, so that you and we may remain in peace longer and be good neighbors, as I know you are inclined without any doubt. Confer confidentially with my cousin about all matters and ask the Lord from the bottom of your heart to move and stir the hearts (which He has in His hands) to such counsel and means, through which we may experience deliverance. I would gladly, with the Lord's eternal praise, put everything on the line and much rather, with God's help and support, suffer a thousand deaths, if possible, than to yield and agree to anything against God and love; for it is better to stand with God's peace in the world's discord and all other dangers than to have the world's false, vain, and momentary peace in God's disfavor. But, oh God, I know the unbelieving heart of the wicked and the great weakness of those whom I nevertheless believe to be God's children. Therefore, I would gladly be helpful in all that we may not have to bear shame and mockery against God and our neighbor, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You have surely seen the oath that the envoys of the cities must swear to the Emperor by your lords. I ask you for God's sake, write to me in three words your judgment, whether it can be defended and excused in any interpretation, especially since one must renounce all expression of brotherly love and loyalty towards Saxony and Hesse. I cannot in any way find in my heart and judgment that it is justifiable. I will remain silent about some other points that are also included in the speech of the cities and then in the oath.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Likewise, I cannot in any way understand how you can, with God, abandon your other Confederates, that you neither take up our cause nor that of others in our troubles, so that we are not forced into ungodly things. Well then! You understand and comprehend me well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>May the Lord God give everyone to do His pleasing will, so that no one offends another, that we all may not have to suffer God's wrath and His terrible punishment, and that we may not have to perish together (which He may graciously prevent)! Praying and begging, as best you can, for the churches of God, that they may be built up blessedly and not be destroyed in such a manner.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>God be with you and your house. Greet all good lords and friends, especially your ministers in the Lord. My dear brother sends you his service and all good things. Given in great haste, the 29th of January 1547. A. B.</p>
