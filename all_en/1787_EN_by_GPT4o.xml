      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, around the Ides of December I received a letter from you, indeed quite long and in which (if ever before) you declared your love for me.</p>
      <p>For this reason, I give eternal thanks to my Lord God, who uses you as an instrument to help and console me. Therefore, I will respond to those things which seem most necessary to me. The letters, which I suspect you wrote to me about my English cause, have not reached me; I suspect they have been lost. Please see to whom you entrusted them for delivery. The wickedness of some people is astonishing, who, when they cannot harm in any other way, indulge in violating letters. I was pleased to hear what you wrote about the Polish Diet and the calling of Mr. a Lasco, who would be dearer to me in that place, where he can help the cause of Christ, than if he had lived with me in England or perhaps here in Raetia. May the Lord Jesus bless the holy labors of that man. I can easily believe that all the routes to England are quite unsafe, as both wars rage and pestilence. Therefore, for this reason and many others, I will now remain with my Raetian people. Meanwhile, God willing, better things. But the same desire to cross over remains, as soon as it is possible through arms and pestilence.</p>
      <p>But listen about my affairs, in which there is something new. After the Lord granted freedom to the Valtellina to preach our doctrine, I descended there twice and almost entirely surveyed it, nor was I silent, believe me; but here and there I sowed the gospel. What do you ask? When I saw the fruit appearing, I decided to want to live there for some time, especially since many good brothers invited me. So I came to Vicosoprano the day before yesterday, negotiated with these lords, and obtained permission to leave this ministry and go into the middle of that valley, which I will do in three days. I do not deny that grave dangers threaten me, especially since I am the first to enter the ranks of powerful and rabid enemies. But I trust in the Lord, and if it happens that I die, I will die for Him and indeed willingly. You hear, therefore, that I will henceforth be a pastor in that valley and no longer in Pregallia. May the Lord be with me; you, Bullinger, will diligently pray to Him for me. If you wish to write anything, send letters to Clavenna to Mr. Francesco Negro; but see to whom you give them, which I earnestly ask of you. I, however, will not be able to return to you before the end of winter; I will send one of mine soon. The small vessel, which you wrote you sent, I have not yet seen, nor do I know whether you received the Pontifical I sent.</p>
      <p>There is a town in Pregallia called Solio, where many powerful papists live. But God was more powerful; for eight days ago the mass was driven out from there by the actions of those who were poor and almost nothing according to the world. The Lord is marvelous. I expect Aurelius from the homeland any day, where the gospel is doing well. Greet all the brothers for me. Farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, the day after the Kalends of January 1553. Yours, Vergerius.</p>
      <p>I resisted Camillo in such a way that I hope what he was attempting will not succeed, nor will I fail in the future. If anyone in the name of the marquis asks you or Ziegler to be able to take those two vessels elsewhere, certainly allow it.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
