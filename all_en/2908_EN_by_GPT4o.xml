      <p>Greetings. I congratulate myself, most illustrious man and most esteemed lord and dearest brother, that my Apologetic exposition has pleased you so much; indeed, I give thanks to our Lord God, to whom alone all things worthy of praise that we do should be referred, and I wish that our adversaries would someday come to their senses and cease to quarrel over their gross opinions and to provide material for exultation to our common adversaries.</p>
      <p>You have no doubt heard that the most illustrious and holy man, Mr. Konrad Pellikan, our most closely connected brother, passed away to the Lord on the very day of the Lord's resurrection. He was a professor of the Hebrew language in our school and a colleague of Mr. Theodor Bibliander in the exposition of the Old Testament. Now, therefore, when it was consulted about appointing another good man in the place of the deceased excellent man, Mr. Peter Martyr was initially designated by the deputies, then by the entire college with always unanimous votes, and finally elected with unanimity without a single dissenting voice. The matter, according to our national custom, was referred to the most honorable senate of our republic, which also approved and confirmed the election with unanimous votes. He writes to the most illustrious senate of the republic of Strasbourg, asking that with their good grace you may be allowed to follow the divine and legitimate calling. He also writes letters to you, calling you and promising all kindness. It has also been enjoined upon me by the brothers, in the name of the whole college and the brothers, to call you and even to beseech you not to disdain to come to those who love you most. This I do with the present letters, and I urge you to come and regard the minds of all devoted to you rather than weigh the words of one who does not speak or write with the dignity of the matter.</p>
      <p>There are indeed countless things that can invite you to accept this offered condition, especially the divine, legitimate, and unanimous election, then that you will be freed at some point from the contentions and hostile minds of your fellow ministers and join the college of those who love you and hate contentions.</p>
      <p>Here you will have and find your old friend and brother Bernardino, and you will have and find the Italian church, such as I do not think you will find any in Germany... (...)... you will be in the vicinity of Italy, so that if you wish to do anything with those of yours, you can do so more conveniently from here than elsewhere. You will also have a sufficiently liberal and munificent stipend. You will not bear heavy labors; consideration will be given to your age; if it happens that you fall ill, this will not be to your detriment, and if, worn out by old age, you become unequal to your confession and thus useless to yourself and others, your canonical portion, that is, your stipend, will nevertheless remain until the very end of your life. You have heard from others that the people of Zurich, among all the Swiss, do not hold the least place in humanity. There are countless other conveniences that can move you to come to us. If, having settled your affairs, you are present at the feast of St. John the Baptist, you will be present early enough.</p>
      <p>But while these things are being written, letters are offered from Mr. Vergerio indicating that you are being called or invited by the most illustrious prince to Heidelberg, to profess there. This news has not a little afflicted me and our others; however, as I consider each detail more closely, I conceive hope again that you will choose to come to us rather than to Heidelberg. You learned in England what it is to serve a single prince, and yet the most serene Edward was a young man; the Palatine is old and, as they say, already has one foot in Charon's boat. You know how many changes the death of a prince brings with it, and you have experienced how burdensome it is to serve universities, and yet your age, long afflicted by labors, ought to have been relieved, not burdened more and more. You are not unaware that the princes of the empire depend too much on the nod of the Emperor and that many things are changed in the churches of Germany according to his edicts. If you come to us, you will be in a free people, who have no business with the Emperor and the chameleons of the imperial diets. This religion, which this church received 30 years ago, it retains even today and has always abhorred and abhors innovations and altercations. I do not think that a better good can befall a pious man and a student of pious letters than if he can enjoy true freedom and dwell among friends, indeed among his most beloved friends. You see that this very thing can now happen to you. Therefore, there is no need for me to say more to you.</p>
      <p>We all ask you to come to us, who love you most; we promise, and we will provide, all kindness and goodwill to you.</p>
      <p>I greet you in the name of all. May our Lord Jesus Christ move and compel your mind to come. Farewell forever in Zurich on the first of May in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Moreover, if you have decided to devote your efforts entirely to the prince in reforming the church and school of Heidelberg and have not yet committed yourself to the prince, go ahead and ask the most illustrious senate of this city to grant you some time, intending to come, God willing, before winter.</p>
      <p>Request in written letters from your colleague Mr. Theodor Bibliander that he himself meanwhile perform the duties of both, just as he now performs the duties of the excellent man Mr. Pellikan until the feast of St. John. We will wait until you have accomplished this; but you can also use a true and holy excuse with the prince; for you know that you have committed your efforts to our church above others by letters written to me when you returned from England. But farewell and come.</p>
      <p>Mr. Theodor himself, when I read or recite these things to him, promises to serve you willingly, provided you serve Christ for some time in the school of Heidelberg, provided you finally come to us. He greets you particularly and asks that you not take it badly that he does not write himself; he writes through me.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Peter Martyr.</p>
