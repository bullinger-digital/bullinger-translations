    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Bullinger will surely still remember how he [some time ago] emphasized the importance of a mutual relationship of trust between the [Zurichers] and the people of Konstanz. However, Blarer cannot shake the suspicion that the Zurich councilors are not telling Bullinger the whole truth, but are concealing or even feigning some things. Therefore, he decided to proceed cunningly with his dear cousin Konrad Zwick and presented him with a series of questions that he took from Bullinger's letter [not received]. Zwick's answer is enclosed [not known]. Hopefully, Bullinger's doubts are now dispelled! He should not show the sheet to anyone else, but return it immediately, as Zwick knows nothing about it and it would be unbearable if Blarer's relationship with him were even slightly tarnished. Blarer would have preferred to black out some passages at the end of the sheet, but he has to return it to Zwick. Despite these [delicate] passages, he sends it because he does not want to hide Zwick's mental state from Bullinger and is sure that Zwick's reputation will not be harmed by it. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Zwick's answer must not fall into foreign hands for important reasons! Blarer sends it only so that Bullinger can determine how skillfully Zwick acts in everything. If everything else were handled with the same care, things would be better with Zurich and Konstanz! But what has happened cannot be changed. God must have allowed it, and there is nothing left but to bear it with patience. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Bullinger should pray for Konstanz and especially for Zwick (who always has great plans)! The former mayor of Ulm [Georg Besserer] wrote to Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz that [Johann] von Lier [zu Berchem], an important man at the court of Emperor Charles V, has talked a lot with him about the war machine invented by Zwick, although without ever mentioning Zwick's name. It was merely communicated that the inventor lives in Konstanz. Von Lier showed great interest and commissioned Besserer to determine the identity of the inventor. Blarer is afraid of this. Bullinger should pray that God turns everything for the good! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] He must never tell Zwick that he received the enclosed sheet and should return it as soon as possible! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Regarding Hans Schöner, no answer has yet come from Augsburg. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Bullinger, thank you for your last letter [not received]! Blarer can hardly find words to thank you for the small [bathing] gift made of silver along with the little letter for his wife [Katharina, née Ryff]. It makes him rather uncomfortable, as it is quite unpleasant not to be able to reciprocate a favor and therefore feel obliged to the benefactor for life. May the Lord bless Bullinger and his family! He should pray fervently with his church for the people of Konstanz. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> [7] Just now, the Zurich messenger [Andreas Müller] arrives with letters from Augsburg addressed to Blarer and Bullinger. Blarer encloses them. Unfortunately, there is no good news for the elderly [Hans Schöner]. Blarer already suspected that the people of Augsburg would not be helpful. Such people are completely indifferent to the misfortune of others. But God will one day avenge His own! Bullinger should comfort Schöner. Blarer sends his regards and will write to him as soon as possible. </p>

      <p>Greetings. I know, my venerable and dearest brother, that you have not yet forgotten what you wrote to me about that mutual trust between your people and ours, which should be maintained in every way. However, since I suspected that not everything was presented to you in good faith by your people, but some things were concealed or even feigned, it seemed best to proceed cunningly with my dear cousin Konrad Zwick and to present him with some questions from your letters, hoping that his response would satisfy you - which I intended to send to you, although my cousin knew nothing of this. Therefore, I beseech and implore you by our friendship and by our Savior Christ, that no one else reads this, but that you return everything as soon as possible with the next messenger, so that this does not cause me any harm with him (whose mind I would not want to alienate from me even slightly). I confess frankly that I would have erased or blotted out some passages, especially at the end, if they were to be returned to me. And yet, since I could not do this, I did not want to keep your mind in suspense, being persuaded that whatever it is, it will not harm him in your eyes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>See to it, as I have already implored, that these do not fall into anyone else's hands! There are many and great reasons why I do not want this at all. I only wanted to achieve this with these, that you understand with what skill everything has been handled by my excellent Konrad Zwick, and if everything else had corresponded to his fidelity, perhaps all our matters would be in a better state on both sides. But what has been done cannot be undone, nor was it seen otherwise by the Lord, therefore let us bear with equanimity what cannot be amended, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Pray diligently to the Lord for our city, especially for my cousin, who always meditates on great things. I have now read the letters written by the consul of Ulm to Marcell Dietrich, in which he indicates that Lord von Lier, a prominent figure at the emperor's court, has discussed much with him about that war machine, although without mentioning my cousin, but that there is someone in our city who holds this invention, and he has earnestly requested that the author be inquired with the utmost diligence possible - which matter has greatly terrified me! Therefore, you will earnestly pray that the Lord turns everything to the praise and glory of His name.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Be careful that Konrad Zwick never learns that these were sent to you by me, either now or in the future, and return them as soon as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>No response has yet been received from Augsburg regarding Schöner's case.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Your last letter has been delivered to me, for which I thank you very much. As for the small silver gift and the most loving little letter sent to my wife, I do not know where I can find enough words to thank you, as I completely despair of ever being able to repay you. You continually burden me with your excessive generosity, binding me more and more to you, so that I am almost unable to bear it. You know, however, how burdensome it is for a free man to owe, and to owe in such a way that you can never hope to repay. But I will certainly pray to the Lord, which is the one thing I can do, that He may bless you and your household most graciously from the abundance of His bounty. Pray diligently for us with your church!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Your messenger has now arrived, bringing letters from Augsburg addressed to you and me, which I send. Ah, how I grieve for the good old man, although my mind had already foreseen that we would achieve nothing! For I know these people inside and out, easily dissimulating and despising the causes of the afflicted. But the Lord lives, a just judge, who will one day avenge His elect from the hands of the unjust who oppress them! You will comfort the good man with the grace given to you and greet him most dutifully in my words. I will also write as soon as I have leisure.</p>

      <p>8th of August, very early in the morning, 1547. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
