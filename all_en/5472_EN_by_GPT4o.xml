      <p>I received your most welcome letters, my father, to which I respond as follows. This conversion is truly marvelous and indeed the finger of the Lord. If it had been entrusted to certain people, perhaps things would have turned out differently. But the Lord, angry with our sins, has confounded the counsels of the wise and broken the spirits of the strong, as I have seen and observed a hundred times. Meanwhile, I do not cease to hope well, because I know we are not given over to death. Truly, we are now reduced to remnants. The seed remains, which I wish the Lord would preserve in the greatest and truly extreme dangers, lest all be swallowed up at once. Of those who were with us at Saint-Germain, I think no one was killed except perhaps one, Johannes of Tournai, who was captured by the enemies six weeks ago and thrown into prison. But what happened to him afterward, I do not know. Many others were miserably slaughtered with great devastation of the churches. Few have returned to Geneva. Some are hiding, others are besieged in various places. I left many in Orléans with the Prince and Admiral. We have few cities besides, where, with the papacy overthrown, Christ still reigns. I, having been miraculously snatched from the midst of death a thousand times, hoped to breathe again in Geneva. But behold, I am again carried back into a vast whirlpool. For Andelot's entreaties compel me to return to him as quickly as possible, unless I wish to appear a deserter. Therefore, I now return to Lorraine, where I will meet him and his forces, that is, three thousand five hundred horsemen and four thousand foot soldiers. What shall I do there in the meantime? Whatever the Lord who calls suggests. This is my condition now, my father, that is, most sad and miserable. But, by the grace of God, I have resolved even to die, if it seems good to the Lord. I am surprised that we have heard nothing from the English for a long time. However, Montius assured me in Strasbourg a month ago that seven ships had already crossed, and thirty-three would follow. Whatever certain news I hear, I will write back immediately, if a courier is available. The Bituriges, shamefully betrayed by the commander of the garrison, surrendered themselves, indeed on excellent terms, but which the most treacherous enemy broke two days later. However, most of our soldiers reached Orléans safely with their arms. Since that time, they say the enemy has divided their army into two parts, one heading towards Rouen, the other into Champagne to hinder the Germans. What will happen to the people of Lyon, I do not know, whom they have deserted so untimely, with the enemy already near their gates. The city is indeed very fortified both by position and by works. Inside, too, there is a strong garrison of foot soldiers, and a strong reinforcement is being prepared not far away. But I wish that in this trepidation their spirit remains firm and that they do not lack diligent leaders. Certainly, however the matter may fall, they will never wash away this disgrace, nor will they repair the damage done to us. But what is that? Not to be more moved by the danger of the brothers, indeed by their own danger, than if everything were going well? Meanwhile, the neighbors have already sent soldiers against us for the third time to crush us, and yet we still slumber. This is the charity, indeed, that Christ urges. This is the sympathy of the members, which Paul so greatly commends. We asked for soldiers, in some places it is denied, in others it is granted indeed but on conditions you see. We asked for money, even offering guarantors. It is flatly denied. What more? It will not be due to the good brothers that we perish as rebels. Therefore, judgment will begin at the house of the Lord. But it is strange if these spectators are not finally compelled to come forth onto the stage themselves, and become no less guilty of the just blood shed than those who have contaminated their hands with impious murders. I do not wonder that these things displease all good people there and elsewhere, nor do I doubt that the pastors fulfill their duty. But I beseech you all in the Lord, that in this, as in the final act, you exert all your strength, so that at least the four cities are not reluctant to call a meeting at the earliest opportunity to consider a matter of such great importance. For who doubts that with the French churches overthrown, whose remnants now barely sustain themselves with some hope of aid, the fury of the enemies will also advance into these regions with certain hope of victory? Will there then be time for deliberation? Certainly either very little or none, and then the people will rightly complain that they perished more from the negligence and sloth of the magistrates than from feeling the danger. "But we," they say, "have a treaty with the king." As if we are not fighting for the king, while we uphold his edict, or as if guardians are to manage the affairs of a ward at their own discretion, or if they do so, are to be recognized as guardians. Finally, if they do not want to pronounce on the cause, at least why are they not moved by the ruin of such a great kingdom? Why do they not send envoys to allies embroiled in civil war, to interpose themselves and in some way break these attacks with their authority? For, even if they accomplish nothing else, they will at least achieve this, that they understand the whole cause better and later establish something more certain, as they have recognized their own interest. This is therefore, my father, this is, my [lord] Bullinger, my [lord] Gwalter, and you other brothers, in which I think you must work both most vigorously and most quickly, if the safety of both France and your own is dear to you, as I do not doubt it is. Therefore, in the meantime, I proceed straight to Andelot and from there, wherever the Lord wills, to whom I commit myself entirely. I have written this to you, my father, as perhaps I will never write again. Therefore, I wish these letters to be common to the whole college of dearest brothers with you and to stand as a testimony of our mutual concord and agreement unto death, if anything human should happen to me. May our Lord Jesus Christ bless you more and more, dearest and most esteemed brothers, and look upon his afflicted churches and grant me also to live and die in him. Bern, 24th of September, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, T[heodor] Beza.</p>
