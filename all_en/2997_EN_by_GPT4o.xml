      <p>S. Regarding the matter of Geneva, I do not doubt that, as you have learned about the Bernese plans, you have carefully discussed them with your people.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we have received not very favorable news about the people of Glarus, and that the five confederate cantons are attempting to restore papism in some churches through a delegation they sent on the 23rd of August, and if that path does not succeed, through armed soldiers, whom they intend to send to aid those among them who demand papistic impiety. They seize and grasp every opportunity to suppress the truth, being much more zealous for the kingdom of the Antichrist than most of us are for the kingdom of Christ the Savior. I received this information partly from a prominent man from Glarus who is a very good friend of mine, and partly from another trustworthy man who came directly from Switzerland to us, a man who loves and is devoted to sincere piety. And although I hope that you, as neighbors, are not unaware of this and do not doubt that you are vigilant, I could not refrain from informing you of what has certainly been reported to me. It is undoubtedly a matter of great importance, in which, if the adversaries succeed, there is no doubt, as Habakkuk says, that they will take new spirits and sacrifice to their idol, and will attempt the ruin of other churches with even greater audacity. Meanwhile, I cannot cease to be amazed if the papists, being fewer in number among the people of Glarus, receive aid from the five cantons, while the more sensible ones, who are greater in number, are deprived of our support. Let us fervently pray to the Lord to destroy the plans of the impious and preserve His church. Regarding the Hungarian affairs, I have this to say: The Roman king's troops had a skirmish with the Turks on July 24th; it was a serious encounter, said to have lasted about 7 hours, and both sides became so weary that neither pursued the other, which was indeed the true reason that occurred, and it is said that up to 2000 Turks were killed, and about 500 of our men, including some of the nobility, among them Christoph von Bollweiler was killed, and his brother Niklaus was shot through the thigh. It is written that if the Steurer and Hussernen had done their best and not fled, the Christians would have had a remarkable victory. Otherwise, it is quiet and no prince has yet arrived in Regensburg. Maximilian is calling back the land and is said to be well disposed. The emperor has gone to Ghent, and there is talk that he wants to go to England, hence preparations are being made. The one from Schwarzenberg is recruiting riders and leading them down the land.</p>
      <p>Margrave Albrecht has ridden with the Elector to the Upper Palatinate, and the Count Palatine is with him. It is said that he desires half of both bishoprics, WÃ¼rzburg and Bamberg, and wants no less.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 25, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague. Zurich.</p>
