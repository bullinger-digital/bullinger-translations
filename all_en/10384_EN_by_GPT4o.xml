    <p xml:id="regest1">Rumors about a large French military assembly heading towards Montbéliard against Gabriel Salamanca, Count of Ortenburg. The people of Basel fear a war in their vicinity. In Paris, the king, in accordance with the papal bull, imprisoned over fifty "Lutherans." However, after his meeting with Philip of Hesse, everything turned for the better: In front of and inside the Louvre, the Gospel is freely proclaimed by an Augustinian monk and a Carmelite to a large audience, including many nobles. The bishops of Paris, Jean du Bellay, and of Senlis, Guillaume Petit, are suspected of Lutheranism, the rector Nicolas Cop has fled, and Jean de Sallignac was excluded from the theological faculty. The Knight Commander Guillaume Quynon?, theology professors François Vatable, Jacques Toussaint, and Pierre Danès, as well as many learned physicians, etc., attend the evangelical preaching; Professor François Le Picart complained about this in a sermon. These reports are repeatedly confirmed. In England, the Pope was excommunicated by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, and in London, the images of eight cardinals were burned. According to the latest report from France, Gérard Roussel is free again, Noël Béda has been arrested; however, a long-time prisoner from Geneva, Jean Pointet?, was burned. Request for news. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Rumor, I would gladly say for certain, is that the king has entered Burgundy with a large army. His intention is to head towards Montbéliard, which he is said to have purchased; along the way, he seizes what his impulse commands. Nearby is Gabriel Salamanca, a Spaniard powerful in Germany, troublesome to the German nobility, whose power many say is to be broken in the king's plans. It is certain that the nobility does not fear the king's intention at all. Today, the Count of Ortenburg (as they call that Spaniard) consults with his men on how to respond. Arms have been ordered for the people of Sundgau, Alsace, and others. If they proceed, there is fear that both Sundgau and Alsace may perish. Therefore, there are those who advise the people not to move a foot from their place if they wish to be safe. I see nothing but a plan contrary to everyone's opinion. Who has not been persuaded until now that the king aspired to Italy? And now see where he is headed. It displeases us if he is to bring the army closer to us. If Sundgau is lost, our granary is indeed lost. Who can be ignorant of how inconvenient this would be in these times? Enough about these matters.</p>
      <p>In Paris, as letters brought here show, amazing things are happening. Initially, the king, moved by the papal bull obtained against the Lutherans, led over fifty captives, among whom some paralytics were carried on beds, to prison. This agitation lasted until the king returned from a meeting with the Prince of Hesse. Then everything was restored to tranquility, and not only this, but also full of the best hope. For an Augustinian preaches the gospel near the Louvre with a great gathering of people. In the Louvre itself, a bearded Carmelite, who was sent from Italy by the pope to his niece to care for her, freely teaches Christ. The queen, the king's sister, governs the pope's niece. Very renowned men attend those sermons daily. Two bishops, of Paris and Senlis, are ill-spoken of because of Lutheranism. The rector has left the city because of the gospel, that is, because of the hatred contracted from the gospel. Salinas, a trilingual monk, was expelled from the synagogue of theologians. Recently, D. de S. John Lateran, Vatable, Toussaint, Danès, and some consular men, as well as three or four pairs of the most learned physicians, have revealed themselves as disciples of Christ by attending sermons daily. Recently, the sophist Picard shouted during a sermon: "It is over for us. I see no one around me except old women. The men go to the Louvre." After this, letters came, which we mentioned, confirming almost everything. I say "almost"; for they omitted about the Carmelite's matters otherwise well known.</p>
      <p>From England, these are the news: The Patriarch excommunicated the pope, and in London, the images of eight cardinals with their concubines were burned in a play.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, today a certain messenger brought to me that Roussel, who had been detained until now, was released by sentence. Béda has been captured. A few days ago, one who had been led to prison fifteen months ago for the gospel, a native of Geneva, was burned. Why he was condemned only now, I do not know. Enough about these matters.</p>
      <p>I wish to know the outcome of your captives. Concerning the senate, do your utmost.</p>
      <p>Farewell with Utinger and all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, the eighth of April, year 34.</p>
      <p>Your O. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, friend and brother in his Lord. To Zurich.</p>
