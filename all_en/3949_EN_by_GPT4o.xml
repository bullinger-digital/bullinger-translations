      <p>S. P. D. I received your little book, which you sent to me as a gift, and found it worthy of reading and knowing in itself, and also pleasing due to your recommendation, for which I am grateful to you, as is right. I will also not neglect any opportunity to reciprocate your kindness, if any should arise, in whatever ways I can. You will easily understand my thoughts on the matter of eradicating errors from our churches from my letters to the Zurich colleagues, and even if what I have written does not seem so learned, you will judge it to have come from a sincere heart.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given in Tarnów on the 12th of May in the year of our Lord 1559.</p>
      <p>Your good, though unknown to you by face, friend from the heart, Jan, Count in Tarnów, etc., signed.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and well-deserving lord of the Christian religion, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the holy church of God in Zurich, the most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church among the Swiss, his honorable friend.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zurich church, his honorable friend.</p>
      <p>From Count Tarnowski of Poland, 1559.</p>
      <p>I received letters from you, which were most pleasing to me. For they were not only filled with the most useful doctrine but also with many expressions of your goodwill towards me. They were most pleasing to me not only for that reason but also because you, with the best intention and singular zeal, admonish what contributes to the preservation and advancement of the safety and honor of this kingdom, than which nothing is dearer or greater to me. This duty of yours cannot be placed in praise without being well-placed.</p>
      <p>As for the Roman pope, I cannot but agree with you that he, with his arts, in which he is very powerful, places obstacles so that the scepter of power and tyranny is not wrenched from his hands, which he seized through force and deceit, thus permitted by God and borne by the troubled times of human affairs. For there is no doubt that he grew and reached such power through the weakness of kings and princes, not without the ruin of the church and the obscuration of divine truth. I am also of the opinion that his judgment should not be followed in all things that he teaches and imposes against divine truth, whose foundation is the writings of the prophets and apostles, since no authority of any man, indeed not even of angels, is so great that relying on it we should do anything contrary to the divine mind, on which all our things ought to depend as the highest good. He boasts that he cares for the church of God and therefore will convene a council, but if only, freed from the care of human affairs with which he is occupied, he would at some point take this mind, to be held with greater zeal for divine matters than for the most unrestrained ambition, and that he would at some point prove by deed what he promises in words, but it is difficult, as I myself see, that he, overwhelmed with so many cares of defending and amplifying his dominion, will seriously undertake this effort to convene an ecumenical council, in which what is corrupted from the word of God may be corrected, what is omitted may be restored, and foreign plants in this vineyard and those fighting against divine truth may be uprooted. Nor is it to be doubted, however, that we will at some point be granted this wish, especially since it is not only the popes who can convene a council but also monarchs and princes, to whose faith and diligence the empires have been entrusted by God, as it is evident that in other times emperors not only convened councils but also presided over the matters that were debated in them. We trust, however, that God will also regard our evils and give this mind to kings, whose hearts he holds in his hand, that they may seek remedies for these evils with which the Christian world is miserably afflicted, and apply those found.</p>
      <p>What remedy can be more present for healing the wounds of the church of God than a free ecumenical council, indeed I cannot at all comprehend with my reason. Private individuals can do little or certainly very little to persuade people to depart from this opinion and embrace that one with unanimous consent. If it happens in the affairs of the state that unless the authority and counsel of the highest governors are added, if anything is sanctioned by private opinion, people are not affected by it nor do they consider it valid, much less do they go along with the opinions of those who, as private individuals, assume the power to eradicate errors and reform the church of God. Hence, in my opinion, even among those who wish to follow the gospel, disputes still arise not about trivial matters, because the matter was conducted and attempted by private counsel to remove abuses. For this is the nature of people, that they easily allow themselves to be overcome by common consent, which they consider to be almost an oracle of nature, but they are especially offended when fewer and perhaps of lesser authority think they see more acutely and perceive more prudently the truer opinion than others. For they think they are held in contempt in this way, and thus there is a need for a free ecumenical council, so that these most pernicious evils may be removed from the world, since they can hardly be removed otherwise, so that all whom God has chosen may follow one opinion about religion. People have always embraced the authorities of those ancient councils with such great eagerness of mind that they have considered them to be held in the place of the divine word.</p>
      <p>But when will this council be convened? The Christian emperor, the kings of Spain, France, and England have given us the least doubtful hope that they will move every stone to relieve and refresh the church of God groaning under so many burdens by convening a council even against the will of the pope. We have received this from certain and not insignificant authorities.</p>
      <p>God the best also places us in hope that these disturbances will have an end at some point. He will come to the aid of his endangered church and will not allow this ship, in which he is with his followers, to be submerged by waves and storms.</p>
      <p>He will undoubtedly calm these storms, as he has done in all the most turbulent times of the church. He sometimes seems to be in a deeper sleep, but he is awakened by his promised goodness, with which he cherishes his church, and also by the prayers of the pious. Thus he proposes examples of his goodness in the preservation of the old church, in the healing of its wounds, in the change of turbulent times to tranquility, so that we too may hope that the Lord Christ, having dispelled the dreadful darkness, will illuminate people with his light, having removed errors and informed them with his truth and made them peaceful. As for myself, I pray to God that he may strengthen me with his spirit, so that I may value the doctrine brought forth and revealed from the bosom of the eternal Father through Christ so highly that I may willingly expend all my things, even my life, if necessary, for it. In removing the superstitions with which this kingdom is filled, among other things, by the work of the clergy, for which many think they must fight, this is my intention, that as much as possible, regard for common tranquility may be had, so that disturbances, which usually bring sad ruin with them, may not be stirred up.</p>
      <p>We must also consider our place and times here, if we wish to provide for ourselves, as we certainly should. For what would happen if, having stirred up sedition, we wanted to promote the cause of religion by force? Thus we would submit our necks to the cruelty of the Turk, who would rush upon us with much more eager spirit, greater preparation, and more learned tyranny, than when he saw us distracted and consumed by internal discord. He has always observed and seized such times to overthrow many and indeed the most flourishing kingdoms, to establish his tyranny, to propagate the madness of Muhammad. The examples of others, which are a lesson, move us to follow what is useful for us, to avoid the mournful and civil discord, lest, having lost the kingdom at the same time, which God forbid, we also lose the Christian religion and build and consecrate altars and temples to Muhammad. For even a slight occasion provides many evils, which are easy to fall into, but we easily find out how difficult remedies are.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we need a certain method by which the vicious plants may be uprooted from the church. For we must proceed prudently and show obedience to reason.</p>
      <p>But if we were to conduct the matter by force! Would we follow reason as our guide, would we proceed prudently? Let the judgment of a fair judge decide. Thus we would destroy ourselves with arms, undoubtedly open the way for Muhammad.</p>
      <p>Your place is different, among whom, even if some discord were stirred up, it would not bring ruin to the church, especially since almost the greater part of you persist in one opinion about religion.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the change must be made gradually and step by step, remedies for the diseases of our church must be applied gently, not cutting off the sick part, lest the healthy part perish at the same time. In this way, with God propitious, the churches will be reformed and the fruits of the sweetest peace will not be lost. I, for my part, will diligently take care that whatever I see can be referred to the glory of God and the salvation of this kingdom, that it may be referred, according to the ability of both my intellect and strength, according to the reason of my duty and status. But the most merciful God, who has promised to carry his church even in squalid old age, will come to our infirmities, will remove the spirit of discord, will give his love, since he is the God of love and peace, will drive away from us the darkness of errors and will illuminate us with the light of his truth, so that the kings themselves may serve in fear, so that we may all walk in his ways. I pray with all my heart that he may increase my faith, that he may both guide and strengthen me with his spirit, and I also earnestly ask you to help me with your fervent prayers to God our Father for your piety.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that your prayers will have a place with his most holy majesty, who has commanded to be invoked in all tribulations. These briefly are what I thought should be communicated to you about what should be done in this matter, about which you wrote to me, which I also ask you to receive with a grateful mind for your humanity. And that Jesus Christ may govern, strengthen, protect, and preserve you with his Holy Spirit for as long as possible, I pray from the heart.</p>
      <p>Given in Tarnów on the 13th of May 1560.</p>
      <p>Your friend from the heart, Jan, Count in Tarnów.</p>
