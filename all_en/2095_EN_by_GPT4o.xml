      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc. Yesterday evening, the bearers of this letter came to us, informing us that our mint master, a man who, when sober, is quite good, but when he gets drunk (which he does frequently), blurts out whatever comes to his mouth without any regard for things or people. Recently, in the fields of Zurich among drunken peasants, he, being far more intoxicated, spewed out some words that would certainly come back to haunt him (to use a Plinian term), unless some kind genius either settles or completely silences them. For he is said to have uttered some quite intolerable words against the most distinguished and honorable man, Mr. Consul Lavater, which, if spoken by a sober person, would not be bearable. A drunkard has long since given rise to this saying: "Where wine goes in, wit goes out." It is also reported that among drinking companions, it is agreed that anyone may say whatever they please without consequence, attributing everything to wine. They say that all these things were reported by a certain informer to Mr. Consul; the man was thus provoked, so that he will by no means allow the mint master to have spewed these things with impunity. These mediators are going there.</p>
      <p>Would that they approach the matter with the right Mercury, or rather Christ. They have convinced themselves that you have great influence with Mr. Consul, both because of your piety and your kinship, and that I, in turn, have some influence with you because of your remarkable kindness towards us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they wanted us to beseech you in writing to assist them in this matter (which they will explain to you in more detail) with Mr. Consul. He has children without feathers (young and inexperienced), a pious wife, a most respectable matron, the daughter of a certain evangelist among the people of Constance, and a precise craft. For if this matter is not settled with both parties' honor intact, there is a danger that the private mint master may turn to bad arts, namely military service or worse. Therefore, we pray, most humane Bullinger (for I write in my own name and that of my fellow ministers), that you show yourself in this matter in such a way that our fellow citizens truly experience that we have great influence with you. The brothers also took care to have their most dutiful greetings included in their name.</p>
      <p>May all the pious among you be safe. Schaffhausen, the day before the calends of December, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the pious and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his especially gracious lord and dear brother. Zurich.</p>
