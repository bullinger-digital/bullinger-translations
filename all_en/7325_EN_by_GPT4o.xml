      <p>Greetings. I cannot advise that in our churches, where the Lord's Supper is celebrated on certain days throughout the year, another custom be introduced whereby it is performed more frequently.</p>
      <p>I am not unaware that Augustine, in the letter I referenced, mentions that it was once customary for many to partake of the sacred supper every Sunday, and indeed for others, daily, etc. However, he also states: "All this kind of matter has free observances, and there is no better discipline in these things for a serious and prudent Christian than to act in the manner he sees the church, to which he may have come by chance, acting." And likewise, he says: "I would prefer in such matters that he in this country and he in that country not deviate from what the others do," etc. Therefore, since I see how many disputes we would stir up if we were to change the form that has been accepted and practiced for 40 years and more, I have no doubt that it is most advisable and most acceptable to God to continue to act according to Augustine's advice, in the manner we see the church, to which we have come, acting, etc. December 7, 1567.</p>
