      <p>Holy Reverend Father in Christ, what do you wish me to write to you? You advise me to act cautiously. I do; for it has been not only weeks, but also months since I have spoken a word about this matter from the pulpit. I urge our people to sincere repentance for their sins, because punishment is at the door. The plague is spreading. Philipp Gallicius himself seems to have been struck by it, although I still doubt whether it is the plague, etc. You will pray to the Lord for me, that He may sustain me; for I easily understand that the adversaries have tried to bring me and the delegates of your city into great disrepute. They are being listened to; but I promise myself more from the modesty and prudence of your people than to believe in obvious slanders. In this whole matter, I could not act otherwise than I have, and in this I call my soul as a witness. As for our affairs, you will learn what has been done from the delegates. The situation seems to be worse than before. Farewell, Reverend Father in Christ. Suddenly, because the departure of the delegates was not certain.</p>
