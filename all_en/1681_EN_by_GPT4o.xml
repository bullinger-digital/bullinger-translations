      <p>I have received two letters from you, most learned man, the latest of which I received today. In the earlier ones, you congratulate me on my return and express concern for my poor health, which indeed afflicted me gravely, confining me to bed for several days; but I am feeling somewhat better and am not as weak. However, seeing myself in such distress and not knowing what the Lord's goodness has decided for me, I sent a nobleman from among my friends to the king to inform him of the state of his affairs among the Swiss and to request permission for me to leave for only two months so that I might attend to my health. I do not know what his response will be; however, he will hardly allow me to leave entirely. I see that you are rightly concerned about a successor for the legation; this also greatly troubles me; for I know how important this legation is and how much it can harm the good if someone misuses it. This is why, a month ago, I wrote to my son-in-law, who is a secretary to the king, to take it up; for he seemed to me quite suitable, being sufficiently learned in both Greek and Latin, and his wife, my daughter, can understand whatever Latin she reads without a teacher. However, he excused himself due to his important affairs in France; therefore, we must think of someone else, and to serve you, whose pious counsel I see is certain in all things, I will not entirely abandon the legation without providing a more suitable replacement in my place. May the Lord be present in this matter so that His glory is considered. As for your desire to know where the king is and what fortune he enjoys, know that he is on the borders of Picardy, where he is destroying all the ditches and embankments that the enemies have built to ravage the territory, and having done so, he intended to overthrow the house of Queen Mary, which is located near the town of Gems, which had miserably ravaged many villages, as she dared to invade no castle. But due to the rainy weather, which brought many diseases into the camp, it was not possible, which is why His Majesty wishes to station the army in garrisons in the towns so that they may rest a little and be better able to respond to or invade the enemy when they come. I have this from his letters, which I received one or two days ago, and in the same letters, he complains about the treaty made by the Swiss with the Duchy of Milan without his knowledge, about which I did not write; but the courier, who was carrying sealed letters to the Emperor, was intercepted by our men. Your letters, which you wish to be torn up, so that you may understand that I wish to deal with you in good faith, I will send to you, and although reading them is most pleasing to me, I would not want to keep anything that could be a disadvantage or offense to you, nor do I doubt that there are some who do not favor you sincerely, and I thank you for your friendship and goodwill towards me, and if I could repay such a benefit, I would do so gladly and sincerely. In your other letters, you write about Vergerius's letters, which you send to me; I would indeed like to satisfy him; but I have received no response regarding his business, although I have written often, and I think my letters are suspected on both sides, as they believe I favor the pious and promote their cause... I respond to him and advise that he have the matter handled through Lord Castiglione, the royal legate to the Rhaetians, which he will easily obtain. As for what you write about the Swiss, and that they are little concerned about the Emperor's army, contrary to custom, I have noted it diligently, and certainly, if they were wise, they should understand the Emperor's cunning and not allow the recruitment of soldiers to be gathered in their vicinity. But I see them fearing that the friendship between the French and the Germans is so close that they are neglected by His Majesty, and certainly, things sometimes happen that we fear, although I am convinced that His Majesty will maintain perpetual faith and friendship with the Swiss. If you hear any news, it will be pleasing for me to learn it through you; for here we hear nothing. Farewell. Basel, July 26, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Maurilius Musaeus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
