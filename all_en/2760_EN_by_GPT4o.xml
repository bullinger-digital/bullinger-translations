      <p>S. D. Yesterday evening your letter was delivered to me, venerable lord and dearest brother. However, I am compelled to respond to it barely having read it due to the opportunity of the couriers: therefore, I ask you to consider the brevity and haste kindly. For while doing this, I am also drawn to other matters. I gladly read your apology with which you have satisfied me, and furthermore instructed me so that I can also explain the truth to others against the slanders and lies of certain people. Continue to urge those things which are of peace and concord. For in this way, you will please God and all good people. However, there is something here that is especially important for you to know. I hear that a pamphlet has been sent here to the most honorable council by Perrin and his followers, in which they plead their case and strive to prove their innocence. For when the people of Basel and our own understood that Bern and Geneva were seriously at odds with each other, they wrote to Bern and requested to intervene as mediators among the dissenters. What response they received, I do not know. This I know, that our people will do everything to restore friendship. It would therefore be beneficial if your most honorable magistrate could promptly write a brief pamphlet in the German language about the actions of the entire unfortunate cause of the tumult, and send it here without delay. You should know that brevity is most pleasing to our people. I truly suggest this to you as to my intimate friend, and indeed from no one else's prompting. If my advice seems opportune, ensure that it is carried out without delay, but in such a way that there is no mention of me at all. I call God to witness that I seek and desire the safety of the church and the true peace of your republic to be promoted. Although you have written many things that are especially relevant here, they will be proposed with no particular benefit either by you or by me. Many things will be suspected by many.</p>
      <p>The matter of the oath has long tormented me and involved me in the greatest and most serious labors. I have written very frequently to Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, urging them not to allow our sincere religion and the adorable name of God to be profaned. And indeed, I have found faithful ministers everywhere, but in the Republic after the illustrious Bern, I understand there are few strong ones, or certainly few who consider this matter as it should be. They pretend that God is not offended if only the form is followed by the common people who take or conceive the oath, but those who perform it do not follow the saints of God by joining. I, however, instructed entirely by the scriptures, contend that it is unlawful to precede in our temples with a form that openly conflicts with God and true religion. Nor do the ministers and all good men feel otherwise. Meanwhile, many are found who themselves do not want to appear to be doing anything against the word of God, yet they do not consider it unlawful and therefore contend that it should be granted to their associates by all means. The contention is therefore serious. Nor do I doubt that we are authors and encouragers to our people not to profane the name of our God, especially in a matter so openly conflicting with the word of God, etc. We hear that at the Baden assemblies, the case has been postponed to another time because it could not be agreed upon by those fiercely contending on both sides. I pray to the Lord that we may always do what is pious, and that He may kindly settle this dissension.</p>
      <p>Westphal has now published a fourth book against us. He is considered a king among the blind. The last one especially labors to attack you. Therefore, I do not dislike your advice to respond to him modestly, to argue the case, and to pass over his person and the man's immodesty. I have also decided, if the Lord grants life, to respond to their main arguments and complaints: now, since I am occupied with a small work in which I expound the most important heads of true doctrine briefly, as many brothers are requesting and urging me, and I hope to publish it in a few days, I am compelled to defer my plan until then: then I will turn myself entirely to that labor, unless the Lord sees otherwise and the affairs of our church draw me elsewhere. Another certain patchwork maker has also emerged, the pastor of Bremen, Johannes Timannus, to whom our Johannes a Lasco has responded wisely and prudently. The book has been printed and perhaps now delivered and read to you. I have seen many foolish writings, but none yet more foolish than that one. I ask you, my lord and brother, if you continue to respond to Westphal, to use as much gentleness as possible. Now regarding that agreement, about which the most illustrious man Dr. Peter Martyr writes, I am compelled to agree with you entirely. It is certain that we will never have Bern and Basel (I could also count others) agreeing. But leaving these aside, I do not see whether anything else can be done with any benefit. If it seems absolutely necessary to write something of this kind, it would seem worthwhile to me if you would also expound the remaining doctrines in the manner in which you published the Defense of the Agreement, which have long been more copiously expounded in the books of the ministers of the Swiss churches and communicated in all books. But it would be necessary to inscribe and dedicate that exposition to the churches and the ministers of the churches of Upper and Lower Saxony, finally to the whole people, etc. But in this exposition, beware, my brother, and kindly consider what I suggest here, not to propose the matter of predestination in such a way that you remove all grace from the whole work and make yourself more hated than ever before. Therefore, I think it should be refrained from such expressions: that Adam was so created that he could not but sin: that those who sin do so entirely by the predetermined counsel of God. I was very pleased with what you once wrote against the Libertines, asserting that God is not the author of evils: that Stoic necessity conflicts with evangelical preaching. You also know what Dr. Melanchthon wrote about this cause. I see the entire antiquity in this cause, as in no other, teaching in agreement, that God is not the author of sin or evils: that sins arise from man, not by necessity but by will: that the promises of salvation are universal, not to be contracted to a few: that believers are saved by the mere grace of God: that unbelievers do not believe and are damned by their own fault, etc. I do not mention these things to teach you, but to remind you to be circumspect in this cause, lest a greater fire arise from predestination than from the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>I am now compelled to break off this writing of mine, which I ask you to kindly accept from your most devoted. Pray to the Lord for us. Live and farewell eternally with all yours, indeed ours. All my family, fellow ministers greet you and invoke a blessing from the Lord. Be of a tranquil mind, brother. Although we have many enemies, one God is a defense and protector for all. May He keep you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 2, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. B.</p>
      <p>Now Lysmanini, the minister, has returned from Poland, laden with letters. He says he brings good news. Those to whom I gave these letters did not want to wait until he was free. More about these soon. Farewell again. We hear that peace has now been granted to the Germans by the king: they will riot more confidently, etc. But God sees and cares for His own.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Dr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my honorable lord and most esteemed and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
