      <p>Our lord bailiff in the monastery has informed Mr. Pontisella and me that he was in Ilanz these days, where the bailiff of Katz, who has a son in France who is a captain, namely the one from Castelberg.</p>
      <p>This one has written from the camp to his father, who is a great papist, that Duke Wolfgang has forcibly driven the one from Aumale through his camp and united his forces with the Cond√©'s. It reportedly cost the Bipontine 600 men, but Aumale suffered a terrible loss, and two very distinguished lords had their horses shot under them. This is also confirmed by some good friends, who have great connections at the court in Haldenstein, that it has come to the lord from Solothurn, that the king's people were almost all slain. What is true, time will reveal. May 17, Chur, 1569.</p>
