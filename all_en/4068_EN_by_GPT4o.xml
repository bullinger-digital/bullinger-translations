      <p>Greetings. Last week (reverend father in Christ) I was unable to write, because I was struggling with many difficulties at once, from which I have now partly escaped by the grace of God. My wife had an extremely difficult childbirth, so much so that there was no hope left for her life. The child was not viable; for shortly after being brought into the light, it expired.</p>
      <p>You have the reason for my silence.</p>
      <p>Dr. Philippus then took on the task of writing and I have no doubt that his letters have been delivered to you. For the service you provide to both of us, we owe you the greatest gratitude; if only we could repay it someday. But since we give thanks so often, yet render nothing in return, it is something that shames us.</p>
      <p>The news brought from Rome is undoubtedly already known to you; for it also passed through you, who first announced it; yet because merchants sometimes must hurry and it could have happened that he flew past you without greeting, I have decided to include it here as well. The Pope is said to have expired on August 18th, with the Bishop of Bergamo, the Pope's chief steward and very close to him, having passed away the day before. After him, the Doge of Venice died; some add the death of the Patriarch of Venice. However, when it was already announced that the Pope had died, the Roman people made a great rush to the palace, and if they had not been stopped by guards, they would have thrown the half-dead Pope from the palace into the Tiber. When this did not succeed, they rushed to the prisons, broke them open, and freed a large number of the faithful (about four hundred) by force; meanwhile, they treated some of the inquisitors, who were in charge of the custody, in a fitting manner and smashed the skull of the chief among them, threw down the Pope's statue, and further defiled and disfigured it with mud and dung. While these things were happening, the arrival of Cardinal Carafa was announced; the furious people rushed out with guns and clubs to greet him, unless Carafa, having been warned, had taken precautions for himself.</p>
      <p>These are the things that are reported as certain and indeed from more than one place; however, you will consider them with your own eyes and see the retribution of the wicked. I had already written this...</p>
      <p>"If it is true what is said about the dragon, I, remembering you of Bremgarten, have ill omens for those parts. But what need is there for portents and omens, when our sins have long been portending our destruction? Everything is for sale. Magistrates themselves are appointed not by merit, but for a price.</p>
      <p>In those who profess to be evangelicals, supreme greed reigns. Unless God miserably preserved the church in these parts, it would have been over long ago. You see the greatest lukewarmness in people, all churches scattered, few suitable ministers, and if there are any, they do not have the means to live; if someone comes and agrees for less, a man of proven life and doctrine is expelled. There is nothing that torments me more day and night.</p>
      <p>I often wish for some corner where I could comfortably hide, and certainly, unless we threw the pious to the papists like prey, I would choose with your counsel. Yet I lift myself up and sustain myself by the example of the prophets and see the most certain destruction looming over us and I proclaim it; but there is no one who seriously repents.</p>
      <p>This I write, carried away by some frenzy." "who is now among us, whom you could truly call pious, who has exposed his soul for the gospel." Chur, September 4th, 1559.</p>
