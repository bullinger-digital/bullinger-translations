      <p>Greetings. When I began to excuse you to Lord Consul MÃ¼llner for not having written to the most honorable council, he replied that you had done your duty well enough and that there was no need for further writing; he wishes you well.</p>
      <p>His household is still healthy by the grace of God. On the 23rd of this month, the envoy from Cham left for the Prince of Savoy; he has burdened all goods passing from France to Switzerland through Savoy with new and very high taxes; everyone is complaining, etc. What he will achieve with the poor prince, who is nevertheless ruined by luxury and therefore scrapes together material for luxury from everywhere, will be shown by the outcome. I am returning the letters entrusted to me, enclosed with mine, and I thank you very much; I have copied the most important parts to send to Bern at the first opportunity. I urge once again that the God's House alliance should do everything with all skill and not delay, so that the other two alliances are united with you.</p>
      <p>You have no doubt observed in these letters from Castelmur that he says the adversaries only hope in those two alliances, etc.</p>
      <p>I entrust my business with Arnold's heirs entirely to you; I beg you not to be annoyed that I trouble you with it so often; henceforth I will say nothing more about it. Do as I trust you and know that you will do it.</p>
      <p>If possible, since it has been pending for a long time, I would like to have the money; for I am in need, etc. However, proceed as it may.</p>
      <p>Let me know alone whether I should stand with the other debtors here or not, as I last informed you, etc. I have no letters from France or elsewhere; the plague hinders.</p>
      <p>When I receive something, you will know.</p>
      <p>I sent letters to your relative through my son.</p>
      <p>I wrote nothing to the envoy; I did not know he had left Solothurn.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers, the consuls. October 26, 1565.</p>
      <p>The plague has also invaded my brother's house in Kapell. Your Bullinger.</p>
