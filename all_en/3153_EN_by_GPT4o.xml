      <p>To my most esteemed and revered Lord Bullinger, I, Friedrich von Salis, send greetings. After I came from Innsbruck and arrived in the province, I received two letters from you, a man and lord most commendable in every way. It is hard to express how much joy they brought me, especially since I learned that you, with your whole family and my little son, are well. However, you seem to complain that you have sent me two letters already, and I have not yet responded. I would indeed be surprised if I did not know that it often, indeed very often, happens that letters are lost due to the negligence of couriers, preventing them from safely reaching the hands of those to whom they are addressed. Indeed, my dear Bullinger, since I traveled to the Valtellina, the counties of Chiavenna and Bormio, I have written to you three times and have diligently informed you of what you ought to know. Certainly, as I have made you aware, there was much work to be done for the sake of religion. But truth has finally prevailed, as foreign monks have been expelled, and churches have been designated everywhere for the professors of the gospel, where the gospel is preached with the decorum it deserves. Moreover, it has been decreed that a church be built from the ground up on Mount Rovoledi, in Sondrio, the most famous place in the Valtellina, where there is a large number of people adhering to the gospel, as there was no other place there where a sacred assembly could be held. Furthermore, having discovered the plots of some who were trying to oppose the gospel with foreign money and favors, we punished the authors and removed all means of harm. In short, my colleagues have diligently strived to pave an easy way for the gospel. May the Lord God, who can do all things, through Christ Jesus, ensure that all this contributes to the promotion of God's glory, amen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am very delighted that you have written to me that my son is dear to you and your most honorable wife, because he is of good character, obedient to you and yours, and diligent in his studies. I give you immense thanks; for indeed, my excellent Bullinger, your writings have increased my expectations of the boy; for I do not think your judgment can err, as you are sincere in every way, do not know how to flatter, and possess sound judgment. Therefore, I receive your prediction about the boy with a very cheerful spirit and pray to God that he may become somewhat similar to you. I also acknowledge that I owe much to your most honorable wife, who so kindly cares for the boy; for my son himself (as you also) has often informed me of this. Although I may not fully repay as I should, I will do so in part. As for the boy being troubled by scabies, I am not at all surprised; for this often happens to boys traveling to foreign regions. But it would indeed be very pleasing to me if he were treated so that his skin becomes clearer, and I would certainly like him to visit the baths, provided that you or someone from your household accompanies him; for I do not care about those expenses, as long as they are spent for the boy's benefit at your discretion.</p>
      <p>As for your recommendation of Mr. Fabricius, the elected pastor of the Church of Chur, to me and indeed to all good people, he will certainly be most commendable to all, since he is recommended by you, such a great man whom everyone wishes to gratify. However, since I do not think I will travel to Chur until the upcoming Corpus Christi fair, I will at least offer myself to him entirely through letters and will diligently inform him of how worthily you remember him and how kindly you commend him, and I will indeed ensure that he feels (as far as I can) how much I am inclined to support you.</p>
      <p>If I had any news, I wrote to you recently when I was in Sondrio. The Turk is about to attack Austria with a large fleet. The Venetians are anxious on all sides and are preparing both land and sea forces so that they are ready for any sudden event in these perilous times. Regarding our soldiers who are serving in Italy, I have heard that they are in Rimini; however, the fact that they are not enjoying very favorable conditions seems to be indicated by the fact that some of our soldiers are returning from the military with letters from their commanders, which they call passports. I certainly fear that the same thing may happen to our soldiers that you seemed to fear when I was with you. We must pray to the Lord God to bring everything to a good end.</p>
      <p>My most delightful Lord Bullinger, I desire nothing more than to come there someday to enjoy your presence with the greatest joy, and if it does not happen sooner, I have certainly decided to travel there after the Corpus Christi fair and stay for a few days, God willing. Our Lord Travers, an elder venerable and incomparable in every way, received your greetings with a very grateful spirit and sends his greetings to you in return. Mr. Peter Bergomas does the same, and no less do my wife and all my household send their greetings to you and your whole family. Farewell.</p>
