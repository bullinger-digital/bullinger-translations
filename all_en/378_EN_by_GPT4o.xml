      <p>God's grace beforehand! Today around eight in the morning, Melchior Schlosser, the messenger of my lords from Zurich, brought me your letter; it arrived at night, and if he had handed over the letter to me sooner, I could have accomplished something further; because when the letter reached me, everyone was in the council, and therefore I could not speak to anyone about it. When I came to the town hall, my lords were sitting over the Zofingen decision, so I could not bring anyone out. Now the messenger is hurrying away again; I barely had time to come to my lord treasurer and to find out how things stood.</p>
      <p>He tells me this: My lords are not writing back to Zurich at the moment, because they are waiting to hear what further news will come from Zurich regarding the Basel matter. Otherwise, they are quite content; they have only postponed the matter, as they have now also written from my lords in Zurich, that they should write to Basel, that they should not send separate messengers, and whatever is raised with them, they will also inform my lords here in Bern. They want to wait for that now. A friendly letter would not have harmed; but it has been neglected this time, partly due to the messenger. Regarding the setting of this, my lords will be mindful; I will also insist with others.</p>
      <p>I would like to know something definitive about Blarer, likewise about Xystus; he has been approved here to be accepted, but there is still no answer. I ask you, if you have a message, to remind him on my behalf. Musculus' matter stands until we know something definitive from Blarer. Your Vocabulary will be ready this week; I will send you copies. I am sending you your council's advice, I have copied it. God be with you. Greet Mr. Lavater for me. My lord treasurer also sends his greetings to both of you; I have not yet been to the banneret. Greet your entire household from me and mine.</p>
      <p>Bern, 22nd of December, early afternoon.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and godfather, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, head of the church in Zurich.</p>
