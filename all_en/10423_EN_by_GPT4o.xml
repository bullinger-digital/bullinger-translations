      <p>As I have learned from a certain faithful man, Hans Heinrich, the pious, honest man, has not gone away as I thought, but has been detained (zurückgehalten wurde). The plan of the four appointed officials is to bring all dealings now to you, Bern, Schaffhausen, etc., in Baden on the day, so that perhaps common counsel may be taken regarding entering into an alliance with the Prince of Württemberg (Cheruscorum principe). I cannot know what the council will decide.</p>
      <p>Hope all is well. Will do my best. Yours truly.</p>
