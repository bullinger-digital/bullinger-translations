    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not written for a long time because there is a lack of messengers and [the people of Lausanne] are aware of both Bullinger's commitments and his poor health. An Italian merchant, who is now staying in Basel, has brought letters from his father and other friends of Curione from Italy, in which they ask for assistance in purchasing books in Zurich and Basel; however, Curione could not personally help him as he fell ill about twenty days ago and has not yet recovered; recommends Johannes Jakobus [...], the young merchant, and asks Bullinger to support him [in Zurich] with his book purchases at [Christoph] Froschauer. Curione is expecting the [Latin] Bible [translation] [“Biblia sacrosancta”] in a smaller format; he has some smaller works in preparation himself and will send them to Bullinger soon. Greetings, also from his wife [Margherita Bianca Isacchi], who recently gave birth to a little daughter [Angela], as well as from [Pierre] Viret and [Jean] Ribit.</p>

      <p>It has been a long time since I last wrote to you, and this is because few people come to us to whom we can properly give letters. Although this is true, we were also somewhat deterred from writing because we know you are very busy, occupied with great matters, and also afflicted by various bodily ailments and weak health. We learned this both from those present and from your letters. However, our goodwill and respect towards you have in no way diminished, which you have confirmed and strengthened with such great merits that it cannot be shaken by any length of time, distance, or circumstance. But I know your modesty and humility; therefore, I refrain from writing more about these things.</p>
      <p>However, I will pursue the matter for which this letter is written to you. A certain merchant from Italy, who is now in Basel, sent me letters from his father and his own, as well as from some great men, all of whom are very closely connected with me in friendship. They ask and urge that I be willing to be with this young man both in Zurich and Basel, so that under my guidance and direction, he may acquire a good collection of selected books. This indeed happens neither conveniently for me nor for this merchant, for about twenty days ago I fell into a dangerous illness from which I have not yet been freed; hence, I cannot satisfy either my own or his desire. They also requested in the letters that, if I could not undertake this journey, I should at least diligently recommend him to you, as they trust that my recommendation will carry significant weight with you. Therefore, I commend to you Johannes Jakob, this friend of mine and the son of a most friendly and excellent man, in such a way that I cannot commend him with greater zeal. For the young man is not at all familiar with these regions, and although you are occupied with far more serious matters—writing, teaching, preaching, overseeing churches, in which you surpass and leave far behind all your equals—yet I beg and beseech you to be a guide to this young man in acquiring the books he desires and to ensure that Mr. Froschauer, the diligent and good printer, provides him with all the conveniences that can and should be provided. For this merchant is one who will not only now and once purchase books from him, but often at other times, as he has a large, great, and well-established book trade in Italy and is a man of singular faith, who would rather die a thousand times than break his given word. Therefore, what I would do in person, you, with your humanity and singular zeal and goodwill towards good people, will do for my sake, and you will take up his business as if it were mine, which will be very pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>I was expecting the Bible in a smaller format than the first was printed. I do not know what has prevented it from being sent. But if you send me one volume (which I think can easily be done), I will immediately send you the price, whatever it may be. I also have some small works in preparation, of which I will soon make you a participant.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ Jesus. Greet Mr. Pellican, the most holy old man, Bibliander the most learned, and Megander, Gwalter the most charming, and Pinarius, the most diligent teacher and good man, and others who recognize us and to whom we owe something, especially Gesner, the most acute physician and philosopher. My wife also greets you and your wife with your children and the whole family, who recently increased me with a little daughter in the Lord. Viret and Ribit greet you. I indeed bid all farewell. Farewell again, most excellent and learned Bullinger, and love us.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, the day before the calends of December 1543. Celio Secondo Curione, yours from the heart, by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and equally vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, always to be respected brother. In Zurich.</p>
