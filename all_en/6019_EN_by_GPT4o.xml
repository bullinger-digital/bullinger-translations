      <p>Greetings. When I was leaving Augsburg, I had also decided to go to Zürich and to deliver these letters from Georg von Stetten to you in person, as if directly into your hands. However, I am hindered by the frequent intercessions of relatives and the persistent requests of my people, preventing me from following through with the plan and intention I had taken up. Therefore, I am sending them through the coachman along with the confession of Heiden, which I promised you some time ago. It would be very pleasing to both me and Stetten if you could reply to us at the earliest opportunity, indeed with this very messenger present, who is said to be returning here before Sunday, and whom I have decided to wait for. I would also like you to send me your smaller Latin catechism at the same time; for our Stetten has long asked me to consider acquiring it.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and give my regards to Gwalther, Betto, and your family in my name.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, January 18, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Matthias Schenck.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zürich, and a most esteemed friend.</p>
