      <p>Greetings. For the mutual bond we share, you diligently do what is necessary, that is, you commend our safety and that of all the French churches to the Lord with constant prayers. For this, we have great gratitude to you and the rest of your colleagues, as is fitting, and we ask you to continue more and more in this pious and especially in these times, so necessary a pursuit. For although, as far as we are concerned, we have heard nothing but threats, we nevertheless consider ourselves to be in no less danger in the person of our brothers than if we saw the swords of the enemies openly threatening our own necks.</p>
      <p>We receive letters from all places about what we have long foreseen and predicted, namely, that the audacity of the enemies, which the Lord had clearly blunted, is daily sharpened by the observed laziness and softness of some, so that there is nothing so monstrous that they do not dare, nothing so arduous that they do not aspire to. But in the meantime, we are not without consolation, namely, the invincible constancy of the brothers and the incredible progress of the churches, so that what we receive daily about these matters surpasses all belief and expectation.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, however, as is usual in turbulent times, sins are committed in various ways both within and without. In Lyon on the fifth day of this month, when that solemn procession of the god of the crustaceans was being carried, a certain man, I wish he had been as prudent as he was pious, openly rushed upon a passing priest from whom that holy wafer was being carried, knocked the idol from him, and strove with all his might to trample it underfoot. Thereupon a great tumult arose, with the priests sounding the alarm and the crowd raging blindly against anyone they met, as soon as someone began to defend themselves, or the name of Lutheran, or as they now say, Huguenot, was heard. In that tumult, many were cruelly wounded, sixteen were killed, and among them also some women, but most were papists: such was the rage of those Midianites. For our people, completely unaware of these matters, stayed at home that day, on which Satan especially reigns, so that none were caught in public by the enemies, except by chance.</p>
      <p>Among others, Bartholomäus Anulus, a schoolmaster from the public gymnasium, was dragged out as if he were a Lutheran, and was killed in the street with a spear thrust into his belly, a man utterly impious and deserving of any punishment. The man who had given rise to this tumult was barely rescued from the raging crowd by the public guards of the city, who had been stationed throughout the city to avoid tumult, and was soon brought before the judges. When asked on whose advice he had undertaken such a deed, he replied truthfully that he had communicated these plans with no mortal, except his wife, who had not prevented him from abstaining from this act. He said that after fasting and praying to God, he had been so confirmed in that will that he did not hesitate to expose his life to certain death for the sake of such an execrable idolatry. Nor, he said, do I regret the deed, but rather I am grieved that I could not alone designate the same thing in five places at once. For in that city, the idol is usually carried in procession in as many places at the same time.</p>
      <p>At first, his words were not believed, with the priests clamoring that this was a common conspiracy to oppress all Catholics, and they were seizing this opportunity to destroy the church. But the Lord saw otherwise.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when he persisted in simply narrating the whole matter, even under the gravest tortures proposed, and no probable conjecture of a common conspiracy appeared, he was condemned a few hours later and taken to execution. One of his hands was cut off, then he was strangled, and finally dissected into five parts, which were hung on as many gallows in different regions of the city. Some were captured in the tumult, and some time later, some were released, partly from the adversaries themselves, partly from our people, but most have now been released. No inquiry is decreed against those furious murderers, while we are meanwhile accused of sedition, although he, dying most steadfastly, absolved the church a thousand times. It was later decreed that the octave, as they call it, should be celebrated with the greatest solemnity for the sake of expiation. Whether this rage has rekindled on that day, we have not yet been able to understand.</p>
      <p>But it is indeed certain that it can hardly be prevented from eventually breaking out. In Paris, that most truculent senate, which has the highest authority in the kingdom, had promulgated a decree without the king's knowledge, ordering the lords of each house to hang tapestries, with the added penalty of confiscation of the houses, as they call it. Furthermore, it had decreed, on the eve of the procession, to offer a sacrifice of three holocausts to their illustrious god and to parade two of the weaker captive sisters in the procession itself. When these things were reported to the king's court (for the king was almost at the gates of the city), a milder edict was written by the royal council to avoid sedition, which easily broke all those cruel attempts. From these two examples, you can easily conjecture what storms are now in France. For although in most places, especially in Aquitaine and Normandy, the condition of the churches is much better, it is certain that the enemies are raging everywhere and are attempting some extreme measures. The king was anointed in Reims by the cardinal archbishop, quite peacefully, contrary to the expectations of many. Then he came to Paris, where a solemn procession is now being prepared to receive him in the usual manner, and soon in the town of St. Denis, which is near Paris, he will be crowned by the same cardinal abbot. If the adversaries remain quiet with such opportunities offered, and do not rather perpetrate what they have long been planning, we will have reason to give thanks to God. What the enemies are plotting is quite apparent, nor are there lacking means by which they can be hindered, but those in whom everything is placed conduct themselves in such a way that the Lord seems to have plainly decided to manage all these things by Himself outside the usual order. The estates of the kingdom have been summoned for the first of August, but under the most unjust and previously unheard-of conditions. For no free suffrages have been gathered through the individual metropolises according to the custom of the ancestors, but assemblies of selected citizens have been held through certain men, with all those who seemed likely to speak more freely about the governance of the kingdom or about religion being openly rejected by force. It is also added and expressly stated in the royal diploma that no other matter than the payment of the king's debt, to which he is bound, should be referred. It is said that the princes agree well about the authority of the queen, and that the matter of religion will be of the utmost concern to them after the accounts of that debt have been explained. From this, as far as can be conjectured, either a civil war must arise, or the most miserable servitude must be so confirmed that there is no hope of liberty unless God, outside the usual order, has mercy on that most miserable nation. You have, I think, from us what you requested in your last letters, about which we do not refuse to write back to those whom you think it concerns us to inform about all these matters. Moreover, what we asked of you at the beginning, namely, that you help us with constant prayers, you can now easily understand that we have rightly requested. Nor do we doubt that you, along with the rest of your colleagues, our brothers in the Lord, whom we hold in the highest regard, will abundantly satisfy our hope in this part. What remains, we pray the Lord to strengthen you more and more and to bless your holy labors.</p>
      <p>We wish D. Martyr and the rest of your colleagues well in return. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Geneva, June 16.</p>
      <p>Your Beza, in the name of Calvin and myself.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, brother and fellow minister, held in the highest regard. In Zürich.</p>
