    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius wrote to Vadian four days ago that Schwenckfeld, in the hope of reaching an agreement, wishes to have a conversation with Vadian and the [Zurichers]. Jakob Held [von Tiefenau], in his disposition and statements very much like Schwenckfeld, asked Myconius to write to Vadian and Bullinger about this, which Myconius promised to do. When one listens to Held, one gets the absurd impression that before Schwenckfeld, no one knew Christ. For Myconius, Schwenckfeld's teachings are repulsive anyway. He was forced more than once to write to certain noble Schwenckfeldian women, albeit not in his own name, but in that of their sisters. - Myconius advises caution; there are corresponding examples before our eyes. He leaves the rest to Bullinger's wisdom. - The Schwenckfeldian [Johannes] Bader has died in Landau. His successor [Johannes Liebmann] is an even greater follower of Schwenckfeld. - Since the Diet [of Worms], which was not a Diet, there is nothing new, but there is a rumor that 36 companies of Protestants are marching to [King Henry VIII of] England against [King Francis I of] France. An army of the Emperor [Charles V] prevents them from joining forces. - Myconius recommends the bearer [...]. Bullinger should forward the enclosed letters to their recipients. - Greetings to Konrad Pellikan and to Theodor [Bibliander].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote four days ago to Mr. Joachim about Schwenckfeld, expressing the hope and request that he wishes to have a conversation with him and with you, in the hope that this will lead to a healthy agreement. I wrote this because Jacob Held, who recently spoke with me in person, seemed to me to be the spirit and voice of Schwenckfeld. Therefore, after I agreed to his request, I did not want to give him the opportunity to accuse me of lying. This is also why I am now writing the same to you. Otherwise, the matter he is dealing with seems to be such that it would follow that no one knew Christ from the beginning of the world until Caspar Schwenckfeld; how absurd that is, there is no need for words! Indeed, I have so far been so repulsed by his doctrine that I could not even look at his books. Nevertheless, I was forced more than once to write against certain noble Schwenckfeldian letters, which were more than long enough, although not in my own name, but in the name of their sisters. However, whatever I may think, the aforementioned Held came and elicited what I am doing; in my opinion, three things must be carefully considered through consultation: the matter itself, the condition of Schwenckfeld, and the fact that he is seeking a conversation with us, that is, in Switzerland, besides those things which you can evaluate with your own prudence. There are examples at hand, which you know, from which you can be cautious. I want to present what I promised in these few words, and also my opinion, which is perhaps presented briefly and obscurely. What remains, I entrust to your wisdom and that of your people.</p>
      <p>Bader, the Schwenckfeldian (about whom you have certainly heard), has died in Landau, and he has been succeeded by someone who is much more of a Schwenckfeldian. May the Lord remove such scandals from His church and graciously grant the purity of His doctrines. Amen!</p>
      <p>There is nothing new after the Diet - not a Diet - has ended. However, there is a rumor that 36 companies of Protestants are marching to England against France; on the way, the Emperor's army is blocking them, so they cannot meet. What this means is beyond my understanding.</p>
      <p>May the bearer of this letter be commended. I also ask that you deliver my enclosed letters to their respective recipients.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with Pellican and Theodor. Basel, September 13, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most excellent and learned Antistes of the people of Zurich, his venerable friend in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
