      <p>Greetings. I sincerely congratulate your kindness, most illustrious man and most revered father in Christ, that the Lord has restored you safe and sound from the baths, as I hear, to His church, and I pray to God through the Son with all my heart, that He may deign to preserve you, the best and most beloved father of the homeland, for many more years. Amen.</p>
      <p>I then beseech your kindness, if it is decided that the opinions of the fathers which I have collected are to be published, that those which are printed in Latin may soon be sent to me to be translated into the vernacular. For I perceive that the monster of ubiquity in the matter of the supper also smiles upon some among us, who, although they profess not yet to fully agree with the German writings of the WÃ¼rttembergers which they read, nevertheless try to disturb the minds of the simple with their tricks. For although, as I also indicated before, I have translated well over half of the booklet into German, yet, because I have no such example as I sent, with which I may exactly compare what has been translated and complete the rest, I therefore greatly desire to have it.</p>
      <p>What the state of affairs is among the most miserably afflicted Belgians, you, I believe, know better than I do. I send, if you do not have them, the dreadful anathemas of the Spaniard, with which he almost overwhelms the wretched members of Christ. But, since nothing violent is perpetual, therefore new tumults are reported, and a new army is perhaps being recruited in our vicinity under this pretext, but perhaps destined for a far different end.</p>
      <p>It is said that Mr. Victorinus is called from Amberg to the professorship of ethics at Heidelberg, and about the meeting of certain princes there, which I only hear about, your kindness will undoubtedly not be unaware.</p>
      <p>Everything would be quite safe with us, if not for the importunity and foolish envy of a few, which attempt to impede and disturb many things, which evils, however, we hope can gradually be removed and obliterated by moderation and brotherly patience. If the extreme dangers and calamities of others affected us equally in the way they ought, we would indeed embrace and cherish our churches with far greater zeal and eagerness for concord than, alas, is commonly done. But God will also someday set a limit and end to these evils.</p>
      <p>I wanted to indicate these things briefly, lest I write nothing, and I beseech your kindness to keep us commended in your daily prayers. I commend to your kindness the diligent people of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I greet all the brothers with the utmost reverence in my name and that of my fellow students. Given on the 3rd of July in the year 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted to your kindness, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
