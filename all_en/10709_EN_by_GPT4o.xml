    <p xml:id="regest1">At the upcoming Bundestag in Schmalkalden, there will be discussions about a theologian convention; the people of Strasbourg have therefore written to Luther and mentioned [the Swiss] in a friendly manner. Praises the restraint shown by the people of Zurich with the postponement of the publication [of Bibliander's "Apologeticus"]; the concord benefits further from the fact that [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] no longer dares to take advantage of the discord against [King] Ferdinand. The people of Frankfurt are in distress because of the governor of the Archbishop of Mainz: [The council] allows mass and priests in the St. Bartholomew's chapter, and a secretly negotiated treaty includes concerning conditions for a provisional peace; the people of Strasbourg have opposed this. In view of the planned council, mercenaries are already being recruited, and the Emperor is now free to turn against the Protestants; only in unity can they stand with God's help. The moderation [of the people of Zurich] pleases Capito; although the truth necessary for salvation must be upheld at the risk of life, not every truth has the same weight. A renunciation of the publication of their defense will earn them praise. [The people of Strasbourg] are preparing the imperial cities for the cross, which [the Swiss] will hardly be spared. [Johannes] Brenz should not be provoked by careless remarks. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>The princes and cities of the Christian federation will meet at the festival of St. Nicholas in Schmalkalden, where there will be discussions about establishing a colloquium of scholars who are in the ministry of the word among them, to get to know each other more closely. For mutual appeal seems to have some significance for closer friendship. Our senate also considered this matter, and Luther seems inclined to it as well. We have written to Luther about this matter, so that in the meantime he may consider the place, the number, and the names of those to be summoned, and advise his close friends of his opinion. In this, we have made a friendly and honorable mention of you, as we usually do, to show our utmost friendship, as it truly is. No quarrel has arisen so far, without us suppressing any suspicion of it on both sides. I saw certain evidence of this in our last meeting.</p>
      <p>To me, or rather to our senate, you have undoubtedly sent a beautiful invention destined for the press. You can easily guess how much this moderation of spirit commends you to good people, as you have long been familiar with letters and matters, which most hold the human spirit. Concord proceeds skillfully; for a certain prince, for whom the discord was advantageous and glorious with Ferdinand, now no longer dares to pretend it.</p>
      <p>The people of Frankfurt are now in great danger because of the lieutenant of the Archbishop of Mainz. They have agreed to accept the mass and the priests of the St. Bartholomew's chapter. Where peace is to be restored and what was secretly negotiated is to be brought to light, such captious articles are mixed in that they see nothing but, along with external war, also internal, that is, the destruction of the city. One article was that the citizens should not be forbidden to hear their masses, nor should any of the preachers wish to attack from the pulpit anything that the priests perform in their profane rites. Meanwhile, the archbishop is to grant peace until the emperor and Ferdinand reconsider what was given, yet preserving the rights of the Golden Bull, etc. The preachers have shown great confidence, boasting of the Herculean strength of their own, even though we knew what their oligarchs were secretly plotting. We have opposed their efforts through those who are strong in authority, etc. It would be a great calamity if anything adverse to such a great republic and piety should happen. What do friends and brothers say against this? I do not dare to indicate even in passing by letters, what I usually reveal in person.</p>
      <p>The council they are preparing will convene with a spirit of fortitude and will continue in the same spirit. For they are now beginning to bid for soldiers prepared for this. It will be a just army, a regiment of soldiers; although the wages are not yet agreed upon, hope has certainly been given. The sharpest weapon, necessity, will finally unite us; for they assign this summer to extinguishing us, with the emperor free from external wars. What, I ask, would benefit the enemy as much as domestic discord? I do not see: What hope of victory, if we were to meet the mass of the enemy's army, and indeed the most well-equipped, divided against ourselves in three wedges, rather than strengthened in one line, not to say equal it, but not even to withstand its first impact, if indeed the matter were to be accomplished by our own strength. But we must be certain that the help of the Lord will not fail us, united in Christ. He is a father, he will not let his beloved children perish, whom he considers as his own or even as the most bitter enemies fighting among themselves with harsh hatred.</p>
      <p>I know, my Bullinger, with what gentleness of spirit you are endowed, and I rejoice in this, that unlike others, you do not complain about this, as long as the essence of religion remains: We defend the truth, we rely on the scriptures, the adversaries err disgracefully, and the like. For it is common and obvious for everyone to boast of truth, scripture, the consensus of antiquity, and to burden the antagonist with the charge of heresy. Nevertheless, truth requires the constancy of professing it, which we will maintain to our last breath, with Christ's favor. But what truth? For not every truth is to be attested with life and blood, but only that which is necessary for salvation. Otherwise, death would have to be faced for the true doctrines of philosophers, because all truth is from God. With this moderation, let us, I pray, overcome our adversaries, who strangely insult others with the devastation of truth and scriptures, as if we were teaching mere dreams, who truly teach Christ the Savior and through us is believed to be the Savior by the churches. For we have the testimony of our calling in the conscience of the churches.</p>
      <p>I hope you have changed your mind about the Apology. Soon it will be that those who were our common accusers will praise you. Such praise we will deserve in silence, my Bullinger.</p>
      <p>We in the imperial cities are strengthening our spirit against the cross, which you will hardly escape. But it will be salutary for both of us.</p>
      <p>I pray, do not name Brenz as if he were suspect to us, lest his otherwise irritable nature be provoked to greater anger. I hope to mitigate it with our gentleness and tolerance.</p>
      <p>I bid farewell to Bibliander, Pellican, Erasmus, and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, November 2. Basel.</p>
      <p>V. Capito.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his brother to be respected in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
