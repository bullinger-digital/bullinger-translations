      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I earnestly ask you, my dear Zwingli, to briefly open your mind to me and explain what it means that we confess Christ descended into hell. For there are not a few among the learned today who invent strange things here, meanwhile tormenting themselves no less and leaving eager readers unsatisfied.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Huldrych Zwingli, dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
