      <p>To the most deserving, most illustrious man and most esteemed lord and dearest brother, I cherish you for those most excellent gifts with which I see you endowed by the Lord and for your love towards me. It is very pleasing that the discussion about the blessed seat is postponed to another time, when through the power of Christ we shall enjoy that ineffable glory. It is very pleasing that we maintain the harmony and friendship, with which the divine spirit has united us, intact between us. Therefore, continue to love us who love you dearly.</p>
      <p>Farewell eternally together with the entire choir of the most learned and pious men who are there with you, to whom I beseech you to commend me. ZÃ¼rich, 10th February 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
