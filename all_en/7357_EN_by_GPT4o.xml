      <p>New reports come daily in great number and variety, but how truthful they all are, I cannot confirm; for when one starts a war, according to the common saying, one begins... However, these are the most certain ones that have come to my lords in this manner:</p>
      <p>Firstly, a prominent lord from Paris writes to the governor of Lyon (the letters are, however, intercepted and copied; a copy has come to my lords); their content is that the king in France was stationed at a place, the name of which I cannot recall, where he received a warning that a group of cavalry was present, and that he should be on his guard.</p>
      <p>There he quickly allied with the Swiss Confederates and set out for Paris; but as he was on the way, the cavalry met him, whom he evaded and, with the help of the Swiss Confederates who charged at them, held them off until the king could escape. The next day, the king arrived in Paris, and the same lord also writes where the king stayed the night and at what hour he arrived in Paris the following day; he writes nothing further about the Swiss Confederates than what was reported and that they also arrived in Paris thereafter.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Frenchman in Solothurn also writes to my lords, mentioning no particular battle or encounter. Some say (though I do not know how reliably) that each of the mentioned cavalrymen had a foot soldier behind him, and after they fired, they turned around; then the ones behind also fired.</p>
      <p>Another person (who is otherwise well known to me) writes extensively to my lords about how the Huguenots, as they are called, have taken Calais, as well as all of Picardy except for Saint-Quentin. Also, that the king fled to Paris, where he is besieged, and they have the Seine River blocked both upstream and downstream, as well as all the mills, so that nothing can come into the city, and it is believed they will conquer it in a few days. The Huguenots have also stormed and conquered Orléans, losing 2000 men in the process. Similarly, they have taken all of Dauphiné up to Grenoble. Also, the papists from Lyon have moved down towards Vienne, but have been driven back, so they had to retreat, now lying between Vienne and Mâcon, which the evangelicals also hold. Toulouse is also said to be taken by the one from Monluc, who was papist in the previous war, but is now on the evangelical side.</p>
      <p>There was also someone here recently who said that the evangelicals have taken Avignon in Provence (belonging to the pope).</p>
      <p>It is also written that there is a new uprising in Flanders; for all of Flanders is said to be up against the Duke of Alba because he executed Egmont and Horn; the English are also supporting them; they have taken the port known as Le Havre. In Burgundy, it is certain that there is a large armament for the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Savoy has a treasurer here, Graneri, who was a city clerk in Thonon; he reports that the duke wants to remain neutral in the matter; he does have some pension and agreement with the king to maintain 100 cuirassiers if he demands it; he has sent them to Lyon, but otherwise does not want to get further involved. He asks my lords to lend him several thousand crowns, promising to repay them so that he would have the money for the land; but nothing comes of it but promises and good intentions. Regarding his armament, my lords are informed differently by others, namely that he has appointed 20 captains to recruit a certain number of soldiers here and a certain number of cavalry beyond the mountains.</p>
      <p>It is said that the emperor is taking the matter seriously in Germany, preventing the German cavalry from coming to France.</p>
      <p>Various things are said about them, that they are already on the move and the king is also recruiting German cavalry, and that a large force is gathering in Germany; but we know nothing specific about this.</p>
      <p>Three horses loaded with idle gold are said to be coming to Solothurn, to raise a new uprising of the Swiss Confederates, etc.</p>
      <p>My lords have issued a strict prohibition under penalty of severe punishment, forbidding anyone to join this campaign, but instead to prepare and wait for them.</p>
