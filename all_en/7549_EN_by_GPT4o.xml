      <p>Greetings. If it is permissible to suspect like friends, most esteemed and revered father, I see that we are daily attacked and surrounded by internal treacheries; everything seems to happen contrary to what reason and all fairness demand. I have often written to you about our envoys returning from Milan, especially about Baptista von Salis, the captain, who, before this misfortune occurred, was reportedly at the service of the leader of the assassins, namely the monk from Plurs, more than once. Although he denies this most steadfastly and calls the narrators of this story thieves and robbers, he has nevertheless clearly revealed himself in his role; I call the role the office of the legation, which he recently imposed on himself quite shamelessly by promising much for the redemption of Cellarius. But why did the Rhaetians choose someone else besides him, who promised golden mountains, as if he had Cellarius in his power, and secretly sought the legation? But listen, I pray, with what vigor he executed that very thing. Hardly had he returned home when two golden spurs and a necklace of three hundred gold coins followed him, that is, he was declared a knight by the pope, as a reward, of course. I certainly did not see the insignia; but I learned this to be so from the faithful report of Mr. Charles and other men. If indeed that honor (which the devil may favor him with, from whom it originated) was offered to him at this time, surely, what this means is well understood by both the just and the unjust. But the origin of this vice is widespread and in many, so much so that hardly a trace of the old Rhaetian integrity appears. - This is indeed a horrendous story and song; but it is echoed by what Mr. Campell also writes to you: that the entire Lower Engadine openly boasted that it belonged to our Austrian, when they recently sent a legation of about 20 horsemen to Zernez, a place in the Lower Engadine, under the pretext of inspecting a certain large forest. He claims the ground and soil in the Lower Engadine and says it belongs to the County of Tyrol. The sum is: these conspirators move every stone to make a passage for themselves through our Alps into Germany and France, nor have those immense sums of money cooled down, which the Spaniard recently poured out in vain to gain passage through the Rhaetians. - To this diabolical harmony, it will also contribute (which I forgot to describe in our splendid legation), that when they passed through Chiavenna, they issued a mandate that was not a mandate: that the people of Chiavenna should not henceforth receive or elect any minister unless known to all, that is, tolerable to the papists and not an exile, such as Mainardus, Zanchus, Lentulus, learned men. They would rather appoint leaden donkeys, who would feel nothing and not work against the papist cause, and thus gradually the entire worship there would cool and be extinguished. Mr. Charles told me this in secret; when I know more fully, I will let you know. However, it is certain that this was not commissioned by the higher magistrate. They also say that a certain weaver, a townsman of Chiavenna, a good and honest man, when he went a little further, was caught around the doors and boundaries and taken away, and it is not permissible for anyone to wander, indeed it is hardly safe and without danger to look out of the window. Meanwhile, all our princes snore and sleep the sleep of Endymion. That report, which has not yet thundered in the rostrum, is also being deliberately prolonged.</p>
      <p>What will finally happen, I do not know; I will know that present destruction is at hand. - The best God has also revisited us with the scourge of the plague, by which a certain grown girl recently perished, and the host and the rest of the family took flight for their safety.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, no one cared for the funeral. Finally, the gravedigger entered the house at night and carried her out, who now, locked in the closed house, does not dare to return to the hospital, of which he was a member. And unless my mind deceives me, my maid has also been seized by that disease.</p>
      <p>I would pray to God more often, that I might be second, if not for the abundance of my children, misery, and burdensome poverty that want me to survive... The plague has also now claimed not a few in Maienfeld, as Mr. Brunner, who has long since recovered, writes to me. - As for the business you sent, truly great and to be highly valued, we give you great thanks for your labors and intercessions or finally for your exhortations to do duty. It would befit our people to contribute not a little, if they were not hindered by avarice. Mr. Charles is absent; but I have discussed everything with Mr. Consul, who will bring it to the council tomorrow. He does not want to assert what can be hoped for; however, he promises his efforts in every way. That nobleman from Ramschwag recently asked for 400 gold coins as a loan from our senate; but because he is not wealthy at this time, that good man suffered a refusal. They also recently lent our bishop 2000 gold coins. As for individual persons, I would promise nothing; for most favor the papal religion, which is strong with money and present aids. They would rather help Albano, if he needed it. I certainly will spare neither labors nor even time, provided that all are educated and inflamed, whom I know to be more favorable and auspicious to the good cause. On the first occasion, I will make sure you know what can be done; now certainly it could not be done otherwise. Therefore, let that most esteemed man Mr. Tathenus forgive and hope only well with us. Tomorrow I will write (if I am well) to Davos, to the Rucantian Valley and to the Engadine, so that, if there are any of better clay and estimators of the present necessity, they may not reluctantly contribute their efforts and resources not so much for them as for us. - It remains, lest you be unaware: that the archpriest Bartholomeus Saliceus, namely our other bishop, is now a member of the cardinal order by the pope's witchcraft, his greatest friend and compatriot. But our blessed bishop recently sought the baths of Fabbri. When Captain Remigius von Schauenstein also accompanied him, he encountered the peasant Ragaz, who very severely demanded from him the payment and settlement of the remaining soldiers' wages. When he refused and boasted that he owed nothing to anyone, they tore the cannon from the saddle and would have added blows, unless he promised a guarantee for the remaining wages with payment. After long and much resistance, he was finally forced to give a guarantee or be diminished by the head. It cannot be said how much that man incurs the hatred of all. But thus the Lord is accustomed to repay his enemies."</p>
