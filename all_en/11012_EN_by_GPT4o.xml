    <p xml:id="regest1">Doubts that the sharp response that Leo [Jud] directed at the joint letter from the Basel pastors to Gryn√§us will be supported by Jud's colleagues; if the admonition, based on concern for the state of the church, to judge Bucer fairly is received so unfriendly, there is nothing left to write. Sends the letter that Luther sent to the mayor [Jakob Meyer]; believes that Luther can be trusted without danger.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The brothers wrote to Leo and thus to you; Leo responds to Dr. Grynaeus, not to the brothers, which we consider fair and good, not because the brothers, except for me, read the letters, but because they received a response from Grynaeus to the letters we sent together. I wonder if Leo was instructed by your counsel to write so fervently. He criticizes us as well as Bucer, although we do not wish, as he says, to preempt your judgment on Bucer's writings; but lest, if he has erred, we neglect the well-being of the church, which seems to happen when you do not appear to be sufficiently fair to him. Setting aside emotion, which sometimes also seizes and draws me against Bucer, I do not see otherwise, where he has committed such a sin that should not be forgiven for his labors, diligence, friendly spirit towards us, and for firm and true ecclesiastical concord. Let each one abound in his own sense; for after Leo writes: "We will bear Bucer; just do not force us to subscribe, just do not provoke our patience with so many letters" - and yet nothing of the sort came to our mind; for whether we wanted to compel or fraternally admonish, our letters, I think, sufficiently testify. Then, because he cannot bear that your patience is provoked by our letters, whom we tried to appease, not provoke, and for this reason we entrusted the task of writing to Grynaeus, lest I, being inept, err somewhere - after he writes thus, I say, and does not accept the fraternal letters otherwise, and you remain in the same opinion, indeed I would easily refrain from writing either about this matter or others. However, I am still of the opinion that his letters are not common; for brothers, who are truly brothers, should not address any of the brothers in such a manner. These things to you alone, to you alone, I say, although briefly.</p>
      <p>I am sending Luther's letter to our mayor. You will judge. I am pleased with it in every way, and I trust the man; especially since it is allowed without our danger. If he deceives, he will deceive himself, not us.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, Basel, March 14, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of Zurich, brother in his Lord.</p>
