    <p xml:id="regest1">[Simon] Sulzer declared before the council that he was only involved in responding to a request from the pastors of Montbéliard because of his visit to [Guillaume] Farel, as were [Pierre] Viret and [Andreas] Zebedäus; the articles adopted in Neuchâtel were drafted with regard to [Count Christoph of Montbéliard] and were not intended for introduction in Bern or elsewhere; after hearing the aforementioned, the council threatened them with dismissal in case of repetition. Beat [Gering] preached in a questionable manner about the eating of Christ [in the Lord's Supper] after Pentecost and previously declared on Ascension Day that quarrelsome people would argue with the ascension of Christ in the sacrament dispute; when Rümlang confronted him on the street about this as an attack on the deceased Franz Kolb, Gering became angry but refrained from filing a complaint. At Martinmas, he demanded an examination [before admission to the Lord's Supper] in a sermon and justified this in a hearing before the council by referring to the common catechism examinations, attacking Schultheiß [Hans Franz] Nägeli and presenting, among other things, certificates of departure from Bullinger and Theodor [Bibliander]. After Gering left the hall, Rümlang criticized his sermons before the council and declared himself ready for a confrontation; since the council then decided to strictly admonish Gering, Rümlang is now being opposed. Sulzer threatened him that the pastors would defend themselves together, but Rümlang knows he is in agreement with Erasmus [Ritter], whose Christmas sermon on the Lord's Supper was well received, and trusts in God. He let Sulzer know that he wants to oppose their doctrine, supported by his knowledge [of the Fathers] and the Holy Scripture, and considers it Eutychian. The pastors also disliked that he, in his function as a print censor, prohibited the already begun printing of the commentary on the Corinthians by Sebastian [Meyer], with [Hans Rudolf] von Graffenried supporting him against [Anton] Noll and [Peter] Kunz. In view of Luther's defamatory letter to Froschauer and as a counterbalance to Bucer's efforts, he proposes a delegation from the Zurich council to [the reformed cities of the Confederation], which should also include Bullinger, Erasmus Schmid, and Gwalther; in this way, a unified doctrine of the Lord's Supper could be achieved in Bern and the Confederation. Possibly, a convention of theologians could also counteract Bucer's machinations and Myconius; Rümlang asks for a statement and has sent this messenger specifically for this reason (and because of a payment to [Konrad] Gessner). He shares a letter from [Pierre] Toussain to the Bernese pastors, in which they are asked for a statement on the planned introduction of the Württemberg church order [in Montbéliard]; Sulzer's statement on the Neuchâtel articles thus appears implausible, and a countermeasure is all the more necessary. He urges for a response again; the Bucerans are exerting increasing pressure. Kunz is seriously ill. Greetings. He has not yet been able to forward books and letters to Lausanne; Celio [Secondo Curione] is still alive.</p>

      <p>May grace and peace be multiplied from God.</p>
      <p>I believe you have been eagerly awaiting the outcome of the Neuchâtel articles, most honorable Bullinger; after much back and forth, the matter has been resolved in this way, in which I was also involved. As soon as the smaller council received those articles, they demanded an explanation from Sulzer, who was compelled to give it before two hundred people. He explained that he only wanted to visit and greet Farel in Neuchâtel during the autumn study break and had no knowledge of these articles. When he arrived at Farel's, he said that it was timely, as some other brothers, namely Viret and Zebedäus, were also present; the articles had come to them from the brothers in Montbéliard, who requested advice because the Duke was pressing them, and they considered it unjust not to assist the brothers with counsel. Therefore, they advised that since the Duke was pressing, who still had a papistic inclination, they should accept them in such a way that they always maintained the doctrine, so that no hope was placed in them, and they should have regard for Christian liberty. Thus, these articles were not made to be imposed here in Bern or in other freer churches, and he swore by the highest oath and sought forgiveness if he had erred. The decision was suspended until both Viret and Zebedäus were called, and after hearing them, it was decreed that they should all cease from drafting such and other articles unless the matter was first reported to the council, and whoever did not comply would be prohibited by the council from preaching; for they were very displeased with those articles. Thus, they were completely silenced among us.</p>
      <p>As for Beat, after the Pentecost festival, he gave a sermon on the threefold eating, in such a way that it led to the nullification or weakening of faith; for he insisted that eating was necessary for faith, and that we must eat the divinity of Christ (behold the abstraction in the Trinity), and he urged eating in such a way that it seemed to me, if such eating were necessary, a new article of our faith would have to be inserted into the symbols, etc. On Ascension Day, the same Beat, explaining the article of faith about the ascension of our Lord Christ, asserted that quarrelsome people would use it in the sacramental dispute. All these things troubled me greatly and disturbed me not a little, and it happened that on the third day after the sermon on eating, he met me. I spoke with him about the sermons he had given and said that it was unjust to attach the voice of a quarrelsome person to Franz Kolb of blessed memory, a peaceful man, who had used this article of our faith in a disputation held here to establish the truth, and that he did not deserve to be called a quarrelsome person after his death; therefore, he had acted unjustly. And when he became angry, which was betrayed by his pallor and faltering words, the trembling of his lips and gesticulation of his hands, I added and urged him to spare himself; that I did not delay his anger, which would be harmful to him, not to me, and that I did not fear him angry, as I am not an inexperienced or untrained soldier and have encountered angry people, yet by divine grace, they have been able to do nothing against me, etc.</p>
      <p>And to make him feel even more that I did not fear his anger, I told him to his face that on Pentecost he had given a sermon against the divine word, against the Bernese disputation, and against the decree of the two hundred, to which he had promised to comply and had bound himself by his given and pledged faith. Finally, with great indignation, he departed from me, which even some standing at a distance noticed. I was expecting him to summon me to court or the council; perhaps he refrained, distrusting his own cause.</p>
      <p>But when Sulzer was called by the smaller council to account for the Neuchâtel articles and before the matter was reported to the two hundred, Beat again gave a rather importunate sermon at our Martinmas fair and, among other things, pressed for an examination, calling it Christian. "And if such were instituted here, how do you think," he said, "many would be established and confused?" The council also summoned him and wanted to refer the matter to the two hundred along with Sulzer's case. But because Sulzer had used a long apology, Beat's case was postponed to the next day. When we convened, he was called and began a rather harsh defense, where I also seemed to be slandered. He attacked the consul Nägeli not without pretense. He also presented testimonial letters of his departure from Zurich, yours too, Bullinger, and Theodor's, and boasted not a little about them. I believe he had heard some rumor about his misdeeds being spread. And regarding the examination, he claimed to have taught well, because we are convicted by our public action, namely the children's catechism, that a proper examination is necessary and should be held, etc.</p>
      <p>After a long speech, with many things related that did not contribute to the matter, only to make a show and obscure the issue, when it was finally over and he had gone out, I rose and reported that his defense was very inconsistent with the sermon he had given, which was then criminal and most importunate and did not agree with today's excuse, and I proved in what matters it consisted. Having settled this, I added what he had spoken on Ascension and Pentecost, and that I had confronted him about them; since he remained silent, I would not remain silent, but would prove that he had acted against the divine scriptures, our disputation, and the decree of the two hundred, and among other things, I also refuted most of the Neuchâtel articles with scriptures, saying that such and as many as could be devised in the future, if they proceed from human pleasure, not scriptures, are altogether an abomination before God, if they are imposed on churches, which ought to please God. And when I supported my words with scriptures and some burst out saying I was speaking in the manner of disputants, Beat should therefore be called, so that he could also respond; (Anakoluth) to which I added that I desired nothing else than that he be called; that I had said all these things openly to his face and would say them again, as often as they wished, and requested that Beat be brought to me for disputation, and if I did not overcome him, I would submit to the magistrate's punishment. After I had finished, opinions were asked, and there were two: one, that he should be sent away altogether, because he had acted badly, etc., the other, that no one could deny that he had erred and acted badly and importunately, and that his excuse did not agree with the sermon, and therefore he deserved to be sent away, but for the sake of our honor, it should be forgiven him once with a severe admonition, that he should be more cautious in the future and preach for edification, not destruction.</p>
      <p>This opinion prevailed. And because the council did not consider Beat well excused, they pursue me with the most bitter hatred and cast all blame on me, also attacking me with clandestine schemes (but God will protect me), and because they cannot detract from the cause, they detract from me, as if I had acted unbrotherly by bringing such a grave accusation against a brother.</p>
      <p>To this, which you write about the sermons, Sulzer also spoke with me, asking what impels me to pursue them so. When I openly stated the cause, he said that the doctrine was not Beat's alone, but all of theirs, and they would therefore defend the doctrine together. I said I did not care about the rabble, and unless Sulzer ceased, I would reveal his propositions made in the colloquy, which seemed to me to be against the sacred scriptures and the writings of the orthodox fathers; I also affirmed that their confession submitted to the council, which they now impose on many brothers in the field, was insufficient; therefore, I did not fear, if they all stood together, that I would be content with Erasmus alone, who on the day of the Nativity gave a celebrated sermon on the sacrament of the Eucharist with the greatest attention of the whole church, where a great multitude of people also communicated, which greatly troubles the sarcophagi. We are waiting to see what will happen with the upcoming festivals, where we also celebrate the Lord's Supper. In the meantime, I bear all the envy of the somaphagi, who are agitated with furious rage, so that they cannot forgive and be appeased, and on any occasion they can, whether by right or wrong, with this cause concealed, they will plot harm against me. Yet I give thanks to God for my innocence, in which he protects me, that they will find nothing disgraceful in me, and because I am free and do not want to and cannot flatter, they will perhaps promote not a little among many; for such honeyed words deceive many without examining the cause, etc. But whatever they plot, I will be secure, committing myself to God, my protector.</p>
      <p>I also told Sulzer that unless they desist from pursuing me with words and writings about their opinion on the presence of Christ and the last chapter of Matthew, which they cite to establish their own, I will pursue them, and I have not a few things prepared, as I am somewhat practiced in the reading of the orthodox, and I know the rules of Cyril and Hilary about the dispensation, what is said about Christ, to be weighed, according to what it is said, lest there be confusion of natures, about which the scripture speaks distinctly many times, to this the testimony of John the Baptist, also of Christ himself from David, who called him Lord, cited, to this the ancients and also the more recent ones have interpreted the last saying of Matthew about the Holy Spirit, the power of Christ, protection and patronage: Christ does not leave us orphans, etc., therefore it is wrong to extend humanity to the mode of divinity; for it is sufficiently established how one can follow the other. For wherever Christ the man, who is God and man, was, whether in the virginal womb or on the cross or in the tomb, it can be said that God was there because of the personal union. But not conversely, properly speaking, and only because of the communication of idioms are the former expressions admitted; for man is finite, but God is eternal; and that man is not extended to the mode of God, the words of the angels at the tomb to the women from the resurrection of Christ, when he already had a glorified body, and after the ascension to the Galileans testify. Therefore, they are imposing an unusual doctrine and one conforming to the opinion of the Eutychians, and they should be admonished to cease, and also to be reproved, so that they may understand and acknowledge, etc.</p>
      <p>There is also another reason, most learned Bullinger, why I have greatly offended our preachers: Dr. Sebastian read here for the colloquy the epistle to the Corinthians and entirely without any mention of the word "ministry" or "symbol" he reported that we drink from the cup, which the minister offers, the very blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which flowed from his side as he hung on the cross. And because he had repeated this not once and similarly affirmed about the bread that it is the body of Christ, expressing emphasis through demonstrative pronouns, etc., when they were trying to have this printed here, so that we might at least be considered Lutherans from the published works, when they were offered to me for review, as I am also appointed by the council to examine what is committed to the press, I examined the opinion and prohibited it and did not want Apiarius to proceed. Sulzer acted as the corrector, and although six pages had been printed without my knowledge and, as if I had little power, the preachers wanted to break through, I resisted and forbade and ordered Apiarius to desist, otherwise he would find that even after the book was completed, everything would be taken from him, and he would also have to pay a fine. Conzenus approached me, pleading: "Allow it to be printed; we will be together and protect you." I said: "I do not want to admit anything against my conscience, which would lead to the deception of the truth." Because of this, they are also gravely agitated against me; for one senator, the standard-bearer von Graffenried, sided with me, but Noll sided with Conzenus, and they did not dare to refer it to the council. They took away the printed pages and I do not know where they sent them; but they had not yet reached the matter of the Supper, which is also not a slight cause for them to pursue me, etc.</p>
      <p>I want to add a few things that seem to be provided by you, so that Erasmus may be supported among us and you may be our patrons. You would already have a most abundant opportunity because of Luther's defamatory and slanderous writing to Froschauer, which, because it has been copied by many, is circulating in everyone's hands and because it detracts from your labors, indeed from the divine truth worked out for us by you, it seems to me not a private matter, but abundantly public, too much to remain silent and indifferent and to be speechless in the face of such reproaches is not approved by me. If Bucer is offered the slightest occasion, he immediately seizes it and moves every stone to accomplish his efforts. It would therefore seem to concern your name, dignity, and our tranquility, that the matter be referred to your council and a delegation be sent to the Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, Biel, us too, and finally to Basel, with you also involved, Erasmus Fabricius and Gwalther, so that you may have sermons and instructions in the council and for the sermons demonstrating what poison lies hidden under this pretext, how much it detracts from the canonical scriptures and what an abominable heresy it nurtures and fosters. And because the rumor has reached you that even among our preachers there is controversy or dissension about this matter, it grieves you that some want to depart from the disputed opinion and Luther, also from the writings and agreements and pacts of the Saxon princes; if it is so, you therefore fortified by the word of God from this opinion, which you also briefly explain, by divine help will not cease. For they dream of some metaphysical exhibition and application of the body without dimensions, while faith is not without effect, whose end is the salvation of our souls, 1 Pet. 1.</p>
      <p>For by the power of God, that is, we are kept by the Holy Spirit through faith unto salvation; the effect and power of this virtue is sufficiently explained in Rom. 8. They therefore seem to deprive the Holy Spirit of his office, and attach everything to this action of commemoration, as if they seem to affix grace to the symbols, etc. I trust that with no one opposing, all will subscribe to you, and thus finally among us Swiss this dispute would be removed, nor should you therefore remain silent.</p>
      <p>Consider carefully, I beg you. Perhaps it would please all the magistrates, that the learned from the Swiss regions acknowledging Christ would convene and the whole matter would be settled, so that we would know, whatever the foreign and external might plot, that we too are fortified and equal. I would like a synod of Swiss ministers to be held, where Bucer's machinations would finally be excluded, and Myconius would be restrained, who threatens that we must scrutinize the mode of presence and forbids it, while we ought to grow in all wealth of certain persuasion of understanding Col. 2 [2. 6-23]. You, who are in a conspicuous place, ought to take care of these matters. Greet, I pray, all the learned and write what seems to you to be done. For I sent this messenger solely for this matter and to administer money to Gesner. You have understood what cause Sulzer has given for the Neuchâtel articles; but recently Toussain wrote commendatory letters for a certain brother in these words:</p>
      <p>"To the most vigilant pastors of the Bernese church, our most esteemed lords and brothers.</p>
      <p>We have given this brother of ours the book of ceremonies of the Duchy of Württemberg to be communicated to you, because they want to impose those ceremonies on us here as well, and we eagerly desire to hear your opinion and that of the other brothers of Switzerland on these matters, because we certainly do not want to accept anything that good men would judge to be contrary to the glory of God and the edification of the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>Montbéliard, November 7, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient brother Peter Toussain in his own name and that of his brothers."</p>
      <p>This seems to me to agree little with Sulzer's causes. Thus they deal with us wickedly and with fictitious words, meanwhile drawing many to their opinion.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it seems that these ceremonies should also be dealt with, because unless timely remedy is applied, I fear the contagion will become incurable. Consider all things well.</p>
      <p>Given on January 29, 1544.</p>
      <p>Write back, I beg you, so that we may consult about the manner of conducting the business of Christ.</p>
      <p>The Bucerians are more and more pressing their opinion and promoting it as much as they can.</p>
      <p>Conzenus is now struggling with a serious adverse health condition; I believe it is a putrid fever.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Erasmus greets you, and all the wise greet you all. Greet Hagius the consul, Lavater the treasurer, etc.</p>
      <p>I have received the books and letters to be sent to Lausanne, but not having found anyone willing to carry the book, it is still with me. I will soon give it to our servants. Celius is still alive, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and faithful and at the same time most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of Zurich, his always esteemed lord and patron.</p>
