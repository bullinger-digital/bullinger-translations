      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Our enemies, the papists, have now returned from the wilderness (where the days of rogation and supplication were held) and appeared before our senate, requesting the seal of the community and the republic for the reason that they intend to firmly observe, together with the cantons and their descendants, what was approved and ratified at the Council of Trent, and to affix the seal in the name of all of them as a testimony to the truth. The senate, I don't know by what imprudence, granted their requests.</p>
      <p>However, what this sealing and subscription portends, anyone may conjecture.</p>
      <p>We are all more than sufficiently informed about what the Council of Trent decreed in matters of religion and what it approved as orthodox, namely those things that diametrically oppose the truth. But it is astonishing to say how many promises they now made in supplications at the wilderness to confirm our adversaries, the Swiss, in matters of religion, so that they may remain firm and persevering in the ancestral religion. They have threatened dire consequences to those who wish to hinder or dissuade them from their purpose.</p>
      <p>With these promises, the adversaries raise their crests and become more insolent by the day, while ours become more timid, as they do not hear a word from the evangelical cities that contains any consolation, let alone assistance, which I fear may eventually lead to ruinous defection. May the Lord have mercy on us and help us, as we see that placing hope in men is utterly vain. Furthermore, I have read everything you sent from France, and I understand that the cause of the pious stands in extreme danger. May the Lord defend His church and show Himself against His enemies in such a way that the whole world may see and recognize that He is the Lord and that men are but men. Farewell happily with your very dear family.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that you soon bring us joyful news from France. Dated May 5, 1562.</p>
      <p>Fridolin Brunner, Minister of the Word of the Church of Glarus, most observant to you.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my kind lord, to his hands.</p>
