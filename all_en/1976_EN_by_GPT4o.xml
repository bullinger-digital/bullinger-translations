      <p>Greetings from God through Christ, etc. When I returned home, everything was found safe. The next day, I read and reread the English Christian confession, which pleases me greatly, so that I would wish for perseverance and peace from God. But that article (for it is foolish to judge unless each thing is very well known) displeases me. No one except Christ is without sin. I know no one lives without fault. The best to me is he who is burdened with the least. What about the Virgin Mary, Mother of God? God, who was powerful enough to create the world from nothing, was also powerful enough to provide a dwelling for His Son. Likewise, concerning Jeremiah and John: to sanctify them is taken as to set them apart, as sanctify trades and of the Sabbath. If he had concluded (in my opinion) concerning people already existing in life, etc.</p>
      <p>My leg is half healed; because another hole has formed, I now have 4 in the leg, on the head (which does not do much harm) 6. I am in good hope that it will soon be well, as I have received another plaster.</p>
      <p>Every convenience brings its inconveniences with it, etc. My wife reaped the front week, so I have this week but unequal plunder. The rumor has reached Bremgarten (but nothing certain) that Hans, my son, is said to have died in Dzalun from the red plague. If it is true, I cannot leave the mother without harm to raise 4 children. I believe that I am dear to God, as He says: Whom I love, I chastise, etc.</p>
      <p>Our people have left Piedmont, set up camp in Liguria near Genoa, where they have a horn of plenty of all things.</p>
      <p>Thus writes Frölich; but with great labor and expense, they passed through the mountains with the artillery.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, I received a message from Josue, but no letter with the messenger. Schwyz sends greetings to us all, and he was well off in money. So I wrote to him in haste about various things, also to Werner; so the messenger has courage, to be back with me in 7 weeks.</p>
      <p>They have moved out of Piedmont with great cost and labor over the mountain with the artillery, won several places and a city with the castle, where much goods were shot and finally conquered. They are now lying there in the open field. The messenger is in Zurich today, has much money from Wilhelm Stutzen; but has carried out 700 crowns.</p>
      <p>How the servants behaved on the mountain with the artillery, Frölich also placed the common people on a cart and said they must ferry over or swear out of the camp. They ferried over more easily than the servants.</p>
      <p>No more, than God be with you all. I thank you as good. Given on the eve of Ferene.</p>
      <p>I have no leisure.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes.</p>
      <p>Tell Hans Rudolf to go to Heini Binder and have the barrels of wine ferried to the town hall with the cart, so that they may be better loaded, as I want to have them ferried off, etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
