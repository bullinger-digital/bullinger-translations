      <p>Greetings. Do not think, beloved brother, that I disregard your letters or have no regard for you; behold, I respond to them briefly and pray that you consider the brevity a good thing, as I have written this with difficulty, being entangled in many affairs. You ask that I recommend your son to Mr. Evangelista, the silk merchant from Locarno. While I have done this diligently, he responds: "Certainly, he has been highly recommended to me until now; I have taught him, fed him, and clothed him; but in return for my benefits, nothing is repaid to me. If at least some gratitude were shown to me, I would gladly continue doing good; but I regret that everything here is exceedingly dry. There is another matter that troubles me more: If I support him here for some time, it will soon be that when he thinks he can fly away, he will leave and not stay with me for the promised years, and thus I will waste my oil and effort. If he would assure me through good men that he wishes to stay with me for the proper and customary number of years, I would gladly do good to him. I ask you to write this to his father."</p>
      <p>This is what I wish to be done. Then, regarding the books you mention in your letters, they are of considerable value and no longer all available; although they have often been printed, they have been sold out even more frequently. I do not know what the printer will do, whether he will print them again or not. Others are now writing, who handle everything far more learnedly and better than we, who first broke the ice. I earnestly ask your kindness to kindly greet the most honorable Mr. Friedrich von Salis along with his son Johannes, whom I love and revere from the heart. Tell him that the news from France is written in such varied opinions that you do not know what to believe. Beware, you Rhaetians, not to give soldiers to the king anymore; there are many serious reasons why I write this. I cannot say more now.</p>
      <p>Farewell along with all yours and all your fellow ministers. In Zurich, in great haste, the last day of September 1569.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, Minister of the Church of Zurich, etc. To the most honorable Mr. Peter Parisotto from Bergamo, faithful minister of the Church of Pontresina, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
