      <p>My entire inclined, willing service and friendly greetings beforehand, venerable, friendly, dear sir and godfather.</p>
      <p>Last night, Captain Schüler from Glarus came to me and said that he had held a conversation with a well-known Catholic or old believer, asking what news they brought from Einsiedeln from our dear Confederates (since they make a pilgrimage and journey there every year on the day of Philip and James from Glarus and other places) and further inquired whether there was any war against the Turks. He answered that there was not a single man from the other Confederates on the journey to Einsiedeln; he heard nothing of a war; but it might well be that there would soon be war with us. Captain Schüler replied that God would graciously avert that, and then said, "Well, we from Glarus are again in disgrace with them." But he said, "No, but those from Zurich; for they let songs and booklets go out daily, which the Five Places (cantons) do not want to tolerate, and therefore they did not want to let their people (although reluctantly) go on this journey, so that they would not side with the Glarus people, which would seem to favor those from Zurich, etc."</p>
      <p>He asked me to write to Zurich, if I could, so that they would be better prepared for the matter. For this, I went to Lord Vogt Vogel and sought his advice, as it is not always good to write about such matters. He told me that today a letter came here for the council from those of Schwyz, very short, the content of which is: "We from Schwyz, together with Uri and Unterwalden, have scheduled a meeting for next Sunday to discuss something friendly with our people from Rapperswil. Therefore, our request is that you also send your delegation to Rapperswil on the appointed day." They were very surprised by this letter, as they had not thought of any reason. And at their request, they elected the governor Häßi as a messenger, but with the instruction that he should listen to the proposal made to their people from Rapperswil by the three central places, and should not give any final answer without the prior knowledge of the land of Glarus. And Vogt Vogel told me that the landammann Schüler, as well as other gentlemen, could not be surprised enough by the short letter, and they also thought that there must be something strange and complicated going on, and he also asked me to write to you, dear godfather, so that more attention would be paid to the matter; for many say that the Five Places have never been so defiant as they are at the present time, and perhaps something might be in the works. I ask you, dear godfather, to reflect on this matter according to your wise understanding and to act according to your good judgment. With this, I commend you to the gracious protection and care of Almighty God. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in haste before the sermon, Wednesday, the 9th day of May, in the year 1571.</p>
      <p>Your humble and willing servant, J. Hugo of Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich, his dear lord and godfather, to his hands.</p>
      <p>"Warning, written from Glarus, concerning the intentions of the Five Places against Zurich. 9th May 1571."</p>
