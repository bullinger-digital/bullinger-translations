    <p xml:id="regest1">New Year's wish. Despite increasing work, he wants to respond immediately to Bullinger's letter and not keep the messenger [...] waiting. He is pleased that Bullinger does not doubt his loyal attitude towards the church and the people of Zurich. He is also pleased with the news that the Confederates are united; may they rely solely on God, the mighty fortress. The rumors about France should not concern the [Confederates]; if they trust in God, the world will not harm them. Whether [the Council of Constance] is pursuing another goal by stockpiling flour, grain, and other necessities, Blarer does not know. Blarer knows no more about the Emperor's favor towards Constance than what is heard on the streets, namely that the [Constance] envoy [Hieronymus Hürus], who rode to the Emperor in France, was well received by the Vice-Chancellor [Johann von Naves]. The envoy [Ludwig Kürnstaller] achieved similar results with King [Ferdinand I]; consequently, the General Collector [Hans Lochinger] and the Fiscal [Valentin Gottfried] have suspended the demands on [Constance] until the Emperor's arrival in Worms, so that [Constance] has not yet paid the "Common Penny" nor the past levy [for financing the war] against France. Blarer heard that noble imperial governors [...] offer their help to [Constance] and that K[onrad] Zwick is deputed to the Imperial Diet; these are signs that Constance is seeking grace from the Emperor. If the Emperor were planning an attack against the Confederates, he would not be so favorable towards the people of Constance but would force them to obedience. Blarer shares the view that the people of Constance would worsen their situation if they supported the war [of the Emperor against the Confederates]; however, through trusted councilors, Blarer knows that [Constance] leans not towards war but towards a Christian peace. Yet only God knows how the [Constance] Council will react to promises and threats [from the Emperor]; therefore, nothing better can be done than to ask God to grant [Constance] the spirit of wisdom. Blarer has not yet spoken to anyone about the [Confederate] plan [of an alliance with Constance] (especially since new councilors will soon take office), so he can neither advise the people of Zurich nor know what could be obtained from the [people of Constance]; perhaps the people of Zurich (alone or with the other Confederates) should write to the Secret Council or the mayor [Thomas Blarer] taking office from [January 6, 1545], and ask them not to be incited [by the Emperor] against the Confederates; from their response, more could be learned about [Constance's] attitude [towards the Confederates]; Blarer can also show Bullinger's letter to his brother [Thomas] and other confidants. If Blarer were to govern the city, he could not support the conclusion of an alliance between Constance and the Confederates regarding the current situation, even though he is positively inclined towards such an alliance. What should Constance do now? If [the city of Constance] ignores the offers from both sides, it gains nothing; if it joins the Emperor, it loses its freedom; if it allies with the Confederates, it faces great danger without having real advantages from it. So far, the [Confederates] have neither offered their alliance to Constance at the right time nor in an appropriate manner, so one must conclude that this was not God's will; in the past, Blarer informed Bullinger in writing and orally how [the Confederates] should act in this regard; however, his suitable advice was not followed. On Epiphany [January 6], a general city day of all free and imperial cities is scheduled in Ulm; the Confederates should inform the envoys in writing on this day that they have heard that the imperial estates want to wage war against them because some Confederates do not want to pay the imperial tax (to which they are not obliged due to their freedoms); therefore, their request is that the imperial cities should not be moved to act against the Confederation. From the response (if one comes about) or the silence of the imperial cities, the Confederates would know how to proceed. Bullinger will likely treat Blarer's advice confidentially. [Gian Giacomo de' Medici], [Lord] of Musso, is said to have secretly stayed with the [Constance] Bishop [Johann von Weeze] in Meersburg; he would have recommended recruiting Spaniards and Italians [as mercenaries]. May Christ grant his protection. New Year's wishes to the mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater]. [1. Attachment:] Recommends [Konrad Zwick] to Bullinger's prayers; Zwick is under pressure at the Imperial Diet both from [Ferdinand I] and [Philipp of Hesse] because of [his military skills]; will he remain steadfast? Greetings and New Year's wishes. [2. Attachment:] If [the people of Zurich] had followed Blarer's advice, [an alliance between Constance and the Confederates] would now exist, which would correspond to the wishes of Bullinger and Blarer; the plans of Ferdinand and other rulers would have failed; the people of Constance would not have asked the Emperor and King for a reduction of the imperial tax, nor would they have had to send representatives like [Konrad Zwick] to the Imperial Diet; they would not be obliged to the imperial grace, and even less would one have been able to negotiate with [Konrad Zwick about his military skills].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace through Christ from God, along with the wish for a gracious, God-pleasing year with all good things for body and soul to you and yours, and my entire Christian brotherly loyalty and love steadfast and eternal beforehand.</p>
      <p>Especially dear lord and brother, upon your writing, I wanted to give this following answer in haste, so that I do not delay your messenger, as otherwise at this time, when I am truly burdened with preaching and many obligatory tasks, it would have had to happen.</p>
      <p>Firstly, I am entirely and more than well pleased that you do not doubt my loyal love towards you and yours; for certainly my heart stands thus, that I would gladly see the rise and expansion of the church of Christ with you and everywhere, and then also your temporal welfare, and would further it to the best of my ability, as I am entirely assured in my heart of your reciprocal feelings towards me and ours. May the Lord confirm all good things.</p>
      <p>Secondly, I am glad to hear that the Confederates are well united. May God will that such unity is built on a right foundation and rock, so that it is not overthrown in times of great storms, and we do not experience (as has happened before) that against God's intended punishment and discipline, neither strong buildings, great power, excessive wealth, many people, nor their unity, and in sum, nothing human without God's grace and favor can or will help. Those who can trust in God's grace in cross and adversity (need), that is evident. If you are of the same or will become so, then God will undoubtedly be your stronghold, protector, and defender, even if the whole world were to rise against you; for over His work, which we have now become, the Lord's grace and mercy will certainly prevail; it all depends on that and only that we do not misuse ourselves.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, the rumors about the king of France and especially concerning you should not be taken seriously; one must let people talk, as they say, like geese. It is only to be noted, if you have rightly deserved punishment from God, then you are the cause of it yourselves, if you do not soon turn to God; but if you stand well with God, then the chattering world with its bloody plans, (intentions, plans) mockery and threats, nor with deeds, will not be able to harm you, but will dig a pit for themselves, into which they must fall.</p>
      <p>Fourthly, regarding the meal, I cannot give you any other information than that I have now several times understood that my lords are securing themselves with grain, meal, and other necessities; but whether this is done for another purpose than their own provision and preservation, I truly cannot know.</p>
      <p>Fifthly, regarding the consolations that the Emperor is supposed to offer this city, etc., I have no knowledge beyond what I hear on the streets and can guess myself; for I do not speak at all with the councilors about these matters. However, it is true, as I have heard, that my lords' envoy, who was supposed to ride to the imperial majesty in France, was kindly heard by the vice-chancellor on the way and was sent back with good information.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the other envoy received a gracious answer from the royal majesty and especially achieved that the general collector and fiscal against my lords should be quiet until the Emperor's arrival in Worms, as this is happening. And my lords have not yet paid a common penny nor the past levy against France.</p>
      <p>I also hear that some noble imperial governors write very friendly to my lords and offer to further their concerns with the imperial majesty, etc. Moreover, my dear cousin Conrad Zwick is appointed to the Reichstag, although he has not yet departed; which also gives me an indication that my lords are seeking grace from the Emperor; for previously they have sometimes sent unwillingly and sometimes not at all.</p>
      <p>But putting all this aside, it is well to consider, if the imperial majesty were to have any plans against the Confederates, her majesty would undoubtedly not take any displeasure against the city of Constance, but, as you write, would use all possible means to make them dependent, etc.</p>
      <p>What disadvantageous and ruinous consequences would follow for my lords if they were to become involved in such a war, you have orderly recounted in your writing. And I have sometimes heard sensible people among us speak of it in social conversations; and I do not doubt that such future dangers will be carefully considered in the deliberation of matters. So far, I have also not been able to understand from some special trusted councilors, as I have also reported to you before, that the councilors are more inclined to peace and quiet than to war for Christian reasons.</p>
      <p>But how all this stands, it is up to God what good words, gracious promises, and assurances will finally be able to achieve with the councilors. But so that what we recognize as the best and most Christian prevails with them in the council chamber, I consider this to be the foremost and most useful means, to earnestly ask God to grant them the spirit of His wisdom, which is gentle, quiet, and peaceful, not puffed up, not greedy for honor or fame, and especially that He grants them the grace to forget all old and new grievances that have befallen them manifold, and not to desire to avenge themselves, but to commend all revenge to God and not to rejoice in the misfortune of others. If we could achieve this with our prayer to God, we would experience God's blessing, and you would now have your benefit, which you have often paid little attention to before, without any present effort.</p>
      <p>Lastly, regarding your plan, and that you desire to know what can be obtained from ours, so that I might also speak with some trusted ones about it, etc., I inform you that I have spoken to no one about this matter; for I have taken care that it is not my place to do so. Nor would the shortness of time have allowed it, especially on the day when the new councilors are to be elected. Therefore, I cannot truthfully report to you what will be done about you or what can be obtained from ours. However, it seemed to me that if you wanted better guidance, it might be time for your lords alone or together with other Confederates to write a friendly letter to my lords, the secret councilors, and admonish them not to let themselves be moved against a praiseworthy Confederation; then you might perhaps receive more guidance from the response. Or that you write to my brother, who will now soon hold the office of mayor again on the next Epiphany, about these matters; it would then be appropriate for him to discuss it with other trusted ones and let you know further information. But if you do not want to do any of these, I will then, out of duty, show this your writing to my brother and, if he considers it good, also to other trusted ones, etc.</p>
      <p>But if the city of Constance were my own, as much as I would like to see it united in true friendship and neighborliness with a Confederation, I could not in my simplicity think that such a thing would be advisable at this time and with the current clamor; for that would only ignite the fire and certainly give cause for a future war. Nor could I, for such a small benefit and advantage, as might now be obtained from the Confederates and partly reported by you, put myself and my city (yes, if it were mine) in such a great danger. And even if beneficial things might happen to me according to my heart's desire, I would still have great doubts whether it would be advisable for me to accept it publicly at this time.</p>
      <p>In sum, in my opinion, it is difficult to act in this matter according to human wisdom. For if the city of Constance is now to reap at harvest time, and if it could gain something from either side, it should not cut (harvest), and thus be quiet and take no side, it gains nothing, and perhaps enjoys nothing from either side. If it attaches itself to the Emperor and gains much, no one knows how long it will remain, and it buys its own servitude and bondage. If it makes itself dependent on the Confederates, it must do so with little advantage and yet great danger; for the Confederates want the benefit that may arise from the union with the city of Constance, and in return, the danger in which the city is placed, in my opinion, is not compensated.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it seems to me that one does not want to act at the right time or with appropriate means. Therefore, I must conclude that it is viewed differently by God. I have written to you in the past and also spoken to you orally about some means that would have been well-suited to this matter if they had not been disregarded, and the time will come when you will recognize and acknowledge it, as I now feel and partly see before my eyes; may God grant us His grace that we remain on the right path in all ways.</p>
      <p>On Epiphany, a general city day of all honorable free and imperial cities has been scheduled in Ulm due to some common grievances that have befallen them. It might not be bad in my opinion (so that I reveal my foolishness) if the Confederates had written to the envoys on that day in a friendly manner with such an intention, briefly and without danger, as this is an example: It reached them through a street rumor, as if the estates of the empire were planning war against them because some of their relatives did not want to pay the imperial tax. Although they now, in view of their freedoms and many other just causes, do not expect this from the imperial majesty or other estates, and especially the honorable free and imperial cities, yet since they have heard that now the aforementioned honorable free and imperial cities are gathered together, they did not want to fail to write to them about it, with a very friendly request that they should not let themselves be moved to displeasure and much less to action against a Confederation.</p>
      <p>So they want to behave towards them and theirs in such a friendly and neighborly manner that it will be evident that they are inclined to promote and maintain common peace and all good things towards the honorable free and imperial cities.</p>
      <p>If the cities were to respond to such a letter or remain silent, the Confederates could understand the matter all the better and know how to proceed accordingly. The day will certainly not last long, etc.</p>
      <p>Forgive me for writing such a form; it happens towards you in trust and best intention, and it should remain so; otherwise, it might be interpreted as presumption. In this, you will know how to act rightly in my trust; otherwise, I would keep my foolishness to myself in the future. God knows that I mean it very well and faithfully.</p>
      <p>The one from Miss has been, as I hear, at Meersburg with the bishop for several days and was released and taken away in one night. However, it is said that he has ordered the recruitment of Spaniards and Italians.</p>
      <p>Our dearest Prince of Peace, Christ Jesus, may faithfully watch over us and grant us temporal and eternal security under His protection.</p>
      <p>Given in haste, Constance, December 28, 1544. Please convey my kind Christian service with the wish for many happy years and all good things to my gracious dear lords, both mayors.</p>
      <p>Let my dear cousin Conrad Zwick be commended to your faithful intercession, for it is very difficult for me that he should attend this Reichstag, especially also because of the matter you know. For as long as the royal majesty and also the landgrave know about it, he will not remain unoppressed. So the human mind is movable, etc., although I trust him with all good things. But even if he remains steadfast, danger will grow upon him, so that he will need the intercession of pious people. Greet all your household with the wish for good years and all peaceful God-pleasing times.</p>
      <p>Would to God that yours had followed my faithful and well-founded advice that I gave you last year. Through this, this matter would now have been brought to an end according to your and our wishes, or at least Ferdinand's and other lords' plans would have been prevented. Likewise, my lords would not have asked the Emperor and King for a reduction of the imperial tax, nor would they have sent representatives to the Reichstag, or at least not appointed my cousin there. From this, it would have followed that the Emperor would have had less reason to show much grace to my lords and, in return, to demand much from them. So one could also have less engaged with my cousin in negotiations. I wanted to remind you of this incidentally, for I find more and more how this path would have been a quiet, decisive means; and it troubles me that it was not acted upon.</p>
