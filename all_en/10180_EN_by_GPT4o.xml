      <p> Lorenz Meyer (Agricola) from Winterthur to Heinrich Bullinger, a distinguished, learned, pious, and above all humane man. Greetings. I am sending to you, most learned Bullinger, a poem written in our language, that is, German, and an epigram "Against the Zwingli Defamers," in order to partly express my love for the late Zwingli to you, the most humane man, and partly to fulfill what I promised when I was in the city, and to give you what you requested, now brought by Erasmus Schmid, a learned and serious man. Although these are lighter than your gravity, yet your humanity affects my modesty, indeed my eternal love for you has commanded me to give you these meager poems. I believe the gods have acted most holy with me, if these please you - I care nothing for other harsh critics - whether they stand or fall by your judgment. </p>
      <p> Farewell in Christ our Savior. May He keep you with us for a long time, surviving and unharmed. Amen. </p>
      <p> Stammheim, 14th of November, in the second year after the death of our Zwingli. </p>
      <p> I have not yet put the final touches on the Sapphic. I will send it to you shortly or bring it myself. I very much wish your most holy parents and your most honorable wife to be well. I beg you to sweeten the bitterness of Christoph Froschauer with your kindness; he has become more inhumane towards me due to the delay of the debt. I truly sin not out of malice but out of necessity, due to a lack of money. I have not yet sold the wine, nor have I received the annual income. As soon as I sell the wine, I solemnly promise to send him the rightful money of the debt. Do what I ask. What I promised, I will diligently take care of. </p>
      <p> To H[einrich] B[ullinger], the churchman of Zurich. </p>
