      <p>Greetings. Only now have I learned from your letter to our Beza, most honorable man and sincerely esteemed brother, that you were deceitfully misled by that Englishman to whom you had given letters: unless perhaps he died on the journey, which is not believable. Perhaps also, to gain your trust, he falsely claimed to bring messages from Mr. Johannes a Lasco. Although I regret the loss of the reading, I am more troubled by the fear that he might be one of those wanderers who sell themselves to the malevolent by spreading our secrets. The unfortunate outcome of the Worms colloquy does not disturb me as much as Philipp's leniency is odious and troublesome to me. For although I had not forgotten how flexible and soft he always was, and I knew he was now too timid and sluggish, he has fallen further than I suspected. Indeed, I did not think even Brentius would act so hostilely.</p>
      <p>But whatever they have let slip, it is well that our freedom is not bound by any of their prejudices in the defense of sound doctrine. If we were to meet tomorrow, they are mistaken if they trust that they have gained even the slightest advantage.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I am more eager to seek a colloquy, so that free discussion may teach them to act more modestly. Meanwhile, I wrote to Jakob Andreae, stating that it was neither right nor humane nor considerate for them to have done so: so that all may know that our churches were justly offended. Beza and Budaeus will understand more in the courts of princes, as they have now been forced to undertake a third journey: partly because Michael Dillerus warned us that the cause of the brethren was betrayed there by a hired rogue who crept into the favor of the Palatine: partly because the implacable king's fury urges us to seek remedies. For the fact that more were released from the large crowd was not due to gentleness or clemency, but because the constancy of the seven martyrs who were burned so broke the spirits of the judges that they decided they must seek a new plan. They deliberately chose two young men, one of whom had barely entered his sixteenth year, whom they hoped would be unable to resist.</p>
      <p>When this expectation failed them, they distributed about a hundred into monasteries, where the monks were like daily torturers. Many escaped, partly because it pleased the monks to rid their cloisters of those pests, lest the contagion spread further, and partly because it was burdensome to feed the destitute for free. Those who were caught and stronger were hidden in foul dungeons, from where they are dragged to death at the first opportunity. However, the judges' sluggishness was often and repeatedly rebuked by the king with many insults and threats, as if they were not acting manfully enough.</p>
      <p>Finally, he (the king) petitioned the Roman Antichrist (as the words of the bull sound) through his legate to appoint three cardinals to the inquisition, to whom unrestrained license to slaughter and destroy was granted. He also promulgated a new edict, by which bishops are given the ultimate power of life and death: and nothing is left to the royal judges but to be their executioners. Behold those splendid promises with which he deceived your people.</p>
      <p>I thought it appropriate to indicate these things briefly, lest you think we are too fervently engaged when our brothers everywhere tremble, frightened by threatening edicts. Farewell, most illustrious man and venerable brother.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Peter Martyr and the other fellow ministers diligently in my name. May the Lord protect you all unharmed, guide you, and bless you.</p>
      <p>Geneva, February 23, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, brother and esteemed fellow minister.</p>
