      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Our age continually spreads vain rumors, and it is no wonder, since there are so many liars and hypocrites everywhere, who are always accustomed to invent something to deceive others, or who want to be the authors of rumors so that they may be held in higher esteem. Yesterday I received letters from Strasbourg, in which the following was included: The people of Augsburg have issued a public edict, which a knight announced with a trumpet in all the cities, forbidding anyone to say or write that the Emperor is dead. What do you think the edict means? The Elector Bishops are in Koblenz, to whom the Bishop of WÃ¼rzburg is hastening; they will undoubtedly discuss the future council or the common peace of Germany. The Emperor is at odds with Ferdinand, and this is most certain, over the imperial dignity. The Diet in Vienna has not yet been concluded. The Pope has postponed the council until Michaelmas, and the Emperor has agreed; for he said he would personally punish the people of Magdeburg with the gravest penalties, so that an example may stand for posterity, nor does he add "if the Lord wills." Have you heard anything about the town of Mirandola? They spread rumors among us that it was almost betrayed by the monks who held a provincial meeting there; but I will obtain more certain information from Coelius on this matter.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing more about the Turk, and someone from Vienna in Austria wrote to a citizen of Basel that everything is safe with them and that the Turkish cruelty is not feared this summer. So why are these trifles being spread? Perhaps the Emperor, as usual, is trying to wage war and gather soldiers under this pretext, so that he may unexpectedly crush and defeat his enemies, or they want to extract money from the simple people, so that they may more conveniently conquer the people of Magdeburg or wage war against us.</p>
      <p>The price of meat is very high with us; but our senate has conceived a regulation, which they will propose to the butchers; if it is printed, I will send it to you. The plague has not yet ceased. Myconius is in excellent health, although he is burdened by old age.</p>
      <p>These few things for now, more shortly. Basel, May 5, 1551. Greet Theodor in my name, to whom I will shortly send a lengthy letter.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my kind and dear lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
