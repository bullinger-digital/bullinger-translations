      <p>Strasbourg, 3rd September 1554.</p>
      <p>Greetings. This noble and learned man, Anthony Cooke, will pass through your city on his way to Italy, drawn by the reputation of your humanity and learning. I ask that he may feel that my recommendations have been of some benefit to him. He was a collaborator with Cheke in the education of the late king. He lived with me for some time in my house, in a holy and very courteous manner.</p>
      <p>I have sent my servant Joachim back to you. You will not count the money for your son's board to him, unless it can be done as conveniently as possible without any detriment to you. I will have clothes made for your son's needs, and they will be neither torn nor excessively luxurious.</p>
      <p>This nobleman could inform you better of the news from England. As I wrote in my last letter, the Emperor has suffered a great defeat. This is confirmed by the Landsknechte, who pass through this city daily without arms, those who survived the defeat. May the Lord preserve you all. My wife sends her regards to you.</p>
      <p>You know the writer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
