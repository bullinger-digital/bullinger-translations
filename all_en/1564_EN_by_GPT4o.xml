      <p>This is the fifth letter I am sending to you since Stumphius left us, mainly because I do not trust the messengers and do not want the letters from the most illustrious prince addressed to your eminence to be lost; for I do not doubt that they will be most pleasing to you. It will also be your responsibility and kindness to ensure that I am informed as soon as possible whether all of them have been faithfully delivered to you, in which matter I hope you will not keep me in suspense for long. Here, everything is still peaceful, except that the head of Duke Somerset was cut off by the executioner Calethano in London yesterday at eight o'clock in the morning. From the confessions (as they call it), Cox was with the prince, undoubtedly with great sorrow and grief; for they were always very close in friendship and association. Astonishing and entirely new plots are said to have been aimed at Warwick by him. Indeed, these are the miserable and pitiable gifts of the times. Everyone mourns and laments this great prince's downfall and calamity most grievously. It seemed already to be held by fate that his death would someday be the harbor of his miserable and much-tossed fortune. What is to be expected further, let him see, who alone is the immortal and most just judge and king of the whole world.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, make sure that a book of yours is copied as soon as possible for the Duke of Northumberland, and letters to John Cheke, the king's tutor, which clearly contain an expression of thanks for the benefits bestowed upon us, mainly for your sake. Especially take care of my Alexander, or rather yours; Cheke promises that he will handle his case excellently with Warwick. You should do nothing here that is not worthy of you and most pleasing and acceptable to our studies. I ask you, most distinguished man, to be willing to do this as earnestly as I can. Send all letters to me, especially Cheke's. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Oxford, February 8, 1552, given now late at night. Your disciple and son in Christ, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
