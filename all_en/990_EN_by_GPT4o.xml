      <p>Grace from God the Father, steadfastness in faith through Christ, and the comfort of the Holy Spirit, etc. In June, we received your letters written in Emden in February and sent through Johann Hypocrat from Bern, otherwise, I would have responded sooner to your charity. Now, however, we were compelled to wait for the occasion of the Frankfurt fairs; for from these, the letters of friends and brothers will be transmitted more conveniently and certainly. Moreover, after reading your letter, the brothers unanimously gave the greatest thanks to God, who supplied you with counsel and strength, so that you would not accept the unfortunate Emperor's Interim to the subversion and insult of the truth and your eternal disgrace and reproach. We pray to the Lord, that He may confirm you in the holy institution, lest you yield to those who not only plot against our liberty but also desire to once again subject all the churches of Christ to the Antichrist. There is no danger from that, which they forbid you from the temples; do what you do and what you have learned from the apostolic example, and you have remedied that inconvenience; for the apostles, excluded from the synagogues, sought another suitable place, another time, another occasion. It is sufficiently suitable, which for the time admits the assembly and in which it is allowed to pray and teach or preach Christ, until Christ grants better times, and it is much better to enjoy the truth and sound doctrine in a narrow place than to exercise adulterated worship by the papists in the most spacious place and leisure. Neither let their words hinder and disturb you, who shout that you are hot-headed and arrogant men and disturbers of public peace.</p>
      <p>A hot-headed and arrogant man is not one who does what is of the scriptures and perseveres in them constantly; a disturber of Christian peace is one who disturbs the consciences of the faithful and subjects them again to the servitude of the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>A hot-headed and arrogant man is one who knows more than he ought to know. What indeed does the pretense of adiaphora help them? Those adiaphora are either from the scriptures or they are not; if they are from the scriptures, they show, and rightly we receive the determination of the scriptures; if they are not from the scriptures, they have undoubtedly arisen from the will of men. But who would impose the will and invention of man on Christian men? For concerning these, Paul says:</p>
      <p>"You were bought at a great price," he says, "do not become slaves of men:" And indeed those ceremonies and rites, which they strive to impose on the churches, cannot be defended by any scriptures; for they are traditions of men and thus almost diametrically opposed to the scriptures. Therefore, stand in the truth, brothers, and sanctify the name of the Lord; pray to Him, who alone can provide the wisest counsel and give the strength to accomplish what He wills. Farewell in Him. The brothers greet you and offer all their efforts to you. You will soon see that unfortunate and impious Interim of the Emperor to be an introduction to complete papism, which he will attempt to restore in full through the continued factious and impious Council of Trent; but He lives, who said: "Take heart, I have overcome the world." The false prophet and the beast or the image of the beast will fight and will fight against the Lamb on the throne of God until the end of the world, who will finally conquer; to Him be glory and kingdom and priesthood. ZÃ¼rich, 17th August 1550. May all the brothers be safe, especially our dear Gerhard from Kampen.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your brother in the name of the brothers.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful servants of Christ, Hermann Brass and Thomas Bram, and Gellius Epipedius Faber, residing in Emden in East Frisia, most esteemed and beloved lords and brothers in the Lord.</p>
