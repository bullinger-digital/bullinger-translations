      <p>Greetings. On the nineteenth of March, I sent back to you, most esteemed brother, the writing about Naemann's adoration, and subsequently, on the eleventh of April, I wrote again among other things, asking what you think about translating that writing into Latin by me. So far, I remain uncertain about everything; for I have received nothing from you since the 15th of February, nor has the printer responded to my request. Therefore, I wish to be informed as briefly as possible through this letter delivered by the courier and my friend Varnirius. If the printer also wants to have that little book in Latin, I will send it immediately; Varnirius is not yet equipped for printing.</p>
      <p>However, as much as I wish to reward you with some little book, I can have nothing at all, except to order you to keep some of mine. Nothing has yet been published about the diet, although it is said to be in the press and will soon be released. Today, that Interim is referred to our senate, as it was presented to all the estates in Augsburg last week, about which I will write more at another time, and undoubtedly soon.</p>
      <p>For it is unknown whether all will ratify it with their consent. I hear indeed that the electors Maurice and the Brandenburgers have protested against it.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I did not have time to write more; for Varnirius misled me with the indication of his departure.</p>
      <p>Ulm, 22nd of May, year 1548.</p>
      <p>Leonhard Serin.</p>
      <p>I would not write about the little book, unless I feared that neither this nor the other letter might have reached you.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful minister of the Catholic Church, H. Bullinger, his brother in the Lord, much beloved and esteemed. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
