      <p>Greetings in the Lord, most illustrious Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Such is your kindness that you will not attribute it to my impudence or imprudence that I, unknown to you, now write to you and interrupt your holy studies with my unlearned letters. For it was not so much my will as the friendly insistence of our Konrad and the bearer of this letter that compelled me to do so, namely, that through the solicitation of these intermediaries, I might introduce myself into your friendship. But you will also grant this and take it in the best part, that I write to you so carelessly and briefly at the beginning. For our dearest brother knows well enough with what occupations I am overwhelmed, that I could give you nothing more than what you read now.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it is not unknown to you how all the evangelical princes and cities recently gathered in Schweinfurt, a city in Franconia, to discuss making and establishing peace until the future council, which the emperor, with commissioners appointed for this matter, the Archbishop of Mainz and the Elector Princes of the Palatinate of the Rhine, are promising with ample assurance. The assembly at Schweinfurt was adjourned without yet having reached a conclusion. The aforementioned commissioners have reported what was discussed back and forth to the emperor, who, as I hear, has now retreated to Straubing, a town in Bavaria, for hunting. They will meet again in Nuremberg, not Schweinfurt, in a fortnight to continue, hopefully successfully, the work they recently began.</p>
      <p>Our people have subscribed to the "Saxon Apology." Our Bucer, with his followers, has devised a plan as to how we might piously agree with the Saxons on the matter of the sacraments. At the same time, he has devised a way by which we might deal with them with almost no offense, especially in the matter of the Eucharist: that truly in the supper, the body and blood of Christ are given as spiritual nourishment to the pious, which we have never denied, we assert. We reject the terms which Scripture does not use, such as their "corporally," "substantially," "essentially." Moreover, whatever I learn from those future assemblies, whenever I find a convenient messenger, I will entrust to him to convey to you what I have reported for you and yours to know. Now indeed, I was not allowed to be longer in writing letters, nor in the meantime did I wish to deprive this sufficiently eloquent messenger, a living letter to you, of his duty. He will discuss other matters with you in person.</p>
      <p>I ask you, for the sake of your remarkable kindness for which you are praised, to consider it kindly and fairly that I have dared to intrude upon you with these unlearned letters, and diligently commend me to the brothers, especially Leo Jud and Pellican.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily in the Lord, by whose spirit you may be preserved. Konrad Sam greets you and the brothers.</p>
      <p>Hastily in Ulm, May 23, 1532.</p>
      <p>Martin Frecht.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of Zurich, venerable for his piety and integrity, his superior in the Lord.</p>
