      <p>I have received three letters from you, most excellent Bullinger, and have not responded to any; for all the journeys were beset by the great severity of the plague.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I had no one to whom I could give the letters to be delivered. Additionally, I was truly overwhelmed by a great burden of affairs, and finally, I hoped to return to you. Therefore, take it kindly that I have delayed my response for so long. Now I will respond to all the letters at once.</p>
      <p>I received the package of books sent by the brothers from Geneva, for which I thank you.</p>
      <p>If you send your booklet on the church, I will gladly translate it, indeed I ask you to send it as soon as possible. For I know that it is desired by my Italians. Many brothers have read the other two that I translated, and they urge that they be published; for they please everyone in a wonderful way, and they think it necessary that they be made available for reading in Italy. I wish to print some things at Froschauer's, indeed many; but since you have no one there who can correct what is written in the Italian language, it is necessary to await my return to you.</p>
      <p>For I will return in the month of February, I assure you, and although I greatly wish to extricate myself from here much earlier, yet the nature of my affairs, as I see it, will not allow it. Persecution burns in Italy as never before, and meanwhile, the Antichrist boasts of a council, but full of treachery and impostures, which I will reveal to you, God willing, when I return, or if I delay longer, I will write diligently, indeed I have already written and have ready a book, which I think will be dear to you all. The bull of the council has already been published, inviting all bishops, I mean only the papists, to return to Trent on the first of May to condemn Christ and the gospel, which they will diligently do. But my opinion is that we too should do something for the glory of our God. The Pope daily reveals more of his inherent vanity and foolishness combined with cruelty. May God restrain and crush the ferocity of that beast. I am sending some brief histories; it will be worthwhile to publish them everywhere, as you will be able to judge by reading. I have taken care that they be copied and published, both so that our people may understand what kind of council is to be expected from the most impious persecutors of Christ, and so that they may be moved and incited to pour out prayers for the wretched brothers of Italy, whom they will hear are being oppressed under such a cruel tyranny. If you learn anything from England about our affairs, write. I have gathered some brothers here, tattered and half-alive. Their calamity holds me back especially; for from the other affairs I could more easily extricate myself and return to you. I will speak more openly: I think I have some things concerning the council that it is very important to know; but they are of such a nature that they cannot be easily or safely entrusted to letters. But I will make an effort that you may understand them as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Send some of the histories to Mr. Musculus and Mr. Haller, to whom you will convey my many greetings. Farewell.</p>
      <p>I greet all the ministers and professors, for at the moment I have no time to write to anyone else but you; however, I will write soon. Pray for me, all of you.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, December 20, 1550.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
