      <p>To my most esteemed Lord Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I have now received two letters from you, to which I have not yet responded. The last of these was dated September 8th, and indeed all your letters have been most welcome to me. I have also received your sermons on Jeremiah, with which you have gifted me. Therefore, I give you my greatest thanks both for this most acceptable gift and for your constant remembrance of me, as you continually inform me of new developments. For I eagerly listened to what you reported about the affairs of France and the discussions at the Diet of Augsburg. In return, I would inform you of any new developments here, if there were any; but we have nothing at present, for everything is quiet by the grace of God. However, some assemblies were recently held in Chur regarding new and counterfeit currency of various kinds, which is being circulated among us, and this matter has been addressed as necessary by the lords of the Grisons. Otherwise, nothing at all was concluded in those assemblies, as far as I know.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I recently wrote to your son Christoph through a trusted messenger who went to Venice, from whom I hope to receive letters from him, which will be all the more welcome to me, as I have had none from him for several months, indeed since he arrived in Treviso. However, a certain friend of mine from Venice has informed me from time to time about your son's condition, and I have learned that he was somewhat ill in recent days but has now almost recovered. This same friend of mine also lent him two florins and will not fail to provide further assistance if needed until he fully recovers; I have diligently written to him to do so.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you need not be anxious about your son; he will be especially dear to me, and as soon as I have letters from him or learn anything about him, you will be informed. I have my own son here, and indeed I have treated him quite indulgently so far.</p>
      <p>However, now more diligence will be taken to ensure he does not waste time uselessly. I have received Francesco Applano from Lucerne, whom you so kindly recommended to me, as a friend in your favor, as I should, and I have sincerely offered him my help, as much as I can provide, etc.</p>
      <p>We are daily expecting news about the new election of the pope; there is said to be a contest between Cardinal Carpi and the one from the Medici family, although Cardinal Farnese also greatly hopes to be promoted due to the competition between the other two. It is also reported that in Rome, the trials of some who were detained in prisons for the true religion have been examined, and after considering these trials, the processes were indeed burned, and the captives were freed. However, I believe this is less true, although I would very much wish it to be true.</p>
      <p>It is also said that the Duke of Savoy, the governor of the Duchy of Milan, is more favorable towards those who adhere to the true religion, as he himself has annulled some processes formed by the inquisitors against certain individuals and has absolved the accused. The hand of the Lord is powerful, as He can do all things in all; may He continually wish to promote His glory! It has also been decreed by public decree in Rome that the insignia of the House of Carafa be erased everywhere, so that the disgrace and great infamy deservedly inflicted upon the deceased pope and his family may be understood by all. And indeed, this news was brought today by some who came from Milan; if any other news arises, I will inform you. Farewell, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, and always keep me in your thoughts, and greet all your household and all friends in my name. Given in Chiavenna on the last day of September 1559.</p>
      <p>The same as above, your most devoted Friedrich von Salis, commissioner.</p>
