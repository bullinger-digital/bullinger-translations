      <p>To Mr. Johannes a Lasco, November 6, 1557.</p>
      <p>The sacramental matter is being drawn more and more into contention, with some ministers of the Saxons almost going insane. Nor do we see how, in such exacerbation, the truth can be well considered unless we teach and profess simply what the matter is, disregarding all persons and confessions, lest perhaps, while we do something to please men, the truth is obscured and the simpler ones ultimately do not know what to safely follow. The Saxons allege the Augsburg Confession for themselves and interpret it very crudely, just as the Apology explained it and as the recess of the empire published in 1530 proves it should be interpreted. Let us therefore leave that confession to them, and let us follow the truth.</p>
      <p>The Waldensians in their book published under Luther's auspices are not consistent with themselves in this doctrine, as are all the Lutherans. They have dyes and potions with which they color the diseased: ineffable power, reason removed from the age, ineffably, with indescribable power of the spirit. I see some men of better note using these as well.</p>
      <p>We consider it entirely dangerous and pernicious to the truth to seek verbal coverings and to cover matters with them so that almost both sides think their opinion is being expressed. Therefore, leaving aside such expressions, let us confess that Christ has a true and natural body and therefore is not present corporally in the supper, but spiritually: that his flesh is eaten for life, but spiritually through faith. For thus speaks the scripture: thus the entire antiquity has explained it.</p>
      <p>Nor let us allow these things to be snatched from our eyes and some subtle things, which nevertheless make us more doubtful than certain, to be substituted.</p>
      <p>I hear, I don't know what and I don't know who are to be sent to Poland, learned and cunning and practiced in such subtle artifice, who may mitigate diverse opinions and fabricate some middle ground. But you, striving for simplicity, try to make what is said understandable and not at all deceitful and subtle. For what is simpler than what the apostles have left us? But perhaps the Lord will break the plans of the cunning. May the Lord grant grace! In establishing discipline from the beginning, I would not be too rigid; moderation is commended in all things; you know what the blessed Augustine left written about this matter in the book against Parmenion 3. But Mr. Augustine was, if anyone, the most experienced of all in this cause and says many things from the very experience of matters; for the Donatists exercised him for many years, etc.</p>
