      <p>Greetings. You are surprised, as the messenger here has told me, and perhaps not without reason, that I have not written to you until now.</p>
      <p>I will assign one reason: I wanted to accomplish something first before writing, so as not to be compelled to write the same thing that you already knew. But so as not to keep you in suspense any longer, accept these few things: Today, a senate of deacons is held; without a doubt, Mr. Waeber will be assigned to us in the fellowship of our ministry. We have appointed one deacon, Theobald von Sur, whom I do not yet know by face; he pleased everyone, although he has not yet been confirmed by the senate.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, another deacon is still being considered. I spoke to Consul Nägeli about Christian Hochholzer; he would be pleasing in every way, but they are ashamed to constantly trouble you and ask from you; therefore, I think he should not be called at present.</p>
      <p>I would never have believed the church itself to be in such a bad state as I still experience daily, as much as there is schism.</p>
      <p>However, I hope it can gradually disappear with prudent gentleness. My greatest task now is to reform the schools both in the countryside and in the city. Our lords indeed make great expenses, but without any order and therefore also without benefit and fruit.</p>
      <p>For the next Thursday, we have established an examination as the beginning of the matter, to test what kind of talents there are and how each supervisor and lecturer conducts themselves. Once these are known, it will be better to advise. The examination will be followed by a review; for I have obtained this from the school overseers appointed by the senate for this matter, treasurer Haller, Fenner von Grafenried, and Claudius Amadiis, who will also participate in the review. After the examination, we will consult about the common order.</p>
      <p>I would very much like, if it were possible, for you to send me that vocabulary of yours; for I have discussed it with the brothers. And indeed, everyone embraces your advice, so that it would also be presented to the school overseers for consultation, whether they would then have it printed by Apiarius or Froschauer. You have what is being done here.</p>
      <p>In Lausanne, the situation is as follows: Viret has written to me; everyone fears and trembles, fearing expulsion or relegation; they all pray for the lords to be appeased. They now express their opinions somewhat more clearly; however, they have not a little provoked our lords anew (whom they call princes) since they have again sent here that man from Christiana, who was almost the occasion for the whole action because of his vocation and examination, as you know, whom Zebedee rejected while the others approved.</p>
      <p>They have, I say, sent him here again, so that at least he may be examined by us, his opinion heard. They added to him a certain Greek professor, and the whole not even because of loquacity a sin. He strongly urged that the good man should not be condemned without his cause being heard. We referred them to the princes, so that if they wanted him to be heard by us, then we would be willing to comply, but without their command, it is not permissible for us to examine anyone. When it came to Nägeli, he treated them so principally that they left again with great indignation and, as they think, injury.</p>
      <p>Everyone fears for themselves here. The consul also told me that Viret is to be summoned soon, to whom, however, he does not wish ill because of the man's probity; yet he will not escape without a special review.</p>
      <p>We hear about Calvin, how he preaches some splendid things about the concord of the Zurichers with him. All good people wonder what he has done in Zurich; I explain, and at the same time what you have done with him. Everyone loves his learning, but they deplore that wandering mobility. I received letters from Augsburg from Musculus, Xystus, Lepusculus. Musculus among other things: "What is being done here [Greek] and what end this cause will have, cannot yet be exactly signified. There are not lacking those who agree, although few; tomorrow will pronounce about the rest. This is the perpetual wish of my heart, that if it should be necessary to leave here, which I strongly suspect, there may be some corner with you, where I may be received, where I may spend and serve the rest of my sojourn for Christ the Savior and his church. I pray the Lord to keep you in peace and sincere Christian religion, so that it may be constantly consulted for you and there may exist some place in Germany where those expelled and persecuted for the cause of truth may flee with a good conscience." And soon: "He lingered here for the space of three weeks [Greek], not without severe temptation and trouble, yet aided by the Lord he kept faith and finally on April 20th freely departed to his own. [Greek] I do not hear very plausible things; I would wish for more fortitude for the most modest heart. I saw something of his, if it was indeed his; I could not approve, although it was the advice of a dear friend."</p>
      <p>This is Musculus. What that temptation of Bucer was, a certain citizen of Augsburg of the Herbrotian faction or society, as they call it, explained to me; for he said that he was solicited with many dignities and monies by the Count Palatine and Joachim, Margrave of Brandenburg, to agree with them in the Interim. Musculus also adds that aided by the Lord he kept faith. But I am digressing further than I intended; my love for you makes me not care about the measure and reason of writing. I will add here the form of the revocation of the most wicked apostate priests, which many of them present in the Upper Palatinate; for thus Lepusculus sent it to me transcribed:</p>
      <p>I, N. N., unworthy priest and pastor at N., here publicly confess (you most beloved in Christ), that I, out of the instigation and seduction of Satan, enemy of the divine truth, also out of human frailty and weakness, for some time have fallen from the holy, common, apostolic, catholic, Christian Roman church into all kinds of errors, especially now wavering in the new Lutheran sects, and initially did not hold the teaching of the holy fathers, the councils, the tradition of the same, nor did I render due obedience to the holy Christian vicar and vicar, the most holy pope in Rome, but, according to the manner of the new sect, I have shunned, mocked, and blasphemed him, moreover, I have defiled myself in my priestly office and state with a falsely supposed marriage, and have not used the holy venerable sacraments, of baptism, confirmation, the sacrament of the altar, chrism, anointing, and consecration, nor the marriage (as set forth according to the order of the holy common apostolic, catholic Christian Roman church), further also the office of the holy mass and veneration of the highly praised Virgin Mary and the dear saints, I have lived, taught, and preached against the same, besides I have also fallen into many more errors, false teachings, and unchristian heresies, and have not gone before my sheep with the right example of life and teaching, which I should have rightly improved, I have scandalized them and hindered them in their salvation. But I have now, out of the inner gift and grace of the holy spirit, the spirit of truth and ruler of the aforementioned Christian common apostolic, catholic, Roman church, converted back to the same.</p>
      <p>So that everyone may now take away that this is not done in a fictitious manner, but from my whole heart and will, I hereby publicly confess with mouth, whole heart, will, and mind the right true Christian, common apostolic, catholic, and Roman faith and also hereby curse all and every heresy, false teaching, and error, especially of Luther and all those who now in our times are against the unity of the aforementioned holy common Christian, apostolic, catholic, and Roman church in the German nation and are wavering against it, in which I also have no pleasure and which I have nevertheless previously praised, taught, and preached. I also believe and promise by the loss of my salvation and eternal blessedness, never again to believe, teach, or preach such errors, as I have then sworn a lovely oath on the holy gospel before my orderly superiors for that reason, and I will also never again separate or fall away from the same superiors, but will always remain and persist in the same holy unity. And I ask for God's sake all those who have been scandalized by my life, words, and preaching, that they will forgive me and also willingly join with me in the much-mentioned unity of the holy common Christian, apostolic, catholic church and let themselves be absolved.</p>
      <p>So I promise and vow that, wherever wavering heresy and error should occur, that I would act, teach, and preach against the same, so I shall then be subject to the strictness of the spiritual law. As a testimony of this, I have signed this document and confession with my own hand.</p>
      <p>Here let us recognize the lion by its claws, what that Interim is, by which we finally fall through our own inconsistency. Oh, how much better it would be to endure a thousand thousand deaths than to sing such a recantation. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant grace, that we may rather bravely meet death than thus fall into the eternal fire of Gehenna. I am glad that they so openly revoke, in this so that others may judge what is sought; for there is no deceit here, everything is open. Let those who see it that way receive it. But I will finally make an end. May the Lord keep you forever.</p>
      <p>My wife and I wish all your family well, then Mr. Pellican, Gwalther, Theodor, Ammianus, etc.</p>
      <p>In Bern on the very day of John the Baptist 1548. Yours forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and compatriot, to be honored forever. In Zurich.</p>
