      <p>Greetings. As I recently wrote, the pharmacist, who is highly regarded, initially delayed me with too many words, and finally said it was not convenient for him at this time to take on someone to teach. We approached another, who is dear to Bucer and me. He immediately said he had given the same response to others who approached him about the same young man, that he currently has one until December, I believe, and it would not be beneficial for the young men to have two living in the same workshop. Finally, we approached a third, who eagerly offered himself, initially asking for 24 guilders for expenses, then reduced it but still insisted on at least 20 to be paid for board and teaching the young man, though somewhat hesitantly, so it seemed to me that 18 guilders would satisfy him. We concluded nothing, for it was not appropriate until we knew what the young man's father would agree to. Therefore, I repeat the same now, lest the previous letters have been lost.</p>
      <p>We will be most mindful of the Concord.</p>
      <p>Farewell. March 10, 1536.</p>
      <p>I send many greetings to Leo in Bucer's and my name.</p>
      <p>Your V. Capito.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, to be respected in the Lord. Zürich.</p>
