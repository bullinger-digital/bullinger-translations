      <p>That Gaspar, the noble Pomeranian, who recently returned from Italy and to whom you said you could show Servetus's writings, brought me the saddest news that my dearest mother has passed away, which greatly disturbed me and my plans, although I do not despair nor lose heart, but rather, humbled under the mighty hand of God, I await what He has also decided for me. However, you will not cease to strive in prayers that He may be with me and deliver me from all evil.</p>
      <p>I beg you to send letters to Vergerius as well. I will devour your books on the grace of God as soon as I can see and obtain them.</p>
      <p>I stayed here longer than I had thought; but tomorrow, God willing, I will depart and write to you more fully from Geneva. Meanwhile, farewell and remember your Laelius with some benevolence. I greet all friends. Basel, February 5, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Lelio Sozzini.</p>
      <p>In Burgundy, a great persecution has been stirred up again.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and excellent man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
