      <p>Greetings. As for news from Italy to write to you, I have none, most reverend sir, I only write this to commend to you the most holy old man, Johannes Fabricius, who delivers this to you; he is from the more secretive senatorial order, a just and honest man, excelling others in age, integrity, and other virtues.</p>
      <p>He is related by blood to our Gantner; yet he has always conducted himself in this matter in such a way that we desired nothing more from him. He has always been displeased with the man's unheard-of arrogance and stubbornness, and unless my mind deceives me, he now finally also wanted to hit the mark, so that the man's wickedness would not further accumulate damage to the church. If you honor him in some way for the sake of our church and republic, in which his age and experience are admirable, we will rejoice, and it will not be without its own reward. He is otherwise a wealthy man; and he wanted to visit friends and blood relatives in HÃ¶ngg and in your city once more. There is a rumor here that the King of France has lost almost all his nobility before Paris due to the slaughter and the attack of the Huguenots.</p>
      <p>I barely write this; I am so troubled by my right arm and worn out by frequent and long sermons.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, April 13, 1574.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>To the pastor in Zurich at the Great Minster.</p>
