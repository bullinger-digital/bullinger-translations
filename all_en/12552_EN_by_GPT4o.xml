    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer forwarded the letter from the [Zurich Council] to the Augsburg [Council] as well as Bullinger's letter to [Georg] Frölich [not received] to Augsburg. It was unnecessary for the Zurich Council to give Blarer's messenger [...] a florin, as he came from Konstanz and will likely also receive a reward from the Augsburgers (who asked Blarer to entrust letters [from or to them] only to a specially appointed messenger).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger will have meanwhile received Blarer's letter [No. 2503] with the secret alphabet. He should write it in alphabetical order in one of his books and start this list with the letters to which no value is assigned, so that no one knows where the alphabet really begins. Caution is indeed necessary.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Blarer also sent [the recorded] lecture of the papal delegation [at the Diet in Baden] to Frölich. The Pope [Paul III] and his followers are all equally [bad]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- It is flattering to learn that Blarer's letters bring Bullinger so much joy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The letter [No. 2493] entrusted to [Hans Rych] has not yet arrived. Blarer intends to inquire about the messenger with [Johannes] Haller in Augsburg, among others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- A priest [...] from Überlingen, who had previously assaulted a woman from Konstanz [...], was caught with a married woman [...] (whose husband [...] went to war a long time ago) in the house of a cooper from Konstanz who is already in prison [...]. His wife [...] (who arranged the meeting) was thrown into prison with the priest and the adulteress. The priest will likely be tortured.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Blarer does not know why the Augsburgers recalled [Sebastian] Schertlin, even though Schertlin intended to capture Innsbruck and other places.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Frölich wrote the night before that Emperor [Charles V] is gathering his troops in Bavaria, but does not plan an attack yet, instead waiting for the Spanish and Italian [troops]. In Trent, they expect the arrival of 20,000 foot soldiers and 5,000 horsemen by the end of July. Allegedly, these mercenaries were only persuaded to join this enterprise because they were promised the body, life, and property of the Lutherans. Venice is also said to have granted the troops free passage. Near Friedberg, [imperial lands]knechts conducted a maneuver to stop Schertlin's advance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [From the city assembly] in Ulm, the envoy from Konstanz [...] writes that the Swiss [mercenaries] are behaving well, that they are popular and will be reluctant to part now that the Nine Places are demanding them. Blarer can well understand that Bullinger distrusts the [pension recipients].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- It is expected that the pious Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] will attack [Weigand von Redwitz], the Bishop of Bamberg, during his advance and punish Nuremberg. Many would welcome this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Enclosed is a letter to Wolfgang Haller, who comes from Ulm and may be from Johannes Haller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- [Konrad] Hofherr should write to [Jakob] Herbrot as soon as possible and send Blarer the letter with Bullinger's next letter. As Blarer was writing this, he received Bullinger's letter [not received] along with Hofherr's writing! He should not yet return [to Konstanz]. Blarer wants to first seek Herbrot's opinion on this matter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Now to the last [just arrived] letter from Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Blarer will promptly inform about the receipt of letter [No. 16183].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Bullinger has used the useful [secret alphabet] correctly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Nothing more specific is known about the advance of the Landgrave.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- Blarer accepts Bullinger's apology.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">- Regarding the [admonition of the Swiss mercenaries demanded by the Nine Places], Blarer has heard a similar piece of advice as the one Bullinger gave. May it be adhered to!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">- [The Schmalkaldic League] plans an attack on the immoral [imperial] group of about 4,000 men near Salem. However, Blarer fears that this is too late, as [the mercenaries] are now to be mustered. For too long, they have watched idly!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">- May God grant the right seriousness and zeal so that one proceeds against the enemy without negligence.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">- May God support the Landgrave. He has written to the people of Konstanz that he wants to defend God's people with determination against the Antichrist.</p>

      <p>Your Grace. I have immediately forwarded your lordship's letter to the people of Augsburg, as well as yours to Frölich. It would have been unnecessary for your lordship to give the messenger 1 florin. The messenger is from here and will likely be rewarded again by the people of Augsburg, upon whose command I also intend to send my own messenger, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>So I think my letter along with the secret alphabet has reached you well. Keep it diligently and write it in a book so that you do not lose it. However, you should place the letters that have no value at the beginning, so that if someone comes across the book, they do not know where the alphabet begins. It requires vigilance and is good to handle cautiously in this world, which is more than unfaithful.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have also sent Frölich the recorded lecture of the papal delegation. Similes habent labra lactucas. Everything looks the same, the Pope, his envoys, and those with whom he deals.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You have soothed my head very gently when you write how much my handwriting pleases you whenever you see it; and that no writing pleases you more than mine. How could this not make me eager to write, since my work is best rewarded when I learn that it serves to please you, etc.?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The letter you previously mentioned has not yet reached me. I intend to write to Augsburg about it with Haller or others and find out what kind of fellow this is, etc. The matter troubles me not a little.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>No special news at this time, except that my lords on Friday night arrested a priest from Überlingen with a married woman, whose husband went to war (not now), in the house of a cooper, who is a citizen and now also in prison for his worthless behavior, and placed him in prison along with the woman and the landlady who let them in. I think he will be tortured, as he previously also acted disgracefully with a woman from Konstanz. This rabble is ashamed of nothing but honor. They cannot consider anything dishonorable except what is against their idol. May God see to it one day!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I do not know what uproar has been made in Augsburg. Schertlin is withdrawing back to Augsburg, who, if his advice had been followed, would have taken Innsbruck and other places. The delay benefits the enemy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Laetus writes to me among other things at night that the emperor is gathering his troops in Bavaria, but is not yet prepared for a siege or battle; he is waiting for the Spaniards and Italians. They are expected to come with 20,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 horsemen by the end of July, certainly to Trent. He writes that they did not want to move unless the body, life, and property of the Lutherans were made completely free and available to them. This has also happened. But the Lord of Hosts has not yet said yes to it. Also, he writes that the Venetians have finally allowed the wretched people passage, etc. Some soldiers made a maneuver at Friedberg. It happened with the intention that Schertlin would withdraw again, which could have been done otherwise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Our envoy writes from Ulm that the Swiss are behaving very well and orderly. They are loved and esteemed by everyone. They are very reluctant to part and separate, while the Nine Places are now demanding their own. I have long suspected that it would go this way. That you do not trust the oligarchs is no wonder. There are more people who seek nothing good there.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>It is confidently expected that our dear, pious Landgrave will do a good deed or two, by enticing the Bishop of Bamberg and also giving a banquet to those of Nuremberg in a strange manner, of which there is no writing. It looks very similar for many reasons. It is a well-deserved matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Herewith a letter to Wolfgang Haller. They have come from Ulm by post. I do not know if they come from Johannes Haller.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and venerable Bullinger. Never cease to intercede with the Lord for us and our church. Greet your household with all friends and brothers. Our people greet you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Remind Curio, I beg you, to write to Consul Herbrot as soon as possible and to attach those letters to yours so that they may be returned to me with the next messenger. But now, at this moment, your and Curio's letters are returned to me. Tell Curio to delay his return until I am certain of Herbrot's disposition, to whom I have written. Then I will also write to him about what should be done next.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Now to the next ones.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>As soon as the letter dated July 10th reaches me, I will let you know without delay.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>You have used the secret language well. It is indeed very good that people can understand each other without others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Nothing is yet known among our people about the advance, what it is and what it intends. As soon as I learn something, I will let you know as soon as I have a message.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>I am quite satisfied with your apology. I had previously thought that the pelt had been too much feathered.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>I have heard a piece of advice on what to do when the soldiers are dismissed, also very much in line with your writing. I hope it will be followed by our people. If nothing can be achieved, one must let God prevail.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>Regarding the soldiers lying around Salmenschwyl, there is a good plan of attack or two. However, there is concern that it may come too late. For it is said that they are now to be mustered, and money has arrived. It will soon be known whether it is true or not. They are exceedingly burdensome to the poor people. It is thought that there are about four thousand of them. They have a great number of whores and camp followers. They are a nuisance. They have been watched for too long.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>May God grant the right seriousness and zeal for His honor, so that one acts against these enemies as is proper. For if our people are not serious about acting bravely, then another will be serious. But the negligence will punish itself. For lying in such costs for a long time and achieving nothing will be unbearable.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>Well then! I hope in God that He will use the Landgrave for great things. He has written to our people that he will either accept heaven for earth or defend God's people against the Antichrists.</p>
      <p>God be with you here and there. July 20, 1546.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
