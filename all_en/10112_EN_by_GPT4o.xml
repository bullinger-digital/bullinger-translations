    <p xml:id="regest1">At Haller's request, Bullinger provides a "guide to study," which essentially represents a summary from the larger work "De ratione studii," which is currently not available. For effective study, a precise daily schedule is a prerequisite. At the forefront of all reading is the Bible, for the understanding of which language skills are necessary. Commentaries and other aids should be comprehensively utilized. The recommended pagan and Christian writers are divided into several groups. Historical authors: Sabellicus, Plutarch, Justin, Josephus, Livius, Eusebius. Non-Christian philosophical: Seneca, Cicero, Plato. Christian philosophical: Tertullian, Athanasius, Lactantius, Eusebius, Augustine. Other useful reading: Erasmus, Pliny, Volaterranus. Poets: Homer, Virgil, Horace, Terence, Ovid. Of "dialectical" and "rhetorical" works, the works of the following authors are useful: Melanchthon, Agricola, Georg of Trapezunt, Cicero, Erasmus, Quintilian.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote, dearest Berchtold, a few years ago, if I am not mistaken, a not-to-be-regretted little book "on the method of study" both theological and secular. It is now hiding in Constance or St. Gallen with Leonard Hospinian, a very learned young man, whether he is copying it or sharing it with others. For it has not been returned to me, which I had hoped and expected until now. I had intended to send it to you as soon as it was returned. Hence, I have delayed for so long in responding to your inquiry about the method of study. But accept these few things from me, which I can offer, since what I wish to offer is not possible.</p>
      <p>First of all, it is necessary to divide your day into parts, in which you can attend to ecclesiastical duties, take care of your body by eating, drinking, walking, or resting, listen to those who come to you, advise them, discuss questions with them, and devote yourself to both sacred and secular studies. Dedicate the dawn to more serious and sacred studies. Reserve the afternoon for secular ones. After lunch and dinner, respond to those who, as often happens, come to us while walking. And you will find, what you would not otherwise believe, that by this division of time, and by doing everything at its proper time, all labor is somehow lightened, and many things can be done quickly and efficiently.</p>
      <p>When you are about to read sacred texts, begin with a faithful prayer. I do not want you to read in the manner of some, who now read the Old Testament, then the New, then consult commentaries, and now start something else. When you are about to read sacred texts, set before yourself an entire author or book and do not take up anything else until you have properly completed it. For example, when reading Moses, start with Genesis or Deuteronomy, which are the core of Mosaic works, begin immediately from the first chapter, proceed to the second, and so on. For I do not take up another reading until I have completed this one. Moreover, I divide the chapters of the author into days, so that each day has either a whole chapter or half, and I read it in such a way that I derive the meaning from the context itself and the comparison of other passages. I have prepared commonplaces for myself, I note and mark the more significant things, so that there is some use of what I read in sacred sermons. I do not disdain the commentaries of the ancients or the moderns, but I use them moderately and in a certain way. You will find no more certain method of exposition than if you consult the Hebrew in the Old Testament, the Greek in the New.</p>
      <p>But who can do this? Modest beginnings are needed. The exercise itself teaches later. And no one, unless experienced, would believe how with little effort one can penetrate to the highest matters over time. There are now so many aids to study in both languages, that anyone who claims difficulty or insurmountable labor simply does not want to learn. There are so many translations, so many annotations, so many commentaries by learned men both of ancient and our own age, so many rudiments, introductions, grammars, dictionaries, that one is clearer than the other. I advise this so superstitiously because I do not want you to despair of the gift of languages. If the whole is not achieved, certainly some portion will not be denied, by which you will act more surely and happily in sacred matters. And indeed, I prefer this to all other gifts, if a man is not entirely alien to the knowledge of languages, otherwise pious, learned, and possessing judgment.</p>
      <p>I want the reading of secular literature to be no less accurate and solid, so that no other author is taken in hand before the previous one is read and thoroughly read to the end. Meanwhile, I do not want you to wander among authors, reading the beginning, book, or end of one and then another, neglecting the rest. For this inconsistency in reading clouds the mind and distracts and disturbs the memory. First of all, however, I think historians and philosophers should be read. Sabellicus has encompassed everything in his "Rhapsody," so that he has a not-to-be-despised summary of all histories and historians, who has Sabellicus's "Aeneades." He who reads Plutarch's "Lives" has read the essence of both Greek and Roman histories. Justin wrote briefly, Livy copiously, Josephus, a most noble historian, sacredly, nor should Eusebius be disregarded in the meantime. I want you to observe in these the manners, plans, events, and actions of men, so that from there, as from a mirror of human life, you may draw examples, and finally judge the manners of men, etc.</p>
      <p>Among philosophers, if you consider the Christian religion, none is more similar to ours than Lucius Annaeus Seneca. He is especially to be read. To him, join the works of Cicero. For Cicero, a man of pleasant and delightful genius, briefly, clearly, and with the most instructive eloquence, collects what is intricately handed down among various philosophers. But if you prefer to read something solid and a professed philosophical man, read Plato. For as Cicero excels in oratory, so Plato in philosophy. Perhaps it pertains here to show which Christian philosophers should be read, that is, who outside the scriptures, that is, not interpreting the scriptures, have treated the heads of Christian philosophy. First of all, therefore, read Tertullian's book "On the Prescription of Heretics," followed by the one written "Against Praxeas" on the Trinity, again the one written "On the Flesh of Christ" and "On the Resurrection of the Flesh," and the "Apologetic" against the Gentiles. To this, join those two most famous books of the divine and truly great Athanasius written against the Gentiles, again those most elegant, learned, and pious six books "On the Divine Institution" by Lucius Coelius Lactantius Firmianus. The seventh savors of chiliasm and therefore should be read with judgment. About the chiliasts, there is reading in Eusebius's "Ecclesiastical History" book 3, last chapter, and in 7, chapter 22. To these, you will beautifully join the learned books of Augustine "On Christian Doctrine," above all the most polished books "On the City of God," etc. But if you are delighted by variety, read the "Ancient Readings" of Coelius Rhodiginus, the "Chiliades" of Erasmus, a most elaborate and necessary work, also Pliny and Volaterranus. For I only mention the most select, which can be sufficient for a studious man. For I do not approve of a multitude of books nor the empty reading of many, but of selected books, so that in a few you may have and read all that is necessary for a studious person, and what others with difficulty learn from many hundreds of books, you may draw with minimal effort from a single decade of books.</p>
      <p>Moreover, poetry delights, moves, and beautifully, indeed vividly, paints with crimes the criminals. Therefore, read for pleasure, to lighten the nausea of studies, meanwhile, however, observe the power of expression and learn the manners of men. But I would like you to read certain ones, Homer, Virgil, Horace, especially Terence, and Ovid.</p>
      <p>But also dialectic and rhetoric, without which all study lies idle, should not be neglected. By dialectic, I mean not the Spanish or copulative, or what is entirely treated in universities, but the thread of discourse, so that anyone can discuss any matter truly, copiously, clearly, firmly, and in beautiful order. This has been adequately outlined by Melanchthon, but no one more worthily than Rodolphus Agricola, who wrote three books "On Dialectical Invention" - Melanchthon also teaches rhetoric in three books, likewise Trapezuntius in five books - books, I say, both most learned and most clear, but no one has yet surpassed Cicero. But whoever desires a brief summary of all these, let him read the second book "On the Abundance of Things" by Erasmus, and finally the "Oratorical Institutions" of Quintilian, and these I especially want to be recommended.</p>
      <p>But we have written very copiously and to the point of nausea about all these things in that book, which we cited above and titled "On the Method of Study." I could not say more at present. I pray that you are content with these and fare well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 1, 1532.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, entirely yours.</p>
