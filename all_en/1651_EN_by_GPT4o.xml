      <p>Greetings. Reverend man, esteemed teacher and patron, I consider communication with those men who excel the rest of humanity in piety, learning, virtue, and wisdom among the chief ornaments of a scholarly man.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since last year I was given the opportunity to enter into friendship with you, and you have meanwhile confirmed it with letters written to me most lovingly, I sincerely congratulate myself on this happiness, and your letters will forever be to me like a most precious treasure and the surest testimony and pledge of true and ardent goodwill towards me. Would that I could in turn declare my respect for you with some service; but since I am removed from you by a very long distance, I hope you will find my mind mindful and my faith and constancy in honoring you. For I now live at the farthest edge of the world on the shore of the Baltic Sea and I give thanks to God, who has placed me in these places, which alone almost provide a peaceful refuge with well and most sacredly established churches and schools. In this academy, I present to the listeners the elements of Christian doctrine and am greatly aided by your Decades. However, to show you some example of my respect for you and my exercises, I have attached to the letters a little disputation On the Essence of God and the Distinctions of Persons, held by me last year, in which you will see that I have often used your orthodox assertion of both natures in Christ. I have also added a funeral oration about Prince Heinrich and I beg you to receive these papers with an even mind and to love me, as you have begun, perpetually.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and happily. I respectfully and dutifully wish health to the most distinguished men, Mr. Conrad Gessner and Mr. Rudolf Gwalther.</p>

      <p>To the Reverend man, outstanding in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, governing the church of God in the renowned city of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and teacher, to be reverently honored.</p>
