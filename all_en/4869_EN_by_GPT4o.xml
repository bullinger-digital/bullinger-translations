      <p>Greetings. I have received your letter written on the 9th of this month.</p>
      <p>I have seen your concern about the synod of bishops. But regarding that assembly, which will take place on the 20th of this month, many are hopeful, and that the better and more learned party will prevail. I eagerly await what the princes and the king's council will have done after hearing the opinions of all the senators of the Paris Parliament on the matter of religion. What I learn, I will inform you, and if I have the confession of the impious Italian you mentioned, I will send it to you. Rambouillet will interpret the copy of the letters that were sent to me from Spain, and he will narrate what he understands from me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will make an end, having enough business with the envoys of the Five Cantons, whom I wish were more mindful and grateful for the benefits. Greet all the friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, July 14.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
