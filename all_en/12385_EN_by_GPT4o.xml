    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Hilles' last letter to Bullinger was sent some time ago [HBBW XV, No. 2137?], it is now time to provide news again. Hilles thanks Bullinger for his books, which he recently sent him [through Ludwig Lavater] for reading and not as a [mere] gift. He will read them thoroughly so that his gain from the reading is as great as Bullinger's effort in writing them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">– For reasons unknown to him, Ludwig Lavater is not staying with Matthias Zell, but with a certain [Johannes] Marbach, even though Bullinger's letter from [last] October [not received] indicated that Lavater's father [Hans Rudolf] did not want this. Bullinger had cited Marbach's Lutheran disposition as the reason, which, however, is common [in Strasbourg], as almost all professors and preachers there are Lutherans or at least present themselves as such. Therefore, it is not necessary for Ludwig [Lavater] to change accommodation, especially since, even if he were to stay with another scholar, he would still have [a Lutheran] as a host. Hilles hardly knows anyone else who offers accommodation and where one would be better off than with Zell, who was praised by Gerhard [thom Camph] and others. The other [boarding house leaders] are not equally praised by the students. However, Hilles must admit that since he has been living [in Strasbourg], he has only met a few [boarding house leaders]. - For Bullinger's sake, he offered Ludwig [Lavater] to pay him the board costs for a quarter or half a year. Since Ludwig's father is wealthy, he will be able to hand over the money to John Burcher [in Zurich] before Hilles gives [Ludwig] the same amount; for Hilles hardly keeps [cash] with him for more than a week, but immediately invests it in goods. Bullinger should forgive Hilles' frank remarks about financial matters. Hilles is also willing to pay the amount and receive it later through Burcher, even if this will probably cost [Ludwig's father] three times as much.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger will be able to gather news from England from a letter [No. 2336] by John Hooper. Hooper, who once resided at the court [of Henry VIII], is now studying in Strasbourg and is a devout and convinced disciple of Christ as well as an admirer of Bullinger. He fell very ill in Hilles' house, and when he seemed to be on the brink of death, he made an impressive confession of the Eucharist before many listeners and also recited all the articles of the [Apostolic] Creed several times.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- When Hilles read in Bullinger's letter about the death of Megander [died on August 17, 1545], it initially pained him greatly; but in view of the state of the world and the happiness of those who die in Christ, he now begins to praise God for it. May He compensate for the loss incurred by the Zurich church! - John Burcher wrote that Bullinger or his wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] wanted to send the Hilles family a cheese for Christmas. Fortunately, it did not happen, as his family has already received more gifts and kindness from Bullinger and his wife than they could ever reciprocate. Bullinger should not spend so much [money on gifts] and should not doubt that he remains recommended to Hilles.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings, also from his wife [Anna, née Lacey], to Bullinger and his wife, to Megander's widow [Regula, née Offenhuser] (if she is still a widow) as well as to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [P.S.:] Ludwig [Lavater] reports that he has agreed with Marbach on 30 guilders a year for the pension, about which he will certainly have informed Bullinger in writing [No. 2320].</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in the Lord! Since it has been a long time since I last wrote to your piety, I cannot refrain any longer. First of all, I give you immense thanks, my lord, for deeming me worthy to send those books, which you recently sent to me for reading, even though you did not give them to me as a gift. But since it pleased you so, I accept them with a grateful heart, and what remains in them that I have not yet read, God willing, I will complete by reading. May the best and greatest God grant that I may read them with great benefit, just as you published them with the greatest labor for the glory of God's name and the edification of the church.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Ludwig Lavater (I do not know what happened) did not stay with Mr. Matthias Zell, but, as he told me, is now with a certain Mr. Marbach, who, as I understand from your letters given in October, is someone with whom Ludwig's father would not be pleased for him to stay. You say the reason is that Marbach breathes Lutheranism; but this is not new among us, as almost all preachers and lecturers here especially breathe and exhale Lutheranism onto others; so that either Luther has led them into his error, or they pretend to be Lutherans, fascinated by the world. Therefore, if we were to consider this, there is no need for your Ludwig to change his lodging again, as he would have the same situation (if he lived with any learned person here). And as for me, my lord, I hardly know anyone here who keeps boarders for money, with whom I would think he would be better off than with Mr. Matthias Zell. For I have only heard him praised by Gerard from Friesland and others, and not the others by the students who board with them, among whom, however, I have known few since I came here to live. I am ready and have offered, if Ludwig desires it from me, to pay the money for a quarter or half a year for the board of that young man, for your sake. However, since his father is wealthy, I think it will not be a loss for him if he first gives it to John Burcher there, so that I can give the same amount here later. For indeed, I hardly keep money with me for more than a week, but rather invest it in some goods immediately. But I pray you do not take it badly, my lord, that I now write to you so freely, because I only indicate to your piety the state of our affairs, as far as the use of money is concerned. In the meantime, however, I will by no means refuse to pay the money here first, before I receive it from you through John Burcher, even if the sum is three times as much as I think it will be.</p>

      <p>If there is any news here or from England, you will learn it from the letters of a certain compatriot of mine, who is studying here, whose name is Mr. John Hooper, formerly from our king's court, but now a disciple of Christ, the King of Kings, zealous and most pious, and a great admirer of your name among all theologians. He was almost at the point of death in my house, and when he seemed about to give up his spirit, he often declared the words and confession of a most pious Christian heart concerning the matter of the Eucharist and all the articles of the Christian faith before many bystanders. May the best and greatest God grant him grace to persevere to the end, so that he may be saved. Amen.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I was grieved at first about the death of Mr. Megander when I read your letters; now, however, when I consider the state of this world and the happiness of those who die in Christ, I begin to praise God for him. In the meantime, may God make up for the loss that, as you write, the Zurich church suffers or feels from his departure. John Burcher recently wrote to me how you or your pious wife wanted to send us cheese for the feast of the Nativity of the Lord; but I am glad you did not do so; for we have received more gifts and benefits from you than we could ever repay. Therefore, spare your resources, I pray, my lord, and nonetheless do not doubt our feelings towards you; for we love you, as we used to, in the Lord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>My wife and I, as well as the widow (if she is still a widow) of Mr. Megander, especially greet you and your most chaste wife, Mr. Pellikan, Mr. Theodor Bibliander, and your beloved Mr. Gwalther, as he deserves. Farewell in Christ Jesus, our Lord and hope, in whom live long and happily. Amen.</p>

      <p>Your Richard Hilles.</p>
      <p>Ludwig says that he agreed with Mr. Marbach for 30 guilders per year for board; but without a doubt, he has informed you of this in his letters long before now.</p>
