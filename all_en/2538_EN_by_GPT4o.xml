      <p>Greetings. That in my letters, most illustrious and highly esteemed in Christ, I have sometimes more freely lamented and complained to you about the fortunes and events of our times, I truly do not regret (to speak as it is); for those complaints prompted you to send me a letter full of edification and consolation, which was most delightful for me to read, and I give you great thanks for it. And although each day abundantly provides material for complaining and lamenting, and it is pleasing for me to frequently hear consolations such as yours, yet because I fear that by writing or you by reading, if I continue to act on a similar theme, I may be too burdensome, I would like, if I can, to abstain from complaints. What then shall I do? Since sad news does not cease to be announced, I am certainly compelled to write about such things as are reported. You (I am sure) can strengthen your heart, such is your piety, so that you do not grieve too much; as for me, though I am weak in spirit, I do not cease to hope for strength and fortitude from the Lord. Therefore, what is announced is this: the English are dealing with the inauguration of King Philip, and it is almost certain to happen; indeed, they have already appointed envoys to go to Rome and profess faith and obedience in the name of the Kingdom of England before Julius III. Cardinal Pole will lead them once the king is crowned. The tyrannical power of inquiring into anyone suspected of heresy and punishing the convicted has been restored to the bishops; only the nobles have exempted themselves, for they wanted to be entirely free from the bishops' unrestrained aggression and fury. The rest, however, are left subject to them as they were before Henry VIII, and, what is harsher, the Bishop of Winchester, along with his fellow advisors of his leaven, strives to completely prevent merchants from sending any money across the sea to refugees from England for the sake of religion, and they order that if they have any in their hands, they should not return it unless they wish to be severely punished and pay twice the amount. This has resulted in the good Doctor Cox being defrauded of his money; for the merchant who had it in his hands in Antwerp is forced to retain it, and some others are oppressed by the same calamity. This is from England, where they are thought to have begun to honor the Archbishop of Canterbury, once a martyr of the Pope, again, and it is believed by the wise that both Rochester and More should be entirely included in the list of such martyrs. Thus, with true piety extinguished, false sanctity is introduced. I will not write about the newly fabricated Interim seen in Augsburg, because I do not think it is unknown to you. I greatly approve and admire the strength of your Senate in the cause of the Locarnese, because I do not doubt that such acts of supreme piety are pleasing to God and Christ our Lord, who will abundantly repay them for this justice and kindness and will deign to console those afflicted in some way. Farewell.</p>
      <p>May divine mercy preserve you for us in safety for many years. Strasbourg, January 29, 1555. In my name, bid all the fellow ministers farewell. Our Zanchi sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, endowed with distinguished learning and piety, Lord Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
