      <p>God with us. Dear son, herewith you have the true account of the French massacre, also the unfortunate pardon of the king, from which it is understood that he wants to falsely accuse the late admiral of a conspiracy against him. However, you should send all of this back to me, as I am sending it to you here, within 8 days, well packed, so that nothing of it is lost. This account was given to me this week by the noble Count Ulysses Martinengo, who is traveling from Geneva to Italy, and who was in Geneva with one of the king's chamberlains (who also escaped) and learned from him and others who were present, written in French, where our dear brother-in-law Dr. Keller translated it into German, also J. Hans Heinrich Schmid, as you see here in their handwriting. The last writing to the governor of Lyon and what is with it I received from Bern, which is first noted in my handwriting, from the Netherlands, written in Latin by the Count of N. and translated into German by me from my letter. Send all of this back to me exactly, and it would also be time for you to send me back the Memoralia in Jonah, which I sent to you via Dyes on the 17th of May this year, etc. Mayor Cammli has become the chief captain, treasurer Thoman the captain of the shooters. May God be our captain and protect us from war; but if it must be, may He fight for us against all arrogance and tyranny, treachery and idolatry.</p>
      <p>Greet Susanna and the children for me and all of us, also J. Hansen Peyer and H. Hansen LÃ¶wen, etc.</p>
      <p>Given on Saturday, October 4, 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
