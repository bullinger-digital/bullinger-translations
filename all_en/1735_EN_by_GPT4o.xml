      <p>Greetings. Since Johannes von Ulm is now returning to his homeland, I did not want him to come to you, most illustrious man and highly esteemed in the Lord, without my letter; however, I will write briefly, both because I am troubled by a quartan fever and because I have little time due to some other matters. Moreover, I am certain that Johannes will abundantly inform you about our condition, the church, and the school. Therefore, I ask you to relieve me with your prayers, so that, if it is seen fit by God our Father, I may be freed from the quartan fever, in order that I may be able to work in His vineyard according to the strength given to me. I would like the same to be done for my wife, who is afflicted with the same kind of illness and indeed is suffering far more severely than I am. I know that you and the excellent brothers and fellow ministers in Christ will not fail in this duty. I received the letters you sent me in March in August, and I believe you already know that our Celsus, whom you kindly recommended to me, did not come here due to a change of plan; for it seemed to him, or rather to the Holy Spirit, as I think, to take up the ministry of the Italian brothers in Geneva. May God grant him that he is not deprived of the expected fruit. I will not write now about how much I have longed for him for a year; for I see that it is enough for the faithful of Christ, while living here, that if they are separated by distances, they remain united in spirit. Know that Johannes, who is returning to you, conducted himself piously and gravely among us, and therefore I commend him to you and your church not in an ordinary way.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers in my name, I pray. In the house of the most reverend Archbishop of Canterbury, October 4th.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>I am here with the most reverend Archbishop of Canterbury, so that the ecclesiastical laws that remained unfinished last winter may be completed, and, by the grace of God, I hope well... and to the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
