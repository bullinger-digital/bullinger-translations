    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks the people of Zurich for sending Erasmus Schmid; the pastors in Riquewihr will gladly accept him as a teacher and leader. Since their prince [Count George of Württemberg-Mömpelgard] had to travel, Treasurer Johannes Frosch will take care of Schmid; the people of Zurich need not worry about him, as he will be dealing with a civilized people [in Riquewihr].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I cannot easily refrain from giving you, dearest brothers and most learned of all, my eternal thanks for finally obliging our illustrious prince, who has been eagerly waiting, and the ministers of his church and us, who have been anxiously pleading. You have also proven that my efforts were not in vain and that I have brought nothing false or deceitful before the prince and the whole church, by sending us the much-desired and universally desirable Erasmus. I, for my part, will always regard him as both a parent and a teacher. Not only I, but all my brothers, colleagues, and fellow ministers have long awaited with great desire to obey his doctrine and authority and to be his subjects. There is no need to commend him to us, which we indeed acknowledge we owe to him and to you.</p>
      <p>The illustrious prince, Count of Württemberg, will provide for him, and he could not wait for his arrival for three or four days. He will have good and pious overseers, especially Johannes Frosch, a most learned man and very fond of us, who has always been very favorable to all who love the word and to the ministers. Would he neglect this Erasmus, who is desirable to all of us? And we brothers, in our modesty, will ensure that he lacks nothing, as he is to be held in high esteem and value by us. Therefore, lay aside all care and anxiety; for you have not sent your colleague to uncharitable Scythians or other foreigners, but to pious and faithful brothers, and to magistrates and people who, although rustic, are eager for the divine word and who are willing to share in the needs of a faithful bishop. As for sending us this Erasmus, we can never adequately thank you; but may God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, reward you in the future age, to whose glory and for the advancement and edification of his church the efforts of such pious men are directed. And when that prince, the guardian of pastors, appears, may you receive from him an unfading crown of glory.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, most learned and upright men, and pray to God for us, just as we do for you.</p>
      <p>Given in Hunawihr, November 15, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus König, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious pastors and ministers, readers of the word in Zurich, dearest friends and brothers.</p>
