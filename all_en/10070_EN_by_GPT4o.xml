      <p>Our kind greetings beforehand.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, since it has come to our attention that you have unfortunately left Bremgarten due to uncertain circumstances and, as we fear, will not have much space there anymore, we reach out to you with our friendly request (wish) that you would come to us here; we would like to provide you with a reasonable position so that you may, God willing, proclaim the Gospel of Christ with much fruit in our city. In doing so, you would be pleasing (favor, kindness) to God and us. We request your response with this bearer.</p>
      <p>Dated Tuesday, the 28th day of November in the year 1531.</p>
      <p>Adelberg Meyer, mayor and council of the city of Basel.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, once preacher in Bremgarten, our good friend, now in Zurich.</p>
