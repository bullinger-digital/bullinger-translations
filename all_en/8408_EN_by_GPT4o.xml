      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Most esteemed lord and father in Christ. Since I know for certain and am entirely convinced that you love me no less than I love and respect you, an outstanding man, I could not refrain from recommending to you a grandson of mine from my daughter, whom I am sending to Zurich to be educated by your son-in-law, a man renowned for his piety and learning. This is not because I do not fully trust, as is proper, the integrity of such an upright man, but because I would seem to be acting against duty if I did not commend the boy to you, given the uncommon bond and friendship that exists between us. Hence, I will not say much, content to merely hint, confident that out of your goodwill towards me, you will do more in this matter for our friendship than I could request from you with many words.</p>
      <p>As for recent events, it is undoubtedly reported from all sides that the Venetians have lost the island of Cyprus, except for two fortresses, which no one believes can be defended for much longer.</p>
      <p>Finally, most revered lord and father in Christ, I earnestly ask you again and again to make use of my services in return, if there is anything you judge I can do for your favor or for the sake of your honor or benefit; indeed, I will not fail to let you know that I am no less free in seeking your help than I am eager to provide it to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Chiavenna, October 17, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your most loving and devoted, as a sincere friend and brother in Christ, Hercules von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, theologian and pastor in the church of Zurich, venerable in many respects, my most esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
