      <p>To the most esteemed Lord Bullinger, his Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter, Mr. Johannes Baptista Skenardus, originating from our Valtellina, approached me to seek advice on where he should go to thoroughly learn jurisprudence in Germany from worthy and truly learned men in that profession. I could not offer a more beneficial counsel than to suggest he travel to you and consult you first and foremost, and to follow your advice. Since he has said he will follow my counsel and I have no doubt he will do so, I commend him to you, so that you may kindly prescribe to him where he should direct his journey to acquire expertise in laws and jurisprudence. I know that no one can advise him better or promote him better among the most learned men through their intercession than Mr. Bullinger can.</p>
      <p>In summary: I ask that you consider him recommended in my name, etc. Furthermore, after I returned from Venice, I wrote to you about everything I should have informed you about, and since I wrote to you, I have received two letters from you, which were indeed most welcome. I say most welcome because they came from you, my most esteemed lord and patron, and from them, I learned that you, along with your entire family and even my little son, are well. However, they also caused me some distress because I learned from them how the most Christian king has been affected by a great disaster at Saint-Quentin. Indeed, while I was in Venice, rumors of this were spreading there; however, it was not reported that the most Christian king had suffered such a loss. But since it was fated that these events, whatever they may be, occurred, and since it cannot be undone, what has been done must be borne with equanimity, and we must pray to the Lord God to favor the most Christian king in the future and that, as the saying goes, the end may not respond to the beginning in the same course, etc. Regarding the gift you sent me, which is most celebrated, most desired, and indeed most expected (I speak of your Apocalypse), I give you immense thanks, which I will try to repay in part, if ever given the opportunity, as befits a grateful man. I received the gift itself today around noon, and I could hardly tear myself away from its reading to take food; for as soon as I tasted the work, it pleased me greatly, and I will not stop until I reach the end. May the Lord God grant that I gather the most beneficial fruit from it!</p>
      <p>Regarding what you mentioned in your last letters, that my son also suffered from a headache or illness, which is almost everywhere rampant, and has recovered, I give thanks to God. Indeed, almost all of us here in this jurisdiction have been affected by this plague; however, no one (as you also write) has perished from this infirmity so far. Additionally, in Venice, this illness was also widespread.</p>
      <p>But may the Lord God prevent any worse contagion from following. Our Lord Johannes Traversius, a most venerable old man, to whom I regularly communicate your letters that you send to me and whom you greet in these letters, is well and in turn sends his greetings to you and offers himself entirely to you from the heart. Mr. Peter Bergomas also sends you many greetings and commends himself to you. There is nothing new that I can write at the moment.</p>
      <p>I indeed give you tireless thanks, who, despite being burdened with the most pressing occupations, do not hesitate (which is a great testament to your humanity towards me) to keep me informed daily.</p>
      <p>Indeed, my Lord Bullinger, I am ashamed whenever I think that you endure so much trouble for my sake or out of love for me. But you do as you always do, omitting nothing to render me (as you have long rendered me) most devoted to you. Farewell greatly, most esteemed lord, and keep me and my son commended to you. Given hastily in the dead of night in Samaden on the 8th of September, 1557. I also ask that you kindly greet in my name the reverend elders and most esteemed lords, Lord Bernardino Ochino and Mr. Peter Martyr Vermigli, your noble lords, Lord Walther and Mr. Frisius, and finally all pious and learned men, to whom I wish a Nestor's age and that most happily. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>The same as above, to you as my most esteemed lord and patron, most devoted Friedrich von Salis. Mr. Bullinger, consider my poor writing as good, for I have experienced such kindness from you so far that I have no hesitation in writing to you extemporaneously and in haste, as the time allows. And may you and yours always be entrusted to me.</p>
      <p>Also, please truly greet your honorable wife, my son, and the entire household for me, etc.</p>
      <p>Given as above.</p>
