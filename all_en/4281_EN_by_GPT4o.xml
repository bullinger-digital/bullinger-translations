      <p>Greetings. What you, my brother, have asked of me regarding your son, I have attempted to carry out, and for that reason, the opportunity was not unwelcome to me, as certain business required me to visit the court of Pforzheim after the Easter festival. However, the reason I could not bring back a definite response is that the steward of the court, who is entrusted with the management and distribution of such duties, was absent at the time; nevertheless, both the court preacher and some of the councilors promised diligently that they would take care of the matter as soon as the opportunity presented itself and would inform me of what they had accomplished.</p>
      <p>When I receive that response, I will not keep it from you. Duke Christoph and Margrave Karl are now at the Wildbad; it is said that Wolfgang of the Palatinate and several others will come there as well. From there, they will proceed to the wedding (I suppose) that the Landgrave of Hesse will celebrate for the betrothed daughter of the Elector Palatine to his son Philipp, undoubtedly with great pomp and immense luxury. Germany promises itself great security and certain peace as if placed beyond all danger, which I wish may not be more threatening than everyone expects.</p>
      <p>It is reported that the Saxon preparations have been dispersed, as the Bavarian and the bishops have not obscurely indicated that they will be ready in turn. Thus, one sword has kept the other in its sheath.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there is neither end nor limit to ecclesiastical disputes; for solemn debates are held, prepared for that purpose. Many speak much about the successes of Illyricus, as more and more people daily subscribe to his opinion on predestination, justification, and free will, while the authority of Philipp is gradually waning.</p>
      <p>How great these wounds are to the church, you understand with pain due to your prudence and piety. It is the usual artifice of Satan to set against each other those who ought to fight together for the truth; for it is evident that the battle against the Antichrist is not yet over, as shown by the furious persecutions against the church and the biting pamphlets of the antagonists flying back and forth. Our Hospinianus has published a writing (as you know), which has offended not a few, and I wish he had been more cautious.</p>
      <p>I am entirely focused on handling this matter moderately; may the Lord grant success, grace, and peace to His church. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 10, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
