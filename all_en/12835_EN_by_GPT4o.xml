    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] On January 27, Haller's relatives [including Konrad Kambli] brought Bullinger's letter from January 22 [not received], while Bullinger's letter from January 14 [No. 2752] only arrived the following day. The letters contained the advice to endure in Augsburg as long as possible. In the meantime, Bullinger should have received a letter from Georg Frölich [not received] and another from Haller [No. 2769 from January 25] with reports on the current situation, while Frölich and Haller are still waiting for Bullinger's response as well as that of the Zurich council [to Haller's letters from January 18 and 25 to the Zurich council].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] During their negotiations with Emperor Charles V, the people of Augsburg had to promise to dismiss Sebastian Schertlin (he will probably come to Zurich) and to accept imperial troops in the city. The council secretly bid farewell to Bernardino Ochino and Francesco Stancaro to avoid having to extradite Ochino. In light of this development, the Zurich pastors in Augsburg [Haller, Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] had written to the Zurich council for permission to leave Augsburg. The people were also so agitated that the houses of the mayors [Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot] had to be protected by guards for two nights. Fortunately, God prevented an uprising, otherwise the pastors would have been held responsible for their calls for steadfastness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Subsequently, Haller's relatives arrived in Augsburg on behalf of Haller's father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli]. They wanted to bring Haller's wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli] and the children [Agnes and Johannes] back to Zurich. However, the mayors did not grant permission for this. They asked Haller and the other preachers to stay to prevent the people from branding them as traitors. They further justified the peace made with the Emperor because the people of Augsburg were allowed to continue practicing their religion freely until a general reformation in the German Empire. Moreover, the preachers were safe from the Emperor. The mayors also promised to do everything possible to prevent a foreign occupation in the city, and if they failed, it would only result in an occupation of three companies of German mercenaries for a month, so that the vain Emperor could maintain the appearance of his authority. The mayors also emphasized that it would have been dangerous to continue resisting the Emperor, especially since Augsburg could no longer count on allies in southern Germany. After all, one must obey the Emperor. Even Landgrave Philip of Hesse and the people of Strasbourg were already negotiating with him. This was communicated to Haller not only in private but also publicly, in a meeting of the pastors, by the mayors, and made palatable to the people with promising words.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Thus, Haller no longer has a valid reason to leave Augsburg or to send his family away from there. Even the city clerk Georg Frölich is no longer trying to obtain his leave. He also advised Haller against sending his wife and children away. The mayors promised Haller that in case of danger, they would secretly lead him and his family out of the city with a strong escort. Haller's relatives were compensated by the council with twelve crowns for their journey and gifted with an honorary wine, so they would leave Haller and his family in the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Haller is completely torn. The mayors are now keeping him in the city of Augsburg, threatened by the Emperor, while he waits to be recalled by the people of Zurich. Some want him to stay, others want him to leave. It would be good if he received the authority from the Zurich council to decide for himself whether to leave Augsburg if his conscience urges him to do so. Because while he is forced to report on the new dangers in Augsburg each time, only to then wait for permission to leave Augsburg, he is not only accused of being fearful, but it also leads to [dangerous] delays.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The three other Zurichers in Augsburg, especially Meyer and Schwyzer, are eager to leave Augsburg. In a conversation with the mayors, they behaved so boldly that there is no intention to hold them back if they want to leave. Haller learned this from the mayors themselves. But if he were to tell these colleagues, they would leave immediately. However, Haller wants to wait for Bullinger's and the Zurich council's decision first.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] He is willing to take risks for the honor of God; but not risks that would be detrimental to the church. He is not trying to conveniently retreat home. Rather, he wants to continue to edify other people abroad. But whether it would be more beneficial for the church and the good reputation of Zurich to return or to stay in Augsburg, Bullinger should decide himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The Augsburg envoys paid homage to the Emperor on January 29. They are now trying to prevent the quartering of imperial troops in Augsburg. The Emperor is said to have shown them favor and made great promises. Believe them who will!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony has allegedly already invaded Silesia, Leipzig has been taken, and Duke Moritz has fled to Bohemia. It is reported that a large army is being gathered from Denmark, Holstein, Lüneburg, Brandenburg, and the Hanseatic cities, which is intended for Duke Johann Ernst of Saxony-Coburg, the [half]brother of the Elector. Additionally, Khair ad-Din Barbarossa has occupied an imperial port in Africa. However, it is not true that the Landgrave has besieged Frankfurt. The soldiers dismissed by the Emperor are roaming around and posing a danger to travelers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Pankraz Mötteli von Rappenstein was dismissed without pay. As he was on his way from Mindelheim to Augsburg this week, he was captured by Italians near Angelberg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The false prophet Claude d'Aliod has recanted his heresy, but other followers of his faith continue to hold on to it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Bullinger was annoyed by the letter from Haller to his father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli] because the latter told everything further and thus contributed to Haller being branded as a coward in Zurich. This was also written by Rudolf Gwalther, to whom Haller has responded. Kambli alone is responsible for any negative consequences, especially since Haller rarely writes to this somewhat senile man anyway. Those who accuse him of cowardice are either not quite right in the head or are only intent on making all "priests" (as they call the pastors) look bad. But God knows Haller; and Haller's church in Augsburg knows him too. Or should Haller now start spreading false news?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Greetings, also to the wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and the children. Greetings from Meyer, Schwyzer, Ruman, Wolfgang Musculus, Michael Keller, and Sixt Birck.</p>

      <p>Greetings. My relatives brought me your letters dated January 22 on the 27th of the same month, and the ones you wrote on January 14, I finally received on the 28th. You advise staying in Augsburg as long as we can with a clear conscience and without risking our lives. In the meantime, I believe you have received other letters from Mr. Laetus and me, to which we await your response and that of the esteemed Zurich council. In these letters, we have explained the current state of affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Our people have submitted to the Emperor and agreed that Schertlius (whom I believe you will soon see in Zurich) be dismissed and that imperial soldiers be admitted into the city for protection. The Emperor also requested Bernhardinus, whom the council secretly dismissed along with Mr. Stanggarus. With these departures and as we await the soldiers, what else could we do but write to the Zurich council to ask for permission to leave and to request free passage? The people were also agitated, so much so that for two whole nights, armed guards protected the houses of the consuls. If the Lord had not averted it, we would have been blamed for this tragedy, as we have always encouraged steadfastness and perseverance.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Conveniently, as things stood, my relatives arrived on behalf of my father-in-law to take my wife and children away. I informed the consuls of this: I could not obtain permission. But they earnestly asked me with promises and pledges not to abandon them, lest I further agitate the people. For if I were to leave, this fire would grow larger, and everyone would cry out that they had been betrayed and sold out if the preachers were to leave. They also presented just and fair reasons for peace: They are allowed to practice their religion freely as they currently do, without any added ceremonies, until a common reformation is made in the German Empire. All preachers are also individually secured by the Emperor's majesty. They will also move every stone to prevent any soldiers from being admitted, and yet, if they are forced to accept them, only three banners of German soldiers are to be admitted for one month, at least in name, so that the proud Emperor can maintain his authority and have a name among other nations for holding Augsburg. They further explained what calamities would have followed if we continued to resist (as we are the only ones left in Upper Germany). We seek nothing else but the preservation of religion. With this promise, it is fair to obey the Emperor in other matters. The Landgrave and the people of Strasbourg are also negotiating peace with the Emperor. These and many other things were explained to me both privately and publicly by the consuls at a meeting of the ministers. Publicly, they also proclaimed these things to the people with colorful words.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Therefore, I have no honest reason either to leave myself or to send my family away, which I would undoubtedly have soon followed. Even our chief scribe has ceased to urge the leave he had requested, and he dissuades me in every way from sending my children and wife away. The consuls also promised splendidly: They do not want to put me in any danger; if they see this impending, they will secretly send me away with a strong hand. They also gave my relatives twelve crowns for travel expenses and honored them with wine publicly, at least so they would leave us behind.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am completely at a loss as to what I should do. On one hand, they hold me here. On the other hand, I expect to be recalled by the Zurich lords; on one hand, I fear the Emperor's yoke and treachery; on the other hand, the faith of the lords moves me. Many advise me to leave, who would gladly do without me; others urge me to stay, who would gladly have me. I wish I could obtain this one thing from the Zurich lords, that it would be free for me to leave when it is not possible to stay with a good conscience. For while I am always forced to wait for their response and in the meantime, while I signify some dangers, I am drawn into suspicion of timidity, our affairs are delayed too much. Since all things are still uncertain, nothing certain has been decided yet, but time, circumstances, and place will give counsel.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The other three, especially Laurentius and Rodolphus, are contemplating and seeking nothing but departure. They have been to the consuls, with whom they used such bold and stubborn words that I heard from them (the consuls) that they would not retain those two if they wanted to leave. If I were to inform them of this, they would leave immediately. But we await your and the esteemed Zurich council's advice.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I certainly do not refuse any danger that leads to the glory of Christ, but those that lead to the church's ruin. I do not so much desire to be well at home with some scandal as to be poorly among strangers with the edification of others. But whether it should be done at this time and is more beneficial to the church and honorable to the Zurich name, I appeal to you as a judge.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Envoys sent to the Emperor on January 29 submitted to the Emperor. They are now negotiating about not receiving soldiers and other matters. They write that the Emperor showed himself most gracious and promised splendidly; let those who wish, trust them!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>They say about the Elector that he is now ravaging Silesia. Leipzig has been captured, Duke Maurice has fled to Bohemia. An innumerable army of Danes, Holsteiners, Lüneburgers, Brandenburgers, and maritime cities has gathered, whose leader is Ernest, the brother of the Elector. They also say that the Emperor has lost a very strong port in Africa to Barbarossa. Some falsely say that the Landgrave is besieging Frankfurt. The Emperor dismisses many soldiers, who, running everywhere, are dangerous to travelers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Metellus was dismissed by the lords and deprived of his stipend, while this week, as he was traveling from Mindelheim towards Augsburg, he was captured by Italians at Angelberg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>That Claude, the false prophet, a most pestilent rascal, has recanted his error, but he has infected others who have not yet wanted to recant.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Regarding these matters, because you are angry with me for imprudence, for writing to my father-in-law, which he then spreads, from which the name of timidity arises for me, I have responded a little to our Gwalther, who indicated the same. If any fault is committed, it is my father-in-law's, not mine. I do my duty: I write to him very rarely and very simply, because I know he is somewhat delirious due to old age. Those who interpret me in such a way as to gather from this that I am faint-hearted, they are either of no judgment or otherwise unjust to me and all priests (as they call us). I care little for those impious mockers. The Lord knows what I am like. The church will testify what I have shown myself to be. I do not want nor can I write falsehoods, unless perhaps they delight more in falsehoods than in truths! But about these things, a few words to Gwalther.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Farewell. Our three brothers, Musculus, Cellarius, and my Xystus, greet you. Greet all the brothers, your dear wife, and children. Augsburg, February 1, 1547. Johannes Haller, forever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his lord and venerable father. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
