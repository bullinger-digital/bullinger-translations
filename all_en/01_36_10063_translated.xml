  <input>Salve in Christo, mi frater.

Vigilii libros legi et approbavi semper. Miror autem, quare petas a me exponi istud: «Philippe, qui videt me, videt et patrem meum» [Joh 14, 9], quum antea a multis declaratum sit Porro dum fateris triadis unitatem, intra metam, quam et ipse amo, me contines. Certum est Christum non de corporali visione loqui; pater enim, quum spiritus sit, carnalibus oculis non videtur.

De cognitione igitur sermo est. Iam sublimior est divina natura, quam ut maiestas eius nobis in sua essentia cognobilis. Sic solus filius patrem novit. Sufficit igitur nunc parvitati nostrę ineffabilem dei bonitatem agnoscere, quam agnoscentes credimus, iustificamur beatique efficimur. Quorsum enim quam in bonitatem fertur fides? Quis cum fide in benignissimum deum beatus non est? In hac igitur cognitione proficiamus, et crescet in nobis etiam charitas, et variarum virtutum exuberabit abundantia. Itaque ad patrem per filium sic pervenire licebit. Et si cognoverimus, quantum nos dilexerit filius, qui pro nobis passus est, cognoscemus etiam, quantum nos diligat pater, qui tantum filium pro nobis tradidit.

Videamus igitur, an contextus verborum pati hanc sententiam queat. Dicit: «Vado parare vobis locum» [Joh 14,2]; utique in domo patris ipse nos reconciliando et apud patrem patrocinando sic parat, quod praedestinando paratum. Rediturum autem se indicans et glorie sue participes nos facturum subdit: «Iterum veniam, ut ubi ego sum, ibi et vos sitis» [Joh 14,3]. Opus ineffabilis benignitatis et misericordię, sua humilitate ad gloriam et sua morte ad vitam nos provehere. Quis in hoc non videt amorem summum? Iam autem edocti erant d[e] h[oc], summam dei gloriam esse, ad quam transiret, proinde patrem, ad quem iturus erat, cognoscebant quodammodo, et viam ad illam per Ihesum [!] crucifixum sciebant, tametsi sibi ipsi Thomas ignotus clamat: «nescimus» [Joh 14,5]. Exponit autem Christus et ait: «Ego sum via, veritas et vita» [Joh 14,6]. An non, quum in me ista cognoscitis, quod veritas sum et veritatis doctor, vita et vitę author, iure ad patrem dux et via ero? Videtis tot in me bona opera et miracula, agnoscetis et in morte benefaciendi studium. Quis unquam indulgentissimum patrem sic declarabit atque ego, qui non minus mon quam ille ad mortem pro vobis me tradere paratus, ut eius amor colliquescat? Certe etiam nunc ex operibus potentię venistis ad agnitionem aliquantam illius et vidistis; non enim illa sunt carnis. Hic Philippo nondum satisfactum, ad terrena spectanti et crassa imaginanti amplior dictorum confirmatio datur. Addit enim: «Tanto tempore vobiscum sum» [Joh 14,9], benefaciens et miracula operans divina, et adhuc talia rogatis? Ecce ego, ut naturę divinę candor sum et character substantię patris, ita et benefaciendo patrem refero. Ecce habes aditum ad patrem, cuius tam perspicua opera in me vides. Nonne vides bonitatem patris in me et bonitatem meam in patre? Id sane vel opera testantur, quibus ego vos ad patrem sic adduco.

Hęc mihi sententia non videtur inutilis, non reiicio tamen interim quae Bucerus vel Cyrillus annotant. Audiam tamen et de hac re te disserentem uberius.

Vale et venerabili domino abbati Capellę meo commenda.

  <output>Greetings in Christ, my brother.

I have always read the scriptures and approved of them. I am however wondering why you ask me to explain this: "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father" [John 14:9], when it has already been declared by many. Yet, when you confess the unity of the Trinity, you contain me within the bounds which I myself also love. It is certain that Christ is not speaking of a corporeal vision, for the Father, being a Spirit, cannot be seen with carnal eyes.

Therefore, the discourse is about knowledge. The divine nature is now too sublime for us to be able to know its majesty in its essence. Thus only the Son knows the Father. It is therefore now sufficient for our smallness to acknowledge the ineffable goodness of God, which we acknowledge and believe in, to be justified and become blessed. For where does faith tend to but towards goodness? Who, when believing in the most gracious God, is not blessed? Let us therefore progress in this knowledge, and love in us will increase, and an abundance of various virtues will abound. Thus it will be possible to get to the Father through the Son. And if we know how much the Son has loved us, who suffered for us, we will also know how much the Father loves us, who gave up the Son for us.

Let us therefore see if the context of the words can bear this sense. He says: "I am going to prepare a place for you" [John 14:2], namely, by reconciling us and by interceding for us before the Father, thus preparing, by predestining. Indicating his return and that he will make us partakers of his glory, he adds: "I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am, there you may be also" [John 14:3]. An ineffable work of kindness and mercy, to lead us to glory by his humility and to life by his death. Who does not see the highest love in this? Now they were already taught that the highest glory of God was, to which he was about to pass, and thus they somehow knew the Father, to whom he was about to go, and they knew the way to it through Jesus [!] crucified, although Thomas, unknown to himself, cries out: "We know not" [John 14:5]. But Christ explains and says: "I am the way, the truth and the life" [John 14:6]. Is it not so, that by knowing these things in me, who am the truth and teacher of truth, the life and author of life, I will be rightly the guide to the Father and the way? You see so many good works and miracles in me, you acknowledge the zeal to benefit even in death. Who will ever declare a most indulgent Father as I do, who am ready to deliver myself up to death for you, that his love may be melted? Certainly even now you have come to some knowledge of Him through his powerful works and you have seen Him; for these are not earthly. Now Philip, not yet satisfied, looking to earthly things and having gross imaginations, is given a fuller confirmation of the words. For he adds: "Have I been so long time with you" [John 14:9], doing divine works and miracles, and yet you ask for more? Behold, as I am the brightness of the divine nature and the character of the Father's substance, so also I refer the Father by doing good. Behold, you have the access to the Father, whose so clear works you see in me. Do you not see the Father's goodness in me and my goodness in the Father? This surely the works attest, by which I thus bring you to the Father.

This opinion does not seem to me unprofitable, yet I do not reject what Bucer or Cyril have annotated. I will however hear you speak more fully about this matter.

Farewell and recommend me to the venerable Lord Abbot of Chapel.

Basel, 4th October.
