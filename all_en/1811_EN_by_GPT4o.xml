      <p>Greetings. Your letter, most learned man, was very pleasing to me, and indeed to my other colleagues, firstly because we gather from it that you have been restored to your former health, to God be praise forever; secondly, through your letter, we are made more certain that we are among those to whom your kindness does not disdain to write. May God, the best and greatest, allow you to remain with us for a long time, which we hope to obtain from Him through Christ with constant prayers. Thirdly, you always include news in these letters that would otherwise remain hidden from us; hence, your letters cannot but be most welcome to us.</p>
      <p>However, most learned man, regarding the first request in your letter, I would certainly prefer to write something else to you. For the situation of Vinsler (Wensler) pains me, and neither I nor anyone else would have written a word about this matter to anyone. But since you wish me to write, and I ought not to deny you anything in this matter or others, for after God I owe almost everything to you, and perhaps from Vinsler's defense, which he presents for himself, a negative opinion might fall upon our most honorable senate and also the ministers of the word, as if he had been treated entirely unjustly, I will briefly touch upon the matter as it is. And let him defend his cause as much as he can, yet he will not escape notice; for everyone, though guilty, tries to defend themselves, and it is often fulfilled what is said: if you did it, deny it. The reason for which he was removed from office is the very one you assigned, shameless greed and the usury of its fruits, and that cause drags many other evils after it and is truly the root of all evils, and it fulfills Paul's saying: Those who want to become rich fall, etc. But take the one and greatest cause concerning the magistrate. It is decreed by our senate in the field and city that no one should sell their grain, etc., except at the price set by those appointed for this business; for the grain is appraised, then it is decided at what price it should be sold. Ignoring this decree, he sold a bushel of wheat for 3 florins, a bushel of rye for 40 of our batz. The peasants complain about the high price, it is shown to the senate, it is decreed that he should allow himself to be paid at a lower price; he is also removed from office; for the penalty of transgression, 10 florins are demanded from him. There are also other reasons that moved the magistrate, namely discord between him and the peasants, between the Counts of Sulz because of some sermon, also between the bishop's prefects and him, by all of which he has incurred the greatest envy, so that it was judged that the gospel would be preached there with little fruit by him. Moreover, our magistrate strongly defended him in all cases against the aforementioned, bestowed many benefits upon him; yet he secretly sought other positions, which if he had obtained, he would certainly have left, whether the church had been provided with another minister or not.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they prefer to dismiss such an uncertain minister (and who boasted that he was so recommended, although he had no position when he was received by our people, nor was it requested by you to lend him to our people) and to remove him from office for certain reasons rather than wait for when he would come and seek forgiveness.</p>
      <p>Added to this, after various and many admonitions in the synod, he did not guard himself against greed and usury, but in Kaiserstuhl he dealt with someone in such a way that he added a great offense to the gospel; for he sold wine to a worthless man at a rather high price, doubting the payment he required a guarantor, a good man; the debtor delays payment; the guarantor, being called upon, is forced to pay, and when he could not pay, after enduring great expenses, the barn is sold to the miserable guarantor, etc. He sold his wine in Eglisau for the wine of that land; later it was discovered that the wine was his, and the buyer is forced to pay the tax, called "das Umgeld," long after, who if he had known it was Vinsler's wine, would not have bought it at such a price as he did, because of the tax. Behold the deceit committed against the magistrate of your region. These and other things were well known to the brothers, so that in the next synod (if it had as much authority as yours) he would have been removed from office; but, while we do not dare, the magistrate calls and dismisses him without our knowledge. And since there was a danger that they might perhaps receive him out of favor, the brothers show the magistrate that he had committed more serious sins than this sale, which they do not wish to name, and therefore he should not be received. Add to this that it is said he lent grain to a worthless person, yet the debtors were forced to return the best.</p>
      <p>These and other reasons are why he was removed from office, and although he denies it, we are certainly convinced that this is the case. In short, he is the very embodiment of greed and filth. As for his hope of reconciliation, I allow it through the intercession of good men, for the sake of his children. Consider carefully the testimonial letters he will receive from the magistrate; they must certainly be given in such a way that they do not seem to have acted unjustly with him, but that he, deservedly, has been deprived of office.</p>
      <p>I write all this to you alone, especially the latter sins; only that about the sale of grain is manifest, also about the discord, etc. Mr. Peyer gave letters to Mr. Volmar with his own hand. I was compelled to retain your bundle, recently sent to me, for a few days due to the lack of couriers, but it has long since been returned to the count, indeed Mr. Peyer is now seeking the Duke and Duchy of Württemberg, perhaps bringing writings and responses. I have no new things to write except those very well known to you.</p>
      <p>The people of Rottweil are warned by the cities of the empire to be cautious; they also write to our magistrate asking that attention be paid to them, our people to yours, etc. There is a rumor about the emperor's heraldic letters sent to the French, etc.; but please, if you have any certainty, write to us. There is also a rumor that Ferdinand is leaving religion free to everyone and has published this by public edict. The Duke of Brunswick is again deprived of his duchy, praying to the emperor to be restored, he received the response that he already has many other matters, and since he had previously restored him, why did he not conduct himself in such a way that he could remain. Our people loudly complain how excellently the Bacchus festivals are celebrated among you, while here everything is forbidden and quiet. "Behold," they say, "your Zurich evangelicals, whom you prefer to everyone, whom you propose to us as an example, how excellently they act; hence arises a great offense." I do not write this because I think you are asleep; for it has already been indicated to us how vigorously, especially you, have resisted and cried out against it, but so that it may sometimes be said to the magistrate how much offense they give not only to the papists but also to the evangelicals and how widely their misdeeds are known and spread, as from the first church; therefore they must always act more cautiously, avoid offense, etc. Our consul, the old Meyer, who never took the Lord's Supper with us, has died; pray, I ask, to the Lord, that he may be replaced and take away the white stone, who is as the Lord wills Romans 18. Numbers 27. Deuteronomy 7.</p>
      <p>The one who offers you this letter is a pious and learned man, which you will judge from his person and speech, a Bavarian by nation; his name is Georg Acanthius, known to your family, Mr. Huldrich Zwingli and Mr. Simler, if I am not mistaken, he once studied in Basel, now lacking money he comes to us; therefore we have given him a florin and a half. Therefore, I and my other colleagues ask your kindness to have him recommended to you and to promote him as much as you can, as you have been the patron of all exiled students until now.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dear Mr. Bullinger, and have me and the other colleagues of our church recommended to you, and if there are any new things, please write to me. Greet on my behalf Mr. Gwalther, who can also give a good opinion of this young man, as a poet, Mr. Theodor, Mr. Pellican, and the other ministers of your church. Schaffhausen, February 20, 1553.</p>
      <p>Good, my dear Mr. Bullinger, consider these writings; I had to hurry.</p>
      <p>Jakob Rüeger, most devoted to your kindness. To the distinguished in learning and virtue Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his brother in Christ and esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
