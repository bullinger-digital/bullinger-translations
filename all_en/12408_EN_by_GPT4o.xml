    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has read Schuler's "Six Questions" [about the Lord's Supper], considered them well, and found that Schuler now expresses himself differently about the Lord's Supper than he did before (when both were still serving the same congregation [in Bremgarten]). Bullinger is very troubled by this. He knows that Luther tolerates such expressions; indeed, that they are used by those who believe they represent a middle position between the Lutherans and the [Zürichers]. However, Bullinger thinks that pastors should adhere to the manner of speaking of their leader [Christ]. Here, in brief, are the points that Bullinger takes issue with.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Schuler defines the Lord's Supper as "body and blood of Christ," which is wrong and absurd! The Lord's Supper is an act instituted by Christ, in which one partakes of bread and wine and remembers the Lord. This is evident from both his words and those of the Apostle [Paul]. Human tradition has equated the Lord's Supper with its purpose! But from the Gospel, one learns that the Lord's Supper serves to remember the Lord, to thank him, to believe in him, and accordingly to grow together with other believers. Through his sacraments, the Lord guarantees the promises of his joyful message, namely, that through faith our sins are forgiven and we have a share in eternal life and in [God's] gifts. This share is not bound to the celebration of the Lord's Supper. Rather, we partake in the Lord's Supper because we have already been made partakers of Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Schuler's statements give the impression that the believer receives in the Lord's Supper or through it what he already possesses (if he did not possess it, he would incur [God's] judgment); as if the sacraments convey grace to those who do not reject them! In this way, one rejects [Paul], who taught that man is justified without works, and returns to the Papists, according to whom participation in the sacrament contributes to salvation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- If only Schuler could express himself clearly and simply as before, and only as the [Holy] Scripture permits! The forgiveness of sin and eternal life is conveyed to the believer as a gift through Christ alone. Yet Christ testifies, proclaims, represents, and guarantees us in the Lord's Supper the redemption and [God's] gifts that he has provided for us and that we already possess through faith and not only through the Lord's Supper. Salvation is absorbed through faith, not through the sign; and the Lord's Supper is [only] a sign.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Schuler claims that the hunger of the soul is satisfied in the sacrament. This does not correspond to what Christ teaches in John 4, 6 and 7! Schuler further explains that the great significance he attributes to the Lord's Supper does not arise from the Lord's Supper itself or from its consumption, but solely because it becomes effective with faith and thanks to faith. Why does he not simply say clearly and plainly: Faith justifies and the sacrament testifies to it? Paul made it clear that Abraham was justified even before circumcision. Similarly, the Lord's Supper testifies that we are already justified before we partake in it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Schuler claims, like Luther, that the [institution] words bring everything with them! How can one claim such a thing? Words can only proclaim, teach, and admonish. They will never convey what they proclaim; unless one believes in magic formulas!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Like others, Schuler also uses the word "offering" (exhibitio). But signs cannot offer what is represented. Actually, "exhibitio" is synonymous with "representation" (expositio). Why use it then? To explain representations with other representations? Unless one understands "to offer" (exhibere) as "to renew" (renovare) and thereby claims that the sacrament brings forth anew what is represented (the body and blood [of Christ])! In this case, the sacrament would be an instrument through which the Lord "infuses" himself [into the believers], or the sacraments would contain what they represent! One can only offer what one possesses; and if something were offered, the officiant would also be able to offer something [himself]. Schuler should read what Augustine writes in his commentary on John 5 about doctors who think they can do such things.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Schuler should recognize his error! If only the "Six Questions" had never been published! Bullinger sends the [“Epitome”] of Johannes a Lasco, a Pole who was a patron of Erasmus of Rotterdam and now teaches in East Frisia and the Netherlands. He does not send this writing because he needs to rely on human authority, but to show Schuler that while some spread a new doctrine, others preserve and defend the purity of the doctrine with the Zürichers. Schuler should return the book after reading it. By the way, a Lasco [in his writing "Defensio verae doctrinae"] has dealt with the incarnation of Christ. [The treatise] would be useful for Schuler in his confrontation with [Kaspar von] Schwenckfeld. [Johannes] Haller will report more about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- By the way, this one does not know that Bullinger has written about the Lord's Supper in the present letter. The friendship that has connected Bullinger with Schuler for 14 years is the reason for this discretion.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I have read and considered your six questions, dear Gervasius, with my limited understanding, not without diligence, and I find that you have changed your entire manner of speaking about the Lord's Supper from what you used when we were both shepherds of the same flock and teachers of one church. This greatly troubles me, and I wish you had considered the matter more carefully. I am aware that this is almost taught by Luther, and I know that such words are used and twisted, fixed and refixed by those who seem to hold a middle position between the Lutherans and us. But I believe that pastors of the church should seek their doctrine from the chief shepherd, not from men. Therefore, I will briefly indicate what offends me in your questions, not by disputing them justly, but by merely pointing out certain things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Reading the definition of the Supper, I wondered if you had a present mind. "The Supper," you say, "is the body of Christ and his blood," etc. This definition is most alien to the matter itself, and indeed, it is plainly absurd! The Supper is of the nature of actions. Therefore, it is a sacred action instituted by Christ, in which, by taking the sacred bread and wine, we celebrate the memory of the Lord, giving thanks to him for delivering us from death by his innocent death. For thus says the Lord: "Do this in remembrance of me." And the Apostle: "As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death." By indicating the use and purpose of the Supper, you follow human traditions, not the simple doctrine of the Gospel. From it, we learn that the purpose of the Supper is to celebrate the memory of the given body, to give thanks, as has just been said, to unite into one body (1 Cor. 10:16f), to exercise faith in Christ, who visibly testifies and seals the promises of his Gospel with instituted sacraments (Rom. 4). But we are taught by the Gospel that through faith in Christ, sins are forgiven, we become heirs of eternal life, and thus we become partakers of Christ and all good things. We do not then become partakers of Christ when we partake of the Supper, but because we have been made partakers of Christ. Therefore, we approach, as the Apostle says, let a man examine himself, and then let him eat.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Nor can your words be understood otherwise than that in the Supper and through the Supper, all those things are offered to us which the faithful possess before they approach, and unless they possess them, they approach to judgment (1 Cor. 11:29). From your doctrine, it rightly follows that grace is conferred by the sacraments to those who do not place an obstacle. Thus, we build again with the Papists what we once destroyed with the Apostles. Where now is that general doctrine: Man is justified by faith without works? According to our doctrine, participation and the taking of the sacraments will be admitted, which truly pertains under the appearance of works.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I wish, therefore, that now, as once, you would speak purely and simply what you could prove from the Scriptures, which would not give any handle to the adversaries, the Papists, to establish their errors: Forgiveness of sins and eternal life are given freely through Christ to believers; but Christ testifies, signifies, represents, invokes, and seals in the Supper his redemption to us, and the gifts bestowed upon us, which we possess through faith, not finally receive in the Supper. The acceptable means of salvation is faith, not the sign; the Lord's Supper is a sign and remains in the nature of a sign. The sign testifies and seals, and unless faith is present first and Christ dwells in the hearts, the sign gives nothing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>But you say: "In this high-worthy sacrament, one finds the hunger of the soul to be satisfied." Otherwise, Christ in John 4:6,7! You say: "But I attribute so much to the Supper not because of the Supper and because it is an external work, but because it is joined with faith and therefore also because of faith." Thus, the Papists attribute righteousness to works because of faith impurely. Why then do you not rightly distinguish and act justly? Justice gives to each his own. Speak in such a way that there is no confusion. Say: Faith justifies us, sacraments testify. Thus Paul: Was Abraham justified before circumcision, or after circumcision, or by circumcision? He answers: Not by circumcision, but before, having received circumcision as a seal, etc. You know the same reasoning applies to the sacraments. Therefore, we are justified before we partake of the Supper. It is added, the Supper is a sign and therefore also a seal of the righteousness of faith, which is in those who partake, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>From where, I ask, will you prove to one denying or doubting what you say: The words bring everything with them? Thus Luther says! You have received this from him and proposed it to your church. But it is certain that words can do nothing but signify and by signifying teach, admonish, etc. No words will ever carry with them what they signify, unless it pleases to attribute something to incantation. This rash statement of yours greatly offends me, but I do not wish to dispute it further.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>You use with others the word "exhibiting," which, unless you add another explanation, you will never prove that signs exhibit what they signify. But the word "exhibiting" is used as an explanation. To what end is it to illustrate explanations with other explanations? Unless you say "exhibits," that is, "renews" or something similar, how will you prove that the sacrament exhibits the thing signified, the body and blood! Therefore, the sacrament is an instrument and organ through which the Lord infuses himself, or the sacraments have what they signify! For I do not exhibit what I do not have; I exhibit what I have! Shall we indeed say that the minister exhibits? See what Augustine says about such doctors in his treatise on John 5.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I do not wish to examine the rest more diligently. From these, you understand my judgment about your six questions, which I wish had not been published. And I urge you to consider how to remedy the error. I send here a booklet by the very learned man Dr. Johannes a Lasco, a Polish baron, once the patron of Dr. Erasmus of Rotterdam, who now teaches in East Frisia and Lower Germany with great fruit and increase of the faithful; not because I rely on human writings, but so that you may see that others more learned than us preserve and defend the purity of doctrine, although some, I do not know by what arts, strive to inculcate a new kind of doctrine to many. Return it after reading, for I offer it only as a loan. The same a Lasco wrote about the incarnation of the Lord, which would be most useful to you against Schwenckfeld, about which Haller will also tell you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>He does not know that I have written anything to you about the sacramental cause. I have kept it to myself alone, and I thought I owed this to you, nor will you think otherwise than that all these things proceed from charity. For I love you sincerely and wish you well, and I have shown this for many years with many arguments.</p>
      <p>To his Gervasius, Bullinger. 20 Feb. 1546.</p>
