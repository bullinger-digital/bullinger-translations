      <p> Greetings. Today I received your letters, honorable lord and godfather, along with two booklets concerning our Steiger and Diesbach. I have not yet offered or sent them to them due to the business that occupies both me and them; however, I will do so conveniently and shortly with your commendation. We have not yet received the remaining copies, but we expect them through a certain rosemary carrier, to whom my brother entrusted them for delivery. I am very sorry that you are not enjoying better health, so that you may continue to benefit the church and all of us with your holy labors for a longer time. Therefore, I do not cease to pray to the Lord for you, that He may preserve your full strength and prolong your days to a long age. I now understand the Paradysiacum matter better and suspect what else may be hidden under this cause; therefore, we must diligently watch and apply spurs to those who seem to care less about this matter. </p>
      <p> I am sending back to you the news written from Antwerp; I also received those which my brother excerpted from yours and sent to me, and I thank you for all of these. I will also thank you and Mr. Simler for your booklets after we have received them. </p>
      <p> Our Aretias is now suffering from the same illness as my wife, along with his own wife. </p>
      <p> I greatly fear for his life; for he is a singularly learned, pious, and peace-loving man. My wife has somewhat recovered by the grace of the Lord, as have her sisters. </p>
      <p> I am writing to my brother about our urban or civic affairs. Soldiers are still being held in prisons here and there, and nothing has yet been finally decided about them. </p>
      <p> The Geneva matter is also still pending. Yesterday, the Savoyard envoy was here; what he actually did, I do not yet know. I therefore break off my letter, as I have nothing else now. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Greet all yours and mine in my name. Bern, March 11, 1574. </p>
      <p> Yours, as you know. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my honorable lord and dearest godfather. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
