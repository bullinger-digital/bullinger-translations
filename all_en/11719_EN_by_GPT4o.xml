    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Blarer's letter [No. 1673]; may God assist His Church! Knows nothing certain about the Swiss soldiers in the service of [Francis I]; at the day in Baden [on October 2], a French delegation [Guillaume Maillard and Jörg Wül] presented a letter in which the King reported on the successful battle against Emperor [Charles V] and the loyal service of the Swiss soldiers, among others, at Perpignan. However, he had heard that attempts were being made to alienate the Swiss from him and that Zurich was siding with the House of Austria; attached were also copies of letters from Nuremberg to the King and to Cardinal [François] de Tournon, reporting that some [Imperial Estates] had written to the Swiss to urge them to aid against the Turks and to recall their mercenaries from the French army, and further stating that Zurich had turned away from France and was favorably inclined towards the House of Austria. Subsequently, Mayor [Johannes] Haab defended Zurich's stance [against the mercenary service] with the city's concern for the Confederation and its obligation to the House of Austria; if the accusations indeed originate from Nuremberg, this allows conclusions about the mood in the Empire; Blarer should be cautious when forwarding this news so that Bullinger does not suffer any harm from it. Just now, news is coming that Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden want to recall their mercenaries from the King; a defeat could bring the misguided people to their senses; may God assist us! Apologizes for the poor handwriting, was in a hurry. Greetings; may God preserve Johannes [Zwick]; Werner Steiner died of the plague on October 6; further greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I give you immense thanks for your letters, written with utmost faith and diligence, from which I easily understand your faith and love towards me. In these, there are some things that have frightened me, and others that have given me great pleasure.</p>
      <p>May the Lord help and deliver His church from all evil, and may He correct the wicked for the salvation of their souls.</p>
      <p>We have nothing certain yet about our Swiss army serving with the French. I do not write the following in German lightly. When my lords of Zurich convened the day in Baden (announced) to all the Confederates on the Monday after Michaelmas, as I reported to you in previous letters, the French delegation appeared and presented a letter from the King of France, which stated that he wanted to let his dear allies know that things were going well against the Emperor; for God would help him well against the Emperor's arrogance, and the Swiss mercenaries were serving him well and faithfully. Now, before Perpignan, he has left some enemies behind, etc. Since he then thoroughly understood that there were some people, the Confederates, who were attempting to turn away from the King, he asked them to remain steadfast with him, etc. With this, he turns the speech from all the Confederates to those of Zurich and writes with the intention: "And I am offended by you of Zurich, that you set yourselves against me with all your might and have dealings with the House of Austria, who, if you would consider it rightly, are no less your enemies than mine. We have done you no harm and have kept the treaties of peace; so it might not be worse with you, if you had not completely renounced me. Therefore, my request to you is that you do not interfere with my fortune, if you do not want to be favorable to me," etc., with many more arrogant words. Besides, two copies are enclosed, one written from Nuremberg to the King, the other also from Nuremberg to Cardinal de Tournon in Lyon; both hold the opinion that the letters from Nuremberg from the Diet report, besides that he informs the King what was negotiated on the day and that another was set, some have written to the Confederates, urging them to send help against the Turks and to recall their mercenaries from the King, etc. But the King should know that such is now (only) the opinion of a few people on the day and not of all the Imperial Estates. Moreover, there is a city among the Confederates, called Zurich, which is unfriendly to the King, but very favorable to the Empire and the House of Austria, through which something could be negotiated, etc. To this, our Lord Mayor Haab has answered very decisively, what Zurich has done, it has done out of Christian duty and love for the Confederation, also that something is obliged with the alliance to the House of Austria, owing good to the Empire, etc. If there is someone in Nuremberg who writes the secrets of the Diet to the French, and not rather that this story is fabricated by our French, I see in what place they are in the Empire, who consult about the safety of the fatherland. If you share this with your friends, see that it cannot be to my detriment.</p>
      <p>Now comes the rumor that Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden want to recall their mercenaries from the King, and have recalled them. In summary: It is a very miserable, misguided people. If they were given a good defeat, I think and trust God, there are still so many pious people at home, then it would be good to act, that one must go to the princes and lords and do justice. Praying to God that He helps us and does not correct us in His wrath, but disciplines us for the instruction and safety of many.</p>
      <p>Forgive the fault of bad handwriting; for I hurried more than you would believe. Farewell with all yours, consult with Blaurer, Zwick, and the others; may the Lord preserve Master Johannes Zwick for us. Werner Steiner died of the plague on October 6; may the Lord be gracious to him. Pellicanus, Bibliander, Gwalther, Megander, Fabritius, and all the others greet you. October 13, 1542.</p>
      <p>H. B. yours.</p>
