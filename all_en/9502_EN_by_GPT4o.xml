      <p>Greetings. What happened with the schismatic Gantner on November 14th and how explicitly he has joined the Anabaptist factions, you can learn from the record written by our consul's own hand, which I wish to send back soon, so that I may attach the last, oh if only, action to my records and finally send a summary to you, which I have not been able to complete due to various business.</p>
      <p>Now judge for yourselves, most esteemed fathers, how much harm that most arrogant man has done to the church and the republic, who tries to remove this holy bond and religious affirmation from our midst. What I have received from Italy in these days, I send to you as is our custom. What you last wrote about Mr. de Monbruno is also confirmed from Milan. Our preachers from the Engadin have been severely accused; but they are defended by their communities as innocent. There is a rumor circulating about some new expedition, and there is a great eagerness for stipends. Horrible things are told about the king and their brother Andio, with mutual clandestine plots. These things hardly deserve belief, yet they are not told as uncertain by many. The Bishop of Como is anxiously working to recover his jurisdiction. Recently, he ordered some monks to consecrate new or young nuns against the decrees of the Rhaetians and to be received into those dens of beasts. The same has begun to be done in Morbegno, where he sent back fugitives to the monastery, relying on that diploma which he received at the last fair, when the Swiss were present. What is happening here at the present fair, I will let you know at another time. Now I ask you to forgive my haste and consider my brevity kindly.</p>
      <p>Mr. Victor, who was here with me while I was writing this, sends his regards to you, as do Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Campell, who is preparing to leave because he cannot hold the properties of the priesthood, and all the others. November 23, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your reverence's most devoted, Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief and most illustrious pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
