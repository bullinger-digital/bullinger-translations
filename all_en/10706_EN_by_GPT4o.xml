      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Recently, Berchtold wrote to me in this letter as follows: "Regarding the situation in Geneva, it has happened as follows: Our lords have always wanted to avoid war; nevertheless, 110 soldiers have been dispatched, almost all from Neuchâtel, Neuenstadt, with a few from Bern. They marched for 10 days through Burgundy and went 3 days without food, arriving not far from the town of Nyon, not far from Geneva. There, they were led by treachery into a thicket and hedge on the mountain. The Savoyards, 2000 strong, fired upon them with some handguns, causing our soldiers to fall to the ground, and the shooters let them pass. And although a cruel barrage of stones followed, our men managed to push through to the hedge, fighting hand to hand, until the Savoyards soon took flight. About 300 of them were killed, some say more, but I prefer to write less. Our men also wanted to flee, but the deed happened in between. Upon this, my lords called them back. They all returned home. Because of this and also beforehand, my lords have demanded from the Duke that he should leave the Genevans in peace or take his alliances from them and give them up, and to respond within 14 days. Today is the deadline. Meanwhile, warnings have come that several thousand Spaniards and several Italians, along with some Valaisans, are coming through Valais to besiege Geneva. But now there are 3 envoys with the Duke, for peace. They hope that more envoys will be sent to them. For the Duke desires peace with them alone, without the shield-bearers. Dated Bern, 27th of October." I did not want to withhold this from you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, 29th of October 1535.</p>
      <p>I await your "Aphorisms". Entrust them to this most excellent man.</p>
      <p>H. B.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, a lord and friend to be especially honored.</p>
