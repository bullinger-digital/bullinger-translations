      <p>God with us, beloved son, I have nothing to write to you now, except that it is true, as I wrote to you from the Netherlands about the battle between Groningen and Damme, and the news is coming so strongly that few of the Spaniards escaped. Consequently, there are fluctuating reports from France; some say the Swiss Confederates are coming home; there are not more than 2000 left, they are dying so heavily; others say more will be sent there, gladly also to die; the loss is not enough. Some also say that Prince Cond√© is besieged, Mouvans and Andelot are taking on soldiers.</p>
      <p>These are fluctuating reports. But it is certain that the admiral has written a supplication to the king and requested that peace be maintained; if not, the king may well consider what will follow, etc., and it is good to pray to God for mercy. In Valais and in Geneva, the plague is raging. Greet Susanna, Elsbeth, your people, godfather, Agatha, young master Hans from Ulm, whose illness I am very sorry about, and young master Hans Peter and our other brothers-in-law. God be with you eternally.</p>
      <p>Dated Monday before St. John the Baptist 1568, as it is now a year since we came from the Gyrenbad.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
