    <p xml:id="regest1">Just a few days ago, Haller could report nothing concrete in a letter [not received] to Rudolf [Gwalther]. Now the [circumstances] are clear, but he must be brief because the messenger [...] is urging.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The behavior of the Emperor [Charles V] at the Regensburg [Diet] can only mean an imminent war. There are to be musters in Füssen, Nördlingen, and also in Donauwörth to prevent the Nurembergers and the Ulmers from accessing Augsburg. Augsburg will likely be the first target of attack. Some [Augsburg] councilors are afraid, the population is uneasy. [Sebastian] Schertlin has recruited 2000 soldiers. Just as many have been raised by other military leaders. 1500 horsemen have entered the territory of the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse], who had previously made raids in the area of Cologne. Elector [John Frederick] of Saxony is armed and wants to join [Philip of Hesse]. Duke Maurice [of Saxony] has assured [Charles V] in Regensburg that he will remain true to the truth [of the Gospel]. Thus, war breaks out all over Germany. There is also talk of an Italian army of the Emperor moving directly against Augsburg. Additionally, [ships] with several thousand Spaniards have landed in the Netherlands. Even [Sultan Suleiman I] is said to be armed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger should, in view of the recently sent [Augsburg] request for help to Zurich, admonish the [Confederates], who also belong to Germany and could soon be affected, not to stand idly by. After all, it is about the truth!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Many are already fleeing the city and transferring their money. But Haller [and his people] remain strong. Thus, the chaff is separated from the wheat!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- If only Haller could send his pregnant wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli, and the little daughter Agnes] to [Zurich] so that he can act better [alone] in the worst case!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger should inform him as soon as possible via Constance about the disposition of the Confederates, for the [Augsburgers] rely on their loyalty.</p>

      <p>Salvation and life through Christ. I wrote to Gwalther, our brother, a few days ago, in which I could not report any of the things that are now at hand, because everything was uncertain. Now, therefore, to you these few things. For the messenger is in a hurry to leave and is waiting for my letters. Forgive me, therefore, because I write in a more turbulent manner.</p>

      <p>Our entire city is in turmoil. The Emperor in Regensburg acts in such a way that we can promise ourselves nothing but the most imminent war. He has announced musters in Füssen, Werdt, and Nördlingen. Many soldiers are gathering there. Everyone thinks Augsburg will be besieged in the first attack. He chose Werdt to prevent the Ulmers and Nurembergers from passing to Augsburg. Our magistrate is partly faint-hearted, but we encourage them as much as we can. The populace is agitated. Soldiers are also being gathered here. Schertlin is gathering 2000, and other leaders likewise. Around Cologne, 1500 horsemen have long been making raids and have now invaded the territory of the Landgrave. The Elector of Saxony is armed, intending to join the Landgrave. Duke Maurice told the Emperor in Regensburg openly that he would not abandon the truth as long as he lives. Thus, war is igniting everywhere in Germany. They say a large army is being prepared in Italy, which the Emperor will lead directly against our city. Several thousand Spaniards have also landed in Lower Germany. Some even say the Turk is armed. A messenger was sent to you this week to implore your help.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Therefore, I beseech you, strongly urge your people not to sit idly by and watch the destruction of Germany, of which they are also a part. You know what to expect if Germany is subdued. Moreover, the fight here is for the truth, not for any earthly possessions.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We will be strong in the Lord, although many are already fleeing from our city and leaving their money behind. I hope, however, that the Lord will deliver us all the more, the more these chaff are separated from the wheat. I am therefore ready to die for my Lord Jesus Christ whenever He wills, and I thank Him for revealing Himself to me. I consider this my greatest treasure. You pray for us with all your people to the Lord.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>If only I could send my family to you, if the troubles grow worse, so that I could act more strongly! For their sight greatly moves me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>But my wife is already close to giving birth; thus it pleased God. I ask you to write back as soon as you can, at least by sending letters to Constance, so that I may know what the Swiss have in mind. For our city greatly relies on their loyalty.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Augsburg, June 17, 1546. Yours entirely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed lord and father. In Zurich. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
