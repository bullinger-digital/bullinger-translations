      <p>Greetings. I did not know whether I would have a courier available due to our fairs, during which there is a great scarcity of couriers, and therefore I did not want to write to Mr. Collin, whose letters, however, were delivered to me; for there was a risk that I might write in vain. I also bought Rhaetian wine for Doctor Gesner, but I could not write because on Monday evening I was not sure about the messenger and I had many other letters to write concerning this bishop's business. The Rhaetian churches also trouble us, and the Jesuits are returning.</p>
      <p>Therefore, excuse me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>The business against the bishop has proceeded quite successfully so far; but we await the outcome. The outcome proves the deeds; I wish that anyone who thinks deeds should be judged by the outcome may lack success.</p>
      <p>Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and patron.</p>
