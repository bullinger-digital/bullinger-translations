      <p>Greetings and blessings. I received your letters, dear brother, and I am always grateful for your diligence.</p>
      <p>Regarding the army being gathered in Germany, we hear nothing, nor do I think the Bernese will easily come to arms with the Savoyard; for things are so arranged that they seem likely to agree shortly.</p>
      <p>But in the meantime, I recognize that the plans of the world are remarkable; therefore, may the Lord protect us. Now I have nothing to send, except what is enclosed; return it and be careful not to spread it rashly, indeed do not hand it over to anyone from your hands. Always pray to the Lord for me and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 14th of July, in the year 1564.</p>
      <p>Yours always.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, most faithful minister of the church of Chur, my most esteemed and dear godfather and brother. Chur.</p>
