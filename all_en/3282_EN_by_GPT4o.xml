      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The illness, partly from grief and partly from that contagion which has invaded almost every person in these regions this month, has afflicted me so much that I have been forced to delay my response to the last letters I received from you until this day. Even now, contrary to my usual practice, I will write you a common letter, not because it is burdensome for me to write to you individually, or because, if there were any burden, I would not willingly undertake it. But partly because I am not yet so recovered as to endure the labor of prolonged writing, and partly because I am persuaded that you will not be displeased if, while attending to my health, I satisfy two letters of the same subject with a single response. I will indeed try to do this in as few words as possible.</p>
      <p>So, most revered fathers in the Lord, consider this about me. Whatever rumor may have been spread about me by those who have misinterpreted my and Mr. Farell's confession, I could never persuade myself that you would doubt my faith. If, however, this is the case, I hope that what I have copied from our recently published annotations on the New Testament will satisfy you, so that I may spare you the labor of consulting the original. Matthew 26:26. "Is," εστι, metonymically, yet so that we know that along with the sign, believers truly receive in a spiritual manner that which is represented by the external symbol, namely, the whole Christ with his gifts. Neither transubstantiation nor what they call local conjunction, transfusion, or commixture is to be thought of, but a symbolic and sacramental conjunction of the sign and the thing: since these cannot coexist with the truth of Christ's humanity nor are they necessary for salvation. For to become partakers of Christ, we do not need to bring him down from heaven, but rather to ascend to heaven by the power of the Holy Spirit and faith and embrace him there, so that we may sit with him in the heavenly places. In sum, it is necessary for us to be truly united and made one with the whole Christ, God and man, to be saved: which happens in no other way than spiritually, through faith, which is indeed created and confirmed in us by the Holy Spirit, and that through the preaching of the word of God, and the symbols added to the preaching by which all our senses are aroused and moved, so that we are truly brought into possession of Christ himself.</p>
      <p>In the same place, verse 28, in these words: "this is my blood." The Vulgate and Erasmus: "this is my blood," referring the pronoun τουτο to αιμα, that is, blood.</p>
      <p>But it is clear from Luke 22:5, 20 that it must be referred to ποτηριον, that is, the cup, metonymically, however, so that the container is taken for the content, by the common and well-known usage of all languages. But some will cry out (I know well) that my audacity is sacrilegious.</p>
      <p>But let them cry out and even clamor, if they please: Luke speaks in such a way that it cannot be doubted that Christ indicated the cup when he said these things, so that they are compelled, whether they wish it or not, to recognize a trope in the demonstrative pronoun. Likewise, Luke 22:20 in these words: "this cup." There is a double metonymy in this place, which even those who do not cease to press the literal expression in this formula are compelled to recognize, so that they may defend what they have once undertaken to uphold by all means. For first, the container (as grammarians speak) is put for the content, namely, the cup for the wine contained in the cup. Then the wine is said to be the covenant itself, when it is only the symbol or token of the covenant, or rather of that by which the covenant is ratified, namely, the blood of the Lord: a true and not at all empty symbol, but still to be distinguished from what it represents. Therefore, there is no need to draw Christ from heaven, or to mingle with the immense and invisible body of Christ, to preserve the proper meaning of the word "is." This metonymy is not only frequent in sacred writings, as has been so often inculcated by the most learned men, but is also used by Homer himself. For thus he, when mentioning the covenant between the Greeks and Trojans ratified with many ceremonies in the third book of the Iliad:</p>
      <p>The heralds went through the city bringing faithful oaths, and they sent lambs and honey-sweet wine.</p>
      <p>In which verses everyone sees (for let us be allowed to compare profane with sacred to this extent) that lambs and wine, which were only symbols of the covenant, are given the very name of the covenant: in a manner of speaking entirely similar to that used by Luke here when he called the cup the New Testament. Likewise, Acts 1:17 in these words: "so he will come." In three ancient manuscripts it was written ουτος by epanalepsis, which indeed has great emphasis and cuts off all occasion for caviling for those who, to defend the bodily presence of their Jupiter Elicius against this open testimony of the angels, cling to that particle ουτως. For they say he descends daily, indeed every moment, but otherwise than he ascended, invisibly, and without bounds.</p>
      <p>Certainly an excellent quibble! But let us rather ascend to heaven by faith, so that we may truly embrace Christ there, than to bring him down from heaven before that great day and remain in earthly elements. Likewise, Acts 3:21 in these words: "to be taken up into heaven," that is, to be contained.</p>
      <p>For, as we have said elsewhere, among the Hebrews, often the consequence is understood with one word placed, as when εχελθειν is put for "to come," and many similar things which we have noted in their places. But the reason we have used the passive rather than the active form of expression is to avoid all ambiguity. For it is worthwhile for this clear testimony to stand in the church of God against those who, instead of ascending to heaven by faith to be joined to our head, think that Christ must be called down from heaven again like some Jupiter Elicius, and even stubbornly maintain that he must be summoned by us. Likewise, Ephesians 4:10 in these words: "that he might fill all things," that is, that he might fill with his gifts and benefits. For thus the word is taken in this construction, as in Isaiah 23:2 and Jeremiah 31:25, etc. Therefore, the word "fill" in this place is not taken to mean "to perfect," except consequently, insofar as we are perfected by the gifts of Christ: nor does the question properly pertain to this place, how Christ is everywhere, but rather how he fills us with his gifts, namely, through his Spirit. But those who impudently and impiously try to attribute to Christ a human body απεριγραπτον, that is, a body not a body, from this place, and to overthrow our hope from its foundations, must be utterly rejected. For not only if he were not, but also if Christ is not a true and natural man, we hope in vain for what we hope: and he who thinks that we cannot become partakers of Christ's body without drawing him from heaven or stripping his body of its natural qualities, is ignorant of the power of the Holy Spirit. Likewise, Ephesians 5:30. In these words: "of his flesh," he alludes to the creation of the woman. But they err greatly and dangerously who refer this union of ours with Christ to his incarnation, since in this way it is shared with unbelievers, which the apostle attributes only to believers. For not every woman is flesh of any man's flesh, but only of her husband's, or conversely, any man is not flesh of any woman's flesh, but only of his own wife, as is entirely apparent from the apostle's purpose.</p>
      <p>Thus, in Christ alone as the husband and in men alone as the wife, this union is to be regarded, namely, which is not only a union of nature (for I do not exclude this, without which the other cannot be constituted) but also a communion of the very substance: without transfusion or any natural and gross imagination, but by the bond of the Holy Spirit through faith. The seal and symbol of this communion is the Lord's Supper, which we call, so that Christ may truly be flesh of our flesh and bone of our bones, and we in turn his members unto eternal life.</p>
      <p>In the same place, verse 32, in these words: "this is a great mystery," that is, a secret. For what is more remote from the common sense of men than that we miserable creatures crawling on the earth should be made one with Christ, the Son of God, the Lord of earth and heaven, sitting at the right hand of the Father, in such a spiritual marriage that we draw from him all righteousness and therefore eternal life? It is remarkable, however, that while Paul so openly says that this union is a mystery, many still contend to prove that it is not a mystery. For I do not see what else they are attempting, who do not want to recognize a trope in Christ's words, and therefore (to introduce a carnal and natural mode of union that conflicts with the truth of Christ's body and this passage of Paul) they fall into this, that they attribute to Christ an immense, infinite, invisible body even before glorification, and finally draw him from heaven, contrary to the manifest word of God, to attach him either to the substance of bread and wine, or, as others prefer, to the mere appearances, unless they prefer to say that Christ's body is everywhere, rather than to concede a change of place.</p>
      <p>To what end is this? Namely, because otherwise they think that substantial communication is excluded, otherwise the signs are left bare, otherwise the authority of the word of God is thought to be at stake, and in the meantime they do not see that they are undermining the foundations of our faith to measure the mystery of God by the grasp of nature. As if he who, not yet made flesh, once truly communicated the same spiritual food, that is, his flesh and blood (outside of which there never was or will be any hope of eternal life) with his church by faith, cannot today, being a true man dwelling above all heavens as far as the flesh is concerned, truly unite himself with us by faith, so that there is no need to resort to those empty and mutually conflicting inventions. Indeed, there is no other organ of our union with Christ in this world than faith, and in the other world the very sight of God. These, as I hope, will satisfy even the most difficult, let alone you, most revered fathers, unless perhaps some think that I have suddenly changed my mind and gone over to the side of others, which may it never come to my mind. But if even these are not sufficient, let it be indicated to me what more is required of me. I will come in person and not unwillingly beg for forgiveness for my fault.</p>
      <p>For I would rather die a thousand times than have given even the slightest occasion for offense to the church of God, and I would rather allow myself to be torn from my own bowels than to be separated from the holy consensus of our churches.</p>
      <p>As for the confession itself, consider this.</p>
      <p>We presented two.</p>
      <p>One privately to Diller, but not to the Palatine prince, and it was not signed by us, of which you conveniently sent me a copy, as I had none. The other to the prince of Württemberg himself, which you recently read when it was brought to you.</p>
      <p>We had two entirely necessary reasons for this action, as it seemed to us. One, because those with whom we were dealing did not conceal that it would be difficult to obtain anything for our Waldensians unless we testified what their opinion was on the Lord's Supper.</p>
      <p>We responded, as is the case, that they do not think otherwise than the consensus of our churches would allow. Here they brought forth a passage from their German confession which spoke too sparingly of such a great mystery. Hence, we came to some, but still friendly and peaceful, conversation, which led us to the second reason for writing a confession. For when we found them, although not agreeing with us, yet wonderfully placid and inclined to concord, and when we sensed the prince's own will inclined towards the peace and tranquility of the churches, not only from his whole demeanor and gesture but also from his kind and humane speech, we thought we would betray the church if we did not eagerly seize this opportunity divinely offered. Therefore, as we can truly testify to you, after giving thanks to the Lord and invoking his name, we described what we believe in the way that seemed most suitable to us for what we had proposed.</p>
      <p>But the Lord is our witness that we diligently, to the best of our ability, first took care not to add even a syllable that might seem to deviate from our consensus, that is, from the truth. Then, to explain as clearly and simply as possible that about which, if once settled, the rest seemed likely to follow, namely, how the matter of the sacrament, that is, Christ with his gifts, is joined with the symbols, and also how it is communicated with us. If we could not achieve this, we think it fair that our inexperience, which we will certainly not be unwilling to acknowledge if pointed out to us, should be granted pardon, and we will not be ashamed to testify in writing before the church of God, so that every occasion for offense may be removed. Furthermore, in the Württemberg confession, I admit we prefixed "in the Helvetic and Savoyard churches it is taught thus," because we were so persuaded, nor have we learned anything different from the books of all our people so far. However, these seemed to have no weight: whether you consider the Waldensian matter or the hoped-for concord, if we had presented it as our private doctrine and opinion. But it never came to our mind to present this as written in the name of the Helvetic or Savoyard churches or to bring any prejudice to anyone.</p>
      <p>For who would be so audacious and impudent? But at least it should have been communicated to you. Indeed, although we otherwise explained the whole matter to you, as far as the conversation held between us and the hoped-for peace is concerned. But as for the earlier confession, I testify to you before the Lord that we had no copy of it. I did have the original of the other, which I still keep, but it was so blotted with corrections that I had to rely on guesswork while copying it.</p>
      <p>But this, I admit, does not provide us with a suitable excuse. I acknowledge that a grave error was committed here, not only with you but also with Bern and Geneva, and that by me especially, who had all our papers folded. But here I ask you, and I beseech you by Christ, most revered fathers, not to attribute this action to fraud or malice, which entirely arose from negligence and forgetfulness, admittedly not very credible, but nevertheless most true, so much so that I did not remember to copy the confession and communicate it with Mr. Calvin until he, having received letters from Strasbourg, asked me by letter what this matter was. But enough of these things.</p>
      <p>Now I come to those matters about which you and Mr. Martyr wrote to our Mr. Calvin, with which your frankness not only did not offend me, but also delighted me so much that I confess I owe you much for this as well. Nor do I respond to these for any other reason than to explain my opinion to you more fully, being so disposed in mind that I would much more willingly embrace your opinion than my own. You wished that mention had been made of apprehension by faith, notwithstanding the distance of places. But we seem to have mentioned faith twice at the very beginning, where we explain the chief end of the whole sacramental matter, as a necessary instrument. For we did not simply write that Christ has been made wisdom for us, etc., but we added: to believers. Then in the Württemberg confession, it is expressly added that it is required that through faith, which is the gift of God, we become bone of his bones, etc. We did not indeed express the distance of places, but since we exclude every physical mode of presence, we thought it sufficiently defined. Moreover, what we said in the earlier confession, that the human nature of Christ has not ceased to be finite, you see well enough what necessarily follows, and we hope you will consider our brevity, which we hoped would be more fully explained in a future colloquy, favorably, if you consider the circumstances of time and place more attentively. Secondly, you wonder that we wrote: the symbols always have the thing itself joined. What this means, we do not understand at all.</p>
      <p>For we did not simply write so, but we added, "as far as God, who promises and offers, is concerned," which doctrine we think is entirely in agreement with the consensus and the truth itself. Thus you see that we overturn by consequence that dogma about the communication of unbelievers. For why else would that restriction have been added?</p>
      <p>As for the sacramental signification, may it never be that we think otherwise than you write. For we do not simply deny that it is symbolic or figurative, but we add the adverb "only," namely, to express a certain peculiar force of sacramental signification, which by virtue of divine constitution and promise makes what is figured, although if you consider the distance of places it is far away, yet, whether we believe or not (for here it is not a question of the perception of the thing but of the conjunction of the thing and the symbol) it is no less present than what is seen with the eyes and touched with the hands. You complain that the word "represent" is ambiguous, which we confess we used deliberately, because you know that the simple word "signify" or "figure" never satisfied them, indeed it gave occasion for this controversy, which was also the reason why our people do not refrain from the word "exhibit," which is no less ambiguous in itself, to show that the truth is joined to the signs, since to exhibit means, according to Ulpian, to bring forth and give the faculty of seeing and touching. But all this ambiguity is removed by the addition of the word "symbol," as it seems to us, especially since we have expressly explained this when we say: "with the symbols themselves added to the thing," etc., and a little later we say: the presence is indeed defended by us, but the mode is still disputed, which we say is perceived by us not by understanding but by faith. For who understands how it can be that Christ, whose body is in heaven, truly offers it to us on earth, who ascend to him by faith, to be enjoyed? Finally, you do not like that we say: the mode of presence is only disputed, which is known only to God. For you say, it seems to me that this mode is the apprehension of living faith.</p>
      <p>But in this article, we are not dealing with the instrument by which the matter of the sacrament is communicated with us, but with the mode by which the matter is joined with the sign, which we say is inscrutable, since it is in heaven, and this on earth, and yet, whether we believe or not, whether we take only the sign or also the matter itself with the sign by faith, the truth of this conjunction stands. For I confess that I have always been very pleased with this method for explaining this controversy, that in the first place it is explained what the matter of the sacrament is, for what end and by what instrument it is offered to be perceived.</p>
      <p>Then that these three modes are explained separately. One by which the matter is joined with the sign, or is present.</p>
      <p>The second by which we perceive the sign.</p>
      <p>The third by which the matter of the sacrament is communicated with us.</p>
      <p>We have said that the first mode is known only to God, who has so constituted it, but is to be believed by us, yet so that we can say what it is not, but not what it is, as we explained in the fourth response. We testify that the second is natural.</p>
      <p>But the third we also say relies on the incomprehensible power of the omnipotent Spirit of God.</p>
      <p>For who will explain how it can be that we, dwelling on earth, become one with Christ, who is in heaven, so that we draw eternal life from him? For although it is known to us, as we said at the very beginning, that we are united with Christ by faith, it is not thereby accomplished that the mode and manner of the efficacy of this faith can be comprehended by us: which if true, those who hallucinate are surely those who, to subject that mode to our senses, or to define it by local conjunction, or transfusion of substance, or the immensity of the glorious body, or transubstantiation, or whatever else they devise to define that mode. For we can say what it is not, we will understand what kind it is only when what we are will appear. These are the things, Mr. Martyr, which in your letters to Mr. Calvin, as far as I could conjecture, you indicated you desired in this our confession. If there is anything else observed by anyone, we will also endeavor to satisfy them. Valerandus noted some other things in the lines below, but what they are we have not yet been able to conjecture sufficiently. We suspect, however, that he does not like that we say the matter of the sacrament is not only the merits and fruits of the Lord's death, that is, the benefits we draw from it, but also the very substance of the Lord.</p>
      <p>If this is so, as we suspect, we are truly surprised that he subscribed to the booklet which Mr. a Lasco published last December entitled: The Purging of the Ministers in the Foreign Churches at Frankfurt. For there it is written on page 24: "To the first, finally, we acknowledge and have always acknowledged according to this doctrine of the chapters: that in the Lord's Supper, together with the bread and wine, that is, while we partake of the bread and wine, the body and blood of Christ are truly exhibited, to be perceived by faith for our nourishment unto eternal life."</p>
      <p>We have always acknowledged and also now acknowledge this about the presence, exhibition, and participation of the body and blood of Christ in his Supper." Similar things are also written there on page 32, but especially on page 48, where he does not hesitate to use the adverb: substantially, from which, however, as ambiguous, we wanted to abstain. He uses these words: "We acknowledge and have always acknowledged that Christ the Lord is truly and substantially present at his Supper with his body also, provided that the use of the Supper is not bound to the earth or its elements alone: and that the true food of his body and blood is truly exhibited to us to be perceived by faith with the bread and wine for spiritual nourishment unto eternal life. But to what end are these things? For we think that if this is his opinion, he needs your reproof more than we need any defense with you in this matter. And indeed, to speak frankly what we feel, although we despise no one, yet Valerandus' judgment, who has so far conducted himself in such a way as to have labored strenuously in disturbing the churches, does not move us much, much less even the complaints of Bocquini or Balduini, who are now in Heidelberg, who, if there were any discipline in the churches of God, would have either changed their ways long ago or would be better known to all.</p>
      <p>But your judgment, most revered fathers, has affected us in such a way that although many very sad things have been announced to us this month, we have received no news as unpleasant or unexpected. In sum, we acknowledge and beg pardon for our greatest sin in not communicating the confession with you upon our return. We desire our plan, conscience, and opinion to be more fully understood and considered by you. If there is anything else in these matters about which you think we should be advised, indeed even reproved and rebuked, and especially me, the lowest in age and prudence of all, I testify to you, most revered fathers, from the heart, that you will find us not only ready to acknowledge and even testify to our error but also grateful and mindful of the benefit. For what I said before, I am not ashamed to repeat now, that we are prepared to die a thousand times rather than knowingly give even the slightest offense to the church of God, and rather to allow ourselves to be torn from our own bowels than to be separated from the mutual consensus of our churches, that is, from the truth of God. What remains, most revered fathers, I ask you and indeed your whole church, to consider this writing, whatever it may be, favorably and to expect from me everything that can proceed from a son most devoted to you. May the Lord Jesus confirm you again and again and bless your holy labors. Lausanne, August 24, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Theodor Beza.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servants of Christ, fathers most revered by me in the Lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and Mr. Peter Martyr.</p>
