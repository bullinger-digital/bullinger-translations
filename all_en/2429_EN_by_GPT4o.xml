      <p>Greetings. Today I received your letter, dearest compater, and I do not have much to respond to it. I am saddened by your illness; may the Lord restore and preserve you! As for the people of Locarno, I also do not know what our people are doing now. Very few senators are in the city because of the grape harvest. The people of Geneva have sent one of their ministers here to complain to the senate that Calvin's name is being slandered as heretical by some ministers of our dominion, and this is intolerable to them. But this matter has been postponed until St. Martin's Day; then both the accusers and the accused will be present. I greatly fear serious disturbances; but by invoking the Lord's name, we will strive to calm them as best as possible. If you have any advice, please suggest it in the meantime.</p>
      <p>I wish to know from you what Sultzer has done with you, especially what he discussed with you and what you think of him. He went to Strasbourg to settle the controversy that, as you know, is currently there. Regarding the English turmoil, as you promise, please inform us once you know more. We have nothing. All of ours send their greetings to you in return. I have delivered your letters to Tremp. Nicolaus von Diesbach also sends his greetings to you and is sending this to you as well. Farewell. October 13, 1554. Bern.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and compater, to be piously honored.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
