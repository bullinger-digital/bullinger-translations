      <p>Greetings. I am returning everything you sent through this boy, except for those items that pertained to Geneva; the senate is sending those there immediately. I have given everything to Steiger; he reported to the senate. Everyone expresses immense gratitude to you. A severe storm threatens these churches; therefore, we must pray to the Lord to avert it and turn it upon those who do not know His name, and I hope the Lord will do what He has done elsewhere, so that His name may be glorified and the truth may prevail. Otherwise, we have no news. Steiger and Diesbach send you their careful greetings, from whom I have just come. Steiger himself would have written, but due to business, he could not; he wishes, therefore, that my words be as if he himself had written them to you. As for my family, the Lord has taken from me, after two daughters, also two sons, Wolfgang and Berthold, the former of whom was seventeen, the latter eleven years old; the former had spent three years in Lausanne and had returned here with Rodolph, his brother's son; but it pleased the Lord to call both of them. All three were of excellent promise, but they belonged to the Lord; He had the right to do what He did. He gave them, He took them away; blessed be the name of the Lord! May He further protect us with the remaining ones to the praise of His name! Farewell. Mother and wife also send their greetings to you. My father-in-law has set out with the Mühlin and Gravenried to Königsfelden and Waldshut, where some disputes, I believe concerning certain boundaries, are to be settled. Bern, November 20, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
