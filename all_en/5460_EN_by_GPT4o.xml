      <p>Greetings. Regarding those matters that pertain to the council, reverend and most esteemed lord, since you have written to me diligently, it is fitting that I, in turn, inform you of what is being discussed here on the same matter. During the Pentecost holidays, a certain advisor of the most illustrious prince reported that it had been agreed among the princes that the delegates, who were in Erfurt the previous year, should again be sent to Nuremberg or Frankfurt am Main to deliberate on issuing a protest against the council. However, Ludwig Gremp, a jurist from Strasbourg, has since written a book in which everything relevant to this matter is explained learnedly and extensively. He sent it to several princes, including ours (whether in his own name or on behalf of the Republic of Strasbourg, I do not know) for reading. I hear that all who have read it approve of it greatly, and I hope it will also come into my hands.</p>
