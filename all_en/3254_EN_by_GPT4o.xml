      <p>Greetings. I have received everything you sent, and I will make an effort to also dispatch the remaining items as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>If it is possible, given the things that must be completed first, I will print the third oration separately. I have delayed the title with the preface of the Apocalypse until now, waiting for Froschauer to inform me of the typeface he would like the preface to be printed in; for that is what he initially ordered. Otherwise, I would have preferred to start with the title and preface from the beginning, as it often happens that something is either left over or missing when the work is completed, with some of the earlier pages still needing to be printed last. However, since I see that he is delaying, I will ensure that the preface is done in the typeface in which I printed your orations; for I do not think it will exceed three sheets even so. I took care of your letters to Naogeorgus only 8 days ago; I received them yesterday with mine from our Junius, and I will keep them for his arrival; for yesterday he accompanied some Englishmen to Aarau, so that he might assist them in obtaining more convenient lodging, and he is expected to return tomorrow (as we hope). I still have the letters to Gilbert Cognatus, as more expensive couriers to Burgundy are offered, and I do not think they should be entrusted to just anyone.</p>
      <p>The annotations being printed on Samuel, Judges, Ruth, and the Books of Kings are by Borrhaus, to whom I will convey your judgment based only on the sample seen, to make him more eager for the rest; for he is very pleased when he understands that his works are not displeasing to good and learned men. Lycosthenes (who is now entirely absorbed in his prodigies), Celius (who is quite disturbed due to the tragedy stirred by Vergerius), Wyssenburgius, and Baleus send you many greetings. Also, Fox, another Englishman, a good and especially learned man, has asked me to prepare some way for him to enter into friendship with you. He has translated a long and equally learned and pious disputation on the whole matter of the Eucharist by Thomas Cranmer, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, against the Bishop of Winchester, from English into Latin, of which I send you a sample here, and he would very much like, since it is less possible here due to some who are still too much inclined towards Luther (for he was denied once and when he asked again), that it might at least be possible with you, so that he may complete it and publish it. I will not hesitate to take care of it at my own expense, at least to find someone who would be willing to undertake the work of printing it for us, and I wish it were possible for the Bernese printer Apiarius due to his health; I would hope to obtain it there without much trouble. However, our people fear where there was no need to fear, and Vergerius's new religion [Greek] (not to say anything harsher) has instilled more than enough fear even in those who were already quite timid, in a cause that is not bad, but only less favorable among those who are outside. However, whatever seems best to you in this matter, please let us know your opinion in your next letter at your leisure, and whether it is possible to obtain a place to print that book with you. I will gladly bear the entire cost; I am so wholeheartedly in favor of this cause, or I will share in the costs or even provide the paper, if necessary, as much as will be needed. Farewell, my most excellent and learned Mr. Bullinger, and forgive me for daring to jest with you too familiarly, beyond both your dignity and the nature of our affairs, on several occasions now. For there will be more leisure for you to read our trifles, if the Lord wills. Farewell again, and greet our Bibliander, Lelio, Bernardino, Peter Martyr, Gualther, Gesner, Frisius, and all your sons-in-law on occasion, with my regards.</p>
      <p>Basel, the day before the calends of August.</p>
      <p>Johannes Oporinus, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, I was not able to reread.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>Marcus Dobler.</p>
