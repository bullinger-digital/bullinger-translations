      <p>Greetings. I did not absolutely, as they say, claim to be unaware of what to write to Caelius; for I knew that I had not said the book published by him was impious and heretical. However, when he pressed me in his letters, asking whether I had said or not said that his book was heretical and impious, I wrote that I did not know what to say. For I was surprised that you had said something I had not. Now, I easily recognize, as you say in your letter, that I did not approve of his book for the reasons I explained in the letter written to him. Therefore, if you said in Basel that I did not approve of his book, there is nothing to accuse. But if, as he complains, it was said that I disapproved of the book as heretical and impious, I do not know that I ever used such words. You know, my dear Vergerius, that I advised against starting any dispute with Caelius when I spoke with you privately, and I wish you had heeded my advice. Now he, if what I hear is true, is preparing an apology, while there is already more dispute among brothers than is fitting and edifying. You are grieved that there are those who do not wish to bark at the wolf with you. But I, my dear Vergerius, think that one should act with reason and moderation in such cases, and distinguish between types of doctrines or articles, and not immediately label those who disagree with us on certain points as wolves, heretics, and impious. We should deal with those who err in such a way that they may return to the path, or at least attempt amicably to see what you can achieve. But if they persist with a stubborn and obstinate mind, then again act moderately, so that, as much as possible, everything serves edification, etc. Hatred and envy should be far removed from such dealings, etc.</p>
      <p>Since I understand your intentions, I will be less troublesome to you in recommendations henceforth; forgive me for this. As for my son, Mr. Burcher, the Englishman, gave him two florins, which my son gave to the typesetter; then Mr. Peter Dasypodius gave 5 florins, both of which I repaid. Thus, you gave nothing to my son, except what he exposed to his own inconvenience for your sake; I erred in asking for only 5 florins, and those I have named testify to the matter as it stands.</p>
      <p>I hear, my dear Vergerius, that you are about to depart for Poland; go, may the Lord bless your journey and keep you, so that you do not become an instrument for the Lutherans in the matter of the Supper, through which they attempt to attack and expel the known truth along with Mr. a Lasco. You know our doctrine of the Supper is sincere, the Lutherans' insincere. But truth will ultimately prevail, however long it is suppressed.</p>
      <p>Your days are shorter than you think; therefore, live and always act with joyful memory. Farewell, excellent Vergerius, and continue to love me. The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 9, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
