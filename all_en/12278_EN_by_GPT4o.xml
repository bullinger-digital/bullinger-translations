    <p xml:id="regest1">Thom Camph writes with a heavy heart, as his friend, Enno [Cirksena], who was intended to be the future [Governor of Emden] and had visited [Zurich] together with the Freiburg professor [Joachim] Mynsinger, has died in Paris. Now, thom Camph has been commissioned by Enno's mother [Gebbeke, née Verdeyne] and grandmother [Teelke, née...] to travel to Paris to learn more about the circumstances of the death and to bring the deceased's belongings home. - Samuel [Pellikan] will report on the journey [to Emden] and the situation there. Here, thom Camph merely wants to express how pleased he is that the church [of East Frisia] is in agreement with [Zurich] in doctrine, which is mainly due to [Johannes] a Lasco. Just one example: They thanked Calvin for his catechism [Strasbourg 1545] dedicated to the [East Frisian] church, but at the same time made it clear to him that the opinion expressed in the [first] edition [of 1538] about the [Lord's Supper] was more pleasing and understandable for the simple-minded. The suspicious eloquence of a Bucer is not needed here. Bucer, who wanted to win a Lasco over to his opinion, only achieved that a Lasco contradicted him. And who would agree with Bucer, when no one understands him, not even he himself? With his tendency to oppose the efforts of others, he has even brought the Cologne [Arch]bishop [Hermann von Wied] and the [Elector Frederick II] of the Palatinate closer to the [Protestant Confederates]. Both princes have promised to invite them to a discussion [about the Lord's Supper]. If it comes to that, they should not decline. - [Philip of Hesse], whom a Lasco also visited, is a staunch supporter of Bucer. He regrets that the [Zurichers] attacked Luther so sharply in their "True Confession." In fact, the [East Frisians] also regret this harshness, especially since it endangers the Gospel and more Christian moderation would have been more appropriate. Thom Camph could not conceal this out of affection for the [Zurichers]. If Luther responds, the [Zurichers] should be even more restrained out of consideration for the weak. - A Lasco and Countess [Anna of Oldenburg] want thom Camph to become an advisor in religious matters. Although he does not feel qualified for this, it is argued that there is no more suitable man. Bullinger should support him with his advice! - Greetings to the "praeceptor" [Theodor] Bibliander, to [Rudolf] Gwalther, and to the others. Due to lack of time, he could not write to them. However, Bullinger may let them read this letter, provided there is no danger that others will learn of the [reservations] expressed in it. Greetings also to the wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler].</p>

      <p>What compels me to write to you, most excellent man, is your kindness and my love for you. However, the reason I write with no diligence is the overwhelming pain of my heart, as well as the journey I am forced to undertake, which does not allow it. My greatest friend has passed away, a truly noble young man who was to become a protector of his homeland and the church, Enno Cirksena, who had visited you with Dr. Mynsinger, the Freiburg lecturer. He died in Paris, after having been there for only a month, to the great sorrow of all good people among us, especially his mother Gebbeke, née Verdeyne, and grandmother Teelke, née..., who had him as their only son. Therefore, I am setting out for Paris to report the facts and bring back what he left behind. For I could not deny this to my greatest friend nor to his parents. Therefore, most humane man, I ask you to consider this kindly.</p>
      <p>Regarding the journey and the state of the homeland, I have nothing much to write that my friend Samuel Pellikan cannot explain in detail. I only wish to mention that I rejoice that our church, however it may be, is in complete agreement with yours in doctrine; in which matter Lord Johannes a Lasco has put and continues to put considerable effort. To give you some indication of this: John Calvin sent us, or dedicated to our churches, his brief catechism.</p>
      <p>Our people received it with gratitude. They wish to respond and thank him, and in the meantime, to remind him that they preferred his earlier opinion on the sacrament to this one, and to ask him to write in such a way that it can be understood by the simpler minds. This is also desired by a Lasco and the ministers in the region.</p>
      <p>Bucer's variety and cunning nature are suspect to our people; and when he thought he could also bring Lord a Lasco over to his opinion, he achieved that he has someone who most strongly contradicts him. And who would agree with Bucer, when he is not understood, indeed, he thinks that he himself does not understand himself? And when he understands the efforts of others, he wishes to counteract them as much as he can, and he has achieved that the Archbishop of Cologne, Hermann von Wied, is entirely of your opinion, and the Elector Frederick II of the Palatinate also thinks better of you than of others. They have promised to ensure that you will also be invited to the discussion. If you are called, it pleases everyone; and we ask that you do not resist and do not abandon the truth!</p>
      <p>Landgrave Philip of Hesse (whom our a Lasco also visited) is plainly a supporter of Bucer and criticizes your confession for having written too harshly against Luther.</p>
      <p>And to write in the meantime the judgments of our people about your book: They are indeed very pleased with it; but they would like you to defend the truth with the simplest words, that is, with great Christian modesty. In which, since you have sometimes slipped in the first part of the book, it has happened that it cannot please as much as the rest of the book. For they fear not for Luther, but for the Gospel, which might be called into question because of this. Since the Lord first restored this through him, and in this Luther has shown himself to be a faithful minister, they think the gifts of God in him should be acknowledged and praised, and his faults and lapses in this matter should be pointed out rather than exaggerated with harsh words. This (since I love you uniquely) I could not keep silent about with you, so that if Luther responds, in your reply (so to speak) you may apply the utmost modesty with the greatest defense of the truth and consider the minds of the weak in this matter. For in this controversy, which in my opinion is not the head of religion, it must be avoided that, when you bite each other, you also consume each other.</p>
      <p>I do not wish to teach you these things, but to satisfy my love for you, which is concerned for friends.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write about myself, but I need your advice and prayer. For I am called by Lord a Lasco and the Countess Anna of Oldenburg to such a position, for which I judge myself to be in no way equal or worthy. They would like me to be a permanent teacher and advisor to the prince in religious matters at our court. I do not dare to undertake this position because of my weakness, which I confess to be very great in every respect. Again, when they object that they cannot have anyone more suitable, I cannot entirely refuse, especially when they say they will be content with my modesty; provided I do what I can. Therefore, lacking advice, I am at a standstill. So, please assist me as soon as possible with your advice and unceasing prayers, so that the Lord may complete what he has begun in me out of mere goodness, out of the abundance of his goodness, to the praise of the glory of his grace, for the edification of the church and my salvation. I, in turn, will not fail to pray for you through Jesus Christ. More on other matters later.</p>
      <p>Now I commend you all to God, the best and greatest, and to the word of his grace, who may dwell in you richly with all wisdom and virtue. Amen. Please convey my greetings to my teacher Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and others, and excuse me to them for not having written; but you may share this with them, provided you take care that no one else recognizes that I have written these things.</p>
      <p>For I have reported these things for the sake of the church and in your name. Farewell in Christ the Lord and be a strong and diligent minister of Christ, as you are accustomed. Greet your wife Anna, née Adlischwyler, most diligently in my name. Again, farewell and consider this impromptu writing kindly. For I wrote this as I was about to depart.</p>
      <p>In Groningen, August 31, 1545.</p>
      <p>Gerhard zum Camph of Emden, entirely yours, as much as he is.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his greatest friend and most beloved brother in Christ. Greetings in Christ the Lord.</p>
