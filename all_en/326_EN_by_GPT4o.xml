      <p>Grace from God beforehand. Dear godfather, your letter sent last Friday at ten before noon reached me on Saturday at 3 in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Thank you on behalf of my gracious lords for your loyalty, effort, and work, etc. In response, as you requested, we have achieved that today, a full council, well assembled, has dispatched this messenger with letters to my gracious lords of Zürich, requesting nothing more than that we also come together on our side to deliberate a unanimous response to give to the 7 places, and also to discuss other necessary matters. Therefore, urging my lords to set a date, when and where it pleases them, for the 4 cities to come together; but be careful not to forget those who are inclined to our religion, similarly. However, as you think it is advisable that a friendly letter should come before the council's time on next Tuesday, it was not possible; for the majority of my lords only returned last night, and it had to be prepared before the council today; moreover, they consider that there is no particular hurry needed, since the 8th council decision must first be ratified by the council and citizens. In the evening, many of my lords, who have entrusted me with this, ask you to write that you are doing everything in your power to ensure that the day is set and not hindered by anything, as it is of great importance to all of us. I wanted to let you know this through this messenger in response to your letter. Otherwise, I have nothing else to write to you at this time. I have sent you Calvin's Propositions again through Hans Mangold. You can tell Frisius that the next day, the four stipendiaries of our church will come, whom, as I hear, he has received at his table and under his discipline.</p>
      <p>Through them, too, if there is anything worth writing in the meantime, I will write. If I write nothing, still consider them otherwise recommended; they are young men not unlearned and, as far as I have been able to know them, pious and modest. My lord treasurer Haller, Mr. Imm Hag, the state secretary, send you their warm greetings. The two lords have been written to; thanking you kindly. The remaining brothers also wish you well. You should greet all those who are with you in my name and also your family from me and mine. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, 29th October 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, as much as he is, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To his particularly dear lord and godfather Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
