      <p>S. D. I am very sorry to cause trouble to good men, most esteemed sir, that in such savage beginnings of a most bloody war, they are sent to such a council, from which no good man can hope for anything good. The Pope presides over it, and holds pure power there; for those who sit there are conspirators and sworn to the words of the Pope. By issuing bulls, they have testified why the council has convened: to extirpate heresies. Long ago, by publishing books and edicts, they declared our doctrine to be that venomous heresy, and us to be those heretics, the disturbers of the Christian world. This world has seen the decrees issued under Paul; everyone knows those decrees have been ratified by continuation; bishops and great men write that it is unjust for heretics to be heard unless they wish to recant and rush into the bosom of the holy mother church. It is known to all, even to the blind and barbers, who have gathered in Trient, what they have been like until now and what they are doing even today, and to this and such a shameful, disgraceful, factional, bloody, and treacherous council, good men are still being sent. The Pope's envoy even called the doctors of the Swiss churches. We have explained to many what I have now briefly recounted to you; we have protested that we do not wish to go there, to tempt the Lord and to present the truth of God to be mocked by the declared enemies of the gospel; we offered a free conference in some fair place. We added that Christ and the apostles taught, but did not wish to go to a papal council, that Christ, once led to this, was soon driven to the cross, that the apostles were slain in councils, that Paul preferred to appeal to Nero rather than to come to the council in Jerusalem. Therefore, I pity the good men.</p>
      <p>Whatever kings may rave, the Greeks suffer. What princes and magnates sin in imperial diets, etc., the poor priests must atone for or bring back to justice.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant those best of our brothers faith, patience, and constancy. They are led like sheep to the slaughter; it is now fulfilled: Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore, it is time for us to sympathize and pray for our brothers.</p>
      <p>I received letters from England written on February 8th from Oxford. Among other things, friends mention that serious and just reformation is now being considered for all of England and Ireland; that the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Ely, the Bishop of London, Martyr, Cox, and some other good men have been appointed to this task. They add that the Duke of Somerset was beheaded in those days. May nothing of turmoil arise from this.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve that kingdom and illuminate it with the light of the gospel of His Son. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell. ZÃ¼rich, March 6, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Christopher Mont, secretary to the most serene King of England, his most esteemed lord.</p>
