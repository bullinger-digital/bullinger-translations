      <p>Greetings. The person who delivers this letter to you, dearest brother, is recommended to me by Mr. Lorenz Agricola, as you can see in the letters I have enclosed here; otherwise, I do not know the man. However, since I understand that he is quite eloquent and knowledgeable in true religion, and is seeking a place where he can serve the church, I have advised him to go to you; there are not a few places that need and lack pastors. I therefore ask you to assist him; however, I do not want you to be unaware that the abbot of St. Gallen detained him in chains for a long time, finally decided to make an example of him (put him in the stocks) and beat him with rods, for no other reason than religion. Hylerus recently explained to our most honorable senate that from the time his uncle committed suicide, he has never been restored to full health; he produced as witnesses neighboring pastors, doctors, and pharmacists. He therefore fears that he may not be able to meet the expectations placed on him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it has been granted to him to remain in the place where he currently is. Tobias Egli, well known to you, learned and of a pious and holy life, has been appointed in his place. He was previously a preacher in Frauenfeld in his homeland; his piety and diligence greatly displeased the papists; therefore, through unjust means, they managed to have him accused at the Baden assembly, as if he had violated the peace by teaching, and thus the magistrate was ordered to imprison him day and night, and then release him. However, he left after being warned, before the order reached the magistrate. He has therefore lived here. From here, the magistrate will send him to you with their letters of recommendation.</p>
      <p>I will also add my own to Mr. Paul Paul and to Mr. Ambrosius, the consul; now I commend him to you with this. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 20, 1561. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
