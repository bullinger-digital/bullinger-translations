      <p>Greetings and peace of conscience.</p>
      <p>On the eleventh day before the calends of March, Johannes Kopf, the bearer of this letter, came to us, indicating that he wished to publicly testify to the church about the marriage that had previously been agreed upon in secret between him and Dorothea Locher; which he did in our presence. However, since our Capito was occupied with significant matters and could not instruct us on this issue, nor had Bucer, to whom we were especially going to entrust the task of writing to you, yet returned from the Schmalkaldic assembly, this good man extracted from us this letter to you, in which we only wish to testify to you all that, as far as the marriage is concerned, it was contracted legitimately and according to the custom of our church between them, and that there is no deceit involved. Therefore, most learned Bullinger, although I have only been able to know the man by face and from one or two conversations, I cannot help but commend his wife to you, as she has been known to me since her youth, and I wish they had stayed with us even for just an hour longer, so that I could have done this more extensively. But you, along with your fellow ministers and friends, should nonetheless continue to do good to both of them, just as if they had been especially recommended to you by us and others. Take it in good part; for I could not deal with you more extensively due to their sudden departure.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 11th day before the calends of March, in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Petrus Dasypodius, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and equally most humane man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his dearest brother and friend.</p>
