      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not written to you for several days, most esteemed and dearest lord and godfather, is partly due to the lack of messengers and partly because I myself have been suffering from the illness that is spreading everywhere, and I have not yet fully regained my strength. Almost my entire household has been afflicted by it, indeed almost the entire city.</p>
      <p>What this illness portends, the Lord knows; may we turn to Him in time! I have received all three of your letters that you sent to me in the meantime, I believe, and I thank you greatly for your faithfulness and diligence, especially for your remarkable work on the Apocalypse.</p>
      <p>We were unworthy for such a great treasure to be published among us; I praise the people of Basel for daring to do this. I owe you much for all these copies of your writings that you send to me daily; I will make sure not to remain ungrateful forever. I will ensure that my Decades, or rather yours, are published cleanly.</p>
      <p>Regarding the title or inscription, I will follow your advice; decide between Froschauer and me what he should pay me for my labor; whatever you decide will suffice for me.</p>
      <p>Today Apiarius began; he has quite clean paper and new type. As for Gribaldus, as I recently wrote, he was summoned, came, and not content with leaving Tübingen with a bad reputation, as soon as he returned to his people, he began to spread his opinions among some, and so openly that the prefect of Gaius, having been warned about this, collected his scattered pamphlets and sent them to our senate along with him. His doctrines are very absurd: he explicitly establishes three distinct gods, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. He establishes the Father as some supreme being, like Jupiter, the chief of the gods, and whatever is said in the scriptures about the ineffable majesty of divinity, he attributes entirely to the person of the Father, gives origin to the Son and the Holy Spirit, and calls them ministerial and subordinate gods or spirits. He also asserts that the divine seed of the Son of God or the Word was coagulated into a man in the Virgin Mother, and not assumed humanity from the Mother herself, and many other such things. He ridicules the idea of one God in the Trinity, or a triune God, as something abstruse that no one can comprehend, neither by word nor by reason, but considers it a scholastic delusion. He cites older fathers who preceded the Nicene Council, but he does them great injustice, as none of them taught what he teaches. He admits the Nicene Creed, but less so the Athanasian.</p>
      <p>After the matter was investigated by the senate, he was thrown into prison. His books have been sent to us for examination.</p>
      <p>This is the 9th day he has been held, and today, I believe, his case will be decided. Some think he should be burned, others that he should be banished.</p>
      <p>I do not know how the matter will turn out.</p>
      <p>We would like him to be brought before the tribunal of the Duke of Württemberg again, but this plan seems less appealing to our people. I hear he will not be obstinate, and this will be to his salvation.</p>
      <p>If the messenger waits here today until his business is settled, I will add what has been done. Viretus, accused of various things by the Lausanne senate, is now defending his case here along with Théodore de Bèze, who is sending his apology to you along with these of mine. He made a copy for me and explained everything about the confession left behind.</p>
      <p>I severely reprimanded him.</p>
      <p>He is very afraid that the matter will become known to the senate.</p>
      <p>We have no news, except that the town of Saint-Quentin is reported to have been stormed with great slaughter on both sides, Reims also occupied by the Philippians, and Langres besieged. Today Leverus arrived here; he thanks you for the advice given to them.</p>
      <p>He promises conformity; he asks that at least more frequent use of the Lord's Supper be granted to them, which I believe they will easily obtain. I am very glad that they wish to accommodate themselves to our churches in other respects; I feared disturbances from there. These are the things I had to respond to your letters now.</p>
      <p>To Lord Martyr, Gwalther, and all the other lords and my brothers, to your wife and all your household, I ask you to convey my greetings; ours greet you. Musculus writes himself.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 14, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Gribaldus is banished on the condition that he does not return unless he brings a good testimony of his departure from the Prince of Württemberg, and if, as we hoped, he is sent back to the prince.</p>
