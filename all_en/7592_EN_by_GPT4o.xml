      <p>Greetings through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Honorable and gracious lord, if it goes well with you, your daughters, and your entire household, and you are all fresh and healthy, I would be very glad to hear it. We here, for our part, give thanks and praise to God the Lord, who continues to share his grace with both parties according to his will.</p>
      <p>I wrote to you on the 19th of July, but since then I have not had the opportunity (because we are accustomed to do our annual accounting at this time of year), but I have since received 2 letters from your lordship, dated June 7th and July 4th, in which I was pleased to hear of your and your household's well-being. Since then, I have not received any writing from you; please inform me whether you have received the money for the books, and also my request for 2 copies of the book called "Fundamentum"; if you have not yet sent them, I ask you once again to send them to me, but I do not desire them for free, but for the money, otherwise, I will not accept them. One copy belongs to Mr. Mauritio Helling, who sends his regards to you, as do Mr. Durnhofer and Dr. Christoph Hartusionsis, very friendly greetings. I have not been much with them lately, as I have been busy with my affairs as mentioned before.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have unfortunately heard what has happened in the Grey Leagues with the pious Mr. F. Cellarius, which I cannot sufficiently wonder at, that the Pope or Philippus dares to undertake such a thing so boldly.</p>
      <p>Some consider it to be a beginning to divide the Confederates among themselves and to incite enmity among them.</p>
      <p>These are, to this day, the Spanish and Roman practices, as they are partly at work here with us as well. But I trust in God, he will bring their false plans to light and make them void. Here it is said for certain that Emperor Maximilian has summoned some scholars to him in Vienna, as some say, to consult them on how to extinguish this kindled fire of religion and to forge a new Interim.</p>
      <p>He has also requested the Elector of Saxony to send him Mr. Joachim Camerarius, the elder; he is already on his way. What benefit they will achieve, time will reveal. What I learn further in due course, I will inform you as opportunity allows. There is also talk that on the 4th of this month, Archduke Charles of Austria is to be sent to Spain, and a colonel is to be appointed and assigned by the king in his Netherlands, because the Duke of Alba is entirely and utterly hated.</p>
      <p>Regarding the advance of the Prince of Orange, it is said to be impressive, they are already over the Rhine near Koblenz, 70 companies on foot and about 8000 horses. Count Ludwig of Nassau is also supposed to join him with a particularly strong force, and daily one learns where he is heading. The Duke of Alba is also said to be strong with Spaniards, Italians, French, and Germans; in particular, he has 2000 horses, which Duke Eric of Brunswick brought to him long ago, it is to be expected that if both forces come together, there will be a terrible bloodbath. May God have mercy on his poor Christendom and turn his wrath from us, overthrow and resist the pride of the tyrant who sheds so much innocent blood.</p>
      <p>Herewith some news from the Netherlands, also what is unfortunately happening in Friesland. It is a great plague from God that we Germans do not open our eyes and allow ourselves to be oppressed by the godless Spaniards in this way.</p>
      <p>In France, peace does not want to follow; it is to be feared that it will start again this autumn. As long as the cardinal is at court and the queen is alive, things will not go well in France. My request, if you have any news from France or from Mr. Beza, please share it with me as opportunity allows.</p>
      <p>There is talk here of an alliance of the lords of Bern, Zurich, Basel, and Schaffhausen with those of Strasbourg and the Elector on the Rhine, and the Duke of Württemberg, of which you will undoubtedly have a good report. Otherwise, nothing at this time, except to commend myself to your love and favor, also to greet your virtuous daughters along with the entire household and all good lords and friends very humbly and friendly, and hereby commend you to the protection and care of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Dated Nuremberg, September 6, 1568. Your willing servant, Gabriel Schlüsselberger.</p>
