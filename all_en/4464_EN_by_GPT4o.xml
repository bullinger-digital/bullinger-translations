      <p>Greetings. I am glad to hear that everything is well with you, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>The Lord will also restore the health of your dear son-in-law, Ludwig; but if the delay seems longer, the Lord must be patient and silent. As for me, who seems to have recovered, I am still dealing with the remnants of the illness and have not yet completely escaped the hands of the doctors, but I hope the Lord will also bring an end to this. Everything is quiet here.</p>
      <p>Hercules appeared at the minor assembly, called by the bytag. The matter was postponed to the major assembly, where he is to appear with his sons, having given sureties.</p>
      <p>Hercules excuses himself, and indeed at length to me; but I am beginning to understand gradually. The main point of his excuse is this: The Venetians recently appointed an emperor, a supreme field commander; who, because he had Hercules as a friend, advised the Venetian senate to appoint Hercules as his lieutenant, a lieutenant's office, according to the custom and institution of the Venetian republic. However, Hercules, being older, when he was written to about these matters, declined this office, but the Venetians gave this province to his son Rudolf in place of his father with a very ample pension.</p>
      <p>This is the main point.</p>
      <p>And when Hercules' son Rudolf was asked how many men could be raised from the Confederates in case of need, he replied: "If you could agree with my lords of the Confederates, I hope to raise six thousand men." Thus Hercules excuses himself. As for the other matters, I can certainly affirm to you that this practice was not initially of the Five Cantons, but I cannot deny that it may now be progressing.</p>
      <p>The stories are long; but do not believe that the beginning of the movement is because they withdrew from the bishop's dominion at Fürstenau in Tumschläschg, but because they complained that the bishop did not proceed with his vassals, without feudal tenants, in the legal form that was fair and previously used in those parts. However, when these matters were being discussed and the bishop's prefect was advocating for his lord's cause (for one must deal with the staff and high court before him), the prefect produced a diploma from his bosom in the bishop's name to defend the cause, saying that the bishop had these confirmed and approved by the Three Leagues in the assemblies. But because not only these but many other things were written in those letters that contradicted the articles, some of the assessors wanted to hear the date and the letters' date, and when two of the judges had been in those assemblies where nothing of the sort had been done, they rose up and publicly protested that these letters were false and deceitfully made by the bishop himself or a few others, and that it was neither right nor lawful for a few to do this without public deliberation.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they appealed against the bishop to the communities. Meanwhile, something else happened, which refers to you among other things, as I could easily understand from the words of Ludwig Quadri.</p>
      <p>Lucius Ringg, a noble man and exceedingly experienced in civil matters, who had obtained the regalia for the bishop from the emperor in previous years because he was well-known at the emperor's court, seized this opportunity. And because he knew that the bishop's prefect was disliked not only by the papists but also by the evangelicals, the former because of his greed, the latter because he professed to be evangelical and yet greatly inconvenienced the gospel under this pretext, he advised his people to depose this prefect and appoint a vicar until the major assembly, etc. This is the brief summary.</p>
      <p>For Lucius Ringg aspires to the prefecture, which the bishop had promised him several times not without witnesses, etc. I neither approve nor disapprove of this action, because it is nothing to me.</p>
      <p>I know Ringg seeks his own interests.</p>
      <p>But because they were pressing two not unjust articles at the same time, 1. that the articles should be adhered to, 2. that the bishop should give an account, since he not only managed the court sordidly but also defrauded the poor of their regular alms and engaged in banking and livestock trading to the great detriment of the republic: when they pressed these, I confess I was an advocate for our people to help them in a good cause. Now, whatever the outcome, the die is cast.</p>
      <p>You fear the practices of the Five Cantons.</p>
      <p>I fear them too; but that is no reason to abandon a good and just cause.</p>
      <p>I know the bishop is trembling, I know he is afraid for himself. He will not move rashly; for in this way he would lose his cause.</p>
      <p>What if he pleaded his cause with the bishop of Como to restore himself to the pope's favor, whom he has completely alienated? For when our bishop acted as the pope's vicar, this pope did not want to confirm this right of his, but, grinding his teeth, said with his hands clenched in the manner of angry men: "Oh, if I had that priest (thus calling the bishop) here!" There was a certain Italian canon here, a cunning man, who once helped the bishop's cause in Rome, an excellent trickster and experienced in the Roman court. He had said (it is now about 3 months ago) that the bishop was a forger and made false diplomas, and therefore he was arrested and thrown into prison with the intention that he would end his life there; but he escaped naked due to the carelessness of the guard and went to Rome to accuse the bishop, whom he had already accused before the bishop of Como, etc. This in passing.</p>
      <p>Indeed, because our Urania no longer offended the bishop of Como, for he had left the day before for the assembly, having stayed there for only two or three hours, he finally followed the bishop with great journeys; on his return, he wanted to visit the abbot in Einsiedeln, who was, however, in Zurich at that time. This is his journey, etc.</p>
      <p>As for the other matters, I know what greed can do, and I experience it more and more every day; but regarding the distribution of the remainder to the communities, the best advice seems to me to be different from yours. Forgive me, father, if I speak freely what I feel.</p>
      <p>For as long as the bishop holds onto these goods, there is no hope that anything can return to the poor or the church; as soon as a portion returns to the communities (we speak of the remainder, which the bishop spends on harlots and his own), then the ministers would have the opportunity to exhort their people in their parishes to convert the goods of the church and the poor to their own use. You should not think that the remainder, which does not go to waste, will be found in a heap for the church. Oh no! Not a penny of it comes to the house of God; indeed, he leaves the buildings and everything else to decay. Euclio alone makes a fortune for himself and his own and drives the goods out of the land, however it may go, so that he has something to stay with; he has the largest share in the Etsch and in Venice in exchange.</p>
      <p>Now some communities in the Pergäl are so poor that they cannot pay their servants until the annual money comes from France; with that, they pay their pastors. Where I should turn, I do not know.</p>
      <p>I know nothing better, as I consider it from behind and in front, than to be honest and fearless and then let God rule; He will do it. But you, dear godfather, need not fear that the matter will be attacked too harshly and that some unrest will follow; for there are so many smooth fellows who secretly have dealings with the bishop, who nevertheless want to be evangelical, that even if we had a much better cause, nothing would be achieved with them. God have mercy! So much for this.</p>
      <p>But I ask you, reverend father, if I write more openly and with some confidence towards you, forgive me; for I feel this way and write this way. As for your writing, I read it with great desire, but I received no less pleasure from reading it; for I hope for great benefit from it. When Mr. Philipp has read it in good faith after 8 days, if indeed the messenger arrives, I will send it back.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>You recognize the hand.</p>
