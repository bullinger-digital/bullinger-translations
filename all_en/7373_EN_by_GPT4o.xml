      <p>Greetings. I have received, most venerable lord, what you sent last, and I thank you for it. We have nothing from Italy or elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The envoy has nothing certain (as I hear from his people). The soldiers who return say very different things; some of the latest are even said to be present. It is strange that nothing certain can be affirmed about the battle that took place. Letters were sent the day before yesterday to one of our citizens in St. Gallen by a certain merchant, the content of which is that almost all the latest soldiers have been slaughtered.</p>
      <p>What is true, you surely already know; for our merchants reported that on Friday, after their departure, letters were finally brought to your most honorable magistrate from I don't know where, which they themselves could not wait to see what they contained. Our interpreter, a cunning and shameless man, invents all these things about the Genevans, hears from others, and thinks everything is attributed to Geneva. But I will be more cautious in the future and will not give anyone any example to copy. The consul retains for a long time, if I send anything; but another favors the envoy too much, and these things, which are distributed even to the most trustworthy, cannot easily be kept secret. I do not know whom to trust in the end. If they themselves obtain something that they consider to be in their interest, they publish and spread it with full mouths, not just in writing. Mr. Brunner lives in Maienfeld, I do not know how well; for he has never written to me from there. I return this Basel document and thank you very much. May God, the best and greatest, preserve you safe and sound for all of us for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Chur, January 19, 1568, swiftly.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>All greet you by special command, the consuls, Mr. Karl, a valiant man, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, and the son of Mr. Ambrosius, Ambrosius.</p>
      <p>The captain of Feldkirch was here this week at court and dined with the bishop along with others, where our German schoolmaster, an honest man, was also present. There the captain brought up religion and attacked the evangelicals very rudely: we are all nothing but damned, unholy, disgraceful rascals, who soon fall into the hands of the devil, etc.; also naming Zurich by name, etc., very rudely. The bishop had indeed rebuked him a little, and the schoolmaster disagreed with him. But he departed the next day.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
