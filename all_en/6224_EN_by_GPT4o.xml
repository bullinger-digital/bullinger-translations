      <p>Greetings. Recently (reverend father in Christ), I wrote very hastily and noted down about Hannibal what I had heard. Meanwhile, the same things have also been written from Italy to Balingketus, and yet, since rumors vary, I am in doubt about what should be believed; soon we will experience the true certainty. There are those who say that at least three Italian banners have been destroyed, but not the German soldiers.</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, the rumor will not be entirely baseless. It is said for certain that the Genoese are in great trepidation and are recruiting soldiers from everywhere.</p>
      <p>There are also those who affirm that two other legions of Germans are to be enlisted, about which I can affirm nothing yet. Soon we will clearly understand what the truth is.</p>
      <p>We are expecting the envoy of Philip of Spain; how certain this is, I do not know; however, his return is affirmed by people of that faction.</p>
      <p>We are in doubt about what delay keeps our consul so long in France. From the letters of Mr. Beza, I have understood enough that the affairs of France are not entirely in the state we hoped for.</p>
      <p>It is very important for us to be informed in the future as well about what is happening, because of the alliance that will soon be discussed among us. Mr. de Bellievre wrote that the leading men from France are expected in Solothurn; whether they have arrived, I do not know. I did not send back Mr. Beza's letters, as you had given me free access to them; if you desire, they will be sent next time.</p>
      <p>I am eternally grateful to you.</p>
      <p>But what if the plague in France is depleting the churches? What if this is the will of the Lord, to which piety commands us to submit? The plague is also infesting some villages here and there in Rhaetia. It has not yet reached us; however, I can hardly believe we will remain immune.</p>
      <p>May the Lord's will be done.</p>
      <p>I do not fear the plague as much as the customs of this people, who fear the plague so anxiously that not a few may perish from hunger due to solitude.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna is now completely empty.</p>
      <p>They are cleaning and purifying the city.</p>
      <p>I have been assured that they are unbinding all the books, shaking each page separately, and burning the threads; for it is certain without controversy that they burn clothes and furniture. I learn many things in these regions, which, if I had heard of them happening, I would hardly have ever believed.</p>
      <p>Mr. Balingketus, due to some of his affairs, wishes to know by what day the Baden assemblies are convened and whether any certain day has been appointed for those assemblies. I have finally completed my response against Fontidonius and Cardillus, which had been long delayed. I explain the reasons for my writing extensively in the letter I preface, which are such that I hope to satisfy Christian men.</p>
      <p>It greatly aids my cause that Cardillus, not content with previous insults, has imbued his tongue with new poisons; here, being provoked a second time, I have found a greater opportunity to respond.</p>
      <p>There is nothing in Cardillus's later writing to which I have not sufficiently responded. Mr. Guizardus, the rector, read part of the book, and what pleased him, he promised to act with Mr. Beza to have it printed in Geneva.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, he left; what he accomplished in Geneva, I do not know.</p>
      <p>However, in recent days, as I had a certain man who was going to Geneva, I gave him a copy and wrote to Mr. Beza.</p>
      <p>Now I pray to God to bless the undertaking.</p>
      <p>I know for certain that the adversaries will eagerly attack me; but since I have not decided to respond further, I have tempered my writing in such a way that it can easily withstand all attacks.</p>
      <p>From now on, if I live, I will resume my studies and intend to reconcile with both divine and human letters. I will also devote myself entirely to the reading of the fathers, so that I may solidly and accurately know what I have hitherto only superficially tasted. This is indeed what I have resolved for myself; the Lord alone knows how far I will progress.</p>
      <p>With these words, I trouble you, lest I write nothing in vain. You will forgive me for your humanity.</p>
      <p>I am not writing to Mr. Wolfgang Haller now; I will take care of the letters, I wish him well. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, as happily and as long as possible. Chur, Rhaetia, in the year 1564, August 7th.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich, to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
