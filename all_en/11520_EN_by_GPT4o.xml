    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer's gift, a Hebrew coin, has delighted him as well as Theodor Bibliander and the other scholars - it matches the weight mentioned by Moses and Josephus and bears an inscription in Samaritan, the language of Jesus -; thanks for the transmitted news. Bullinger also finds Luther's words harsh, but the behavior of the Emperor and King Ferdinand angers even the meekest; we know what kind of sword God has given us and how wrong it was for Peter to take up arms; therefore, Bullinger also recoils from the most just war; may God stand by His Church! Bullinger is also dismayed that alleged polemics from some in Zurich have caused displeasure; upon his inquiry, Leo Jud, Kaspar Megander, Bibliander, and all others have denied spreading such speeches; they are aware that they all fight for the same cause and pray for their brothers. Greetings. Request for news from the Diet of Regensburg.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I cannot easily explain to you, most esteemed Ambrosius, how pleasing your gift was, the Hebrew shekel, which I consider far more delightful, dearer, and more precious to me than pure gold and the most noble gems. You have delighted with this very gift the other scholars of the Holy Scripture, especially Theodor Bibliander. We see and feel that its weight agrees well with what Moses mentioned about the shekel in Exodus 30:13 and Josephus elsewhere. Know, therefore, that with this most sacred gift you have gratified me as scarcely ever before. The letters are Samaritan, which the inscription bears, and they are all the more pleasing because it is certain that our Savior used the Samaritan language. May the Lord repay you for this great benefit, and may He also repay you for the other things you confer upon us.</p>
      <p>Those things were also most welcome, which you aptly wrote by hand from various friends' letters amidst so many business affairs. Would that it might someday be possible to testify to you and yours a grateful and entirely devoted spirit with some distinguished service.</p>
      <p>However, it seems quite harsh and almost unbecoming for an evangelical preacher to use the words that fell from Luther, otherwise a most holy man, more harshly pronounced against the Emperor and Ferdinand, truly unfortunate. Yet their cruel and bloody deeds extort such words even from the most gentle. Meanwhile, we are not ignorant of what kind of sword the Lord has given us. Peter was a faithful and zealous disciple of the Lord; but the war he waged fell out more disastrously. Hence, I shudder at even the most just wars (which are so considered). May the Lord grant peace to His Church, I pray, or patience and constancy in persecution.</p>
      <p>You write that there are learned men who are pained by the petulance of the people of Zurich, who mock the efforts of the best brothers and who dislike the Worms Colloquy as if it were Sorbonic, etc. However, I was sincerely grieved, and this news disturbed me. I called Leo Jud, Kaspar Megander, Bibliander, and the others, and I diligently asked whether they had believed anything of this in writing, or whether something similar had slipped out more freely among friends. They all respond with one voice that they have not even dreamed of such a thing. We rather pray for the brothers who are contending; we know whose business is at stake here, nor are we so stupid, although we are otherwise rustic, that we do not understand that our safety and calamity are linked with their fortune or misfortune; for we are in one body with them. May the Lord preserve us all.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 13, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>[If you have] anything [about] the Diet [of Regensburg] [- - -] please [let me know].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Ambrosius Blarer, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Constance, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
