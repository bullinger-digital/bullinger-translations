      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Today, Johannes Rudolf von Landenberg, Kaspar Messikomer, and Felix Blonsli have informed us that they have been called back home by you, most excellent and esteemed brothers, and they requested from us a testimony of the life they led with us, which we did not think should be denied to them. Therefore, we wish to testify to you that as long as they lived with us, they appeared to us as pious, modest, and diligent young men, and nothing was ever observed by us or reported to us by others that was contrary to their duty. May the Lord, therefore, complete what He has begun in them, and may our work in the Lord benefit not only them but also many others. For we shall consider this the most abundant and ample reward for our labors, if we understand that our efforts, however modest, are neither useless to the church of God nor ungrateful to you, most excellent brothers. Farewell in the Lord, whom we sincerely pray to keep His church and especially you safe and sound. Lausanne, the third day before the calends of April, 1553.</p>
      <p>Theodor Beza, your most observant brother in the Lord, in the name of the ministers and professors of this church of Lausanne.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished servants of God and most esteemed brothers in the Lord, ministers of the word and professors of the liberal arts.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
