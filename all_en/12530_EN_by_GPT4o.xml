    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks for Blarer's letter [No. 2480]. The people of Augsburg should continue to be encouraged. Deciding against [Emperor Charles V] must have demanded a lot from them. Their cautious approach is better than too much presumption.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- If King [Ferdinand] is not lying and [Suleiman I] really attacks, something similar could happen as before, when the Philistines attacked [King] Saul, which benefited David. However, the deceitful brothers [Ferdinand and Charles V] cannot be trusted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Many righteous acquaintances would fight [in the event of war for the Schmalkaldic League]. And supposedly many Swiss [mercenaries] are already gathering in Lindau.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- May God assist Duke Ulrich [of WÃ¼rttemberg]! How did he destroy the parade ground of Riedlingen?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- It is right that the families of the people of Constance, who run to the [Emperor], are expelled.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- All preachers and church servants in Zurich have guild and citizenship rights. If it comes to deployment, they gather armed like other citizens. Some of them participate in guild meetings and have voting rights like the others. However, the council has ordered Bullinger and Leo [Jud] to stay at home in case of a call-up. Yet Bullinger still possesses his guild and citizenship rights. If he presented himself at a call-up, he was always sent back. In the event of war, he would provide a substitute for himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- It was already clear to him that [Alfonso Diaz and Juan Prieto], the murderers [of Juan Diaz], would not be punished, for what is an individual compared to the 100,000 that the Emperor now wants to murder? If he reproaches the people of Memmingen [for the execution of Ludwig Vogelmann], it testifies to his good memory! His [behavior at the Imperial Diet] in Regensburg reveals his plans towards Constance and the other imperial cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- May the day in Baden be successful! Zurich and the whole people are inclined [towards the Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Blarer should continue to write diligently. From Basel [No. 2481] it is reported that the troops who fought for France against England are now running to the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse]. Strasbourg has also sent him four companies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- The Emperor has tormented France with deceit and fraud, devastated Hungary, conquered Milan, and subdued Gelderland. One must beware of him, for he is dangerous!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I have understood the contents of your friendly letter. Thank God that He still arranges things well. Encouragement and earnest persistence in Augsburg with trusted people will bear fruit. Believe me, the first decision must have demanded a lot from them. It is also better to be cautious than too presumptuous.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>If the king is not lying and the Turk attacks, it is like the Philistines against Saul for David. However, there is complete deceit with the two brothers. One cannot believe any truth from them, as they always deal with falsehood and deceit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>There are many righteous companions who would willingly run if it came to it. Yet, the word is that many people from the Swiss Confederation are already gathering in Lindau.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>May God grant Duke Ulrich grace and fortune. But how did he destroy the parade ground at Riedlingen? Did he attack, or how was it?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It is right that the wives and children of those who run against the fatherland are sent after them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>All preachers and church servants have guild and citizenship rights. When it comes to it, they act and behave like other citizens with armor, weapons, and all. Some of them are also appointed to the guilds, and in the guilds, they have a say, vote, and hand like any other citizen. They are also asked for armor and weapons like other citizens. However, my lords have long ago spoken with Master Leo and me that whatever happens, we should stay at home and not run out. When I ran out a few times, they sent me back. I still hold to that. But I have my guild and citizenship rights. I go to the meetings like any other guild member, etc. And if it came to me being called to war and they did not let me go, I would still appoint someone in my place who would represent me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I already knew well that nothing would happen to the murderers. What should one do to them, since the Emperor does not want to murder just one, but a hundred thousand? God will judge! If he can reproach the people of Memmingen, it shows what a good memory he has! Do you not think that more is behind the scenes against you and other imperial cities, as you learn from what he does with Regensburg, what you should prepare for?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>May God send a good day to Baden! My lords are very eager, and the whole people are inclined and willing towards you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Dear friend, continue to write diligently. I will do the same. The word comes from Basel that all the French troops who fought against England are now running to the Landgrave for comfort. Yet, I know no specifics. Strasbourg has sent him four companies of soldiers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Given in Zurich, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon on July 1st. God protect you! Greet the good lords and friends for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I see and notice what the Emperor is up to. With smooth (deceptive) words and treacherous Spanish practices, he has plagued France, devastated Hungary, conquered Milan, subdued Gelderland, promised much, given good words here and there: And it has all been deceit and falsehood. Beware! Do not believe him! He is swift. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given as above.</p>
      <p>Yours always.</p>
