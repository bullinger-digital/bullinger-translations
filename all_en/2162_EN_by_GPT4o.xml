      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, there is no need for you to fear if you see a huge bundle brought by a certain messenger, as if you think I want to persist throughout this year and overwhelm you with such troubles. Do not fear, I say; for I send this to free both you and myself, as you will be able to see from other letters inserted in the bundle. So I send it back to you.</p>
      <p>I had prepared the books four days ago and hoped to have a certain messenger; but it did not succeed, and I thought it best to hire this one, so that I might free myself all the sooner. I beg you, when you send these to the legates, add a word that you received them from me through your own messenger; moreover, I beg and beseech you to order another paper with a German inscription to be added to both letters; for I fear they may otherwise be intercepted. I would have done this myself; but I have already sealed them and do not willingly open them again.</p>
      <p>The more I think and converse with prudent men, the more I fear for Germany now because of other reasons, which I mentioned to you in these other enclosed letters. One reason is that everyone seems to have decided to endure and dissimulate while the Emperor lives, and the other is that he will now disturb everything with bribes more than ever before, if he prepares the kingdom of England, that is, a certain source of gold, for his son, unless we wish to believe that there will be none in Germany who allow themselves to be corrupted.</p>
      <p>Would that we might see something new and a faithful alliance for the defense of common liberty, and unless this happens, I indeed see many evils impending. But our sins and negligence in promoting such a good cause deserve this. Spare us, Lord, spare our sins and our negligence.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, you would scarcely believe how few appear who can truly say: The zeal of your house has consumed me. But may God send his spirit from heaven, who may warm us and kindle us through Christ, our Lord. Allow me to say this specifically (which keep to yourself) that I have known none so far who do not attack our opinion on the sacrament of the Eucharist with a certain kind of rage. This is what is to be lamented, not only that they disagree with us, but that they disagree with bitter zeal. That one, to whom Sulcerus wrote about a false accusation, you know whom I mean, whom I indeed once hoped would agree with us, disagrees, I say, and disagrees with bitter zeal. When I said none, I spoke properly; what need is there for words? and since I have now such a certain messenger, I wanted to lament these things with you and lovingly pour them into your bosom, but into yours alone.</p>
      <p>The messenger has nothing to do there, but only to bring your autograph to me, by which I can be certain that the bundle has been delivered to you; for I know you will soon send letters to those two friends cautiously and prudently, and I hope that I will not be very troublesome to you in this regard, and forgive me if I have sometimes disturbed your holy studies with my letters and messengers. You certainly are not such a person from whom neither I nor anyone else should steal good hours, and I indeed will not steal anymore, as I hope. Farewell and be well and help me with your prayers to our Lord God. Tübingen, January 16, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>If by chance the messenger lingers there, write how long he has lingered; this kind of people is generally not very truthful.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
