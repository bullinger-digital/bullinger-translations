      <p>S. Concerning the events that have taken place in the regions of Flanders and Calais after the capture of Thionville, you will understand from the letters I am writing to the most illustrious council. There is a great terror and flight in those regions.</p>
      <p>Would that the minds of the princes were inclined towards peace and the reformation of the church. But the sun of all days has not yet set, and bloody months remain, and the spirits of the leaders will descend to battle and will not refuse the fight. What if the Lord wishes to accomplish His work through foreign means and, as usual, turn everything to the amplification of His name? To Him be the glory.</p>
      <p>One of my men wrote that Colonel Dandelot was released from prison, even if he persisted in his opinion. When the heat has subsided a little, I will send my son.</p>
      <p>But I have not yet received word that you have recovered; do not allow the horses to perish in idleness, and I beg you again and again to inform me often about your health.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet our mutual friends in my name.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, July 21.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
