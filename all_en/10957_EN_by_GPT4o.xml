      <p>To the people of Zurich, November 24.</p>
      <p>Behold, most esteemed and dearest brothers of all, with the consent of our magistrates, we send to you by this very messenger whatever our church has finally decided to write and respond to Luther. We ask you, our closest brothers, to carefully read and reread this very response of ours, and then to indicate what seems to be done. For our conscience urges us, lest we act rashly. However, beware that nothing sinister comes to your mind. For we testify before you that your judgment will be of use only to our consciences. And there is plainly no other reason why we seek this than to understand by the judgment of good men whether what we are about to give is certain and true, so that it may always be given as it has been once. We have expressed our mind clearly enough. However, we desire, out of regard for charity, to neglect nothing, although this court is not to be expressed by us, but by others. But since we owe the first place to truth and Christ, we must prevent giving anything with offense to Him. Therefore, we have made an effort to imitate as closely as possible the expressions accepted by Luther, which was extorted by the desire for concord. Again, truth has prevented us from giving entirely. But, O God, how it pains us to have fallen into such miserable misfortune, that, although words were invented to express the mind, now there is scarcely enough mind to express the words. And would that it were not a sin to be open! And certainly, whatever in our response is not clear, it is not due to our fault. For we have endeavored to say certain things more obscurely and have forced ourselves beyond our custom to a certain obscurity, and that, lest we seem too unkind for the sake of present charity and concord. Observe each thing and the sentences and words, so that if anything anywhere occurs worthy of being added or removed, you may freely advise. With us, the firm decision stands, always saving the judgment of the Spirit of God. However, so that we may not be deceived by our own judgment, we submit these things of ours also to your judgment. And we know that you, for your utmost benevolence, will not fail us. Our hope will grow with your assistance. The love of Christ has united us thus far. Therefore, we wish that this friendship may not be temporary, but perpetual.</p>
