      <p>God's grace be with you. I thought this messenger Burkhart would leave early today; he has stayed until today. Meanwhile, Musculus' matter has been deliberated by us tonight; we have somewhat calmed the situation and agreed to his vocation, provided that he, like others, takes the oath and signs himself, also explaining in such a way that one can understand. You may inform him of this. Tomorrow I will bring it before the council; thereafter, he will be written to. However, it is intended that he does not come hastily, but rather delays, so that he is here on St. Matthias' Day, so that I can return from Lucerne beforehand; then I can give him better guidance. However, I will also write to him myself when a messenger is sent. With this, you are commended to God.</p>
      <p>Dated February 8th, at 9 o'clock in the evening.</p>
      <p>J[oannes] H[allerus].</p>
      <p>To the faithful servant of Jesus Christ, M. Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and godfather, preacher in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
