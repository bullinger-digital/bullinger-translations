      <p>I come to the case of Hieronymus. You will understand what has been decided in Geneva about him from the letters of Mr. Calvin. I beseech you, my father, to persuade yourself, which is very true, that nothing has been omitted by the Genevans to bring him back to the right path, and that he has fulfilled all the roles of a heretic. For when he was refuted by the most manifest passages of scripture, when he was caught up in his own responses, when he was most gently advised not to confirm by his obstinacy the very doctrine he verbally opposed, he finally added this, that your church's writing supports his cause. And yet there are those who say the man is not evil, and even commend him. Indeed, he is good who with the utmost impudence dared not only to utter the most pestilent blasphemies in the very assembly of the church before the pastors but also to defend them most stubbornly to this day. Unless perhaps these are not errors, to say that grace is offered equally to all, that all are called by God equally to salvation, and thus it is up to individuals to accept or reject the grace of God, whom God has foreseen and foreknown would accommodate themselves to this offered grace, those are called elect: for all things are present in His sight, and therefore God foresees future faith, in respect of which He chooses certain people, the same with unbelief, for which He reproves others. We were chosen because we were going to believe, not chosen so that we might believe. Faith will be the cause of election, not the effect. Otherwise, when it comes to the other part, it would also have to be said that unbelief is not the cause of reprobation but the effect, from which it would follow that God is the author of sin. God wills iniquity, in God there are contradictory wills. Oh, beautiful subtleties and subtle syllogisms! But I, on the contrary: You did not choose me, says Jesus, but I chose you. Faith is the gift of God. We must be drawn, regenerated, taught. Since these things happen only to a very few, who will deny that special grace is given to certain people? If this grace is special, tell me to whom it is special? To those elected by God before the foundation of the world was laid, from His good purpose, that they might be holy, not because they were going to be holy. Now if they are elected from eternity, no one, I think, except Hieronymus will affirm that some are reprobated from eternity. If faith follows election, unbelief must also be placed after reprobation. But I do not find this in the holy scriptures. Scripture says: He has mercy on whom he wills, and he hardens whom he wills. Nor does it say: He hardens him who does not believe (although this is also very true) but whom he wills, to show that the will of God is the highest degree. Furthermore, when Paul introduces the impious disputing against this doctrine with these words: Who resists His will? If their doctrine were true, Paul should have responded with Hieronymus. Indeed, it is blasphemy to say this is the will of God: for God wills all to be saved, it does not please God that anyone should perish. God indeed now wills you to perish, but because you did not want to believe when He offered you the grace of believing which you rejected, and He wanted to help your weak will. This Hieronymus would have said, an excellent patron of God's grace, and worthy of whose weakness we should bear with the utmost gentleness. But what about Paul, who was caught up to the third heaven? Does he deny this is the will of God, and indeed such that it cannot be resisted? Certainly, if these things were falsely said by the impious, he could not have borne it. Indeed, he confesses these things to be most true, and to once and for all dispel all objections of human ingenuity, he appeals to the secrets of God, and: you, man, he says, who are you, etc. This is the most absolute solution. For it is certain that the will of God is neither tyrannical nor unjust. Therefore, in these matters and most others, it suffices for me to know the what, not the why, for whoever labors over the why, he clearly seems to be fighting against God.</p>
      <p>Therefore, as far as salvation is concerned, I attribute everything to God. Regarding reprobation, I acknowledge not only God's foreknowledge but also His counsel and eternal decree in this part as well (for rejection cannot be established without reprobation), and yet I attribute all blame to man. If human ingenuity tries to bring anything against it, I do not listen, and I conclude once and for all: this is the will of God, this is the counsel of God, whose causes are indeed uncertain and unknown to me, but most certain and true to God, who does not will iniquity and is the most certain rule of all justice. I do not want to dispute against my potter, and I am not led to despair by this doctrine: indeed, I am strengthened against all kinds of temptations, when I understand that my salvation is not placed in me, but in the purpose of God, which is always one and the same. God has called me by His external and also internal word, as the spirit testifies to me which groans and sighs within me, to His God: His promises are sealed in me by the power of the spirit of my God. My ears have heard the word of God, my mind has received it and assented to it by the grace of God, my eyes have seen, my hands have touched the sacraments of God, by which the Holy Spirit of Christ has made me a participant through faith. These are the arguments of my election. Whoever has learned to argue otherwise, I let him dispute with God. This is, unless I am mistaken, the sobriety we ought to pursue: namely, not to shrink from this question, which the Holy Spirit explicitly explains in innumerable places, and which is the foundation of our salvation, but to handle it in such a way that we do not overstep the bounds of scripture, and subject the counsels of God to our understanding.</p>
      <p>But to what extent has this contention finally carried me? I beseech you, my father, to bear this as well. If I understand that these things do not please you in the future, I will seek another argument. If I have sinned in any way, I will try to amend it, admonished by you. But the indignity of this matter has so moved me that I could not contain myself. Believe me, my father, this evil is graver than you seem to believe, and I do not fear in vain that this spark may kindle a great and fierce fire in the church of God. May the Lord Jesus, our Savior, who will not allow any of His elect to perish, cause it to be extinguished shortly. As for Mr. Calvin, he is dealing with more monsters than you can suspect, and indeed, if those who complain that he is somewhat harsh were here, they would marvel that one man can suffice for so many troubles at once. As for me, I admire his modesty and patience rather than complain about his harshness. I say this because of rumors spread by some, who in this matter and many others portray Calvin as harsh and horrid.</p>
      <p>But how much injustice is done to that excellent man, only those who know him thoroughly understand. Certainly, it is so far (I testify this to you before the Lord, my father) from being able to be imputed to him, that on the contrary, he has been a singular example of modesty and decency in this cause, if you consider the monsters with which he had to contend. But virtue itself abundantly defends itself. Enough has been said about these things. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Lausanne, the day before the Ides of January.</p>
