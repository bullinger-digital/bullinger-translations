      <p>Greetings. I am not satisfied nor content with having sent you a little letter yesterday, unless I also add another today, which, to freely confess, no one else but that young man of great promise, Konrad, has extorted from me. And would that our cities and all Christian cities were abundant with such individuals! I hope that such people will be the pillars of the now-reviving church. O thrice and four times blessed are the cities that will produce young men in such a manner, who will have both the knowledge of good literature and piety combined. And for this reason, our city seems fortunate above others, where we hope to have born and nurtured, indeed to be born, those upon whom, as time progresses, the weight of both secular and divine matters will rest, and whose usefulness in handling and managing public affairs can be as great as possible. Moreover, the brevity of time did not allow him to be received by us here as kindly and lovingly as he deserved, since he was to depart the next day.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the epitome was sent through Franz. I believe it is not unclear to you what has been requested from you. The matter will undoubtedly be of concern to us.</p>
      <p>At present, nothing else remains but to wish and pray for the most successful progress of the gospel for you. May the Lord, whose business is at hand, stand by us so that at no time do we deviate from the path of His evangelical truth nor ever be drawn away from the true manner of preaching the word of God. Now, lest I be longer, I will bring this to a close.</p>
      <p>It will be your duty to impart many greetings to all those devoted to piety, especially Theodor, Pellican, Amian, Colin, and Leon. Farewell with your most praiseworthy family.</p>
      <p>February 18, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Ludwig Lopadius.</p>
      <p>To the esteemed Heinrich Bullinger, his greatest and singular friend.</p>
