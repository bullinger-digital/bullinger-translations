      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>The matter you wrote about in your last letter, honorable man, is going well. We are now expecting your presence, so that we and your companions may go with you to Basel. The council has decided that the chief city scribe, then Haab, Leo, and I will go. From Schaffhausen, Waldkirch, one of the tribunes, Benedikt, and Erasmus will depart. We are expecting you from St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>You perhaps know that the Bernese are hurrying to the aid of the Genevans. They indeed have a benevolent people. May the Lord grant victory to the best men fighting for the glory of His name and for pure faith!</p>
      <p>If you have any certain news from Schmalkalden, please let me know, I beseech you, and farewell.</p>
      <p>January 21, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Doctor Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord.</p>
