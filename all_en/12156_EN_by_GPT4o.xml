      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Mr. Gilbert, my guest, sends you this small gift, which I had to keep at my home for a few days due to a lack of messengers, and he asks that you receive it with a grateful heart; for he does not wish to compensate you for the efforts you made in instructing him and other Nicodemites on the opinion of the Lord's Supper. He says he has copied and learned the letter more than a hundred times. You will learn more from his letter. I wish Mr. Theodor had enough leisure to write extensively on his question. He is a good man and very supportive of the gospel of Christ.</p>
      <p>In Burgundy, he says everything is peaceful, but the people are suffering from a great scarcity of almost all things. Recently, he told me that he wants to visit the bishop, who has now been made a cardinal in favor of the emperor, and discuss various matters of evangelical doctrine with him; for he is said to be a learned and pious man who does not reject true doctrine.</p>
      <p>Theodor's book is not yet finished, but it will be completed tomorrow. Farewell. Saturday before Laetare 1545. Basel.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Sigismund Gelenius is the corrector at Froben, who carries this letter, an excellent and pious man, a vigorous defender of Christian doctrine, whom I commend to you.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother and lord. Zurich.</p>
