    <p xml:id="regest1">The pastors of Bern have agreed before the councils to the letter drafted at the [meeting from November 12-14] in Basel regarding the doctrine of the sacraments and have requested that the Zurichers be informed of Bern's position. Since Luther did not negotiate directly with the Swiss churches, Bern wishes for the letter to be sent to Capito and Bucer; if it does not succeed, they do not intend to pursue a concord further, but rather to publicly present their own doctrine in a writing. The envoys, who wish to speak to the French King [Francis I] on behalf of the [faith] refugees, are to present him with the [First Helvetic] Confession. A division between Constance and [the Swiss] on the issue of the Lord's Supper is to be avoided. Due to other matters, the issue could only be addressed now. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>What we think about the explanation of the sacrament recently written by you in Basel, we have today responded to our lords, that is, the senate and the people, namely that it can be safely accepted by us in all respects, and there is absolutely nothing in it that we would like to change. We have also requested that, whatever they respond to Basel, they should inform you in Zurich through a public message, so that, if possible, we may agree with a unanimous response. For this reason, the present messenger has been sent to you.</p>
      <p>The main point of what they write to Basel is this: It does not seem to us that this explanation should be offered to Luther, because so far there has been absolutely no negotiation with him, and he has not even deemed our Swiss churches worthy of a word, but everything has been attempted through Capito and Bucer as mediators, to whom they also think this form should be sent. If concord can be established and strengthened among us through this, it will be most welcome; but if not, they will not attempt anything further for establishing concord, but will rather entrust the matter to the highest God and will publicly present to the whole world in writing what they think about the sacraments and the ecclesiastical ministry. This, I say, is the response they are sending to Basel.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it seems worthwhile and necessary that the envoys to be sent to the King of France on behalf of the exiles be entrusted to offer our faith in the Latin confession composed in Basel in writing and to explain it verbally in person, so that he may at least hear what we believe, which otherwise he cannot because of the clerics (Kleriker) by whom he is constantly surrounded and accompanied.</p>
      <p>Finally, care should be taken that the people of Constance are not separated from us in the matter of the Eucharist. And for this reason, I hope our people will write diligently to Basel.</p>
      <p>These are the things I wanted to make known to you. Due to other matters, the present issue could not be addressed sooner.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 29, 1536.</p>
      <p>Greet Bibliander, Bellicanus, and all the brothers. All the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the lords Bullinger, Leo, the most pious and vigilant churchmen of Zurich, his dearest brothers. Zurich.</p>
