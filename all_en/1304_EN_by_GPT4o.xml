      <p>From Augsburg, it is written that it was hoped His Imperial Majesty would move; but His Majesty has not gone further than Munich, and on June 7th returned again to Augsburg, settled there in such a way that nothing more is heard at court about moving, nor can any account be made of it, etc. Therefore, I consider it completely insignificant that it is written by some that the Emperor wants to personally go to Magdeburg, as there are also more reasons that make this unlikely.</p>
      <p>However, it is quite likely to me that something is present through which Magdeburg might be relieved; for everything fits together well and seems alike. For someone first comes out, says openly, the Hanseatic cities do not take on mercenaries, likewise Denmark. This is then felt in Lüneburg and said by Saxony, it might also serve there as well as many other things, etc. So I know for certain from the mouth of a truthful, honest man, who was recently at Weimar with the sons of the imprisoned Elector, that the elder lord personally confided to him that it is present that Magdeburg will be relieved very soon; to which the current news now agrees. May the Lord God let everything turn out for good and His praise, amen!</p>
      <p>That there is still a real seriousness of the French with Parma, the merchants, who always ride out from Lyon, and a very fine man from Augsburg, who was with me four days ago, do not believe at all; they say the French have rejected all things to the Pope in France and ordered them to be pursued; likewise, it is his custom, whenever a real war is present, the French always go together with the commanders to Lyon; but there is nothing of the sort, nor any command from the king there, they know this thoroughly; therefore they think it is otherwise just a rumor now looking at one thing after another.</p>
      <p>So it is not likely to me what is said about the Turks and Vienna, as the merchants, who have their dealings there, know nothing of it; but it is not without reason that this clamor is made about Maximilian and similar deceptions. That the Emperor wants to give two-thirds of the costs, I do not believe for a long time, much less that Haideck accomplishes anything good in Saxony.</p>
      <p>Dear, let me know if there is anything to it: a trustworthy Ferdinandian has confided to me that the French are in great secret dealings with the Confederates, that they are binding to buy from them what they have in the mountains, Lucerne, Bellinzona, etc.; wanting to give them several hundred thousand crowns for it; but it is a great secret. Now this man knows much about the dealings of the French and the Confederates, although he is not a Confederate, but an Austrian; he also considers that the purchase should go through, etc.</p>
      <p>Someone here has let it be known that it will soon be heard that there will be great armament in the Netherlands; around Antwerp, many wagons are already ordered for the provisioning, ammunition, and military equipment to be transported. Around Lake Constance, they are recruiting for mercenaries. The one from Susenegg will send a regiment to Italy; the muster place is Füssen, and it is certain.</p>
