      <p>Greetings. Last week (reverend father in Christ), I did not write to you, nor did I return your letters, nor did I thank you for your service, which I should have done, because my colleague, Mr. Philipp, promised me that he would write and also act on my behalf. But later he told me that, due to some error, he found your letters, which he thought were enclosed with his, on the table. Now, therefore, I am returning them to you (reverend father) and I give you the greatest thanks, as I owe, for being so accommodating to us.</p>
      <p>Many prodigies are reported among us, about which, if I have any confirmed and verified information, I will diligently write to you. In Engadin, things seemed to be heading towards sedition, so our senate sent two of its members to act as mediators and arbiters. They returned to us on December 19 and reported some strange things received from reliable and trustworthy witnesses in Engadin, namely that at night, in certain places, terrifying sounds are heard, like those of avalanches (louwinen) crashing down from the mountains with great noise and force, but in the morning, not even a trace appears. In other places, the sounds of carriages and the creaking of wheels are similarly heard, as if a heap of wagons were traveling together, and some people ran ahead to see, but saw nothing. Moreover, there are those who claim to have seen three demons playing together on the roofs of some houses.</p>
      <p>I report all these things as I received them from the envoys; I can affirm nothing for certain; but those who came to us later from Engadin reported the same things to my colleague, Mr. Gallicius.</p>
      <p>Reading and inspecting your last letters was a great pleasure for me; for from them I perceived both your love for me and your singular wisdom. Certainly, our spirits have somewhat united.</p>
      <p>It is indeed true: at the beginning, I argued the Pontisella case more sharply because I realized that I would achieve nothing with modesty.</p>
      <p>However, as far as I know, I never behaved arrogantly or haughtily; yet I consistently defended a good cause. Now everything is going well between us.</p>
      <p>May God grant that our concord is for the benefit of the church, which is growing among us with not insignificant increases. Today, a large community in Pr√§ttigau requested through the consuls that I come with their will and permission and preach among them. The well-meaning ones intend to bring the whole valley to their side with God's help.</p>
      <p>This community, however, in which I am to preach, has so far been of the Catholic faith. In this matter, I will act with the council's approval and advice, etc.</p>
      <p>You desire to know news, of which there are none or few among us. However, I will add what I have, and at the same time, I will add the sources, so that you may more easily judge each matter. The war in Ferrara is said to be flaring up again.</p>
      <p>Duke Alba has been appointed commander of the imperial troops. The Venetians are also in arms; for they have sent (it is said) 6000 soldiers to aid Ferrara.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Ferrara remains within his fortifications; the return of the Duke of Ferrara's brother, who recently crossed into France, is awaited. He follows the French side and was recently inducted by the King of France into the Order of Saint Michael (for that, if I am not mistaken, is the royal order), and was also granted 5000 crowns annually. The son of the Duke of Nevers married the daughter of the Prince of Longueville; the daughter of the same Duke of Nevers is believed to be betrothed to a German prince, the son of John Frederick of Saxony, who was once captured.</p>
      <p>Likewise, it is rumored that the Duke of Lorraine married the daughter of the King of France. These things were reported to the envoy, as intimated by Aurelius N., who was once with you in Zurich, a Rhodian knight, who solemnly affirmed it to me; but he also narrated the same to the consuls in these words. - As for our soldiers in Picardy, it is very quiet.</p>
      <p>The imperialists claim they have been defeated again; the envoy denies it. Certainly, whatever the matter is, they seem to have suffered some disaster.</p>
      <p>For Duke Guise is said to have set out with a great military apparatus, with artillery and a considerable force of soldiers, to join the remaining troops in Picardy, and indeed very recently, about which the envoy was also informed. This matter raises my suspicion that either the French have struggled or suffered some disaster; yet I would rather learn the truth about it from you. The brother of the Duke of Ferrara is said to have been appointed governor of Tuscany by the king.</p>
      <p>The king is said to be sending new and temporary soldiers to Piedmont. I leave it to you to judge whether these things from the envoy are true.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father, and kindly consider these matters for the present, and continue to love and support us, as you have done so far. Our consuls, Mr. Philipp, and Pontisella send you and yours many greetings.</p>
      <p>From me, you will bid farewell to your wife, the most honorable matron, and all your family together with your sons-in-law, the most learned men. In the coming week, God willing, I will write to you and Mr. Gwalter in detail, and indeed at the consuls' command; now the matter was too lengthy to be conveniently included in this letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 27, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed patron and benefactor.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
