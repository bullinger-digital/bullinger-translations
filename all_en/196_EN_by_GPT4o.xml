      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful minister of the church in Geneva, his dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
      <p>Greetings. A few days ago, a certain French student coming from Geneva delivered your "Antidote" against the decrees of the Council of Trent. For this, I give you my greatest thanks. But since you promised those works which are published with you against the Libertines, and Commentaries on 2 Corinthians, and the epistles to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, I wonder whether you have forgotten these books, or if you gave them to this Frenchman who lost them on the way. I therefore beg you to send me those booklets of yours. I do not ask you to give them, for I am not so shameless as to request another favor after receiving one, but I will gladly pay the price. They are not available with us, nor is there anyone here who has seen them. If I could use someone else's help to acquire them, I would certainly not trouble you, who are otherwise very busy. I beseech you to consider my boldness kindly and to assist me in this matter.</p>
      <p>I hope Mr. Haller will use such moderation with the Bernese that the disturbances will beautifully subside. I also pray to the Lord to most generously pour the spirit into the heart of man, by whose inspiration he may do all things for the glory of Christ's name and the benefit of the churches.</p>
      <p>But what shall I say to you about the German churches? Most have perished, destroyed by the impious Interim of the Emperor. For the Emperor has concocted a most corrupt form of religion, in which he proposed to the states the observance of the mass, the intercession of saints, prayers and offerings for the dead, the use of images in churches, and finally the seven sacraments. He added the most severe threats.</p>
      <p>Thus, the cities especially have given way and accepted that most impious form. Augsburg accepted it on June 26. Musculus, therefore, deserted by the church, has come to us. All the neighboring cities have fallen. The best and most learned Brentius barely escaped the hands of the bloodthirsty wolf. Thanks be to the Lord who preserved him for us.</p>
      <p>Ulm, Nuremberg, Memmingen, Kempten, etc., have fallen. Strasbourg, Constance, and Lindau still stand. A few princes still stand firm. I understand that Philip has become more courageous and is now giving better and freer advice. I hear that Mr. Bucer is strongly opposing the Interim. Would that your spirit also be stirred to write an antidote against the Interim. If you lack an example, let me know, I will send it shortly. Indeed, it would be better for the learned to write against that abomination, so that trembling hearts may be strengthened again. Let us also pray to the Lord to raise up the fallen and to put a bridle in the mouth of that bloodthirsty beast, so that it may not progress wherever it pleases. The assembly ended at the end of June. The princes have departed. What the Emperor will do in Augsburg is unknown. Would that he does not descend upon Strasbourg. May the Lord have mercy on his most afflicted church. Farewell forever with Mr. Farel and all good people.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 14, 1548. The brothers greet you. H. B. yours.</p>
