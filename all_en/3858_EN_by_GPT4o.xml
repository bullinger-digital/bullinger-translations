      <p>S. P. It was most pleasing to me, most distinguished man, to have encountered this messenger from your area at this particular time, when the rumor of Dr. Philipp's arrival at this assembly was being spread more frequently.</p>
      <p>Although I greatly desired to see him, it seemed to me full of loss to spend hours without benefit in such distant regions. Therefore, we bear the absence of the man with a calm mind, and we are entirely consoled by the uninterrupted course of his life. The state of the assembly is such that after eight days, we think the Emperor will perform the funeral of his brother with solemn pomp.</p>
      <p>For that spectacle, in the place where Dr. Musculus once preached piously, Canopoea (?) draped in black over the palace walls from all sides presents a great sense of religion, which I wish would also bear fruit. After the funeral is completed, the causes of the imperial assembly will finally be proposed in the full assembly of princes, which perhaps will be of such a kind that the matter of religious concord will be postponed to another more convenient time, with decrees of aid against the Turks.</p>
      <p>There is as yet no prince in the city except for the envoys of almost each one, who, although not yet completely rejected, have found it somewhat indecorous that this first diet of this Emperor is attended almost without the arrival of any leaders. On Saturday, the Archbishop of Mainz is expected, and perhaps the Duke of Bavaria, but none of the nearby ones like the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg have yet arrived. I would indeed have responded to your letters, had not the adverse and uncertain health of my parent prevented him from requesting them, and had not our not insignificant occupations further taken away the opportunity to investigate. Farewell, most excellent man, and convey my most dutiful greetings to Dr. Gesner in my name.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, February 8, 1559, as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in mind and zeal, Raphael Sailer, jurist, by my own hand.</p>
