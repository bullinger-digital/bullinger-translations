      <p>Greetings. I received your most kind letter, most esteemed father, and indeed with great joy, as you have not yet tired of educating us on many matters, even though both your duties and age might justifiably deny you this task and responsibility. We all give thanks and earnestly pray to God that He may grant you the strength that can continue to be of benefit to us. There are certain things from Italy, but they are unpleasant to hear, as they reek of the unheard-of tyranny of the Pope, about which more later. For now, since my wife has given birth and given me a seventh child today, I can say no more. Therefore, you will forgive both my brevity and haste. The most honorable governor of this city has given me these letters pertaining to Basel, which, if you can send to Basel at your convenience and without trouble, would be most appreciated by both of us; quickly enough, if well enough; for they are laden with money.</p>
      <p>Mr. Campell sends his regards to your kindness, who has come here to assist his niece, the daughter of Mr. Philipp Gallicius, who wishes to separate from her husband due to his incorrigible, desperate, and long-lasting cruelty, etc. Also sending their regards to you are Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, Mr. Carolus, Mr. Bonettus, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, Mr. Balthasar Planta, brother of Mr. Rhaetian, a man very favorable to the gospel, and many others, whose names brevity and countless affairs have instructed me to omit. May God, my most esteemed lord, preserve you for us for a very long time and eternally. Amen.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly from Chur, February 6, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and in every way splendid in virtue and learning, the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Zurich church, my lord to be eternally esteemed.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
