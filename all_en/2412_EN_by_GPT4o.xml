      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote to you from Geneva, my father, and sent our little book to you, which I believe has been delivered to you. Nothing has happened here that I should write to you about, except perhaps this, which I think you have heard: the Duchess of Ferrara, having openly and steadfastly professed Christ, has been thrown into prison by her husband. This is a rare and remarkable example among all the noble ones living today, as I indeed think. Let us therefore pray to the Lord that He may complete what He has begun in her. Furthermore, the one who delivers this letter to you is truly one of ours, a man once powerful in family and wealth, now by the grace of God a faithful servant of God, whose piety and companionship I greatly delight in here. He will discuss with you certain matters, not at all trivial, but which greatly pertain to the glory of God. Therefore, I do not doubt that if you can promote them in any way, you will gladly do so, and I ask you again and again to do so. Regarding our affairs: all of ours are quite well by the grace of God. Our D. Viretus, when I was writing this, had set out for Geneva. Our Samuel, whom you recommended to me, is quite well. May the Lord grant me to be able to promote his studies, and to him, that he may not disappoint your and others' expectations. Farewell, my father, with your whole family. May the Lord Jesus protect and preserve you. I beseech you to greet D. Gwalter and the other brothers on my behalf and commend us to the prayers of your church. Again, farewell... October...</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of God, D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church and my most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
