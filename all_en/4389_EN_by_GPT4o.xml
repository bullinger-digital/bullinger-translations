      <p>To the most esteemed Lord Bullinger, his Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>It has been a long time since I last wrote to you, most esteemed lord, and indeed the reason is that about a month and a half ago, having set out from Chur with my entire family to Samaden and having stayed there for a few days, I finally went with my son Johann to the baths of Bormio for the sake of preserving, or rather even strengthening, our health; for neither of us was entirely well. But it turned out as we wished, by the grace of God; for we returned here safely from the baths just yesterday. To our most good and great God be praise and glory forever.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the reason I have been more silent for a long time is something for which I ask your forgiveness; for I was hiding in more remote places where I could not easily find couriers with whom I could send my letters to you, so I ask again and again that you have me excused. Furthermore, I have nothing new to write, except that it is reported that by order of the supreme pontiff (as they call him), the Duke of Paliano and two cardinals, one of whom was that Caraffa, have been beheaded; for what reason, it is not certain, but it is believed that this was done because of rebellion, of which they were accused.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the Bishop of Terracina has been thrown into prison. And these indeed are the news brought recently by some travelers who, coming from Rome, have set out this way towards Austria. I report the sources, so that if they have spoken falsely, you do not accuse me of vanity likewise.</p>
      <p>With us, all is peaceful, and that great scarcity, by which we were very sharply agitated for almost two whole years, is now beginning to somewhat decrease; may God prosper all things for good. I will remain here for about one or two more weeks, after which I will go to Chur, where, if there is anything new, I will inform you. The reason I am staying here longer is to escape the excessive heat of the air and meanwhile to protect my own and my household's health. My lord father wrote to me that Lord Marius Bisatz received from you on my behalf those 12 florins which you owed me, and, provided this was done without inconvenience to you, I am very pleased; but I truly fear that they may have dealt with you importunately, which I would not wish at all. I have received no letters from you in the past two months; however, I very much wish to hear how you are doing with all yours, and what the reverend elders Peter Martyr and Bernardino Ochino are doing; therefore, when the burden of business, with which you are continually overwhelmed, allows, I ask that you do not disdain to inform me of your and your friends' condition; I, in turn, when I have reached my province, will diligently visit you with my letters, which, although they may be very unrefined, as all my things are, yet you will consider them kindly due to your singular humanity. Farewell forever happily, most esteemed lord and patron, and I ask again and again that you commend me to your sons, as well as to your sons-in-law and all your friends, and especially to the venerable elders Lord Peter Martyr Vermigli and Lord Bernardino Ochino, whom I, along with the others who have deserved well of the Christian republic, uniquely observe and honor after you. Given at Samaden, August 12, 1560.</p>
      <p>The same as above, your most devoted Friedrich von Salis.</p>
