      <p>S. D. Your letters, brother in the Lord, most honorable and beloved, have greatly cheered me, announcing the very successful course of the gospel in England, although eight days ago the same was abundantly explained in written letters by the most distinguished man, Mr. Richard Cox, Chancellor of Oxford and formerly the king's tutor, now almoner, and Mr. Peter Martyr, whose copies I would have sent, had I not understood from yours that you were already well informed of everything. However, they did not mention anything about that serious and very useful matter. On the one hand, your letters have caused me great anxiety: for I clearly see the splendid benefit, but I very much doubt what can be obtained from our people in this most difficult time. All hope of entering into a treaty with this or any other prince has certainly perished: indeed, I fear that even the appearance or suspicion of such a treaty will disturb the remaining plans of friendship and agreement. You have indeed wisely and truly, as one very knowledgeable of the customs of our republic, conferred with that common friend and our brother Mr. a Lasco, and have explained the whole matter as it stands. What is more, the most serene king himself attempted something of this last year, and that through our common friend Mr. C. Mont, the secretary, whom he sent privately with royal letters to all the individual evangelical cities of Switzerland. But he obtained nothing worthy of his mission. And even then I was working with all the diligence I could to obtain something, especially in such a just and pious matter. I also see that now we are more hindered by the iniquity of the times than ever before. For the war of the pope and the French has severely divided and made discordant our neighboring Swiss. Hence our people, seeing the concord of our own more than ever before, cry out that the friendships of princes divide minds and the concord of the Swiss.</p>
      <p>However, you say, I am not now speaking of entering into a treaty, but of agreement in doctrine. I know. But I fear that our people will say that everything tends towards eventually forming a treaty. For this was pretended, when our Mont asked for nothing different from this. To this is added that few, or even 50 men, among them certain ones, can decide nothing. It is necessary to refer all such causes to the diacosios, which they call the greater council. But there is a remarkable diversity in this.</p>
      <p>No embassy is sent without its authority. All matters of religion are conducted before this. Now also, when some distinguished men are not at home or in the city, but are expected to return within a certain time, with whom it is especially necessary to confer these matters, I could write nothing certain with this messenger, as he left the day after he came here. However, you will not doubt my faith and diligence.</p>
      <p>I will take care that nothing is lost in such a great matter through my negligence or carelessness. When I have something certain, I will write to you promptly. I have understood well what term is set for the matters, October. I will join as a collaborator and partner in action our Gwalther, a fellow minister, brother, and dearest relative.</p>
      <p>The young man commended to me by you has found a host, a kind man, in the neighborhood. He will be allowed to associate with my sons: indeed, I will consider him as my own because of you. All of ours greet you and all of yours. You will greet all the brothers for us, especially Gallas. Rumor has brought here from Swabia that several cohorts led by Count Felix von Arch, sent by Ferdinand to Hungary, have been intercepted by Turkish horsemen and that a grave war is to be stirred up in various parts of Europe. May the Lord keep His church safe and us blameless until the day of the Lord Jesus. Let us pray diligently, my brother, to the Lord, that He may provide sound counsel and have mercy on us. The Magdeburgers still conduct themselves bravely. May the Lord preserve and help them. Farewell forever, most learned Calvin and my dearest brother. Zurich, June 23, 1551.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>Theodor singularly greets you, as does Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the Genevan church, his most honorable lord and far dearest brother.</p>
