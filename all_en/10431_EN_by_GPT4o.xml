      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I completed the task rather late, most illustrious Bullinger, due to the delay caused by that fisherman. For he barely came to me on the 10th day of this month, hindered by certain business. On the 11th day, we ascended the mountain, and first of all, I conferred with the bearded man about the business entrusted to me, namely whether he could certainly deliver into the hands of the Duke of Württemberg or ensure it is delivered, what you intend to send to him. To this, he briefly replied that he understood from your letters, which I had previously sent to him, that you would send nothing to the prince that would offend or oppose his mind. Moreover, he hopes that this will be pleasing and acceptable to the prince. He promised most willingly to do it and to ensure that he himself delivers it to the prince. For he hopes that the princes will soon come to the castle, unless they are hindered by great business. But if they happen to be hindered, he himself is already appointed as an envoy by the captains of the fortress to the prince's camp. Therefore, if you have anything, send it confidently. I will give it to him in hand, unless you prefer to send a messenger to Wolfgang, I will also take care of this, which is at your discretion.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we could not fish out any certain news, although on the day we were in the courtyard, three prominent knights came from the princes' camp. But because they headed directly to the fortress and did not linger in the courtyard, we received nothing except this one thing, that he found many great Hanses on the Asperg, among whom is Lord Wilhelm Truchsess's son. He is sought for a ransom of 20,000 guilders. Also, on Hohen Urach, he found a Spanish lord in chains and released him. He had spoken against the emperor and was therefore placed in that location. We expect news every day. If I have anything certain, I will send it. Many invent and lie, as we experience daily.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Hastily from Stein am Rhein, June 15.</p>
      <p>Georg Wimpfer, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang promises great hope from the prince regarding the reformation of the churches and the University of Tübingen.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed patron.</p>
