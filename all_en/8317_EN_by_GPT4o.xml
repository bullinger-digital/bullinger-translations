      <p> Greetings. Nothing was mentioned, most reverend father, in your last letters regarding my last ones, in which I had included two from others to you, and unless I am informed about them soon, I will fear that they have been lost due to the negligence of the merchant. However, we give you immense thanks for the French news and eagerly await the Polish ones soon. In return, it would be time and my duty to finally send you abundant news, but what can I do in such a time of lying and lack of truth, and add to that the nausea and difficulty of my illness? How can I be perceptive and curious in seeking out foreign matters, when I am so insufficient in healing the domestic affairs and the matters of our church and republic, that I have almost despaired in many things? The sacred hunger for gold and avarice reigns among the magnates so much that fornication, adultery, drunkenness, abuse of the divine name, and crimes of all kinds are considered of no importance. Hardly anyone cares for the poor, schools, and churches, except for a very few. Thus, most people have degenerated into a neglect of religion, so that they very rarely attend sacred assemblies and admire the papal asses too much. The window of wickedness is so wide open that some rascals do not hesitate to strike and wound the officers sent by the magistrate for retribution, nor is the magistrate of such authority that he dares to punish that cohort, which you might truly call Catilinarian and which is held on the charge of treason, with the dignity it deserves; but the penalty imposed is scarcely monetary and does not threaten their reputation or honors, let alone their bodies and lives. What hope is there in this so dissolute and desperate ruin of the republic and church? We cry out until we are hoarse; but no one hears us except God, no one, I say, applies our sermons, however fervent, to the correction of their lives. This is the only consolation, which is certainly usually quite miserable and small, that lifts our spirits, that the splendor of truth takes away all excuse from those impious ones and leaves a testimony of condemnation. May the Lord God, our most merciful Father, deign to so kindle His eternal light in our hearts, that we may not abuse it and be overwhelmed and perish again in papal darkness. While I was writing this, the son of the late Friedrich von Salis, who once enjoyed your company and who shines with excellent learning, piety, and prudence, approached me, honoring and still observing you as another parent. It grieves me greatly, and I know it will also be a source of sadness for you, that such a man has been taken from our republic and churches, whom certainly no sane person will deny to be incomparable. I know of no one who could be compared to him in eloquence in three languages at this time among us. However, there is not a small hope that the son will one day respond to the parent in all things; he is of such hope and expectation, indeed, and demonstration. Always in his bed, Friedrich remembered you and did not cease to bid you farewell and commend his son and our churches to you. - His son also reported from Italy that he had received this for certain: the King of Spain had recalled about 50 galleys, which he had sent to the Venetians for aid, due to the resurgent disturbances in Betica, and thus the Venetians were somewhat weakened and mocked by the Turks, who wander here and there, so that they might inflict some damage unexpectedly and from ambush. When I had finished this, my godfather Kobler arrived with your letters and news from Poland, which certainly raised and cheered my troubled and burdened spirit in many ways. I give immortal thanks to your paternity and incredible humanity and humbly ask that you patiently grant me a copy of that writing until next week; for your letters were returned to me so late that I had no opportunity to copy and share them with others; but I will certainly and truly return them soon. Unless it would cause you greater trouble, my most esteemed lord, it would be most pleasing to know where in the world my wife's sister, namely Katharina, might be, whether she is still in Debrecen; it would be necessary for us and others to know this because of the hundred gold coins left by will, which, unless I knew she was surviving, I would receive into my hands. I ask you to kindly inform me of this, whether you have heard anything about her since the unfortunate Raphael perished, and to whom and through whom I should write and send letters. More on this next time. I will also add this: our lords have designated the future day of James, on which both Froschauer and the bookseller from Memmingen will come here and settle their accounts with their books. The magistrate will summon the Memmingen bookseller with their letters; they have instructed me to inform Froschauer of this; but, if I can, I will give him personal letters. </p>
      <p> Farewell, best father, and please diligently take care of your health for the glory of the divine name and the salvation of the Christian churches. May our Erni be safe. </p>
      <p> Most swiftly, July 11, 1570. Your most devoted Tobias Egli. </p>
      <p> The consul, Pontisella, Carlius, Gantner, Bonettus, and the Salis family send their greetings to you. </p>
      <p> Our bishop is gouty and has been bedridden for a long time; he will not last long; he indulges himself so much. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent and distinguished man in all kinds of piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church in Zurich, his singular lord, to be eternally honored with respect. </p>
