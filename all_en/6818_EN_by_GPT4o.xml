      <p>People are gradually departing from the Reichstag again, although it has not yet reached its conclusion. Two points have been resolved: 1. It is not considered good and advisable by both parties at this time to proceed with the colloquy until a better opportunity arises; 2. In the meantime, the Passau Treaty shall remain in effect, and each party shall leave the other unburdened.</p>
      <p>The old Duke Heinrich of Brunswick has reconciled with his young son, who was still remaining and had been disowned by him because he adhered to Lutheranism, and the old man is remarkably reconciled. When he passes away, there will be no more secular prince in those lands. However, there is extreme hostility towards the Zwinglians.</p>
      <p>I have credibly heard from a distinguished gentleman that the former Emperor Charles confessed on his deathbed that he deeply regretted having caused so much harm to the pious Germans in their religion, as he had found the truth among them; he also received the sacrament in both kinds, which greatly displeased the Bishop of Toledo. The current Emperor has dismissed several from his court because they attended the evangelical sermon against his majesty's prohibition. In particular, he removed a very fine young Duke of Legnica from the court because he did not remove his hat for Corpus Christi when the idol was carried past his lodging. No secular prince, except for the one from Bavaria, participated in the Corpus Christi procession, but his imperial majesty did, along with many priests, abbots, and bishops.</p>
