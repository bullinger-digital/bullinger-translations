      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. You reprimand me for my negligence and you are right; the burden of age and my negligence are guilty and worthy of punishment. I have received three letters one after the other. I will not delay any longer, so that I do not fail to respond. I thank you for your earnest diligence, which you share with us. There is nothing new with us that is worth writing about. From Italy and the emperor's misfortune, I hear from someone from Valtellina who spoke with us, that the emperor has suffered a loss, greater and surpassing all that he has suffered so far. Some say, out of 14 galleys, 10 were sunk and 4 captured, including Antonius de Auria; others say, out of 10 galleys, 7 were sunk and three remained; nevertheless, he has suffered a loss. When I learn more, I will certainly send it to you. Pontresina has surrendered, but remains with us.</p>
      <p>May God be with you; greet all the beloved brothers for us. Heim, Tscharner, Philipp, Travers, and Pontresina send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>From Chur, 6th day of September 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my dear and good friend.</p>
