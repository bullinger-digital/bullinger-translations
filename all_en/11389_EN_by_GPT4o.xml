    <p xml:id="regest1">The only book he is currently working on, alongside his many obligations, is the one about marriage; he is writing it for German speakers, and it may be translated for speakers of other languages if necessary. He does not address divorce, but rather discusses the origin, nature, conditions, and value of marriage, the untenability of priestly celibacy, choosing a spouse, weddings, the consummation of marriage, love and constancy in marriage, as well as child-rearing. Erasmus, Vives, and others have written about this in Latin, but there is little useful material available in German; his book will contain no polemics. He is surprised that Vadian has neither reported on his work about the old foundations and monasteries in Germany and on [Pomponius] Mela nor shared any news, even though he is now free from his concerns with the Appenzellers [in the Pannerhandel]. Greetings from [Diethelm] Röist, [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, and the brethren.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. At present, I have nothing to write except that I am proceeding with our little book on the institution of marriage, as much as public and private affairs allow. I see that I and my abilities are unequal to such a great and abundant matter. Nevertheless, I will share what the Lord has given with others, who, inspired by my example, will soon produce more fortunate and complete works. I will write in German for the Germans. If the work seems worthy and should be shared with other nations, there are many learned men who can translate it. I am so distracted by affairs and so hindered by the weakness of my mind and body that I cannot do what I would otherwise like; and perhaps it is well and rightly so with me, lest I be too officious. I will not write anything about divorce and its causes at present. For this book will grow more than I wish. However, I discuss the origin and institution of marriage; hence what marriage is; what is required for the constitution of a just marriage; what the causes of marriage are, what the effects; how praiseworthy marriages are, how vile and foul fornication and adultery are; how the pope has forbidden marriage to ministers of the church by no divine or human law. Again, I dispute about choosing a spouse, about holy weddings to be celebrated rightly, about the first living together of spouses, about conjugal love; how friendship and harmony can be preserved and increased among spouses; what the duties of spouses are concerning the education of children, etc. For I am striving to prepare the institution of marriage for our Germans, Erasmus, Vives, and other learned men have written in Latin; few things have been published in German that will be very useful to us. Perhaps mine will not be very beneficial either. As for the rest: I want you to be assured; I will not slander anyone, nor will I touch anyone's name either openly or covertly. For I wish to build, not to destroy. However, I see that the church of Christ is not very much built with biting papers. But where are your books on the ancient colleges and monasteries of Germany? Where are the commentaries on Mela? How is it that you write nothing to me about new things, when everything is full of marvelous rumors? You are freed from your friends in Appenzell; you have no excuse; therefore, be diligent in writing. Röist and Lavater, and the brethren also, wish you well. Farewell, remember me; for I love you sincerely and from the heart, most esteemed man. Zürich, January 2, 1540. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed and dearest lord.</p>
