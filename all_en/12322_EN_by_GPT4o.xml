    <p xml:id="regest1">Erb's letter [above No. 2213] did not upset Bullinger at all; rather, he acknowledges Erb's intense efforts for the well-being of the church. Indeed, the [Augsburgers] felt great regret. However, they liked Erb's reasoning so much that they are even more interested in Erb! They do not wish for Erb to come to them to the detriment of his church [in Riquewihr]. If Erb should have another opportunity, he should inform Bullinger, for Bullinger does not overestimate him, especially since Erb possesses the faithfulness of a servant required by the Apostle [Paul] in abundance. - A few weeks ago, Erb's [dedication letter to the Latin special edition of Bullinger's "Resurrectio"] was printed, but Bullinger has not been able to send [copies of it] to Erb due to a lack of messengers. Bullinger included [Erb's booklet] with his preface to his commentary on Mark, and he plans to soon add his preface to the commentary on John about the justification of the Christian man. - What does Erb think about the Brunswick (and hopefully not German) war? It does not seem too dangerous if only [Henry of Brunswick] leads it against the [Protestants]; however, Bullinger fears that [Emperor Charles V] is behind it. So if that arsonist [Henry of Brunswick] has had luck on his side and defeated large troops with a small army, all the pious will understand that this happens by the just counsel of God to rebuke the injustice, ingratitude, cunning, and unbelief of the [Protestants]. If [indeed] a powerful prince has allied with the wicked scoundrel [Henry of Brunswick], it is because God wants to awaken the [Protestants] from their carelessness. Meanwhile, all the pious pray: "Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven" [Mt 6:10], and knowing that a victory [of the Catholics] brings infinite evil, they continue to pray: "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen" [Mt 6:13]. - Recommendations and good wishes for Nikolaus König, the scribe [Oswald Fürstenlob], and Gerold Meyer [von Knonau the Younger]. Erb should write again when he has time.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. After reading your letter, most learned and dearest brother, I could not be angry with you at all. For I see that in all things you aim for the glory of the eternal God and the growth and safety of His church. Continue to direct all your words, studies, and deeds towards these goals! Meanwhile, the senators of that renowned city were very grieved, although they were not displeased with your reasoning to such an extent that they have become more and more captivated by a desire for you. However, they do not wish for you to come to them to the detriment of the church over which you preside. They would indeed receive you most gladly if it could be done without harm to that church. Therefore, if ever such an opportunity is presented to you, let me know. I do not attribute too much to you. The Apostle requires above all in a minister that he be faithful; since I know that this virtue has been abundantly granted to you, why should I not commend the gifts of God in you? Pray that you may use them well for the glory of His name and the salvation of the church.</p>
      <p>Your booklet was printed a few weeks ago, but the lack of messengers has prevented me from sending it. I have added to your (your booklet) my preface to Mark on the priest and king of Christ. I will soon add the preface to John on the justification of the Christian man. I believe it will bring some benefit to many.</p>
      <p>What do you think about the war that has begun (hopefully in Brunswick, not in Germany!)? It does not seem too dangerous if only he wages war against our people. I fear, however, that he who is thought to be the father of the country is lurking here. If that arsonist has had fortune on his side and with a small army has defeated large forces, all the pious will understand that this happens by the just judgment of God. For our iniquity, ingratitude, malice, and impiety are astonishing. If some powerful prince has joined with that wicked scoundrel, it is certain that the most just God wishes to shake us from our sloth. Meanwhile, all the pious turn to the Lord, with whom alone is joy, security, life, and tranquility. They know that His judgments are just and fair; they pray, therefore: "Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." They see that the abuse of victory, besides the elation of spirit, brings forth great and infinite evils; they pray, therefore: "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen." Farewell along with all good people, especially with Nikolaus König, and write back whenever you have time. May the scribe and our boy Gerold Meyer also fare well. Zürich, October 30, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Matthias Erb, preacher of Christ in Riquewihr, always to be honored and loved as a friend and brother.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr.</p>
