    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian's illness has saddened him; Oswald Myconius and Simon Grynaeus also regretted that he had to miss their meeting. He sends copies of the explanation [of the Wittenberg Concord] delivered by Capito and Bucer from Basel, as well as the final document of the two-day talks in Zurich, which he also presented to the two councils. In their response, the latter refrain from commenting on the Concord and also do not approve of its explanation for the time being, as it seems acceptable but may not correspond to Luther's opinion; a decision is to be reserved for a joint meeting, which is why Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, and Bern are to be informed first. Bullinger welcomes the publication of Vadian's ["Aphorisms"], inquires about news of the war in France and Belgium, and requests a detailed answer to a question about the nature of the body of Christ.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letter has been delivered to me, most illustrious man, which I certainly received with the greatest expectation, as all your things are by far the dearest to me. One thing greatly troubled me, which was to hear that your health is in jeopardy. May the Lord grant that you are soon restored to strength by the Lord. When your letters were delivered to me, Master Oswald Myconius and Simon Grynaeus, the ornament of the churches, arrived at the same time. They were deeply grieved on your behalf and that you could not attend the meeting.</p>
      <p>But what was done among us, briefly, take this. We conferred with the most eloquent and pious men with the greatest humanity, and that for two days. They read to us the explanation of the people of Strasbourg, Capito and Bucer, which I send here copied by the hands of Myconius. What offended us in it, we objected to. Finally, we agreed on this opinion, which I also send here written. Moreover, when I had fully explained to the senate and the deacons what we had done and in what we had agreed, and at the same time had presented the document, of which we said we would now send a copy, in which the sum of matters was contained, they responded in almost this opinion:</p>
      <p>The articles set up at Wittenberg remain as they are, my lords say; they do not want them otherwise. 2. As for the explanation by Doctor Capito and Bucer, they have no particular complaint, although they do not accept it so plainly. They are concerned, however, that Doctor Martin Luther might perhaps not recognize the understanding. If one were to accept it now as it is, it would lead to ridicule and disgrace. Therefore, my lords do not want to give any answer without the other cities. They want to write the opinion, as it has reached us, to Schaffhausen and St. Gallen. Then they, the people of Basel, can go to Bern and negotiate there as we did here in Zurich. If the opinions could then be brought together, it might lead to a day on which we would commonly negotiate with each other. And we, the preachers, should not sign, but we should give them the writing, which is set up and handed over to the council, so that they can show it in Bern, etc. So much for these matters.</p>
      <p>Do not be anxious about your book. For if this is the mind of Luther, which the people of Strasbourg say it is, your work will establish concord. If it is not, it is better for the truth to come to light.</p>
      <p>If you have anything about the war in France and Belgium, write, I beg you, and farewell.</p>
      <p>August 16, 1536.</p>
      <p>Please respond diligently to this question, if you have time, and in detail; you will do something useful and most pleasing to me: whether the body of Christ, due to its inseparable union with the word, takes on conditions alien to the body.</p>
