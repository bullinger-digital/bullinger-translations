      <p>Greetings. When I recently sealed my letter to you, most reverend father, and our merchants had already departed after receiving them, behold, at that very hour, but as they say, after the feast, the letters of Mr. Lentulus were delivered, followed by others a few days later, which I now send to you together and at the same time inform you that our Kobler, the bearer of these letters, will be heading to Basel; if you wish to entrust him with anything that should be properly taken care of, you may do so. When the elected and appointed syndics of the Three Leagues were here these days, to once again demand an oath from the communities and confirm the laws of the fatherland and the ancient ones, as well as the friendship with the king and the trade of pensions, a certain Clavenna, a great patron of the monks, intervened, who, along with other popular leaders, also thought that supplicatory prayers for the introduction of foreign monks should be brought to the communities with the same effort. This was worked on at the past fairs and was largely granted to them, so that they attempted to address this cause, which had been prohibited so many times by the lords' decisions and decrees.</p>
      <p>But the good men were so advised by us that, having understood the deceit and danger, they completely removed this request of the monks from themselves. If only that impious decree, by which the truth is forbidden to us, could be removed with the same success! If a few good men had not been vigilant at the past fairs, when the Pagans were present, and had not been more present than the others, that same cursed chapter would have been included in the letters and decisions that the Swiss took with them, from which those who are from Paganism would have had ample material for boasting and triumphing over us. The envoy now aims solely to ensure that his benefits can be given and received by the king's friends with impunity.</p>
      <p>They are considering introducing impunity and the license of more corrupt gifts, which not a few Swiss cantons have had for a long time with great damage.</p>
      <p>They intend to ensure that those who are bound by such pensions are nevertheless recognized as good and honest men, who are elevated to public offices. Hence, if a military campaign were to be made in the blood of the faithful, we would not be allowed to object. For these good men must be considered honest, whose efforts achieve the royal endeavors. We would not even be allowed to mutter against such plagues. The pastor of Scuol from the Upper League, a eloquent and honest man, recently, for some reason, called the King of the French a robber from the pulpit. This wound immediately reached the ears of the envoy, who sent his interpreter to me, asking that I admonish this brother not to erupt into such invective further, but to speak of such a great prince with greater reverence and honor. Thus, the accomplices or advisors of this most brutal robbery do not blush to close our mouths, lest we call a spade a spade. I greatly fear that the bow, which they are drawing more than enough at the instigation of others, will break sooner and more dangerously than expected. They do not want to be content with the return of the former state and abuses; but they seek greater things and aim for anarchy in such trade.</p>
      <p>I send this to you as quickly as possible, whom Mr. Consul, Mr. Campell, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Charles, and Victor, along with all the others, greet most amicably. 1573. Chur, October 19.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most revered in singular observance, the most illustrious Antistes of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
