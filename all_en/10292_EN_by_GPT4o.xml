    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for sending Bullinger's commentary on the Acts of the Apostles and his work "On the Shameless Outrage of the Anabaptists". A used copy of Oecolampadius's commentary on the Gospel of John was mistakenly sent to Bullinger. News about negotiations of the Five Places and Freiburg with the Pope, the Emperor, and the Duke of Milan. Greetings to the Zurich brethren in office.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I give you the greatest thanks I owe for your writings on the Acts, as well as for the book against the Anabaptists. They are pleasing, as they most strongly breathe what they are, divine doctrine, from which anyone who wishes to have a tranquil conscience can happily draw what satisfies. I wish for the time to be given when I may be able to return the due favors. The annotations on John, which you received, I had not prepared for you - for I have used them until now - but new ones, not yet folded. While I had entrusted these to a boy as I was going into the consistory, he imprudently took others. This should be excused, so you do not think me negligent in returning favors, if it can be called a return.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I hear that again, I do not know by what counsel, these Cantons are plotting something with the Pope, the Emperor, the Duke of Milan, and some other duke. If I were to find out these things are true, there is something I would do. If you know anything, let me know. Furthermore, Satan has his ministers everywhere, who sow evil seeds in the field of God, as you also recently indicated. I hope, however, that the time will come when the children of God will be freed, so they are not forced to suffer any evil from the impious. But if it seems otherwise to God, it is certain that nothing harmful will befall the souls. We must pray to God, that he may grant us to say from the heart and by the guidance of his spirit: "Thy will be done!" [Mt 6, 10].</p>
      <p>Farewell, and use the grace given to you. I wish Utinger, Pellican, Theodor, and all to be well.</p>
      <p>Basel, 19th of September, in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious chief guardian of the divine word in Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed brother and lord.</p>
