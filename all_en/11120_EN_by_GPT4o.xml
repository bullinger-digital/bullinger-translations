    <p xml:id="regest1">Connects the outrageous assault [by Wilhelm Arsent and his associates] with the pension system and regrets that this evil could not be eradicated during the First Kappel War; although the crime must be avenged, taking action against the [Front Austrian] instigators could weaken the Emperor [Charles V] and thus benefit the French King [Francis I] and the pension lords. Does not want to comment on the merits of Bucer and Osiander regarding the Swiss churches and calls for adherence to the [First Helvetic] Confession as long as it is not refuted. Regrets what happened to Grynäus.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I grieve, my Myconius, and am deeply indignant about the miserable news of the cruel robbery and more than monstrous betrayal. This is what we owe to our pensioners and pensions. If, for this reason, a war is to come and something unexpected misfortune befalls our army, to whom, I ask, shall we attribute it? To the pensions and pensioners! Oh, that the cities with Zürich had been more resolute in the first Kappel campaign, so that we could have eradicated the devilish mischief back then! Meanwhile, the best men were killed at those same Kappel. I do not know what is now being prepared for certain good men. If this cruel injustice remains unavenged, it will be the end of Helvetia, and the name of our country will be despised by all nations. Even Basel, the most illustrious of cities, will be spoken of poorly by everyone. Very few students from distant regions will come to you. This injustice will also affect the progress of studies. Certainly, the devil was evil and cunning, whoever orchestrated this tragedy. Until now, we have avoided French gold, French wars, and French arts. What if we now become French of our own accord? For if Hohenkünigspurg is to be attacked, if arms are to be brought against the guardians and receivers of the robbers in Emmendingen, we will wage wars like the French. For the more the Emperor's forces are weakened, the more it benefits the French, and how could one serve the French more loyally than by attacking the Emperor here, falling into Burgundy, Sundgau, Breisgau, etc.? He will not refuse, I certainly know, the stipends? Thus, he will accomplish his purpose. Thus, the pensioners can be restored to their former place. Thus, the cities will be bound to the French again. Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to be present with His church in such great dangers. The robbery must be avenged. If it remains unavenged, the Lord will avenge it; but in such a way that it will not be pleasant for us. If we decide to avenge it, French aid and gold will certainly be forced upon us. What then? We will be miserable. Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to be with us, so that we can both avenge the evil and remain in freedom and be freed from the arts of kings.</p>
      <p>As for what you write about Bucer and Osiander, I now leave it aside. I do not pronounce who of them has benefited or harmed the Swiss church more. I love both, I hate neither. We have the confession; in this, I pray, let us persevere until those come who refute it as erroneous.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with my Grynaeus, whose situation I grieve from the heart. May the Lord grant that we always feel heavenly consolation.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 3, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant Antistes of Basel, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
