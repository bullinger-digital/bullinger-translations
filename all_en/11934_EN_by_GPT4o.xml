    <p xml:id="regest1">Shares the concerns expressed by Bullinger in his letter regarding the troubles that the church is already facing, as foretold by [the prophet] Daniel for the end times. Did not want to bother [the people of Zurich] with letters, but will write more often at Bullinger's request, especially during the Frankfurt fairs, and feels connected with them in faith. Bullinger's recommendation benefited [the two students from Hesse]; [Johannes Pincier] became [Deacon] in Wetter, and [Wigand Happel] also has prospects for a position. Pistorius, unaffected by the senseless [religious discussions] of the Pope's followers and the princes, can devote himself to building the church. Greetings; [Theodor] Bibliander should put his talent in the service of the church.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, our Father, through the Lord Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, most learned and dearest Bullinger, in the month of December, in which I see that you, like many other good men who love the republic and the church, are deeply troubled in spirit by these public dissensions and warlike tumults, and you think much about the church's hardships and the disturbance of discipline and studies, and not without reason; for not only the Holy Scriptures but also all creatures testify that the times are present and the last and most perilous, in which shortly before the resurrection, Daniel foretold great hardships for the church, warning us to be strengthened in spirit, lest we fall away from God, broken either by the cruelty of the wicked or by the examples and judgments of hypocrites. Therefore, you wisely and piously advise that we strengthen those entrusted to our faith, so that they do not fall back from the truth once received, overwhelmed by the storms of persecution, since it is necessary to enter the kingdom of heaven through many hardships and tribulations, which we earnestly pray for with our prayers and supplications for the whole church. We acknowledge by divine goodness the hardships of the church, and for the glory of God and our own salvation and public necessity, we more earnestly apply ourselves to the preaching of the gospel, invoking God with all our heart, that He may preserve, defend, and increase His church for Christ's sake.</p>
      <p>As for why I have written to you less frequently, I testify before God, it was for no other reason than that I did not wish to burden or hinder you, occupied with more serious and better matters, with my unlearned notes. But now, provoked by you, since you again encourage me to write (for I consider it against humanity to offer no sign of gratitude), I have decided, whenever possible through convenient messengers, especially at the Frankfurt fairs, to send letters to you. I confess that correspondence with brothers through letters has much utility. However, knowing that my household is lacking in both letters and gifts, I am not accustomed to interrupting men endowed with exceptional and outstanding gifts, whose gifts I embrace and admire, and in sentiment, will, and confession, I join with them, if indeed they invoke God with true knowledge of Christ and faith and flee from idols.</p>
      <p>Your recommendation has greatly benefited the young men; for one has been appointed to the church in Wetter, and the other, should he seek a position, would not lack assistance.</p>
      <p>Our affairs are in a moderate state; for, free from the foolish reconciliation of religion, with which we have been perpetually vexed in the diets to no avail, we serve our churches at home and strive to propagate the glory of God through Christ in these matters, secure in whatever the pontiffs with the princes may decide about religion, knowing that the Son of God, whom we invoke, is always present with His church, whom we firmly believe we will have as a defender in all dangers.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest and most highly revered Bullinger, together with all the fellow ministers, and encourage Bibliander to bring forth the entrusted talent and to employ it for the benefit of the church. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>From Frankfurt, 7th of April, in the year of our Lord 1544. Johannes Pistorius Niddanus, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, endowed with outstanding learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, his most esteemed lord, etc.</p>
