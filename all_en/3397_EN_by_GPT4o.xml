      <p>To Palatine of Vilnius.</p>
      <p>Most illustrious prince, most gracious lord. We congratulate the noble men, especially your piety and indeed the entire homeland, I mean the most fortunate kingdom of Poland, for finally, after the most difficult journeys, after enduring many and very hard labors, you have received back into your homeland the man distinguished by piety and learning, Mr. Jan ≈Åaski (Johannes a Lasco).</p>
      <p>This man is a great ornament to the entire homeland. All pious and learned men throughout the entire Christian world know him, among whom he also holds great authority. For they know that twenty years ago, having left behind the most ample resources and the greatest honors and dignities for the sake of the gospel of God, he followed Christ in poverty and in his exile conducted himself by the grace of God in such a way that not even his enemies could find anything to blame in him. His learning is solid, his piety and religion are most sincere, and his experience in many matters is varied, manifold, and unique. The churches of Friesland, England, and Germany testify that they have received significant benefits from him. Indeed, it seems that divine goodness has prepared this man through various trials and tribulations for the greatest tasks and for reforming the most extensive churches of the kingdom of Poland. Therefore, all learned and good men everywhere consider you fortunate if you recognize this remarkable gift of God and use this unique instrument of God to legitimately and sincerely reform the sacred churches of Poland. From this will arise the tranquility and happiness of the kingdom and the most ample reward from God.</p>
      <p>In this one man, you have what you would scarcely achieve otherwise, even if you were to summon learned men from various places, with no need for the trouble and expenses, since one seems to suffice for many, and from one you may hear what you would perhaps scarcely hear from many with such sincerity and grace, namely, the unique truth of the unique scripture. We would have gladly suggested this to the most serene royal majesty, to whom we wish all happiness from the heart, if we did not hope that you would continually inspire these and other salutary things in his mind. May the Lord, who prepares and directs the hearts of princes, also guide the hearts of all the nobles of the most extensive Polish kingdom, so that they may diligently and steadfastly desire and accomplish those things which are for the glory of God and contribute to the preservation of the kingdom's safety. All the ministers of this church, Mr. Gwalther, Wolphius, Bibliander, Martyr, Lavater, Haller, Wickius, Zwingli, Simler, Mr. Gessner, Frisius, and all the others, greet your piety and commend themselves to the most serene royal majesty and to you. May the Lord bless you and your entire household.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 6, 1557.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, etc.</p>
