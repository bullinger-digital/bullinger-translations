    <p xml:id="regest1">Has spoken with the [Basel] Mayor Theodor Brand about [Leonhard] Hospinian's legal proceedings [see above No. 2009], and the result is that Hospinian should return [to Basel] immediately, as some councilors have long been appointed to settle the dispute and to call [the accuser] Franz Konrad [Schmid, known as Gl√º(n)er] to order. The court date had to be postponed twice already due to [Hospinian's] absence; a prerogative of the [Zurich] council, which reinforces the request of the brothers and relatives, could be of great benefit to [Hospinian]; however, the mayor [Theodor Brand, below No. 2013] writes better about this. Bullinger does not need to apologize for his letter [to Amerbach, above No. 2009]. Greetings, also to [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have discussed the matter of Hospinian, most honorable Bullinger, with the very wise Lord Theodor Brand, our mayor, and after reading your letters and having many words exchanged back and forth, we finally agreed that it would be most advisable for him to return here as soon as possible. For several members of the senatorial order have long been appointed to settle the disputes, with explicit instructions to bring Franz Konrad to order if he thinks he can do whatever he pleases. Indeed, they have already been forced to postpone the court date twice due to his absence. Therefore, if he is recommended by the prerogative of your most honorable council to our petition of his brothers and relatives, we are convinced that such a recommendation would be of great use and assistance to him. However, it is better to consult about these matters.</p>
      <p>As for the fact, most kind Bullinger, that you so greatly apologize or excuse this necessity of writing, I ask you to take it in good part! As if I should not love you very much, for you have not disdained to send me letters in the name of a mutual friend. Certainly, nothing could have happened more pleasingly to them, responding most beautifully to the most sacred function you preside over, for which I give you immortal thanks, and I ask you to consider me among those who, to put it briefly, highly value your learning, praise your kindness, and are greatly delighted by your very elegant and loving letters. Farewell, most learned man.</p>
      <p>On the third day before the Ides of October, in the year 1544, Basel. Give my best regards to our dear Pellikan and all good people in my name.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Bonifacius Amerbach, Jurist.</p>
