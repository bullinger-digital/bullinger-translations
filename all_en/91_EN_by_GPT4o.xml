  <summary>
    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer already reported in the letter delivered by [Georg or Hans Konrad] Escher [vom Luchs] [18073 from April 10, 1548] about [the financial situation of] Claude d'Aliod. Hopefully, Bullinger will advocate for him! D'Aliod fears that his creditors will simply take away his goods stored in Zurich, [now confiscated], due to his ban from staying there [through a forced auction]. These include, among other things, medical books he received in Augsburg, as well as documents related to his accounting. Bullinger should protect him (also considering Zurich's good reputation) from such treatment!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[When Bullinger reads this letter,] D'Aliod has already set off towards Winterthur, where he also has a part of his goods. He will have the present letter delivered to Bullinger and wait for his communication on whether he may go to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Bullinger will certainly be able to obtain permission for him to enter Zurich. He has already achieved so much for the people of Konstanz! D'Aliod ultimately just wants to pay off his creditors and redeem his [confiscated] goods. Blarer has sympathy for him due to d'Aliod's [religious] zeal, but he will drive out the [antitrinitarian] heresy from him as soon as he returns to Konstanz. Once again, Bullinger is asked to protect d'Aliod from [another] financial loss: He has already lost trade goods in strange ways several times.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">D'Aliod could have received a letter of recommendation addressed to the Zurich council from the people of Konstanz, but Blarer's brother Thomas and his cousin Konrad Zwick considered the letter addressed to Bullinger from last Tuesday [April 10, 18073] to be sufficient. However, if necessary, D'Aliod can also receive a recommendation from the Konstanz council. It is important that he is granted an extension for debt repayment and is not disadvantaged.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Blarer will be able to continue the present letter [later], especially since the servant [N.N.] of Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz [will only] depart for the Confederation tomorrow or the day after [on April 14 or 15, 1548].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[P.S.:] D'Aliod reports [just now] that he is also owed money in Zurich. Bullinger should assist him in this matter. His creditors could also be referred to the debtors [N.N] to settle d'Aliod's debts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Blarer is reluctant to bother Bullinger with this, as he surely has better things to do. But he knows no one else in Zurich to whom he could turn [regarding d'Aliod]. In the future, he would like to try not to trouble Bullinger anymore.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Bullinger could also have an assistant find out which trade goods d'Aliod still possesses in Zurich, how much he owes his creditors, and how much is owed to him. Bullinger should then inform how large the difference between debts and assets is, and how to proceed if it is only 4 or 5 guilders, so that d'Aliod is not forced to sell his goods in Zurich at a much too low price. As soon as Bullinger has communicated the amount of this sum, Blarer will immediately send him the money.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">He did not advance any money to d'Aliod because he feared that he might lose or squander it instead of redeeming his property. Moreover, he is now going to Frauenfeld to his extravagant wife [N.N.], who is completely unsuitable for good housekeeping.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">Blarer would also like to know the reason for d'Aliod's ban from staying in Zurich.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother, I have written to you through Escher regarding Claudius. I hope you will be a good mediator so that he does not lose his modest possessions. He is very worried because he has been banned from the city, and his creditors might seize his goods, etc., and cause him harm. He has some medical writings that were shared with him in Augsburg, as well as accounting books or records. I kindly ask you to protect him so that nothing unfair is done to him, and he is not overcharged, as this would also serve to the praise and honor of your city.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>He has moved to Winterthur. There he also has a part of his goods. He said he would send you this letter to Zurich and await your decision there on whether he may enter your city or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>But I am of the unwavering confidence that you have achieved so much on our behalf that he may enter, as he only desires to settle accounts and satisfy the people, and thus take his modest possessions into his own hands. He has greatly moved me, as I know there is a great zeal in him. I will (God willing) soon eradicate the error from him when he returns. I ask you again and again: Do as you have done so far, so that the poor man is not troubled. For he has often been treated strangely and has been greatly delayed and hindered from his trade.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>He could have taken a letter of recommendation from my lords to your lords, but my brother and cousin thought it sufficient if I wrote to you on our behalf, as I did last Tuesday through Escher. However, if it becomes necessary, he must and will still obtain the recommendation from my lords, only that his deadline is extended and he is not shortened. Dated April 13, 1548.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Marcell's servant will, I think, go there tomorrow (I will write to you further) or the day after tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Claudius claims that he is also owed money by you in Zurich. For God's sake (and to our friendly satisfaction), please assist so that he is paid, and one debt is offset against the other, or a debt is pushed onto the other, or however the matter may be resolved.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I am very reluctant to burden you with these trivial matters, as you have much better things to do with your time. But I know no one else there to whom I could entrust this. I will, however, greatly improve and not trouble you with such things anymore.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>You could perhaps ask a good fellow to help you, to find out what Claudius has and how much he owes to each, and what is owed to him. If it comes to a small amount, where Claudius could not pay without detriment to his goods (unless he wanted to give them away for a pittance), and it is about 4 or 5 guilders, it is easy to handle. I will send it back to you by the first messenger as soon as you inform me of the amount.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I did not give him any money now; I was concerned he might lose it or squander it otherwise and not free his goods. His wife is in Frauenfeld (where he is now going). She is very extravagant, unwilling to manage properly, and does not bring her poverty to good use.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I would also like to know why Claudius was particularly banned from the city and land.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, Christian lord Heinrich Bullinger, my especially trusted, dear lord and brother. Zurich.</p>
