      <p>On December 14, 1565, Mr. Theodorus Beza, preacher in Geneva, wrote to the servants of the church in Zurich, stating that the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Elector, had sent several articles to the learned in France, also to them in Geneva, and probably also to some in Zurich, indicating that an imperial diet was to be held in Augsburg in January, set by the emperor, where, among other articles, it would be discussed how to address matters of faith and how to eliminate sects and divisions in religion. Therefore, it is important to consider these matters carefully to prevent bad advice and the suppression or obscuring of the truth, etc.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, they deliberated on this and could not find it good to send envoys to Augsburg on that day; however, they thought it best to help the matter by issuing a confession of doctrine and faith in Latin and German, as it is currently preached and practiced in France, in the Confederation, and in Savoy, as well as in Geneva. They should also request Emperor Maximilian to convene an assembly to discuss religion, where persons would be appointed to lead the discussion and to determine how the discussion should be conducted, etc. For when some writings are seen, many will be moved to agree less to condemn the Count Palatine and our churches as heretical or to understand them as such. The servants of the church in Zurich responded on December 27, stating that they were pleased with Geneva's carefulness to maintain unity and the progress of Christian doctrine, and they were ready to apply their possible diligence to this end. They hoped that if they did not accept all of Geneva's advice, it would be taken in good part, as they did not object to issuing a common confession and brief summary of doctrine and faith. However, they could not, for many legitimate reasons, propose anything to Maximilian or offer him a meeting and discussion. A general preface could be made in this or a similar form: Since our doctrine and faith are criticized and rejected by many out of ignorance, as they do not rightly understand our doctrine, we are moved to present the simple truth without shame and lengthy circumstances, in the hope that when it is seen that we hold, teach, and believe nothing unchristian or contrary to the first holy Christian church, we will be at peace with all those who hold and teach the same. Since many confessions have already been issued, it seemed good to us to take one of the old ones, as in the second part of the response we gave to the late Dr. Luther twenty years ago. However, what concerns Luther's person should be omitted, and if anything is sharp, and the writing should be set in the most friendly manner and serve unity. To facilitate this, it might be helpful if someone from Zurich and Mr. Beza from Geneva came to Mr. Haller in Bern and agreed on how to present the writing uniformly, etc. However, in all this, nothing should be issued without the prior knowledge and consent of the Count Palatine, who should be informed if it serves his interest. Also, the matter should not be rushed, but one should first see if the diet will take place and how things will develop. Since Bullinger has already expressed his opinion on the Count Palatine's articles and sent them to the Count Palatine, as well as to Geneva. Above all, nothing should be handled or decided here without the prior knowledge, advice, help, and good consent of the authorities, to whom all this business should be reported. Also, consideration should be given to how other churches - Glarus, Basel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, Mulhouse, Biel, Chur, along with the BÃ¼ndner churches - can be brought into this union; not to create a union that would lead to discord and offense, etc. In response to some of the servants of the church in Zurich, Mr. Beza wrote to Bern and requested that they summon us from Zurich to them in Bern without any delay. For their superiors in Geneva thought it good that such a meeting should proceed without delay, etc. However, the preachers in Bern informed their lords and superiors of some opinions of the Genevans on January 10. But some of them thought that too much haste was being made with the matter; they should wait until the Count Palatine writes again and it is known whether the diet will take place. Some thought that if a meeting were to be held, the Basel preachers should also be sent. And if that happened, it was already known that it would lead to confusion. On the other hand, it was suggested that there was no other way than to take up the confession of faith again, which was established in Basel in 1536 and accepted by all evangelical cities, including Basel. The Baselers could not oppose it. If there was anything too brief or obscure in it, it could be better explained and improved. However, the majority thought it best to avoid further discord and the outcry that would be heard if the learned came together, that they wanted to make something new and change the faith, etc., that no one should come together, but that they should understand each other through letters and writings to make a unanimous confession, and if they were of one mind, further deliberation would be held on how to proceed further. In the meantime, it would also be seen how things would develop and what should be done, etc.</p>
      <p>Some opinions of their lords and superiors were brought to Zurich by Mr. Johannes Haller through a special messenger, and a decision was requested. The servants of the church in Zurich reported this to their lords, the mayors, etc., who, after deliberation, gave this response on January 16:</p>
      <p>Since the Count Palatine has proposed several articles and has been answered in Zurich, and the response has also been sent to him, they should await his response or what he will write further. However, since those in Geneva have not yet completed their response, they may complete it further. My lords think that in this serious matter, there should be no haste, as it is not yet known whether the diet will take place or not and how things will develop. And even if it does take place, the proceedings will be drawn out. In particular, our lords do not think it good at all to issue any writing before the diet. Since the learned of our opponents are so recognized and embittered, it can be expected that they will quickly write against it and take occasion from what we intend to do well to make things worse. They think it even less good for the learned to be summoned to a certain place and time, because of the various outcries and offensive speeches, and because those not summoned might complain and cause unrest, and if they are summoned, much quarreling and little or almost nothing would be accomplished, and discord would not be removed but increased, as can unfortunately be seen in several examples. It can be arranged without a meeting or assembly to achieve what is important in this matter, namely that the servants of the three churches handle it among themselves through writings and unite in a unanimous confession, so that when the need arises now or later, they are prepared. However, it should not be issued without the prior knowledge and advice of the authorities. And that everything in this matter should be handled with caution, etc.</p>
