    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Johannes Blasius, Johannes Travers, Luzi Heim, Johannes Comander, and other lovers of the truth thank Bullinger for his caring letter [not received] and hereby return the proposition of Emperor Charles V. The delegates of the Grisons and Confederates have returned from Italy. At the market they visited, it was initially reported that [between Pope Paul III and the Emperor in the affair of Piacenza] a truce had been concluded, but soon after it was said that it had been broken again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Warnings [about a possible military attack by the Imperial forces on the Confederation] are coming in from everywhere, including in the letter addressed to the councilors of Chur from the Three Cantons Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden. Blasius would report more about this if he did not believe that the Zurich councilors had already heard about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] His son Paul, who has been hosted by Otto Werdmüller for a year and a half on Bullinger's recommendation, has asked his father to find him another accommodation for the coming winter. The reason is not that he is dissatisfied with Werdmüller. On the contrary. The agreed rent was also always paid on time. However, his son is freezing in the room he occupies, and he cannot work in the living room because of the lively children. Therefore, Blasius has asked Gotthard [Richmut?] for accommodation for his son, who has promised it if his wife [...] gives her consent. Bullinger should put in a good word for it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blasius' wife [...] sends Anna Adlischwyler and her children two wooden vessels with Regelbirnen as a gift.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Mayor Heim sends greetings to Bullinger and Mayor Johannes Haab, with the request to continue sharing important matters.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius sends greetings to his dear Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>We all, Travers, Consul Heim, Comander, and other lovers of divine truth, thank you, dear brother, for your faithful and diligent writing to the highest degree and hereby send you back the imperial proposition. Our servant, along with the Confederates, has returned from Italy. They report that a truce was made, but it is now being said in this market that it has been broken again, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Otherwise, regarding the letter to our lords from the Three Cantons Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden, we have nothing else here but that many warnings are coming from all places, the content of which I would have also written to you (assuming you had already written to your lords about it, etc.).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Further, regarding my son Paul, who has been honorably and well hosted by Master Otto Werdmüller for a year and a half through your recommendation (and I am well satisfied with him, having also paid the agreed rent on time), he has now asked me to find him another accommodation for the coming winter, not for any other reason than that he is cold in the room where he studies and wants to be away from the lively children in the living room. I have therefore asked our Gotthard, who has promised it to me, as long as his wife does not object, and it is my request that you also speak favorably about it, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>My wife sends your wife and her children two quartons of Regelbirnen with a sincere request to accept them kindly from us.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Our Mayor Heim sends you and your Mayor Haab cordial greetings, with the request that you continue to share with us what is necessary to know in these significant events, etc.</p>
      <p>In Chur, on the 21st day of November, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>The same, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, brother and most esteemed lord.</p>
