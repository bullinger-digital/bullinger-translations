    <p xml:id="regest1">The times are deplorable, above all it must be feared that the French gold might also tempt the Reformers back to the old mercenary system. Haller is relieved that the Zurich delegates to the Diet have subsequently returned the French gold coins, which were apparently mistakenly accepted in Baden. What the French and the papal legate achieved at the meeting in Lucerne, Haller does not know and asks for information. He copies Bullinger's scholia on the Gospels, wants to return them as soon as possible, and thanks him for them. He would also like to read Bullinger's cited writings "De propheta" and "De praedestinatione." He hopes for Bullinger's visit. He asks for the transmission of a letter addressed to Jakob Otter to Ambrosius Blarer. The bearer of the letter can report on the Bernese shooting festival. Bullinger's commentary on the Acts of the Apostles is eagerly awaited.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Our times are always more dangerous, dearest Heinrich, than I could have ever believed. There is much hypocrisy among those who boast of being evangelicals. They are attentive to rumors of wars. They seem to have open hands for French gold, although none of them dares to openly reveal their intentions. Nevertheless, I fear that while the French gather their soldiers in other parts of Switzerland, ours cannot be restrained by any prohibitions. I have warned in sermons, placed before their eyes the damages suffered so far from pensions and French wars, as much as I could, but I fear that greed may overcome the majority of both the magistrates and the common people. Therefore, I ask you, through Christ whom we share, to advise me on what should be done in this matter. I do not doubt that the same is being attempted among the people of Zurich. Your delegates were criticized for accepting some crowns at the Baden assembly. But all offense was repaired when we heard they were returned.</p>
      <p>I cannot learn anything about what the French and the Verulanus attempted in Lucerne, not even a word, and our people also take great care that we, the ministers of the word, do not learn anything about foreign affairs or plans. For they know that what they attempt can easily be overturned when discussed in sermons. If you have anything, you can safely share it with me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I not only read your delightful scholia on the Gospels but also copied whatever seemed necessary. Now the task is to return the book to you whole and unharmed. If I do not find someone to return it at the Zurzach fair, I will ensure it is returned to you by my own messenger. For I know you do not wish to be without it for long, nor perhaps can you be, and I consider it a great seal of your utmost love for me that you entrusted such a treasure to me, who am so far from you. You sometimes mention a booklet on the prophet, on predestination, which you have collected. I wish I could see those too.</p>
      <p>I await you anxiously, my Heinrich, and as nothing could be more pleasing to me at this time than your visit, do not cease to hasten it. Otherwise, we are all well. In the meantime, we wish you well.</p>
      <p>I would like you to send the letters attached here to Ambrosius Blarer in Constance as soon as you can. He will ensure they are delivered to our Otter in Esslingen. I could not write to either Otter or Blarer. It will be enough for you to recommend the matter to Blarer with a single word.</p>
      <p>What happened at our shooting festival, I do not know; the bearer of this letter, if you wish, can tell you. If he had not had to carry his guns and shooting equipment, I would have entrusted the book to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, and always write.</p>
      <p>We are waiting for the Acts, although I see many are pained that all your works are so pleasing to the readers.</p>
      <p>August 9, 1533.</p>
      <p>Yours always, B. Haller.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his beloved brother.</p>
