      <p>G[od] w[ith] u[s]. Dearly beloved son, after I wrote the previous letter last night, I went this morning to Sir Hans Conrad Escher, as I promised my salt master.</p>
      <p>There I found this answer: it would not be at all difficult to come to Berg and to advise and help.</p>
      <p>However, since it is now a matter of importance, when they are alone together and the mother does not hear for herself and see all things for herself, they kindly request that he make a trip here, so that he can hear and see everything for himself and handle the matter in an orderly manner, as necessary.</p>
      <p>He will be at home for the next 14 days (otherwise it is not known now), after which he has several court sessions to hold in the Lucerne area and elsewhere until Christmas due to his office, and he would be very pleased if he could come, that he would let him know a few days in advance. Otherwise, he has already recruited Heinrich, my godson, to Winterthur to scribe Hegner, to whom he intends to introduce him to the scribe's office; he is still waiting for a response from Winterthur.</p>
      <p>I have let you know some of this, so that you can inform my kind salt master and greet him faithfully and thank him for his good company.</p>
      <p>As I promised him, I have arranged it without any delay. God be with you all.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger etc.</p>
