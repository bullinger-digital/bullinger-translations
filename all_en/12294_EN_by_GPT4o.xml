      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have received the most generous gift, indeed, most excellent man, two cheeses, I say, from your beloved son, for which I give the greatest thanks. If I can express my gratitude towards you in any way, I will do so with the utmost willingness. Now your son will dine with me, then I will send him to Basel, well-instructed with letters. I have dear friends in Basel who will undoubtedly take diligent care of your son, and I will act faithfully here, as if it were my own sonâ€™s matter. If he sends any letters to me from Basel, I will ensure that you receive them as soon as possible. In other matters, I commend myself to you; overwhelmed by the burden of affairs, I can do no more. I send here as a token of gratitude my commentaries on the Gospel according to Mark; I pray that you accept this small gift with a benevolent spirit from one most devoted to your name. Nothing solid was achieved at the Diet of Worms. The Emperor deceives the Protestants with vain hope; they sense his deceit. If the Emperor had the opportunity and strength, he would settle the dissension by force of arms; but Christ prevails among his own. Farewell in Christ. Zurich, 18th of September. Mr. Megander has passed away; the pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Buchter has been appointed in his place. 1545. Best wishes to all the Travers family, especially to Anton, and to the other brothers, ministers of the church of Chur.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Mr. Johannes Travers of Zutz, a foremost man among the Rhaetians, his most esteemed friend. Zutz.</p>
