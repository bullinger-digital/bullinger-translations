      <p>S. D. What my spirit foresaw and many predicted has finally happened, that I was chosen for the apostolate of the churches of the Saane region; this was decided on December 27th. Today I am leaving here; you will pray to the Lord for me, that He may grant ample growth to my labors.</p>
      <p>This calling is burdensome to me; but I cannot resist the Lord who calls, and I have conceived a good hope that all will proceed rightly.</p>
      <p>Viretus will reform the other part of this new jurisdiction, which uses the French language; thus we will be united there in the same ministry.</p>
      <p>Regarding your letters, which you recently sent, I have nothing to respond except to thank you both for the diligence with which you share the writings of friends with us, and for the Epistles of Obscure Men sent to us. I gladly return the letters to you.</p>
      <p>As for your relative, I have recommended him to friends who can assist and promote him in his journey. Nikolaus zur Kinden promised me his help, although he fears the same as I do.</p>
      <p>It would seem expedient for him to come here himself, so that his person, talent, and knowledge can be observed and then promoted all the more conveniently; for without seeing him, it is difficult to entrust him with any position. Therefore, do what seems best to you. I do not know how long I will be absent. I have three parishes to reform and establish; the people are stiff-necked and most licentious; it has been a cesspool of all pimps, prostitutes, murderers, etc., so that in cleansing this Augean stable, I need more than Herculean strength; unless the Lord provides it, I will accomplish nothing. I ask you, however, to write to me nonetheless; letters can be sent to me almost every day; I will also write in return about what is happening with us. Farewell and consider kindly these my words, which I write just as I am about to leave. I have joined Musculus by affinity; he greets you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 2nd. My people and I wish you and all yours a good, prosperous year.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed and dear lord and compatriot. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
