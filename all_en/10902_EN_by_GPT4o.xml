    <p xml:id="regest1">Limits itself to the statement that the Wittenberg [Concord], unlike the [First Helvetic] Confession, is incomprehensible to him, and confidentially announces the publication of a book [Vadian's "Aphorisms"] on the controversial question [of the Lord's Supper]; Grynäus will report further. While disputes continue in the rural areas [due to mercenary service], Zürich maintains its clear stance towards [King Francis I] and Emperor [Charles V]. Writes on new Zürich paper. Hopes for a visit from Myconius and Grynäus.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You are surely expecting, my esteemed Myconius, a lengthy letter, and behold, I send a brief one. I do not understand what was written in Wittenberg. However, I understand what we wrote in Basel. No one will pull me away from them. You have my heartfelt opinion. You will soon see a book that will explain this matter comprehensively, learnedly, simply, purely, and clearly. You will say that books written so far with the utmost piety and erudition cannot be compared to this one. However, we attempt nothing against the confession written in Basel, nothing against the established concord. I entrust this to you alone. Grynaeus will report more.</p>
      <p>I wish you to remain well in the Lord for a long time.</p>
      <p>The peasants are very much of one mind, all because of the lords. I continually pray with the prophet: Scatter the people who desire war. Our people are always the same. They harden their ears to both the requests of the French and the Emperor.</p>
      <p>July 15, 1536.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>This is our new Zürich paper, but still of the coarse kind.</p>
      <p>If only we could persuade you and Mr. Grynaeus to come to Zürich once for the sake of comfort!</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, dearest brother. From Basel.</p>
