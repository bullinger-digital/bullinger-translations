      <p> S. I received your letters, most esteemed lord, and I give you my greatest thanks. I know that we have nothing certain, except that it is written to me from Innsbruck and affirmed by Mr. Vogler that a Jesuit of great renown, a court preacher, has been converted to the truth by the learned reading of your Apocalypse and now openly and publicly declaims against idolatry, neither fearing dangers nor future plots; yet, so that he is not removed from the office and duty of public preaching, he still proceeds cautiously; the Spanish Inquisition is also secretly exercised and confirmed in those places; Maximilian, the archduke, has also been urged by letters not to change anything in religion; he himself is displeased, etc. - It is said that the greatest burdens of papal money have been brought to our legate, but have been carried away elsewhere from the fortress. - It is also written from Innsbruck that the royal army has been destroyed by the Huguenots. So much for this. I could barely steal away these few things; so many things trouble me. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most excellent and most merciful man and father. May the Lord always keep you. </p>
      <p> Quickly from our court, December 7, 1568. Your most devoted Tobias Egli. </p>
      <p> All of ours greet you. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord. </p>
      <p> Zurich, at the pastor of the Great Minster. </p>
