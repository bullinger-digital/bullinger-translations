      <p>Most humane Bullinger.</p>
      <p>When I returned from Venice, where I had gone to retrieve my belongings, however small, I recently received your most delightful letters from my wife, which I was eagerly expecting. Believe me, with these, you have refreshed my spirit.</p>
      <p>If I am replying later than you expected, it is not my fault, but due to my absence.</p>
      <p>I give immortal thanks to God and the Father, that everything concerning me there is quite right and quite fortunate, and I did not think it would turn out otherwise, relying first on your modesty and kindness, then on the testimony of my conscience, which I knew for certain was regarded by God in such a way that it could not be endangered.</p>
      <p>As for the matter that seems to have been taken up and acted upon too harshly by me in your view, it did not happen because I wanted to acknowledge a private insult; for in this regard, I was from the beginning most ready in spirit even towards those who had afflicted me so harshly. The cause was the public one of Christ himself for the sake of the gospel. If I had conceded this due to other faults, as you had written, would I not have committed the greatest insult to the Holy Spirit, who had spoken in me, and cast away God's grace from myself? Moreover, since you affirmed that these things were not being spread by trivial men, I was forced to use more serious arguments to refute their stubbornness. I was also deceived because I thought these things were being spread publicly; it was necessary for my defense to stand out among all and be such that it could not be refuted; for I never persuaded myself to suspect such things about you, nor would I have acknowledged even the slightest response.</p>
      <p>But whatever it was, I am of a good and most peaceful mind even towards those who have uttered these things, and I pray to the Lord not to impute this harm to them, but to grant them a more placable and healthier mind, so that they may learn to speak and think more rightly about others as about themselves. Therefore, I am far more satisfied than I had hoped, and I congratulate myself and give you eternal thanks, that all things have been settled by your prudence and authority. If I have erred in any way in this matter, forgive, I beg, my weakness, I willingly acknowledge that I am a man, not a god, who has forgiven me far graver things in Christ, and at the same time, I know I will endure harsher things for his sake. For these are certain preludes by which God himself exercises my weakness until he does not fear to bring me into the field. You, however, strengthen it before God with your most ardent prayers and ask the brothers to do the same.</p>
      <p>The struggle is great and by no means suited to my strength. As for your writing to England on my behalf, I thank your humanity so vehemently, who never rests concerning me, wherever you can serve my interests. I know your most pious and most dutiful spirit towards all, but especially your most loving spirit towards me. In the meantime, I will await the Lord's good pleasure; he himself knows what is needed for me and his church. The news you mentioned, which pertains to the increase of religion, was most pleasing to me, and I ask you to do the same, since I am in hiding, where everything is conveyed very slowly. I will diligently take care of the book you requested.</p>
      <p>As I have often written, I am in the midst of Babylon, but innocent of its blasphemies, and I seem to be with those fathers under tents, not without danger, but under God's protection.</p>
      <p>My wife is hastening childbirth, and my flock will be increased by God's grace. I wish, if it is convenient for you, that you would commend my poverty to the Duchess of Ferrara, since I am not able to bear the burden of the family in these places, especially where the expenses of childbirth, you know how burdensome they are, have increased. Your recommendation will greatly assist me with her.</p>
      <p>The new Pope here seems to be very friendly with the Emperor and very fond of the Emperor's supporters.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Florence is intimate with him; see, I beg, how great are the allurements of that great harlot, she draws after her as many lovers as she wishes.</p>
      <p>Alas, we have lost whatever hope we had conceived of him; princes are vain, and cursed is everyone who trusts in them.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has ratified the plan offered to him by the Pope and has decreed that it will be celebrated in Trent, but first, he will hold a diet in Augsburg, so that all of Germany may be compelled to assent to the Council of Trent; it is scheduled for June 8.</p>
      <p>The Turk is again enlisting forces, having been provoked once more by the King of Persia. The Frenchman, because he was deceived in the election of this Pope, seems to be fostering enmity against the Roman See. Would that it might be so, and for this reason and for the peace made with the English, he might defect from the Antichrist; but we will await the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ to redeem us from the hand of the wicked. Farewell most happily together with your church, which I greet again and again in my name, especially Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalther, and the other ministers and your family. All the pious who love me greet you. Again, farewell and love me. From my hiding place, April 25, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted, B[althasar] A[lterius]. To the most honorable Lord Heinrich Bullinger, adorned with integrity, doctrine, and piety, minister of Zürich, always to be revered as lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To Zürich.</p>
