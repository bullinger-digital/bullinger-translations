      <p>Greetings. Forgive me, I ask, reverend father in Christ, that perhaps I write to you more often and more familiarly and that I burden you, occupied with greater cares and business, with my foolish letters; I beg you to attribute this to my utmost respect and affection for you, which keep me constantly concerned and at least stimulate me to write something. But if only it were possible to write more joyful things about the most serious and excessively prolonged persecutions of the church in our time. Indeed, the rumor of peace is frequently spread, but it is very uncertain and inconsistent, with the papists thus mocking the evangelicals. Many return from the Swiss camps because they can hardly bear the scarcity of almost all things in their camps; no wages are paid to the soldiers, and the captains barely count 2 testones for the armed soldier.</p>
