    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer gratefully received Bullinger's letter [not received] with the copy of the writing from Emperor Charles V to the Confederates [dated July 28]. It is clear how cautiously the latter is formulated. It also shows that the old statutes are still considered valid, which Bullinger will have noticed as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer does not wish to elaborate further on the [politics pursued by Konstanz] at this time, although there would be a good response to everything. Perhaps he will comment on it another time. May God turn the omissions of both sides [of the people of Konstanz and the Confederates] to good!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blarer sent Bullinger a letter [No. 2987 dated August 12] through Hieronymus Hürus.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] There is nothing special to report. The Emperor does not show himself. The Diet is supposed to begin on September 1. From Augsburg, it is learned that the Emperor has given a county to Count of Büren, Maximilian of Egmont. However, Blarer does not know whether it is the county of Christoph of Oldenburg or that of Albrecht VII of Mansfeld. But when von Büren wanted to take possession of this land, he is said to have been attacked and captured.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The foreign troops stationed in Biberach, comprising up to 1200 men and 100 riders, consume more than necessary, and the population suffers greatly from it. May the almighty God come to the aid of the poor and distressed people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Peter Buffler, who does business in Austria and Hungary, wrote to Blarer that one can trade there completely unburdened and need not fear Sultan Suleiman.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] It is reported from various sides that King Henry II and the Emperor are not hostile to each other, although neither quite trusts the other. Allegedly, France plans to attack England, and the Emperor is said to be mustering forces against Naples.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] People pray incessantly to God to graciously grant us his peace, so that we can overcome this wicked world. Bullinger should pray for the people of Konstanz, who are in the greatest danger and in a hopeless situation, so that they do not let the current threatening situation depress them. May the Lord deliver them as quickly as possible!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings to Bullinger's family and to all pastors and friends. The Zurich church prays for the people of Konstanz, so that they may feel the help of the heavenly Father. Blarer's wife [Katharina, née Ryff], his brother Thomas, and Konrad Zwick also send their regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] [P.S.] Bullinger should solemnly admonish the young man who is currently embarking on a journey [...] to lead a good life, as Blarer no longer found the time to do so.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother. I have received your letter. I thank you very much for the copy of the imperial writing to the Confederates. It is evident from it how cautiously it is formulated, and it shows that the old statutes are still considered valid, which you yourself will have noticed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the other matter, I cannot elaborate further at this time; otherwise, everything would have its good response. Now is not the time. Perhaps another time. May God arrange what has been omitted to be beneficial and good for both parties!</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have also written you a letter through our Hieronymus Hürus.</p>

      <p>We have no special news. The Emperor is not showing himself. The Diet is supposed to begin on September 1. It is also written from Augsburg that he is said to have given a county to the Count of Büren; I do not know if it belonged to those of Oldenburg or Mansfeld. But when he wanted to take possession of it, he is said to have been attacked and captured.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The troops stationed in Biberach are behaving very badly. There are up to 1200 men and 100 horses, all foreign. They consume more than necessary, so that people are very burdened by them. May the strong God come to the aid of the poor and distressed on all sides.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Buffler, who has his business in Austria and Hungary, writes to me that it is completely safe to trade and travel there, and that there is no need to fear the Turk there.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It is written from several places that the Emperor and the French are not supposed to be at odds, although neither trusts the other. But France is said to be planning something against England, and the Emperor is said to be gathering troops in Naples.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>We pray incessantly to the Lord to graciously grant us his peace, so that we can steadfastly overcome all the evils of this world. Ah, pray diligently for our people, so that they do not stumble more severely amidst so many present dangers! We are entangled in great difficulties, truly between a rock and a hard place, as they say. May the Lord deliver us with his mighty hand as soon as possible!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>May your household be well in the Lord with all brothers and friends. May your entire church pray for ours, so that we may feel the help of the heavenly Father more effectively. Again and again, greetings and farewell. My wife, brother, and cousin greet you. August 22, 1547. Yours, A. Bl.</p>

      <p>I commend this young man to you diligently, so that you may exhort him, as he departs, to lead a good life. I was prevented by lack of time from doing this myself. Therefore, fulfill this on my behalf, I beseech you through Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
