    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's letter pleased him; it is not right for both of them to apologize for writing infrequently, as true friends are not deterred by such things. The outcome of the Imperial Diet is in God's hands, but it also depends on taking the justified admonitions of the opponents seriously and addressing those deficiencies that contradict the Protestants' appeal to God's word. Regarding the proposition presented by Emperor Charles V on April 5, which announced negotiations on the religious pacification of Germany and aid against the Turks, only the Protestant estates have taken a position so far; it is expected that the Emperor will appoint a committee rather than approve the continuation of the Worms discussions as desired by the Protestants. Secular reasons suggest a peaceful agreement to the Emperor: his brother King Ferdinand's war in Hungary and the Turkish threat, the fluctuating health of the Emperor and his son Philip, the situation in Italy and the Netherlands, the relationship with the French King Francis I, and the weakness of the papal loyalist party in Germany; Pope Paul III is attempting to thwart this intention, and it is said that his legate Gasparo Contarini is influencing the Dukes of Bavaria, the Archbishop of Mainz, and Duke Henry of Brunswick in this regard. While the majority of the estates seem ready for an agreement in accordance with God's word, the Emperor is also under opposing influences; what is decisive is which tendency prevails, and it is now up to the Protestants not to compromise the cause of Christ. Rudolf Gwalther will likely have sent a list of the present princes and theologians. Tomorrow, Margrave Joachim II of Brandenburg is expected; Philip of Hesse is in the Emperor's favor and has brought four theologians with him, including Frecht's compatriot Dionysius Melander. Greetings, especially from Bucer and Calvin; Bullinger is to convey greetings to Grynaeus and Vadian.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, esteemed brother Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I received your letter dated March 4th here on March 14th, and it was all the more delightful because it testifies to your complete and unbreakable connection with us.</p>
      <p>However, it was more appropriate for me, as you do, to address and explain my long silence than for you. But someone could easily respond to both of us, either accusing or excusing these so-called excuses for sins, by saying that true friendship is not to be measured by lengthy and numerous letters. Yet, if it is true and solid, it often engages extensively with friends, and no one among us would think that we are so overwhelmed by the waves of business that, if we truly love, we would not also consider writing to a friend as part of our business. Those who have taken this to heart will not lack faithful messengers, and it will not be said that studies, which are supported by frequent letters, are disturbed. However, we will not make excuses that accuse us more than they excuse us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you write that you are all in suspense and anxious about the outcome of this Imperial Diet. Certainly, you share this with many. For who here, observing the gathered daily, would not say the same as you, that all are anxious and in suspense? Let us pray to the Lord, in whose hand alone it is, to grant the desired outcome. As you write, there is no confidence in men, but in Christ and His cause, there is ample and firm confidence. However, we are rightly compelled to hear what some reproach us with, since we ourselves are human and sometimes err considerably in the administration of a cause that is excellent in itself. Therefore, we must also fear for ourselves. We have indeed thrown off the yoke of the Pope, but we have not yet fully imposed the yoke of Christ on ourselves or our people. Hence, we are often filled with shame when we give an account of our ministry to those who, although they seem to be in the opposing camp, openly seek the restoration of the kingdom of Christ. They find so much lacking in us ministers, in the magistrates, and the people, and even in the entire administration of religion. They demand a profession of faith and ecclesiastical obedience, which the learned themselves make concerning the mysteries of Christ. They demand correction, both private and public, of those who have sinned. They demand the abstention of those who have offended the church with manifest crimes. Finally, they demand the excommunication of those who do not listen to the church calling them to repentance. They also desire both public and private fasts and set supplications. And although they cannot demonstrate any of these things sincerely among their own, they still think they have the right to demand them from us, who alone profess the reformation of the world and the restoration of religion from the word of God, and who boldly proclaim that we follow the spirit and word of Christ so that we wish to add nothing to or detract nothing from the Lord's precepts. Since all the saints religiously observed the things mentioned - and they are so diligently commended in the divine writings - these religious people ask why we do not also strive for the same things, who wish to appear to be led by the same spirit and to follow the same word. Therefore, by these admonitions, and by our own conscience, daily stirred by the reading and handling of the scriptures, we are certainly driven to be little pleased with what we have achieved and to extend our minds to what lies ahead, even though there are some in our churches who make certain advances in piety and show more flowers than mature fruits. And indeed, nowhere is it thought that our affairs are so prosperous that there is not much left that we wish to correct and much that we wish to add in the Lord. Satan indeed afflicts and agitates us in many ways, both from the papists and from the Epicureans and heretics, so that we must not only anxiously pray daily: "Thy kingdom come" [Mt 6:10; Lk 11:2], but also: "Lead us not into temptation" [Mt 6:13; Lk 11:4] and "Deliver us from evil" [Mt 6:13]. But why, you might say, are these things so prolixly inculcated concerning the success of the Imperial Diet, which you seem most eagerly to know? I wanted to preface these things to what I will add about the success of the Diet, so that it may finally be possible not only to lament but also to correct those things that the necessity of the churches demands, which, however, very slowly achieve the desired end.</p>
      <p>To satisfy you somewhat about the Diet: It began with difficulty. On April 5th, the Emperor had the proposition, as they call it, first presented to the assembled estates of the empire. The main points are that the estates should deliberate on resolving the religious controversies and pacifying Germany in the composition of religion, as well as on gathering aid against the Turks. Our side had their deliberations for two days, which they presented in writing to the Emperor. Today, for the first time, the opponents have shared their plans among themselves, which they may present to the Emperor tomorrow. Some believe that the Emperor will sooner allow the selection of certain laymen and scholars to hold a colloquy on resolving religious controversies than to continue the recently begun colloquy in Worms.</p>
      <p>The Emperor indeed shows by many arguments a desire to pacify Germany with a pious composition of religion and has many temporal reasons for this besides the fear of the Lord. For his brother's affairs and indeed the whole of Germany's are poorly secured against the Turks, with his brother almost always waging unfortunate wars in Hungary, although it is now rumored that the garrison placed in the town of Pest has successfully opposed the Turkish assault, which you will learn more clearly and fully from your messenger. The Emperor himself is also afflicted with gout and other illnesses, although he now seems to be in good health, and he has a young son, whom many fear will not be long-lived. Italy is always wearying itself and its princes with factions. There are some reasons why the Belgians are seeking greater support. The French King will be a difficult friend unless Milan is returned. The papal faction, by the grace of God, is becoming smaller and weaker in Germany day by day. Our side, although religion does not flourish equally everywhere, is growing stronger every day. For these reasons, we do not doubt that there are those who encourage the Emperor's plans for peace and therefore also for ecclesiastical reformation, without which true and solid peace can hardly be established in Germany, as much as they can. But on the other hand, the Pope, who is still so powerful both in Italy and in Germany, leaves nothing undone, both by his own efforts and through his agents, to divert the Emperor from understanding and resolving the religious cause.</p>
      <p>Some assert that the papal legate Contarini, who is now acting here, is attempting to influence the Bavarian Dukes Wilhelm, Ludwig, and Ernst, the Archbishop of Mainz, and Henry of Brunswick, to refer the religious cause to a future council rather than the present Imperial Diet. But the majority of the princes and estates of the empire seem ready to accept a concord on religion that agrees with the word of God, provided the Emperor inclines this way, although he himself seems to have a conscience somewhat bound to papal doctrines, not to mention the superstition of the Spaniards, whose opinion he undoubtedly considers. Therefore, the entire contest here will be, as some conjecture, which side will sway the Emperor's mind to their opinion. But since this is in no man's hand, but in Christ's alone, we must pray to Him through all the churches to put His hand to the restoration of His church and to use whatever instruments He wills for this purpose. Then we must strive to commend and approve the cause of Christ to all good people in such a way that no one is alienated from it by the insolence of our doctrine and rites or by the laxity of our discipline and pursuit of innocence, and that those who are alienated may be invited to know and embrace it.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I believe that Rudolf Gwalther, a pious and learned young man staying here with the Hessians, has written to you a list of those gathered here, both laymen and theologians. Tomorrow, it is said, the Elector Margrave will arrive here; the Prince of Hesse has a more favorable Emperor than the opponents either think or wish. He has brought with him four theologians, among whom is my dear compatriot and esteemed confrere Dionysius Melander, who sends you his warmest greetings. The other confreres also wish you well, especially our Bucer and Calvin. Farewell with all your fellow ministers, the venerable lords and brothers, especially Pellican and Leo, and if in the meantime you write to Mr. Grynaeus in Basel and to the illustrious light of your Switzerland, Mr. Vadian in St. Gallen, please convey my greetings and service to them from me. Farewell again and forever, and may you read and receive these things with the same pious and benevolent spirit in which they were written.</p>
      <p>In Regensburg, the day after Palm Sunday, when the Emperor had not yet given a response, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Frecht from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and brother. Zurich.</p>
