      <p>From Nuremberg, I first wrote to you and entrusted the letter to Lord Vadianus. Then, from other places, I trust you have received how and in what miraculous manner I was brought to Leipzig and then here. Now, to bring something new, I signify that there is plainly nothing new. The Lutheran rites are still observed here, with a few exceptions, and I do not see what should be demanded from the Papists. All depend on one, and whether that one depends more on the stars or on the creator and lord of the stars, I do not know.</p>
      <p>The people of Magdeburg still persist unmoved; among their chief teachers, they have Illyricus and a certain Nicolaus, a Frenchman by name, but a German by nation. These two are urging them and the people of Leipzig to give an account of a certain Interim recently concocted and published by them; but they have decided to satisfy this request with dissimulation and silence, which those who are of a right heart rightly know.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Brunswick is now besieging the city of his name; it, however, silently awaits help from the Lord, who often calls back his own from the underworld.</p>
      <p>The Polish diet has concluded with the aim of expelling the gospel from its borders, the mitred ones rage against their own and take a successful beginning from Francesco Stancaro, who is now detained in chains because in Kraków, while explaining the Psalms, he dared to express something more freely against Lyra and moreover to write here to Philipp, to pray to God to free him from such a dreadful Babylon and to assign him some certain port of rest in this his final old age. The booklet, which I send to Mr. Bibliander in place of a letter in this time of distress, you see; if anything better existed, I would have sent it gladly; therefore, consider it kindly and continue to love me as a son, since I do not cease to observe and venerate you as fathers. And what more? The letters you gave to Mr. a Lasco, I would return if he had not written from England that he would soon return here; I will therefore wait for the opportunity to meet the man more closely. You, however, fare well, a man who has deserved the best from the church of God, and, as I said, do not cease to love me in return. Wittenberg, August 20, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Lelio Sozzini.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed. Zürich.</p>
