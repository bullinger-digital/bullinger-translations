      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I give you and Belinchetto my greatest thanks for the little book of Bernardino; I have given it to be translated, so that I may see what is commented on in it and what needs to be done. I see that I singularly need the abundant and faithful help of God, who alone is sought by so many enemies; but I know the Lord will never fail me, to whom I commend myself entirely and I pray to Him to strengthen my powers a little more firmly; for I feel that the strength of both my mind and body is not a little failing. But let the will of the Lord be done.</p>
      <p>Regarding the affairs of France and Calvin, I have nothing, except that he is gravely ill here; may the Lord restore him to us and console His church! Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 24th of March, 1564. Yours, B[ullinger]. The consul was with us with his people; he said everything about the treaty.</p>
      <p>We talked as friends for a long time; he hopes that the treaty will not proceed. I gave him letters of recommendation to Mr. Coignet and to Beza and Mr. Viret, who is now acting in Lyon; they have their friends at court, through whom the consul can be helped in his cause, which I requested from them.</p>
      <p>The magistrate received him with six cups of wine; four from the senate dined with him; I also joined them. May the Lord bring him back healthy; he seems to be a good man withering, and he also said that I have changed much from myself; but this is how old age usually is. Again and again, farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
