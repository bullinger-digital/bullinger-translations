      <p>S. Although you will learn everything abundantly from the most illustrious Prince Christoph and his companions about the new events being reported, I did not want to let them leave without my letter to you and wanted to add this: Yesterday, I learned from our consul that things in France are very disturbed and are leading to a new tumult, which is about to arise soon. This seems to be confirmed by the fact that some Swiss captains have gathered in Solothurn. The devil cannot remain calm; may God step on his neck. You will learn more from them.</p>
      <p>Farewell. July 21, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
