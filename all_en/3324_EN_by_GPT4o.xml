      <p>Greetings. I write rarely when news is scarce, but now, with more frequent news, I write more often; you will always kindly excuse my importunity. What Farel and this brother bring, you will hear from them; our council is well disposed in this matter, and if yours are willing, ours, I suspect, will not be reluctant to send a delegation again. However, I will learn from you what your people think.</p>
      <p>The one who brings this wanted the council to promise a delegate; but ours will do nothing without the other cities. Gribaldo today renounced his errors and subscribed to our confession; he will write it out in his own hand and leave it here. This will also be written to the Prince of Württemberg.</p>
      <p>When this has been done, he will also be banished beyond the borders of this jurisdiction. These about him... Apiarius has begun to print the Decades.</p>
      <p>I am sending back the copy, which I have not had with me for a long time, first, so that it may come out more accurately; I find certain things in which you will not be reluctant to help me, I pray. In Sermon 9, soon after the beginning, in the testimony of Cyprian, it is written: "Ne autem in illis quidem vocabulis, ubi de divinitate fidei ordinatur" etc.</p>
      <p>Thus the Parisian and also the Basel copy have it, and you also seem to have transcribed it this way, although to the reader of the context these two words "ne autem" seem entirely superfluous, and thus the context will be clear. The same seems to Musculus; however, I also want to hear from you what you think.</p>
      <p>This now hastily; when I find more, I will write, so that you may assist me. Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, 20th of September, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
