      <p>Greetings and peace in... (the Lord) his.</p>
      <p>To these letters of our Farellus, my father, I was going to add my own rather lengthy ones, which I wrote last week to you and to Mr. Martyr; but it happened conveniently yesterday that those letters of yours were returned to me, which you wrote to Mr. Calvin on the 13th of the previous month.</p>
      <p>Since those letters discuss the whole matter much more fully, about which I had written to you, and I was not able to prepare a response so quickly, I am forced to delay, which I would have preferred to have done long ago. For I know the cunning of Satan.</p>
      <p>But nevertheless, I promise myself the best of you and all ours there, to whom, as I hope, we are better known than for you to suspect anything wicked about us. I indeed hope to satisfy you in such a way that I will remove all doubt from you.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, see, my father, that you love me; for certainly no obstacle will ever intervene that will break my respect for you and your entire church. I have already written to you familiarly about the four copies of the Bible sent to Mr. Zwingli; since Robert Estienne asked me for their price, I ask that, unless it is troublesome for you, you advise that the money can be safely entrusted to the one who delivers these letters to you. I also wish to inform Mr. Gesner that I have had for some time several copies of Athenagoras to be delivered to him, but I cannot find anyone to whom I can safely entrust them; for the opportunity of the Zurzach fairs passed me by while I was ill. See, my father, how familiarly I ask these things of you, and from this at least infer that I am and will be the same as I have been, namely, the one who wishes all things for your sake and expects all things in return from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, with all your colleagues and fellow ministers, whom I certainly wish to be greeted most dutifully on my behalf. May the Lord Jesus bless you more and more.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, the fourth of September.</p>
      <p>Theodor Beza, most devoted to you in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
