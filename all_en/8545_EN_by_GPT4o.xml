      <p> Greetings. I recently wrote a very brief letter, most reverend lord, and promised a longer one, which I am now unable to fulfill due to being hindered by many other matters. The most honorable man, Mr. Willius, has returned from Italy, and after finding at home both your writings sent as a gift and the letters of Mr. Rodolphi Gwaltheri, he expressed his greatest thanks to both and anxiously promised to think about how to return the favor. The commissioners, to whom we entrusted the task of closely observing the Servetans and Arians, whom unfortunate Italy or the Valtellina Valley harbors, have only expelled one named Christopher, who acted as a schoolmaster in Sondrio, a man indeed highly, but perversely learned, an Arian or Servetan and masked with other unknown monstrosities and horrors, who shamelessly blasphemed the venerable Trinity before the commissioners and said: 'How could an old donkey be in every way like a young one, which he had begotten?' etc. The mind shudders at such atrocious things. That scoundrel was expelled, who deserved something more severe. All the others, along with Sylvius, tried to excuse themselves in many ways and therefore obtained from the commissioners that they should appear at our future synod, subscribe to us and our confession, and join us; if they do not do this, they will also undergo the sentence of exile pronounced against them. But what do the distorted minds of the Italians not dare? Sylvius has subscribed to our confession more than once, as long as he can be safe; afterwards, he did not hesitate to spread his heresies and plagues to others. </p>
      <p> In my judgment, the commissioners would have acted more rightly if they had punished with exile those whom their own disgrace had convicted. But no speech is powerful against shining gold, and: 'Who could resist so many saints?' a certain corrupt person once said. Surely the next synod will be full of contentions. May the Lord make it turn out well. Mr. Rodolphus a Salicibus reported for certain (which he could also find out in Milan, as he is the Duke of the Valley), that on the Po and other rivers, about 4000 Italians are lying in ships and are being hired and guarded by the Duke of Milan, that they must wait and remain still until the whole force from Spain and the Netherlands comes together, which is supposed to be 30000, whose leader will be the king's unmarried brother from Spain, from Charles. But no one knows for what, where, or why; some think against the Duke of Ferrara, others against the one from Florence. He also says that the Duke of Ferrara has taken Mirandola and defected from the Florentine; therefore, it will not pass without great misfortune. The legate here earnestly advocates for my lord, how good the peace in France is and how bravely the whole kingdom holds on to it. I do not know what it is about. The King of France is said to have wanted to have the count, whom the pope imprisoned for the sake of faith, back. The rest at another time. Forgive me, I pray; for I could not do otherwise. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe with the whole choir of the most learned men, amen. All the consuls, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Campellus, Mr. Bonettus greet you, of whose relative Luisello, as I hear, little hope shines for your Mr. Burkard; if anything can be hoped for, both the consuls and Mr. Pontisella will move every stone, and the whole matter will be more commendable to them, because it was so accurately recommended to the consuls by the most honorable Mr. Gwalther; but we fear that everything is in vain; for where there is nothing, there even the emperor has lost his right. May God grant grace; if there is anything present for them, Mr. Lemann will certainly know it. Soon more certain things about these will be sent to Mr. Lemann himself or to Mr. R[odolphus] G[walther]. </p>
      <p> Most quickly, April 24, 1571. </p>
      <p> Your most devoted Tobias Iconius. </p>
      <p> I gratefully return the judgment of LÃ¼neburg and have copied it for our use. </p>
