    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Konstanz will [not receive] Bullinger's message about the mercenaries to pass on to the Schmalkaldic League, who will make the necessary arrangements.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Blarer is grateful that Bullinger is taking care of [Hans] Schöner. If he needs money, Bullinger should advance it to him; Blarer will repay it. Furthermore, he gladly assumes the obligation Bullinger has entered into with the host [Itelhans Thumysen?] of Schöner. Blarer will inform in due time what needs to be written to Augsburg regarding Schöner's matter. Due to the unrest, all efforts would currently be in vain. Enclosed is a letter for Schöner.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The expenses [incurred due to the Schmalkaldic War] are bearable as long as the war ends with the victory of truth over the godless liars!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- It is good that the [Nine Places] are showing some flexibility. The papal legate [Girolamo Franco] should just disappear [from Switzerland]! This scum should be destroyed, but most realize this too late, after the damage is done.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Whom does Bullinger mean by the surgeon? Blarer has not seen such a person. Bullinger should inquire what happened to the letter [No. 2535] entrusted to this surgeon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The council of Konstanz received a copy of the letter [from August 1] from the Emperor [Charles V to the Confederates] from the people of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- At this moment, the [Zurich] surgeon Jakob [Ruf] appears with Bullinger's letter. Ruf has played a trick on Bullinger, as Blarer really did not summon him to Konstanz. Also, he no longer needs a doctor because he has fully recovered from his almost two-month illness. Bullinger should therefore not worry anymore and may calmly confront Ruf!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Blarer sends a letter received on August 22 from [Georg] Frölich to Bullinger [No. 2537] as well as an excerpt from a letter [from Frölich] addressed to him. From this, it is evident that Frölich no longer judges [Hans] Welser as harshly as before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Blarer thanks for the sending of the confession of faith by [Juan] Diaz with the description of his death struggle. May the Lord avenge the blood of his [martyrs]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Greetings to the family and colleagues. Greetings from [Thomas Blarer], [Konrad] Zwick, and [Jakob] Funcklin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Bullinger will learn everything else from Ruf.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- The threatened Church of Christ must be helped together! If the Lord does not have mercy on the [Protestants], then Germany is in great danger!</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. I have informed our people about those soldiers you mentioned, who will see what needs to be done. We are grateful for your faith and diligence, as you are so vigilant everywhere.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We are grateful that you are taking care of Schöner. If he ever needs money, I ask you to provide it to him; I will repay you, do not doubt it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Furthermore, I will release you from the obligation you have entered into with the host whenever you wish. I will write to you in due time about what I think should be written to Augsburg regarding his matter. In these turbulent times, all efforts in such matters are in vain. I ask you to ensure that the letters you see addressed to this man here are delivered to him as soon as possible. If I have time, I will also write something.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I am not very concerned about the expenses. I consider this loss minimal, as long as the outcome of the war is such that we see God's truth vindicated from the lies of the most impious men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It greatly cheered me that your Swiss are somewhat more peaceful in spirit. I wish the papal legate would leave without greeting the host, so that he never returns to be greeted again! It was entirely fitting that this scab and dregs of the most vain men should have been expelled and extinguished long ago by all who are even moderately sensible. But most people realize this too late, that is, not until a great evil has been suffered, to whom the Lord grants a healthier mind!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have not seen the surgeon anywhere, nor do I quite understand which surgeon you mean. Therefore, see to whom you have entrusted those letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Your surgeon Jakob is now here with us, presenting your letters, from which I clearly understand what a fine story he has imposed on you, as he claimed to have been summoned here by me, when nothing of the sort came to my mind, nor did I need his services at this time. For now, if ever before, I am in excellent health, thanks to God, and my health is completely restored, even concerning that illness for which I was bedridden for almost two months. Therefore, rejoice again, my soul, at the true news of my good health, for which you grieved so much due to the false rumor of my adverse health. Meanwhile, you may lovingly confront our Rufus, who put you into this unnecessary worry.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I am sending you the letters from Leto, which he sent here three days ago, as well as part of the letters sent to me, from which you will also understand about our Welser, what he now thinks, namely a little more modestly than before. May the Lord cure our ailments as soon as possible and successfully with His healing hand!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I thank you very much for sending the confession of faith and the struggle of the best and most steadfast Christian martyr Dietz. May the Lord avenge the blood of him and many others shed by our tyrants for the confession of His gospel in due time!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>May He, my brother, preserve you eternally with all yours! Greet your household with your fellow ministers in the Lord. Our people greet you, my brother, with Zwick, Funcklin, etc. You will understand everything else from our Rufus.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Let us love each other, my brother, and with common prayers help the gravely endangered Church of Christ. A great calamity seems to threaten all of Germany unless the best and greatest God, the averter of evils, looks upon us in time and deals with us, not as we have deserved, but as befits His ancient mercies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Farewell again and again. August 24, 1546. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
