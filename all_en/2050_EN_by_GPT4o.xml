      <p>S. P. Lord, when a nobleman passing through here by post told me that he had met Lord Vergerius and conversed with him, I immediately thought that he would then ride to you and from there to me; for I wish to see him and discuss many things with him before he enters the Duchy of Württemberg.</p>
      <p>Which I especially desire him to understand. I am going to Freiburg, where I will stay for three or four days and then return immediately. If perhaps he cannot come to me, as he hoped, let him write to me where he is going and by what route and means my letters can be delivered to him. Expect nothing new from me beyond what I last wrote; I speak of arms and very serious wars; for in peace and truces there is no hope. The Emperor calls his son and is certainly preparing for a journey, so that he may return the blessed hereditary empire, as it were. If you ask why the Emperor does not restore peace in Germany, listen: it is certain that he will come at the end of November, if it is permitted by the princes and his health. Meanwhile, with great gifts, arts, and practices, he attempts an English marriage for his son; the magnates strongly resist, but nevertheless some have been won over by gifts, and the queen herself does not seem opposed; yet I hope God will be present for the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>From Germany, we have the King of the Romans and the sons with the princes agreeing against the Emperor and this monarchy. But I praise your sincere judgment about these assemblies; for fifteen years I have been present at almost all, but I know for certain what you write about them. Therefore, I always fear that the Emperor's arts will overcome the goodness of the brother and the simplicity of many princes, and in the end, a certain collusion will be made between them to the prejudice of the empire and the entire Christian republic. Therefore, I would gladly have your judgment on these matters, whether you believe the brother and the princes are acting seriously. Farewell, excellent man. From Solothurn, October 26, hastily.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassafontaneus.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Spain had intended to marry the daughter of Portugal; but upon hearing of the death of the King of England, he immediately abandoned it.</p>
      <p>To the excellent man and friend, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
