      <p>S. D. I have nothing special to write at the moment; because I have now found this most reliable messenger to you, Johann Baptist Pellizarius from Kleve, I wanted to greet you and yours. It is said that a diet is currently being held in Frankfurt am Main, to which Ferdinand is reported to have hastened with several squadrons of cavalry, and the princes of Germany have gathered there. What they are consulting or deciding there, no one can say for certain; different people speculate different things, which I do not report to you as they are uncertain. Most believe that Maximilian will be elected King of the Romans.</p>
      <p>How this could happen, I do not yet see, especially since it is said that Emperor Charles is still alive and Ferdinand has been crowned King of the Romans; you know, however, that the crown placed by the beast on the head of the King of the Romans creates the emperor. But why am I bothering you with these trivial matters? Perhaps I will soon provide more certain information.</p>
      <p>I think it is important now for you to know that in recent days I have learned that my eldest son Heinrich has come from Austria to Padua and is now staying with Mr. Georg Cellarius from Zurich, a relative of mine, which I had not even dreamed of. Therefore, I have given letters written by this Johann Baptist Pellizarius to Mr. Georg, etc., in which I recall my son, so that he returns home without delay. I have attached four crowns as travel money to the letters.</p>
      <p>I therefore ask you, by our friendship, to urge Baptist, whom I trust very much, to diligently and safely and quickly deliver my letters. You would do me a great favor if you also, through your friends, with your letters to Mr. Doctor Cellarius, a physician residing in Padua, would remind my son to return home quickly and without hesitation, as I am recalling him with letters given to Mr. Baptist, who is about to depart for Vicenza.</p>
      <p>I also ask that if my letters given to Baptist are delayed on the journey or are not diligently cared for, which I do not believe, my son should nevertheless understand that my will is for him to return home directly, and if he has not yet received my letters given to Baptist before yours, he should mutually accept the travel money and crowns and prepare for the journey.</p>
      <p>I do not want him to live in Italy any longer; there are many and serious reasons why I am recalling him, etc. So if you love me, my lord and brother, please do me this favor.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell eternally.</p>
      <p>My entire household is well, and our son Johannes is doing excellently, etc.</p>
      <p>May all yours be safe.</p>
      <p>All mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 12, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, in Samaden, Rhaetia, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother. To the young lord Friedrich von Salis in Samaden in the Engadine.</p>
