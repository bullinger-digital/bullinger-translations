      <p>Greetings. I received our letters written to the most esteemed gentlemen on April 26th, very late on May 21st, when I first came to the city. However, I had to leave the next morning; therefore, I entrusted the task of selecting a pharmacist to Mr. Schenkius. Meanwhile, while I was away (I returned three days ago), he managed the entire matter as much as possible. For I had indicated to him, before I left, that Fischer or Piscator, about whom he will write to you, would be most suitable for this task, as I gathered from friends whom I consulted on this matter that very evening. Schenkius writes to you abundantly about everything; therefore, there is no need for me to repeat the same here. It is now up to you to deliberate on what you wish to do here. I will gladly assist the young man when he arrives, in your name and that of his parent, although unknown to me, in whatever matter he may need me.</p>
      <p>I pray that the baths, which you have decided to use, may benefit you, so that your holy labors, which you continue tirelessly, may be successfully completed for the salvation of many by the grace of God and our Lord Jesus Christ. I received other letters along with the letters you have sent so far, as you will perceive from those I have given to you, though not yet returned to you. You will perceive what is being spread among us from the enclosed note. What you suspect about the plans of the princes in your later letters, you suspect not without reason; for these things are evident even to the half-blind.</p>
      <p>I hear that the Bernese have requested that the Genevans admit a garrison of 3000 Swiss, hand over to them the other part of the city across the river along with the keys to the gates, which, in my judgment, was not unreasonably suspected by them. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg on May 26th, in the year 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, pious, and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
