      <p>Greetings. Two days ago, I wrote to Mr. Gwalther, but due to lack of time, I could not write to you, my most esteemed lord. Now I also return everything you communicated to me, which I had forgotten to send in my previous letters to you.</p>
      <p>Here with us, various things are being said, but they are very uncertain except for a few indeed, namely that the town of Zweibr√ºcken, located by the Charente near the Bituriges, has been captured with all the garrison slain, that they have crossed the Charente and are wandering at will with no one hindering them; that Daumale is with the Bituriges, and the king is in Paris.</p>
      <p>In Spain, the Moors have engaged with the Spaniards in two battles and emerged victorious; their power grows daily. Thus, the judgments of God do not cease, however they may seem to be tamed, indeed they compensate for slowness with gravity. About 4000 Italians sent by the Pope have arrived in Lyon, among whom are 1000 horsemen, more notable for the elegance of their arms and clothing than for their bravery; they prefer to be in the garrison at Lyon than to be led against the enemy.</p>
      <p>Pfauser, the emperor's ecclesiastic, died last week in Lauingen while relieving himself, with no one present, and thus was found dead lying near the latrine.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed lord, and consider these letters kindly, as I now have nothing else to write unless I wish to include the most vain rumors. Please convey my most respectful greetings to Mr. Gwalther in my name, I ask, and kindly forward these enclosed to my son.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, June 18, in the year 69.</p>
      <p>Your Reverence's most observant, Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
