    <p xml:id="regest1">Returns [a manuscript]. Could hardly understand Bullinger's continued silence in light of the efforts to renew Arianism or the heresy of Servetus. Keeps the letter to Grynaeus with him until his return. Does not know what Bucer wants in Augsburg. Fears that the dispute in the Bernese church could have dire consequences.</p>

      <p>Behold for you, my dear Bullinger, what you once sent. It seemed better to return it, so that the book may be completed with you or Froschauer, rather than be lost with me. It is hardly possible that it would not be of some use to a scribe.</p>
      <p>However, regarding your silence, although I am surprised, I find a reason to excuse you so far. If you continue, see what reason you can devise for your silence. These are times when it is not fitting for good men and leaders of the Christian people to remain silent for such a reason. If they are trying to revive Arianism, as I hear they have begun, or rather to confirm the worst error of the Spaniard Servetus, there will be work for learned men to do. Although I know that due to my insignificance, nothing will come of it for me here, by writing I could perhaps advise, encourage, or narrate something that might be relevant in some way.</p>
      <p>I am still holding onto Grynaeus's letters with me, which, I say, you wrote, and I am keeping them in good faith until his arrival; we hope he will return in eight or ten days.</p>
      <p>Bucer, having been called by the people of Augsburg, is now with them. I do not know what the matter is.</p>
      <p>The dispute among the Bernese brothers will someday bring harm to such a great and distinguished church. Woe to the sower of tares! You will see one day what end the Lord prepares for contentious minds. May God illuminate our hearts with His Holy Spirit, we pray!</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and brothers.</p>
      <p>On the very day of Pentecost, just before the evening sermon, in Basel, in the year 37.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zurichers, his most esteemed lord.</p>
