    <p xml:id="regest1">Konrad Lüthard has requested to appoint someone from the community to intercede with the authorities on his behalf. However, a summons prompted by the bailiff has remained unsuccessful, as no one wants to take on the matter to avoid any conflict with the monastery. Kilchrat asks Bullinger to inform a member of the council, as he fears that Lüthard might be punished too harshly.</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings and willing service are always ready for you, dear sir.</p>
      <p>I have received a letter from Mr. Konrad, our preacher, who is imprisoned with you in Zurich, urging me to arrange for the community to send one or two men to my lords to plead for them to do their best for him. Accordingly, I have instructed the bailiff and informed him of the matter. He was willing and therefore summoned the subjects. However, nothing could be accomplished, as the majority did not want to burden themselves with the matter, and some responded that the cellarer in the monastery also belongs to it, and therefore nothing should be done, and they did not want to burden themselves with the matter. And so that you do not think that nothing could be accomplished, it is because the matter is such that there are as many who withdraw from the cause because they do not want to oppose the monastery; not to mention the monks. And there are few who belong to the community, and then some go around to those who do not belong to the community, who also cannot burden themselves with the matter. Therefore, you might inform a good man of the council, so that good gentlemen may be informed. For I fear it is urgent, as I have said, because not everyone thinks it is as serious as it is, but he must pay the penalty. Truly, no one wants to have anything to do with it in his statement.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God protect you and all of us from evil.</p>
      <p>Given at Rüti, Friday, the feast of Philip and James in the year 34.</p>
      <p>From me, Hans Kilchrat, your always willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and venerable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, head and preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
