      <p>Greetings. We are eagerly awaiting your letters, beloved brother Calvin. We hope that you have received our letters and understood our counsel. What you wrote in your last letter about adding some other declarations to ours, we will consider once we have received your final response. Then a general consultation will be held about all matters, both general and specific. You will receive our response and opinion promptly. However, ensure that you entrust your letters to reliable messengers. They seem to be delayed and almost neglected on the journey.</p>
      <p>I commend to your kindness this Mr. Wilhelm Plancius, formerly a professor in Paris, a Frenchman by birth, a man both very learned and very pious, as if he were myself.</p>
      <p>Farewell, along with all the brothers, especially Mr. Nicolas Gallasius.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 14th of August, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful minister of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
