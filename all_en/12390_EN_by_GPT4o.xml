Bullinger not only thanked him in writing [not received], but he and his wife [Anna] invited Blasius to a distinguished banquet, where he had the opportunity to meet the learned Rudolf Gwalther and finally see his Hebrew book [by Jonah Ben Abraham Gerondi and Joseph Ben Gorion]. To avoid seeming ungrateful, he sends again some regular pears as a simple, rustic gift for [Anna] and the children.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Heinrich Bullinger, greetings.</p>

      <p>To your wife and children, I sent some regular pears due to their scarcity, most excellent Bullinger, according to the common saying: "He who has nothing else to give, gives pears and apples." For these, not only did you thank me in writing, but your wife also expressed immense gratitude, and you both reciprocated with a most lavish banquet. Especially on that occasion, I had the opportunity to meet the very learned Rudolf Gwalther, your colleague (whose Hebrew book I had long wished to see), which was the most delightful event that could have happened to me. Therefore, so that I may not appear ungrateful for this and other benefits, I have decided to send again some regular pears to your most honorable wife and your most elegant children. I earnestly ask that they accept them in the spirit in which rustic and simple gifts are usually received, and consider more the intention than the gift itself.</p>

      <p>Farewell, man most worthy of my highest respect in the Lord; I do not wish to disturb your pious studies with further matters. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In haste, Chur, on the very day of the calends of February, in the year 1546.</p>
      <p>Your same devoted friend, at the Church of St. Regula.</p>

      <p>I kindly ask you to greet Master Rudolf Gwalther in my name. Our Comander sends you and all your colleagues many greetings. The regular pears will be delivered to you by Fries, as I have placed them in his barrel, etc.</p>
