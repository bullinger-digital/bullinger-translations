      <p>Greetings. How the affairs of France stand, you have no doubt understood from our Linero of St. Gallen, who passed through here yesterday. We have received nothing more from him.</p>
      <p>I suppose in the meantime you have received the letters of Mr. Martyr, which I recently sent.</p>
      <p>I have received everything you sent through Löffelsperger; I give you the utmost thanks for the copies... you have certainly left, so that this dialogue may also be translated into the German language. I return to you the schedule concerning Italian affairs and others, as you order.</p>
      <p>What has been done in Basel, you have from Mr. Tumisio: the prince refused to accept the conditions established by the Swiss in the previous assembly, and our people greatly rejoiced over this; for they feared that if he had wanted to accept them, they would have had to refuse with great offense to all the Swiss. Indeed, the arbitrators attempted another means and wanted a fourth prefecture, namely Nividunensis, to be added to the previous three, namely Tononiensis, Gaiensis, and Terniacensis. But our envoys neither wanted to hear this nor to refer it to our people.</p>
      <p>Since it is therefore thought that an embassy will be sent to our people on this matter, it has been decreed that letters be written to each Canton to stop this action. The Savoyard envoys (having been forewarned by our people) came here from Basel and stayed overnight on the 1st of September; they were given an honorary gift of wine; however, no one honored them with a banquet presence, as is usually done. In passing through that new territory, they behaved very insolently, especially the servants; but this does not displease me. We seem to expect nothing now but war, and the only hope seems to lie in the success of religious matters in France. Our people are variously affected; we see amazing trials of the flesh; yet the greater and better part conducts itself courageously. I hope in the Lord's help; may He be with us! It is rumored among us that there is talk of marrying the former daughter of King Maximilian to Charles, the King of the French; how true this is, I do not know; you will have more certain information. Sultzer writes from Basel that the arbitrators chosen for the colloquy to be held in France are, on the part of the pope, Cardinal of Lorraine, Despensius, and Salignatus, and on the other part, Cardinal Castalien and his brother and Despuatus; I know who these cardinals are, but I know nothing of the others. He also writes further in these words: "Public assemblies are held in Poitiers, but outside the temples, with the use of the word and sacraments. Meanwhile, the people of Tours, having joined with their neighbors, have taken up arms against the Prince of Montpausier for the sake of religion and have not allowed the prince to enter the city." This he writes from other letters written in Poitiers on the day before the Ides of August.</p>
      <p>We have just received this.</p>
      <p>If you have anything more about the Italian movements, please share it.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially Mr. Musculus, Haller the treasurer, whose wife and daughter are bathing in Baden, Hagius, the father-in-law, and all the Zehenders. Diesbach has gone to Lausanne; however, I sent him your letters, so I hope he has them now. May all yours and Mr. Gwalther be safe, to whom besides what I write to you here, I have nothing else to write. Bern, 7th of September, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his honorable lord and most esteemed compatriot.</p>
