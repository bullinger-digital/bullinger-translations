      <p>Greetings, brother. One of the Locarnese, whom I have taken into my household, will be sent by me to you; therefore, it was not right for him to come without my letter to you, even though I have little to write.</p>
      <p>When the plague had passed, I returned to Tübingen, freed by this opportunity from the court, which I greatly desired. I am in good health by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>The school is being restored; many students are gathering from all sides. However, Gribaldo has now set out for his homeland at a rather inopportune time. Mr. Martyr sent me a writing, which he had spread in Geneva, quite contrary to the confession. I confess that these things displease me greatly. But so are they all: they cover themselves with remarkable cunning, furthermore with the defamation of the good; I seriously warned the man not to continue.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand wrote to the princes not to come to Regensburg for the sake of the diet, unless his majesty writes first, and he requested that they wish to come in person, which they promised. My Otto Heinrich is wandering in the Palatinate and takes everyone into his trust.</p>
      <p>I will soon approach his highness, if the Lord wills. Everywhere it is heard that the Antichrist is moving every stone to overwhelm us with war. He who dwells in the heavens will laugh at him.</p>
      <p>The envoys of the Austrian provinces have most steadfastly urged their prince for the gospel, but in vain; they returned with the matter unfinished. But that steadfastness will bear its fruit, I do not doubt.</p>
      <p>Would that you would inform me what the Swiss delegation is doing, whether it has returned, what it has accomplished, etc. To Mr. Gualter, my warmest greetings, and that he may send me the verses I requested from him; it would be more difficult for me to extort gold if I cannot obtain verses, of which he is most rich. I bid greetings to the three sons-in-law and the rest of the family and the whole church. I pray, help me with your prayers.</p>
      <p>The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, amen. Tübingen, April 11, 1556.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, brother and honorable lord. Zürich.</p>
