      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt, most esteemed lord and godfather, that you are wondering what we have done in Lausanne, and what the current state of that church and school is. You will learn this from the letters I wrote to my brother, who will share them with you.</p>
      <p>I would have written sooner if I had had a messenger. I received yours, which you wrote to Viret, along with mine, too late.</p>
      <p>For when we had to leave here and the messenger who was sent to you had not yet arrived, I instructed my people that if any letters from you were brought in the meantime, they should ensure they were delivered to me either in Lausanne or Morges immediately.</p>
      <p>When they finally arrived, they handed them to a courier, who, however, did not meet us on the way, and while he was heading there, we were returning home. Thus, after a few days, I received yours sent back from Savoy.</p>
      <p>However, since those you wrote to Viret seemed useful to be presented to him, I ensured they were delivered to him immediately. Everything there is in utter confusion.</p>
      <p>I do not know what they have struggled with in those churches. This I know, they have hardly found as many offenses in that church as they have now left us. The school is almost entirely desolate.</p>
      <p>However, there will be deliberation in these days about its restoration. We hear that those who have gone to Geneva are preparing an apology.</p>
      <p>To which perhaps ours will respond, and thus the latter will always be worse than the first. You can imagine how much offense is given to the neighboring Fribourgers and Valaisans. I do not see the spirit of Christ driving those people.</p>
      <p>Now they harass those who have allowed themselves to be substituted in their places, some of whom they previously considered their greatest friends, and they think no one can serve in their place with a good conscience. They call them bellies.</p>
      <p>They would rather the churches remain completely desolate than have others substituted. Even among those who remain, many have adopted such stubbornness that they neither want to elect anyone with others nor allow themselves to be elected. And there is so much schism in many places that neither deacons want to minister with pastors, nor pastors with deacons in the same church.</p>
      <p>In short, the situation is utterly confused. How they can answer before God, who have led the most adorned churches to this state with their obstinacy, I do not know. Pray to the Lord for them and for us, that He may restrain these fierce spirits with His spirit and restore tranquility to His churches. We have nothing new, except that the war is again breaking out anew.</p>
      <p>We are expecting our merchants from Frankfurt today, from whom we may learn something. Please share with us if you receive anything. On March 12, Mr. Venner Johannes Rodolphus von Grafenried passed away, and on the 22nd of the same month, Frisching the elder, your relative, followed him. This week, Mr. Hieronymus Manuel, tribune, was made a senator, as we call it, a man of integrity and wisdom. Three new members were also elected to the senate, whose names I wrote to my brother.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write.</p>
      <p>Your relatives, my father-in-law, Musculus, my mother, and all my brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, penultimate day of March 1559.</p>
      <p>I return to you the copy of your and Mr. Martyr's letters to Viret and thank you greatly for it, and also for the letters themselves written to Viret in the name of all of us. Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
