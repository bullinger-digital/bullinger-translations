      <p>Revered Father S. I received your letter dated Zürich, July 5th, on September 26th; now see what these rocks interposed between you and us can do. Perhaps you were surprised that I did not respond; but I am much more surprised by the rusticity of people, not to say their wickedness. However, since these things are not new, but common among the people of this world, I will cease to be surprised. In your letter, there was mention of Valentino Gentile being taken captive to Bern; but I have heard nothing further and am eager to hear what has been done with him. Recently, Georgius Niger, the son of F[ranciscus] N[iger], came here from Poland; he reported many things from Poland, which would be too long to recount; but I could not omit these main points: Ochino openly declares himself a Servetian, an Anabaptist, and an associate of these churches; Lismanino threw himself headlong into a certain well and miserably perished there. The whole kingdom is disturbed by so many and such great and horrendous heresies, many are reverting to the papacy, others are becoming either heretics or αΞεοθσ. In summary: there is now a great αταχιαν of religion there; therefore, prayers must be continually offered for those churches. In Italy, there is such persecution as I have never heard of before. Everywhere this papal decree has been accepted, that doctors should not treat any sick person before he confesses his sins to his priest and takes εθψαριστιαν. They say the pope, with the princes of Italy, has decided that, since almost the whole world is now infected with heresies, at least Italy should remain clean and pure (if it pleases God) in religion, then to lead a holy life, to be severe with all the wicked, even to purge the prostitutes, to free the people from all new and unjust αγγαρειοισ; finally, to simulate great equity and sanctity in this way, so as to be more cruel to the pious. Meanwhile, the plague is taking away many in Rome.</p>
      <p>But alas, how much grief the death of our Fabricius, a learned, pious, and faithful pastor and dearest brother, has brought me; among the many friends I left in Germany, he was the only one left whose presence and company I could sometimes enjoy. But God has taken him away too. However, I grieve more for the sake not only of him, that is, of Chur, but of these and all churches, that we have lost such a great man. But what do our sins not deserve? While the people of Chur wanted to defend the papist bishops, that is, wolves, they lost true pastors. May the Lord grant that our people, after feeling the hand of the Lord, may repent. I believe they will ask for another pastor from you; I ask you to ensure that you give us someone not unlike Fabricius. That church certainly needs a wise and strong pastor. By God's grace, we are well here, and new brothers from Italy continually flee to us, driven away by the antichrist.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and pray for us. Those to whom I conveyed your greetings in your name, greet you very kindly in return. Chiavenna, October 7th, 66.</p>
      <p>Your H[ieronymus] Zanchus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, H[einrich] Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich and most revered father. Zürich.</p>
