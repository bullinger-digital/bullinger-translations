      <p>We have graciously understood the recommendation of your son from you; we also want to let him be commended to us, and we find him otherwise nothing but faithful and diligent.</p>
      <p>We have also received the confession of the churches of the Confederation, although we had it before. Dated as in the letters.</p>
      <p>Wilhelm, Landgrave of Hesse.</p>
