    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller will learn more about the Swiss affairs from Bullinger's letter to Georg Frölich [not preserved].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Zürich contributes more in this war than other cities that believe they are making significant contributions. If God does not push back Emperor [Charles V], undoubtedly terrible things are ahead. Therefore, one must pray constantly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Regarding the [envoy desired by Haller] [of the Swiss to the Schmalkaldic League], Bullinger has consulted with some, but nothing has been decided yet. The [Protestant Swiss] have discussed with the envoys of the [Schmalkaldic League] during the Diet [in Baden]. They will likely present their situation to the princes in detail. They know with what seriousness they are taking up the matter. It would be extremely outrageous if one stood in poor regard among friends!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Today, Bullinger has completed his work on the commentary on Luke. He dedicates it to Hans Welser.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have written about Swiss affairs to Mr. Laetus. Inquire from him.</p>

      <p>It is most certain that Zürich contributes more aid in this war than several cities that believe they are providing significant and noteworthy assistance. Do not doubt, my dear Haller, that the Emperor will oppose us unless he is restrained by the Lord, as he is likely to become a terror to many. Therefore, I would like everyone to pray diligently, persistently, and faithfully to the Lord. Victory is in His hands.</p>

      <p>I have discussed the sending of an envoy with some individuals. What will happen, I do not know. The Evangelicals are continually sending their envoys to the Swiss Diet. Our people are dealing with them. I believe they are acting in good faith with the princes and indeed advocating our cause. For they see and experience what our people are doing and with what fidelity they are doing everything. It would be most unworthy if we were forced to hear ill from friends, for whom we have deserved the best.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Today I finished nine books of commentary on the Gospel of Luke. I dedicate these to Hans Welser, the consul.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family, etc.</p>
