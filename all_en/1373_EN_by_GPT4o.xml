      <p>S. P. Although I am occupied with various affairs, especially in establishing our church in its infancy, I cannot pass up this opportunity to write to you, lest you think I have forgotten you, who remain deeply embedded in my mind, both because of your most Christian sermons which I have heard from you, and because of your recently published Decades, by which we younger ones are greatly aided in cultivating the church of Christ. We need assistance in such a great difficulty of affairs: we are beset on all sides, we who would gladly deliver the sincere doctrine of God to the churches. We struggle not only with the papists, who are now almost everywhere ashamed of their errors, but much more with the sectarians, Epicureans, and pseudo-evangelicals: besides the old errors concerning paedo-baptism, the incarnation of Christ, the authority of the magistrate, the oath, the property and community of goods, and the like, new ones arise daily, with which we must contend. Chief among them are the Arians, enemies of the divinity of Christ, who now begin to shake our churches much more seriously than ever before, denying the conception of Christ from the virgin. Their arguments can be reduced to three main points: one is about the unity of God explained throughout the Old and New Scriptures, and that the matter of the Trinity is new with the term, as it is not revealed in any scriptures: the second, they say, is that the scripture, which acknowledges one God in all things, confesses and professes that this one God is only the Father, John 17; who is also called the one God by Paul, 1 Cor. 8.: finally, they mock the places that seem to assert the divinity of Christ, saying that all these things do not belong to Christ of himself, but are received from elsewhere, namely from the Father, John 5., Matthew 28. But, they say, God does not receive from God; and in this respect, he surpasses any man only because he has received more gifts from God the Father.</p>
      <p>We have responded to these as the Lord has given; and (thanks be to the Lord!) we have with us Mr. a Lasco, the only shield of our church after God. However, I wanted to present these things to your kindness, so that, if you have time, you might deign to write to me what can be most properly answered to these three points of the enemies of Christ; for from your Decade, in which you otherwise most solidly establish the divinity of Christ, I could elicit nothing or little that could be conveniently opposed to these. You, fathers, teachers, and leaders of ours in reforming the churches, will not be burdened to advise and teach us, so that we may rightly establish the church of God and fortify it against all heresies. We are doing everything that pertains to this: and especially a comparison of scriptures has been instituted in our German church, in which the sermons of the previous week are discussed to retain the purity of doctrine; this somewhat restrains the heretics and confirms the more ignorant in Christian doctrine. We also have in our German temple two other Latin lectures, one by Mr. a Lasco, the other by Mr. Gualter Deloino; after which individual comparisons of scriptures on the nearest lectures are held, not without the greatest benefit to the churches. Thus, we have three comparisons of scriptures each week, although initially only two were established among us. One thing is still especially required in our church, namely the use of baptism and the Lord's Supper: freedom has been granted to us by royal privilege, but it is hindered by certain malevolent people, so that we cannot enjoy such a great benefit. Mr. a Lasco is indeed diligently working in his office with the bishops, so that it may be allowed to enjoy the freedom granted; but he only stirs, and does not advance anything: I fear that we must wait until the parliament; when that will be, I do not know.</p>
      <p>The English sweat (a disease) raged in London in July, with which Mr. a Lasco was dangerously afflicted, so much so that we thought his life was at an end. But he recovered: for the Lord had mercy on us; for if he were taken away, it was to be feared that the churches of the foreigners would collapse at the same time. The Lord is the sole defender of his church. In what state the affairs of Mr. Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester, are, you will understand more correctly from his own letters. As far as I can understand, he faithfully expounds his talent. I ask you, by your authority, to remind him of gentleness and leniency. You will advise his wife, Mrs. Anna, not to involve herself in the cares of this world: let her beware of the thorns by which the word of God is choked; it is a matter full of danger to hunt for wealth or honors under Christ. For your admonitions have much weight with both of them.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Lincoln, a supporter of evangelical doctrine, has recently departed from life. The English sweat has carried off two most distinguished young men, the Duke of Suffolk and his brother Charles. We have had a peaceful kingdom this summer (thanks be to God!): for the tumult of some peasants, stirred up at the beginning of summer, was very quickly suppressed by the authority of the magistrate and diligence.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my lord, and consider my freedom kindly. On our behalf, I pray you will not be burdened to greet our esteemed teachers, Mr. Bibliander, Pellican, Gesner, and Frisius. May the Lord deliver our church from all evil, amen. August 14, 1551. Mr. a Lasco is in the countryside with the Archbishop of Canterbury, otherwise, as far as I could gather from his words before, he would have written to you.</p>
      <p>Yours, as much as he is, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zürich, his esteemed teacher.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
