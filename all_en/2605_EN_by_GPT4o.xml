      <p>Justina, Countess of Lupfen, Abbess of St. Walburg in Ulm.</p>
      <p>Honorable Sir N. We are sending you here a letter that our servant master...</p>
      <p>has written to you and we have kept this letter with us until now; because we had intended to come to Zurich ourselves, to speak with you and other preachers, and those who serve the word of God and rightly learn the true gospel. Now it has not been possible.</p>
      <p>We ask you to write back to our aforementioned servant and to send the letter to us here, so that it reaches us about eight days after Easter; because we will soon travel back to the Netherlands after Easter.</p>
      <p>With this, we commend you to Almighty God, who will keep you and us all in His word. Dated the 2nd of April, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>At the holy place of St. Ursula.</p>
