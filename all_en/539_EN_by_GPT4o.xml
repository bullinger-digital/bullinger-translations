      <p>Greetings. Forgive the brevity of the letter, most beloved lord and godfather; you will understand from Mr. Butler, our brother, the matters by which I am hindered and with whom I must contend within two days in the matter of divorce. In my commentaries, which I recently wrote on the Decalogue, I have given equal power to both man and woman to use that freedom, if they absolutely wish, which Christ has granted to his church in the gospel, where marital faith is dissolved by adultery.</p>
      <p>My adversaries allow a man to divorce and marry another on account of fornication, but not a woman. In your next letters, I would like you to either support me with a single word or correct the error. We are all well. I sent John Stumph to Oxford, recommended by many honorable men, especially by Treherne, who is very devoted to you. The Archbishop of Canterbury, when I delivered your letters, did not deign to say a word about your humanity or your most pious church. Bucer has all influence with him, whom the bishop will appoint to the king's public lecture in Cambridge. Mr. a Lasco is absent, which is a concern to all the pious. Tomorrow I will send him your letters with the book and writings through a certain and trustworthy friend.</p>
      <p>You will expect longer letters, God willing, within 14 days, with which you will also receive cloth. My wife always mentions you in her prayers and bids you, with your dear wife and your whole family, to be well; even our little daughter Rachel prays the same in spirit with Martin and Joanna. You, most esteemed lord, will greet Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Pellicanus, Mr. Gesner, and all others on behalf of all of us.</p>
      <p>London, the last of May.</p>
      <p>Yours most lovingly forever, John Hooper.</p>
