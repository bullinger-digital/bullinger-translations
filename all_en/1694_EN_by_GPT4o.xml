      <p>S. Clauser came to us, but achieved nothing as there is currently no vacant position that suits him, nor did I want to present his case to the senate at this time, because it seemed completely untimely, as barely eight or ten days have passed since he was deprived of his function in Zürich.</p>
      <p>It seems to me to be a completely imprudent decision, whether he advised himself or someone else advised him, to leave Zürich and the people of Zürich, among whom he was born and raised, so quickly and to offer his services to others. If he has something to endure there, perhaps here he will have more things to endure and bear more impatiently. However, it does not seem to me that he should be dismissed by you, even if he insists on it, because his integrity and learning are known to all. But I do not write this because I do not greatly desire to bring him and other learned men to us, but because I am pained by the fate of a friend, whom I know is also burdened with many children, if he were to be thus separated from his homeland and his own. Therefore, I dissuaded him from his plan, asked him to return to Zürich and not to disdain the goodwill of his lords; if a position is offered to him there, to accept it humbly as if it were arranged by the Lord, but if he is neglected there, I will nevertheless make an effort to call him here with some suitable position being offered. He agreed to this advice and thus returns to you, trusting in your efforts, until he finds another position, not lacking as one of your own.</p>
      <p>We have no news, except what you have. I fear it will not be as it should. Frankfurt is said to be won.</p>
      <p>They should soon attack the emperor! If they do not do this, he strengthens himself daily and will cause them enough trouble.</p>
      <p>May God turn everything to the good of His church. Amen. On the 5th of August, my wife gave birth to a little son, Sulpitius Haller, who greets you very much, as do Musculus and all of ours.</p>
      <p>May all the brothers who are with you, as well as your wife and your entire family, be well.</p>
      <p>Bern, 11th of August 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
