      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ to your brothers, who remain throughout all of Lesser Poland. We have understood, most illustrious men, both from trustworthy witnesses and from the letters of some, which are brought to our people from your regions, that our assemblies somehow suffer from suspicion there, as if we ought to be defenders or at least supporters of foreign doctrines and especially of the Arian or Servetian impiety. Indeed, when this matter was brought to us, it gravely struck and wounded our minds, so that now we are compelled once again in this matter to explain before you, our most loving brothers, the reason for our faith.</p>
      <p>Therefore, do not doubt us.</p>
      <p>We believe and confess one God according to the canonical scriptures and we acknowledge and worship Him as He revealed Himself in three persons at that bank of the Jordan. We believe in the Father Almighty, the Son equal to Him in all things, in nature, essence, or deity, lesser only in that, when He was in the form of God, He emptied Himself or, to encompass it in one word, by reason of the office of mediator. Thus, we also believe in the Holy Spirit, true God, who proceeds from the Father and the Son.</p>
      <p>What more? We reverently embrace those three creeds, the Apostolic, Nicene, and of Saint Athanasius, nor do we wish to depart from the consensus of your churches, and we abhor all new and exotic doctrines, mindful of the saying: "Guard the deposit, O Timothy" (1 Tim. 6:20). This is our faith and confession. Therefore, if Stancarus or anyone else henceforth will plot against our reputation among you, do not believe them, we implore you by the name of Jesus; for this is fitting for you, men endowed with Christian piety and gravity.</p>
      <p>Georgius Blandrata seemed to have seriously subscribed to our confession a few weeks ago. We pray that you carefully and prudently examine his case and inform us of everything. But as for our churches, we testify before God that thus far by God's grace we persist in that faith and, God willing, we desire to persist, as has been recited above. Farewell, brothers in the Lord, most worthy of perpetual reverence.</p>
      <p>Given from Groß Książ (Groß Xions) in our synod on the 3rd day of September in the year 1561.</p>
      <p>To Calvin and other brothers.</p>
