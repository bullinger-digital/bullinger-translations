      <p>S. D. I give the greatest thanks I can to your kindness, for in your many, great, and various tasks and labors, you have written to me abundantly and generously shared what we wished to know. I now return everything that you wished to be returned. We rarely have messengers from Basel who return to us; hence, until now, I have not been able to know for certain what is happening with Theodoret. But on March 30th, a student, an alumnus of our church, wrote these very words to me: "Know that what you urge has already been done; for I myself am pressing the printer in your name, as you request; I have already seen a single form, as they call it, printed in quarto, which pleased me greatly; I would have sent a copy if the sailor's haste had not prevented it; but after the Easter festival, God willing, the most learned man, Master Theobald Müller from Hesse, who is publicly honored with the title of Master in Philosophy at our academy, will set out to you and the other Swiss orders, offering the Triumph of Switzerland, a poem written by him in its praise, which uses the same printer's work and urges your work no less than his own. Through him, I will write to you more fully and send a copy of one or two printed sheets." Thus he wrote. You see, therefore, that the book has long been under the press; whether it has been hindered by the malice of some in the meantime, I do not know.</p>
      <p>I have not yet had the opportunity to see the writing of the people of Heidelberg, which I would very much like to read. Your booklet, the more I read and revisit it, pleases me all the more; it is undoubtedly written briefly, clearly, and solidly for moderate and truth-loving people, and will abundantly satisfy them more than many others; I ask one thing, that you would deign to indicate what form of concord you think Luther approved, which you mention on page 51 of G3; for I do not think you are speaking of that concord which he entered into at Wittenberg with Bucer and the Swabians. I also wish to know in what words and in what writing he approved that very thing you mention; for I see that in this argument a great defense against modern adversaries is placed, as they, in their perversity, cling much more to Luther's words than to the testimonies of Scripture. Concerning the Exegesis of Lysias recently published, the son of my observant brother, Mr. Christian Hocholtzer, also told me some things; but after that, our students who are in Wittenberg wrote nothing from the fairs.</p>
      <p>Johannes Matthaeus has not yet returned to us, nor do I think he will, as I also predicted at his departure; I fear he will go over to our enemies, either the Flacians or the Papists or even the Servetians themselves; for he has proven to us by many judgments to be more of an impudent jester than a good man and theologian, who cares more for his belly than for Christ and the church. Reading his examination held in Heidelberg, I shuddered with my whole heart; these are the devil's last weapons, with which he attacks the Son of God and the wretched churches.</p>
      <p>What you write about Palatine Christopher is now, alas, written and told differently; for some write and say that his army has been cut down and that in that slaughter, a Nassau (uncertain whether Ludwig or another) was killed, and that Duke Christopher was seriously wounded; others, on the contrary, proclaim that Christopher was killed and Ludwig Nassau was wounded, and at the same time, 1500 horsemen fell and 500 warriors were captured. Our Germans are more and more unlearning how to wage just wars, using no prudence, justice, fortitude, and other martial virtues that shone in our ancestors, nor seriously aiming at any legitimate end of war. Hence, it happens that even their victories, however they may be, turn more to ruin and disgrace than to benefit and glory for themselves and those they claim to defend. Dr. Philipp Melanchthon often used to say: "There are no more wars now; but, as Christ says, only rumors of wars, that is: there are now more plunderings, where one senselessly robs another of his own and only makes the evil worse." If what is written and told is true, a most bitter wound has been inflicted on the best prince, the Elector Palatine, at which not only the Papists but also the Schmidlian and Flacian factions will insolently exult. But these fatal evils, along with countless others, must be borne patiently; meanwhile, the truth will stand firm and unmoved, and in the end, the righteous will triumph with the head and captain, Christ. From Strasbourg, a rumor is also brought of Condé's escape and the capture of Navarre, the king's brother, and Momerancy, though not killed. I wanted to write these things quickly, to add at least something of my words to those that were to be returned otherwise.</p>
      <p>All your brothers and friends greet your kindness with me. You will respectfully greet all your colleagues in our name. Farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>Given on the 6th of May in the year of our Lord 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted to your kindness, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most revered lord and father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
