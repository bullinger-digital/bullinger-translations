      <p>Greetings. After the departure of Maccarius, messengers were sent to Basel and Schaffhausen. These, after a few days, responded that it seemed very good to them if the people of Zurich would write to Bern in the name of the three cities, urging the Bernese to restore the city or renew the alliance and offer their assistance in this matter, indeed asking to be admitted. Our people wrote very diligently and sent a messenger to Bern for the sake of this writing, to elicit a more certain response; but the messenger was dismissed without a response, as the senate had many other matters at hand. However, after a few days, a messenger was sent by the Bernese, who brought letters sent by the larger senate, which they call the 200. In these, they explain at length what has been done so far in this matter, and that the people of Geneva have not once rejected or refused to accept the equitable conditions of the alliance. From this, they conclude that even now those people do not highly value the friendship of the Bernese. They therefore express their greatest thanks to the cities, but truly commend the matter to God.</p>
      <p>This response was sent by our people to Basel and Schaffhausen, requesting in the meantime that, since the assembly in Baden is to be held on the first of February, they give their delegates instructions on what seems to be done next. For it does not seem to the people of Zurich that they should desist from the matter they have begun. When the delegates of the cities and regions gathered in Baden, our delegates, Mr. Habius and Mr. Dumysius, privately called the delegates of Basel and Schaffhausen and asked what advice they brought from their lords. They responded that they wanted to understand what seemed right to the people of Zurich, otherwise they had received no instructions. Our people, amazed at the response, added that it seemed entirely useful and necessary to them that the matter begun should not be abandoned, etc. They said they would report this back home.</p>
      <p>Therefore, our people are still expecting a response today. Now I return from the most distinguished Mr. Habius, who hopes that our senate will still receive a response from them. And since another assembly is announced for the 4th of April in Baden, he believes that the most honorable senate of Geneva will have something certain from our letters before that assembly. For he thinks that our people will write to your senate what seems right to the three cities. Furthermore, Mr. Habius instructed me to greet you most diligently.</p>
      <p>As for when we will come to you, I do not know at all. Everything here is frozen with cold and covered with snow, so it seems hardly convenient to set out anywhere now. For your most pleasing gift of Hosea, I give you my greatest thanks. I have shown it to our Mr. Martyr. Within 10 days, letters were brought from Mr. Johannes a Lasco, written in Wroc≈Çaw, which I have had copied for you verbatim, as you see. We here do not doubt that Philip sincerely seeks peace: meanwhile, we know that the minds of the others are so fierce that we do not know what to hope for from the conference. We know that Philip, with a few others, can do nothing with those people. Yet we pray to the Lord that this matter, about which we will consult more diligently at another time, may be directed to the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother in Christ. Our people send you and all yours their most friendly greetings. You greet our fellow ministers and friends for us.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 25th February 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, H. B.</p>
