    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger can gather the situation of the [Upper German Protestants] from the letter of the Konstanz council to the Zurich council [dated June 4].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer had a letter [No. 2913] delivered by Christoph Froschauer and on May 31 a [news] sheet [No. 2918] delivered by the young Augustin [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Even a blind man would understand what Emperor Charles V is up to. Hopefully, the Lord will save His own from temptation in time! Many who were considered steadfast by themselves and others have already fallen. May the Lord instill strength in them again so that they do not completely give up!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The people of Zurich should pray for the people of Konstanz, for soon they will be in the same boat with them. But take courage! On our side is He who has overcome the world, its prince (the devil), and even hell, and who will one day fill us with eternal joy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to all colleagues. Blarer's brother Thomas and Konrad Zwick send their regards. Pray for Konstanz. Although they still show determination, some may soon be overtaken by fear. The circle around Blarer still proves to be steadfast. May God preserve and strengthen this mindset.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [P.S.:] Has the Zurich council been able to enforce the definitive recall of Johannes Haller from Augsburg?</p>

      <p>From the letters of our council to your council, you will clearly understand the situation of our affairs, my venerable and dearest brother.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I had written to you through Froschauer, and then on the day before the calends of June, I arranged for a note to be delivered to you by the young Augustin.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Even a person blinder than blindness itself can see what the Emperor is up to. May our Lord and avenger Jesus Christ deliver us from these most severe trials and dangers in due time! The spirits of some, who seemed most steadfast to themselves and others, are now faltering. May our Savior support them with His spirit as soon as possible, so that they do not completely lose heart.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Pray diligently for us and our church, since you will soon be in the same boat with us. But let us have confidence! On our side is He who has long since conquered the world with its prince and has stormed the gates of hell, who will see us again and our hearts will rejoice, a solid joy that no one will ever take from us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Greet your household with all the brothers and friends. Our people greet you, especially my brother Thomas with Zwick. Ah, do not cease to earnestly pray for us! Worry and fear will pursue some, although they are otherwise resolute. Among my own, I still sense nothing but great trust in God. May He Himself increase and sustain this in them! June 5, 1547. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>

      <p>Let me know if our Haller has been recalled by your people in such a way that he will definitely return to you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable friend and brother. Zurich.</p>
