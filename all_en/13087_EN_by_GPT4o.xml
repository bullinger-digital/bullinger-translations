    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The benevolent Bullinger will certainly not be displeased if Curione recommends some individuals to him, especially since Bullinger is accustomed to doing the same, and Curione only recommends decent and worthy people to him. The pious, modest, and shy young letter bearer [Lelio Sozzini?] is a Christian from Italy, whose father [Mariano il Giovane?] is also a Christian. Since Curione was asked by this currently poor young man, who is traveling to Italy, he requests Bullinger to provide him with accommodation, although he naturally knows that the Zurich pastors would do so anyway.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger should inform whether he has received the booklet for his son Hans Rudolf, so that he can assess the reliability of the bearer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Curione sends his regards to his patron, along with his household and all colleagues.</p>

      <p> I believe that your charity will not be displeased if I recommend some individuals to you, since you also take pleasure in these duties, and I only recommend good and worthy people to you. This young man is Italian, a Christian son of a Christian father, modest and shy, whom I wish to commend to you not for any other reason than that, because he is now poor and very needy, you may deem him worthy of hospitality as he passes through to Italy. Even though I knew that you and the other excellent brothers there would do this of your own accord, I commend him to you and others with these few words, to consider his modesty and almost his fear. </p>

      <p> As for the rest, I would like to know whether you have received the booklet I sent to your Hans Rudolf after receiving your letters, so that I may understand how faithfully the one who undertook to deliver it has dealt with me and with you. </p>

      <p> Farewell, my most excellent and delightful patron, along with your most honorable family. Greet the brothers in my name. Basel, 12th October 1547. Caelius, truly yours. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious theologian, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, singular brother and friend. In Zurich. </p>
