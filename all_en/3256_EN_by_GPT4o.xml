      <p>S. King Ferdinand has made Schertlin a laughingstock to the whole world; in the past and to the one asking, he promised that he would be the commander of 5,000 foot soldiers against the Turk, along with three hundred light cavalry. For this reason, he calls upon both his sons, captains whom he has long known to be very experienced, many nobles, and a great crowd of those who have long been assigned to the veterans. The same king, what he asked for verbally, also confirmed and urged ten times in two letters and later through the envoy Ylsing, the prefect of the treasury of Ravensburg, that Schertlin should show himself ready and come immediately to the army without delay when called.</p>
      <p>Many brave soldiers, the emperor himself with the captains, adorned themselves. [...] and many also sell their armor, likewise more precious clothes, chains, rings, and things that otherwise pertain not only to the splendor of the family but also to necessity, and make themselves ready for battle. What happens? On the 26th of this month, the king writes to Schertlin that he no longer needs his service; therefore, he should dismiss the soldiers, and he does not mention expenses in a word, nor does he want to repay anything to the many who have supported the common soldiers, and what is more shameful, the king adds in the letters to Schertlin that he wants to promote and send those to be dismissed to him from Polweil, who had the selection in Riedlingen, although the king knows well what action of injuries exists between Polweil and Schertlin. Schertlin, the captains, veterans, and common soldiers cry out against the king, the more honorable ones even testify with tears that they are led by repentance for the never-to-be-recovered expenses. Something will emerge from this, which time will reveal; it is not allowed to speak more freely. They say or pretend that Polweiler is about to set out to the Belgians with 7,000 foot soldiers and 1,000 horsemen. Behold, my Bullinger, with these morals, these o[...]s, and impostures, we are to defeat the Turk.</p>
      <p>I send to you a dialogue, from which you will understand the dexterity of those who ought to be an example of honesty. Many in Germany think there is some monster to uproot freedom, and many things testify that this will happen.</p>
      <p>About the Italian war, many say many things; they attribute the victorious arms to the French, who have deposited much money with him, they assign the trophy to the Austrian, who hopes to milk much profit from it. In the Netherlands, there are three orders, the first under the Prince of Savoy will destroy Mariembourg, the second will set out against the Burgundians, King Philip is said to invade France with the English, Flemings, and Dutch. Whether this will succeed, time will declare. I hold this certain: with the pontifical spirit, nothing remarkable has been designated by either side so far, except that they have most miserably torn apart the wretched and innocent subjects and plundered their bodies, goods, souls, and fortunes, prostituted the honesty of women, and, in one word, turned the male toga into a female stole.</p>
      <p>I have nothing about the colloquy that I can affirm will be useful. Our Peter will explain how the affairs of my son Raphael stand.</p>
      <p>The younger boy is progressing beautifully in letters. Your son, who is also mine, lives innocently and piously. I will make an effort that in time he explores the crafts of vegetables. He will be most commendable to me.</p>
      <p>Peter is an excellent man; with the fear of the Lord, he has great diligence in his duty; make sure he returns quickly. Greet Gesner; I send him two fish. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, very quickly, August 1, in the year etc. 57. Your Gereon.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
