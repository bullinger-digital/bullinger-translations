      <p>God be with you, friendly dear brother. I have received your latest letter to me with joy and sorrow, that you have so faithfully warned me according to your love towards me and that the dear churches here are so badly troubled and afflicted. I see that people do not want to address the common harm with the appropriate remedy; therefore, all effort and work is in vain. The gospel is offensive to the world; it has become very burdensome to it. Also, some of the ministers of the word care little for it; there is little zeal among them, no seriousness, no concern for the present tribulation, no true confession of sins, faithful obedience to the word of the Lord, improvement of life, heartfelt trust in God, anxious prayer, which would be the right means to help the present need.</p>
      <p>I cry out daily for the grace given to me, but I see so little fruit and result that it grieves me to live.</p>
      <p>I invite great enmity upon myself, especially among the surrounding proud preachers. Despite all this, God gives me a joyful heart and a good conscience, as I know that my Lord and God, along with His eternal truth, is with me in this. Farewell, dear brother. God, our friend, protector, and shield, over which the devil and all his host are troubled. I hope for the Lord's coming, which I await with all believers; I walk on the path of this pilgrimage, the legs are not yet tired, the heart is not yet discouraged, for I know that the gate of God's place is still open to me. I have sent my son-in-law to Ravensburg to thoroughly learn all matters, and that the lords of Ravensburg understand my inclined will in this; for they have written to me once more, asking nothing else than that I come to them to inspect their churches and discuss their situation with me. However, since all sorts of rumors were circulating, I wanted to send my son-in-law to them for their satisfaction (to avoid greater costs).</p>
      <p>I await every day; what he brings me, I will let you know first, as is proper. The mayor Funck has dealt unfriendly with me, I leave it be until I come to you one day to speak further about it. It is said that the princes are kneading a peace in the sourdough; if it succeeds well, so much the better. At present, a captain is with us in Lenzburg, recruiting soldiers for the king from France. Other soldiers, who are with the king, are returning. In summary, it is all full of laboriousness. May the dear almighty God reward you for your great loyalty, which you show to me, your old friend. Greet your dear wife and the whole household.</p>
      <p>Given at Lenzburg on the 17th of August 1552. Greetings to you from Die√übach, the bailiff, and Hammanus, my dear godfather and scribe; he has been sick for six weeks now, but I hope for his recovery.</p>
      <p>Your dear old friend Gervasius Schuler etc. To the pious, faithful, and godly learned master Heinrich Bullinger, foremost servant of the churches in Zurich, my beloved lord and old friend etc.</p>
