      <p>Greetings. I pray you do not take it badly that I wrote nothing through your consul.</p>
      <p>I could not; I was dining with them, but with such discomfort that you can hardly believe it; for that domestic enemy of mine, the most intense headache, was recurring. It tends to trouble me almost every third week; eventually, and perhaps sooner than I think, it will completely exhaust me and scatter my brain. When all the students from Glarus rode through here to you, I understood well that the people of Glarus are fairly satisfied, although he was present at all and every meeting, he found less than he had hoped.</p>
      <p>But nonetheless, God has made it fairly tolerable. The five places have not accepted the proposed measures and have indicated that they wish to remain with their previous response; however, regarding the legal matter, they hereby offer justice to those from Glarus, in case they owe them justice to hold a legal matter. They do not do this because they think they are obliged to do so; rather, they do not want to be regarded as if they are rejecting justice, therefore they wish to explain to them the nature of justice in the stated form.</p>
      <p>Glarus responds: Since they have rejected the measures, they cannot give any response to it, except that their countrymen cannot reject any reasonable measures; that they have sufficiently clarified in their responses how much they are entitled to. They have offered justice because they are deprived of their alliances and honor, hoping to regain it with justice; asking the mediators once again to settle in kindness or to assist in justice. To this, the five places do not want to respond, but rather bring everything behind them to their lords.</p>
      <p>The mediators have set new measures - they should be more tolerable; I have not yet seen them - and will give a response in Baden on Quasimodo Sunday, whether they will accept them, and if not, that they will let justice proceed. In the meantime, peace should prevail.</p>
      <p>This is the summary of everything; but you will hear more details from the consul.</p>
      <p>I understand from our people that he has been more lenient again.</p>
      <p>As I do my duty in advising and urging, I pray to the Lord that He governs the otherwise serious matter. Meanwhile, I am distracted by many and great sorrows.</p>
      <p>Your last letters have increased these sorrows about the defection of the Valtellina; may the Lord prevent it. Indeed, Satan is plotting serious things through his own, but he is forced to break his efforts in the middle.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore pray to the Lord diligently.</p>
      <p>Encourage everyone there, urge them and show them the future evils.</p>
      <p>The Jesuits are so seditious and papist rascals that if they are once admitted, they will not only reintroduce the devil but also betray the valley to the Spanish and the Imperialists. We have this new order from Spain.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if anyone does not want to help the religion, let them help and preserve their dominion. I send back the letters of the brothers and bid all and each one to be well, I also bid them to be strong in the Lord, to pray to the Lord, to trust in the Lord, and to fight cheerfully against the Antichrist. Tomorrow the case of Beccaria will be proposed in the senate and that our magistrate writes to your Churian one, who also recommends the case of Beccaria to the other Confederates.</p>
      <p>I hope to send letters in time for I will not neglect anything. May the Lord bless our efforts.</p>
      <p>Navarre has sent a nobleman to Geneva, through whom he calls some preachers to France. In the past days, Gregorius Cornelius, who served in Rolle, requested dismissal from the most honorable Bernese senate and received it with congratulations. I write this hastily.</p>
      <p>Eight days ago or today 8 days I also wrote. Let us know exactly how the day of the alliance turns out.</p>
      <p>If J. Friedrich comes to Chur, greet him for me, excusing me for not writing.</p>
      <p>I cannot; the press presses me and almost crushes me. The books on councils will be finished; I am already preparing the German one.</p>
      <p>I have no idle time at all.</p>
      <p>Tell my Friedrich, if he truly wants to serve Almighty God, to please me and all the saints and to achieve eternal glory, he should take care again and again that the Jesuits, the most wicked kind of practitioners, are not admitted into the Valtellina. If they are once admitted, they will first disturb the faithful and corrupt the truth of the true religion with their cunning, then, by weaving sedition or commotions or betrayals, they will drive the Rhaetians out of the valley, etc. Farewell with all good things.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Philipp, the consuls, all the pious.</p>
      <p>January 24, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours truly, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the Churian church, my esteemed and beloved lord and compatriot. To Mr. Johannes Fabricius, pastor in Chur at St. Martin.</p>
