      <p>Greetings. More than enough, my dearest brother Tobias, I am tormented by the complaints of the brothers, even though yours has not been added, nor was there any need for an excuse with me, nor will I pass it on to those who, what they accuse you of, also accuse us. With patience and constancy, we have prevailed so far; you too will prevail, sufficiently secure and confirmed in your innocence. So let these things be. I am sending back to you your poem about the Sculensian prodigy; I cannot do otherwise now. I have added a letter from our MÃ¼ller, which I ask you to return to me. I do not ask, lest you be offended in this matter; for you know that I have done what I could, and what happened, happened beyond our hope and expectation; I would have preferred it to be published. Furthermore, what I have received from elsewhere, I have inserted into this smeared paper. I thank you for the continued history of the Rhaetian judgment and for the letters of our Lentulus. Today it is written from Bern that a meeting is being held in Gaius (to Gee) with the Savoyard prince; the Bernese have sent both consuls and quaestors there. Someone came from France, who reported that the king, in various places (for he frequently changes location), is convening a meeting of the estates, to which he himself will come with 4000 horsemen, by which name few will come to that assembly; the nobles in France again have their preachers; Monbrun is still in arms; the Huguenots have newly appointed leaders and standard-bearers, so that if any force arises, they are ready for defense. I do not think now, as before, that anything else will happen than that Ganthner will cause you trouble; but he can do enough, so that one deals with him seriously and gets rid of him. For I know the deceitful, unstable, and depraved nature of these sectarians. May the Lord convert or restrain him!</p>
      <p>Greet the honorable consuls, fellow minister Campell, Victor, and also other lords and friends, Pontisellas, Bonet, Gregory, and finally each and every one. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 22, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful lord Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
