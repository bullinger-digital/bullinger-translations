    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has shared Cassander's letter [No. 2194] with all the pastors and thanks him for it. - The [Zürichers] also deeply regret that the symbol of unity has become a bone of contention. However, they are not to blame for this. They could not remain silent either, as their church and their doctrine were accused of heresy, which Christian patience cannot tolerate. Therefore, they had to respond to Luther, but they did so with restraint. Cassander will have already read the [“True Confession”]. Now, Luther's reaction is to be awaited. - Bullinger also regrets the persecution in the [southern Netherlands], but he knows that the field of the Lord is watered by the shed blood. [Charles V] and his advisors will one day learn whom they have persecuted. - Bullinger thanks for the shared [“Dialogus Philalethis”]. The [Cologne] theologians will likely fulfill the measure of their fathers and feel God's presence. - Greetings also to Cornelis Wouters and to the host Paul Fagius.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have received your letters, most learned Cassander, addressed to all the ministers, which I have also presented, and I give you the greatest thanks for your outstanding dedication to us. Would that those excellent gifts, for which you so greatly revere us, were truly in us! Pray, however, for us to the giver of all good, God the Father, through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ, that He may fill us with His grace and gifts, so that we may faithfully conduct His business in the church and be pleasing to Him.</p>
      <p>It indeed grieves us not a little that the most sacred symbol of concord has sown such great discord among men. There are those who think we are to blame and cast all the blame for this most pestilent contention upon us.</p>
      <p>But we refer our cause to the most just judge Christ, our king and high priest, quite secure in our minds about our innocence. We have always shown ourselves most ready to those who sincerely wished to enter into our just and sincere concord, consistent with the word of God. However, we could not remain silent when our churches were condemned, our brothers, both living and dead, and our doctrine was accused of heresy. Christian patience indeed remains silent at any insult; but if it remains silent at the accusation of heresy and blasphemy, it is not Christian patience. Therefore, we responded to the reviler Luther, and I believe we did nothing against modesty. We set forth the doctrine of our churches and our faith, and asserted nothing impious or erroneous. The book exists, which I assume you have seen and read. We know the judgments of some and hope for better from you, since you have not yet committed yourself to either side and can undoubtedly judge more freely. We now await what Luther will respond; when we see it, we will not be absent, God willing, from the truth.</p>
      <p>I am indeed very sorry that the churches of Christ in the southern Netherlands are so afflicted. But I know again that the field of the Lord, watered by the blood of the saints, has been made most fertile from the very beginnings of the Christian faith. May Christ, the prince and head of His church, cause this persecution to turn to the glory of His name and the increase of the church. Caesar and his advisors will someday realize whom they have persecuted.</p>
      <p>For the quite delightful dialogue, I give thanks. These theologians will also fill the measure of their fathers and will feel whom they have sharpened their pens against. For God sees and judges. Would that we all watch and joyfully appear in His judgment!</p>
      <p>Greet Cornelis Wouters along with your host, the most learned and dear to us Paul Fagius, courteously. All the brothers greet you and them.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Zürich, August 1, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most devoted young man of true piety and learning, Georg Cassander, residing in Strasbourg, in the house of Paul Fagius, a singular friend.</p>
