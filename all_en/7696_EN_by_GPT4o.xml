      <p>Greetings. While I am writing this, I have not yet seen any of your letters, dear brother, and yet 8 days ago I sent you a brief note, though it was of no importance, just as this one is not.</p>
      <p>I have enclosed here some news that has been brought here from elsewhere. Perhaps Balthasar will tell you the same story in more detail, if not differently, which I might hear about later. We are doing quite well here by the grace of God, except that there is beginning to be a great shortage of ministers. May the Lord be pleased to send out workers into His harvest!</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your family. May the Lord bless you and your family and keep you from all evil.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 10, 1568. Greet all the friends you know in order.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Where is it that those who marched down from Montb√©liard were struck down by the Aumale forces, about 500 of them, their leader, the Count, captured. Indeed, it is also confirmed that the Duke of Guise is advancing towards Saint-Quentin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
