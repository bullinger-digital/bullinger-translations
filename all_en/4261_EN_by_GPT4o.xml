      <p>Greetings. I (reverend father in Christ), truly have nothing to write.</p>
      <p>I sent to the legate, but he himself has nothing either. Nothing is brought to us from Italy; everything is silent now.</p>
      <p>What this portends, I do not know; perhaps they are nurturing some monster, which is soon to erupt. Regarding the crowned one, since you absolutely wish it, I will comply; however, I will give more abundant thanks when my wife has received it, although I reluctantly accept from him to whom I owe. A rumor was spread here the day before about the death of the Duke of Savoy; but I can affirm nothing.</p>
      <p>What is happening in Germany is unknown to us.</p>
      <p>If I live, I will come to you after Easter, and then about all matters. You will then give me a few hours, which you will steal for yourself; for I will not be torn away from you so suddenly as happened last year, since you are not the least reason for my coming to you, unless (which I certainly fear) I am going to be mute in your presence, although when absent I never lack something I wish you to know. I have received everything from Mr. Gesner; I will write, if I have time, after eight days. There is no need to be concerned about the cost of transportation, as everything has been abundantly paid.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, and forgive me for bothering you with empty letters; for although I had nothing to write, I still wanted to write, so that you too would know that I have nothing. All of ours wish you well.</p>
      <p>Give our greetings to all of yours.</p>
      <p>Chur, April 8, 1560.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. We fear nothing about Beccaria.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and patron to be observed in many respects.</p>
