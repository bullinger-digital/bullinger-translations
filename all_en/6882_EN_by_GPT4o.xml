      <p>Greetings in Christ, most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, and dearest brother in Christ. Mr. John Abel delivered to me your letters addressed jointly to Mr. Wintoniensis (Winchester), Norwicensis (Norwich), and myself, along with your writing on the vestments issue; of which I immediately sent copies to Mr. Wintoniensis and Norwicensis. As for myself, I give you the greatest thanks, both for taking such care of our churches and for making me, a man unknown to you, a participant in those things which are written to our people about controversial matters.</p>
      <p>It is hardly believable how much this controversy over trivial matters has disturbed our churches, and still disturbs them to some extent. Many of the more learned ministers seemed about to abandon the ministry; many from the laity also took counsel about separating from us and holding secret meetings. But yet, by the Lord's kindness, the greater part has returned to a sounder mind. Your letters, full of piety and prudence, have contributed greatly to this; for I took care to have them published in both Latin and English. Some of the ministers, moved by your judgment and authority, have abandoned their previous plans to leave the ministry. And many from the laity have begun to think more mildly, after they understood that our rites are not condemned by you, who do not use them, as impious, which no one would have persuaded them of before your letters were published. However, there are those who still remain in their former opinion, among them Mr. Humphrey and Sampson, etc. Nothing would be easier than to reconcile them to the royal majesty if they were willing to depart from their position. But since they do not do this, we can do nothing with the most serene queen, who is irritated by this contention. We who are now bishops (I mean those who were exiled in Germany and other places) at our first return, before we entered the ministry, contended long and hard that those things now in controversy should be entirely removed. But since we could not obtain this from the queen and the estates in the parliament of the kingdom, after consulting together, we judged it best not to abandon the churches because of rites not so many, and in themselves not impious, especially since the pure doctrine of the gospel remained whole and free to us, in which to this day (however many have attempted much to the contrary) we fully agree with your churches and your recently published confession. Nor do we yet regret our decision. For in the meantime, with the Lord giving increase, the churches have been augmented and confirmed, which otherwise would have been exposed as prey to Ecebolians, Lutherans, and Semipapists. But these untimely contentions of theirs about adiaphora (indifferent things) (if I can judge anything) do not build up, but tear apart the churches and sow discord among brothers.</p>
      <p>But enough about our affairs. In Scotland, things are not as well established as one would wish. The churches indeed still retain the pure confession of the gospel; but yet the Queen of Scotland seems to be laboring in every way to eventually uproot it. For recently she has managed to have 6 or 7 papist masses performed publicly each day in her court, with all who wish to attend admitted; whereas before she was content with one, and that held privately, with no Scot admitted to it. Furthermore, when the reformation was first initiated, it was provided that from the goods of the monasteries, which were adjudged to the treasury, stipends would be paid to the ministers of the gospel: but she has now paid nothing for a full two years. She has recently expelled John Knox from the royal city of Edinburgh, where he was the chief minister until now, and cannot be persuaded to grant him the opportunity to return. However, nothing has yet been changed publicly outside the court, and the nobles of the kingdom, as well as the citizens, for the most part have given their allegiance to the gospel and show many great signs of constancy. Among them, the chief is Mr. James Stuart, Earl of Moray, the queen's illegitimate brother, a pious man of great authority among his people. It is also written to me from Scotland that the queen and her husband the king are getting along very poorly. The reason is this: There was an Italian named David, recommended to the Queen of Scotland by Cardinal Lorraine; he, being in the queen's secret and intimate councils, almost alone managed everything without consulting the king, who is very young and frivolous. This greatly displeased the king; therefore, having conspired with certain nobles and his courtiers, he had that Italian, who in vain implored the queen's help, dragged from her sight and immediately, without a trial, stabbed and killed with many dagger blows. The queen cannot put out of her mind the memory of this most atrocious deed, although she recently bore a son to the king. These things I have written somewhat verbosely about Scotland, from which perhaps it is rarely written to you. I pray that you greet Mr. Gwalter and your other colleagues in my name. May the Lord preserve you for us and for His church for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>London, August 27, 1566.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you in the Lord, Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend in Christ Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the church of Zurich and dearest brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
