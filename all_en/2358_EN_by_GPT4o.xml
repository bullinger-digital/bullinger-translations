      <p>If I did not know that he had received letters from his father, I would immediately understand from his sullen behavior that a turbulent parent had sent new hornets to us. He sometimes reminds me of their family, which should be reminded, but partly not truthfully, partly with such insolence that you would call him a wild boar rather than a human. Therefore, I cannot bear him any longer, as it is very difficult to hunt with unwilling dogs. I am looking for another; but three things have hindered me so far. I cannot and do not want to bear a papist, of whom a great heap rushes to us daily, nor a Lutheran, a sympathizer of the papists. For I see how intolerable, obstinate, and troublesome they are, and I do not want their doctrine to pollute and contaminate the mind of a boy who feels rightly in religion for his age. The third thing that hinders me is that I rarely find an adult aged 24 or 25 who is not seriously attempting to leave prematurely or living with looser reins of lust. Therefore, I would prefer a young man aged more or less 20 or 22, who is learned in your religion, that is, Christ's, in Greek and Latin, and would dedicate his efforts for three or two years. I would give annually 25 gold coins, if not sufficient, 30 with clothing worthy of him and my generosity, and in sum, I would not allow him to lack. I will test his character during this time he lives with me; if I find it intact and unpolluted, I will appoint him over my and other good men's sons to be sent elsewhere. Then a more generous stipend will be added.</p>
      <p>I ask you first, my Bullinger, that these matters remain buried with you, unless you wish to discuss this with our Gesner at your discretion. I have thought about whether it would be possible to have someone from Lausanne or Geneva, who had been under Viret or my Calvin for some time; I would prefer a Frenchman or Savoyard to a German. For thus the boy would gradually become accustomed to a foreign language; he has also reached such a level of learning, to God's glory, that he easily understands someone interpreting in Latin. However, I do not want someone who is only learned in Latin unless there is also knowledge of Greek literature sufficient to interpret authors. Do not write anything about this to Amman, lest he becomes more troublesome; but I ask you to look around and inform me as soon as possible, because I will write to others, namely those in Strasbourg and Basel, although I do not very much desire those in Strasbourg at this time because of the Lutherans.</p>
      <p>I would just like to know in time, so that I do not end up with two, as happened with Maximilian, when he was away for 3 months and I had one come from Strasbourg; it cost me over 20 guilders. Maximilian becomes more and more insolent every day, as if he were driven by a gadfly. His avaricious old father pursues him to appoint him quickly to a recently devised parish. However, he is embraced, nurtured, and promoted by me with love and generosity, so he has nothing to complain about to you. He has a table that is not sybaritic, but neither sordid nor too poor; for due to religious diversity, and because I cannot restrain myself in asserting the truth, I very rarely and scarcely four times a year dine or sup outside the house, so, as I do not wish to go hungry, he will also never go hungry, as he sits at the same table with me. He has stockings, shoes, hats, shirts, larger and smaller tunics at my expense. If he sometimes wishes to converse with his companions, money is not lacking, so that he has something to contribute to a symposium. He has never been more harshly chastised or admonished by me, but has been treated most kindly. Once, as I know, he was more unjust to a boy who was obedient and truly pious; but he has relented this severity. However, he greatly disturbs the household, exasperates the wife, who is otherwise easily irritable and bilious. Sitting at the same table with me, they do not speak a word to me of their own accord, and when asked, they barely respond. He communicates no conversations with the boy, except those he knows are necessary during reading. Hence, the boy, whom I would wish to be lively, is completely torpid, struck in spirit, and displays manners worthy of an old man. He blames all the fault on that old Euclio, while he would gladly obey his more lustful flesh. But he does not have a crack through which he could escape because of my benevolence towards him. Since the father solicits and urges the son to defect every week and more frequently with letters, and again his conscience frightens him not to offend the one from whom he receives many benefits, and would receive even more if he remained entirely in duty, he becomes perplexed, doubtful, and stuck, as if frenzied and melancholic. Besides all the necessities of life, I annually promise 25 gold coins, my assistance for a scholastic or ecclesiastical office, and I know that I could promote him more rightly and conveniently, without a note of boasting, than anyone in Augsburg; I could send him to gymnasiums, which would seem appropriate to me and others, with my and others' sons. But he does not aspire to this, he would prefer a wife, so enticing is the most unjust parent...</p>
