    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller should rejoice in the grace of Christ shown to him, of which the letters of [Georg] Frölich and the others testify. - His travel companions [Huldrych Zwingli the Younger and Hans Wilpert Zoller] have returned [to Zürich] and could not praise the hospitality of the people of Augsburg enough. Bullinger has consulted with [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Pellikan, and others about the [Augsburg Church Order] sent by Haller. They will discuss everything with Haller upon his return to Zürich. In the meantime, Haller should adapt to the [Church Order] to be able to stay in Augsburg. He should also behave kindly towards Musculus. However, he should explain the [Church Order] in his sermon in such a way that the people understand that when the pastor presents the signs, Christ cleanses, justifies, feeds, and redeems the believers, while the sacraments signify and testify. Haller should not impose the Zürich sacramental order on [the people of Augsburg]. Everything else will be discussed orally. Later, Bullinger will see what he can achieve with the mayors [Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot] and with Frölich in this matter.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I give unceasing thanks, dear Haller, to our Lord Jesus Christ, who has granted you the grace that the letters of Frölich and other esteemed men testify you have received from the Lord. Pray to the Lord that He may increase His gifts to you for the glory of His name and the benefit of His church.</p>
      <p>Your companions have returned home safely, and they could not praise enough the hospitality and kindness of the people of Augsburg. They also brought me your letters along with the ceremonial form, which they call the order. You ask in your letters how you should conduct yourself towards Musculus, and whether you should use the received form. I have consulted with our Bibliander, Pellikan, and others, and since you will soon return to us, we will discuss more with you in person. At present, I advise you to adapt yourself to every form and manner that allows you to remain in Augsburg, that is, bear whatever you can with a clear conscience, as long as you stay; for we hope that great fruit will come to Christ. Therefore, behave kindly towards Musculus.</p>
      <p>Show him honor, but in such a way that he understands you will not yield in the matter of truth. You will say that you gladly receive and will use the written forms of speech, but you will interpret them piously for the public sermon, so that the people clearly understand what is to be attributed to faith, what to our deeds, what to Christ, what to the ministers, what to the sacraments, and what to the purpose of the sacraments, which is Christ. Christ purifies, justifies, feeds, and saves. The minister presents the symbols. The sacraments seal and testify. They are entirely useless unless faith unites us to Christ.</p>
      <p>This is the essence. Therefore, we cannot advise you to immediately press the Zürich church's form of celebrating the sacrament. Use the received form. It would be harsh and intolerable if you were to reject it and wish to introduce a new one. We have read the form and retained it, so that we may discuss it more fully in person. Meanwhile, you will use it in the present. Later, we will deal with the mayors and Frölich to see what can be achieved, making attempts. I could not write more now. Farewell.</p>
