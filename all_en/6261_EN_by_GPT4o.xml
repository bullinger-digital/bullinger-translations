      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, I received your letters along with your book, which is addressed to Mr. Zanchi, and the letter to the same; I will take care of it at the first opportunity, although I cannot promise anything certain regarding the time; for that route is now closed due to the plague, which I believe you have understood from Zanchi's letters to me.
