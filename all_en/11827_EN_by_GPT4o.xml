    <p xml:id="regest1">Is uncertain about the exact identity of Bullinger, as at the same time when Bullinger attended Caesarius' lectures, a Heinrich from Waldshut [Johann Heinrich Scherer] was studying in Cologne, who followed Caesarius to Münster when the plague broke out [1519]; his memory is fading, and he finds it difficult to put his thoughts precisely on paper, as Bullinger can easily recognize from this letter. He has thoroughly studied and recommended the Bible translation [„Biblia sacrosancta“] that appeared last winter at his request; the [Cathedral] Dean [Count Heinrich von Stolberg-Wernigerode] and Count [Hermann] von Neuenahr [the Younger] have acquired the work; eagerly awaits Bullinger's commentary on Luke. Evangelical preachers were sent to the cities of the Diocese of Cologne to spread the Gospel, but the people of Cologne are resisting it. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p>I would like to know for certain who you are, that is, who is this Heinrich Bullinger, who so honorably orders me to be greeted and gifts me with many books of his truly learned writings. For this reason, I have long considered going to Frankfurt, so that I might finally obtain certain and true knowledge of you from Froeschovius. It was around that time (if I am not mistaken) when you were my listener in Cologne, a certain Heinrich from these regions as well, by the surname, if I remember correctly, Walsshuett, who was indeed quite studious, but, as it seemed to me, not of such great talent that he could have reached not only the understanding of divine literature but also the knowledge of human literature, which you hold well. But "persistent labor conquers all." Therefore, you will do me a great favor if you indicate to me with certain signs the state of your person. The same Heinrich by the surname Walsshuett, when at that time the plague was raging greatly in Cologne and I therefore left Cologne to go to Münster in Westphalia, followed me not long after and stayed with me there until we finally prepared a journey back to Cologne. Now you have the reason why doubt about your person has arisen for me. I would have already set out (as I began to say) for Frankfurt largely for this reason, if bodily weakness and lack of strength had not hindered me, and my memory is also so fleeting and slippery that it no longer seems advisable to me to engage in more humane studies, but only to spend the remaining time in sacred matters. Hence, it also happens that I am less apt in writing letters, for what I conceive in my mind, I cannot express fully and perfectly with the pen, which you can easily perceive in these letters to you. Yet I am often compelled to give and write letters to friends, who write to me almost daily, now this one, now that one.</p>
      <p>As you reminded me in your latest letters to examine and recommend to as many as possible the Bible, which was published last year, indeed last winter, from the translation of Jude, I have done so most diligently.</p>
      <p>As a result, the Dean at our main church, at my urging, has purchased it for himself, as well as Count Nuenarius and several others from the common people and learned men. Furthermore, I eagerly await your commentary on Luke, not only I but also many others.</p>
      <p>The evangelical matter is being spread throughout our diocese of Cologne, and preachers are being gathered from everywhere to be sent to the towns of the diocese; but the people of Cologne are still resisting, which is mainly stirred up by the crowd of monks and the faction of theologians. But the Lord will give grace.</p>
      <p>It remains for you to depict yourself to me in your own colors, but what is it to depict, if not to express in more pleasing characters. I can hardly read one or two lines of your letters. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Cologne, on the very day of the beheading of John the Baptist. Johannes Caesarius, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and also most courteous man Heinrich Bullinger, the most famous preacher in Zurich, his best and almost incomparable friend. To the hand of Froeschovius the printer.</p>
