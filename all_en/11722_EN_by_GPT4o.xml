      <p>Honorable, well-learned lord, our friendly greetings and willing service are sent to you from us in advance and hereby to inform you.</p>
      <p>Your letter, addressed to our city clerk, has been sufficiently understood by us according to its content, and from this, we have learned of your entirely friendly intentions towards the city of Aarau, for which we are highly thankful, offering to serve a respectable college to the best of our ability. Accordingly, we have accepted Christian as our schoolmaster to try him for a quarter of a year, with the good, undoubted hope that it will please us on both sides in such a way that we will continue with another household. However, regarding preaching, it is not permitted to us in any way unless there is prior approval from our gracious lords of the Bern ecclesiastical court. Therefore, our request is that you provide a certificate to our mentioned gracious lords of the ecclesiastical court, stating that he has been examined by you, our lords of Zurich; they will undoubtedly be satisfied with this and will grant him approval. We would then gladly allow him to do so at the appropriate time. Therefore, honorable lord, it is our earnest request that you instruct the mentioned schoolmaster to live up to the testimony given by you, with his proven loyalty, love, and honorable conduct, as an example of his life and behavior, so that you have written well and we may enjoy it.</p>
      <p>With this, may God always graciously keep you! Dated Galli in 42.</p>
      <p>Your honorable, willing servants, the mayor and council of</p>
      <p>Aarau.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well and highly learned master Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the divine word in Zurich, our much-beloved lord.</p>
