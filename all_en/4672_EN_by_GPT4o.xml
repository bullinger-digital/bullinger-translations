      <p>Greetings. If the ice has broken and the waters have covered those to whom I entrusted the books and letters, I am deeply grieved, and let me know for certain. I sent you, Philipp, and Friedrich von Salis copies of my books on the councils; if they have perished, I will send others. However, you have not written any letters to which I have not responded, whether the letters were truly delivered, intercepted, or lost. I rejoice that the church has been given to the ministry of Beccaria and pray to the Lord to raise up zealous spirits everywhere for the propagation of His name. He certainly humbles us, to whom He has given leaders, as you know.</p>
      <p>Since you promise to write the history of that mediator, I eagerly await it; for I do not know what he is like. This I know: those means of pacification will be the greatest cause of dissension among us; thus God will exercise us, I hope, for salvation. You indulge yourself too much, saying that we are idle here: we perform our duty to the best of our ability and as much as we are commanded to serve for edification. The reason we do not advance as much as we would like is the same that has sometimes, indeed not once, hindered the efforts of holier, wiser, and more faithful men than we are. I pray to the Lord that you may not be forced to experience the same.</p>
      <p>If the church and the republic perish, if the gospel is betrayed... we are at peace before the Lord with clear consciences that this is not happening through our fault, although in the meantime we willingly confess with Paul: I am conscious of no treachery, yet I am not thereby justified. If the magistrate is blind, it grieves others and ministers the most, especially since they understand and feel that it must be attributed to the sins and blindness of God if some have their eyes opened, who yet refuse to open them. We pray to the Lord to open the eyes of all everywhere.</p>
      <p>Know, however, that your people are not excused before the Lord if they abandon the righteous, and would that only ours feared for themselves. The misfortune is now upon us; let him who stands take heed lest he fall.</p>
      <p>I leave the judgment about taking secular power from the bishops to you, because you said this matter does not admit delay. I can add nothing to this now and in such a short time.</p>
      <p>It is certain that by divine law and from the sacred writings it cannot be proven that bishops and thus ministers of the church should wield the sword. As for the donations of princes, to which they resort, I say, however much princes have offered temporal governance to bishops, they did not do this by God's command or permission, nor should bishops have accepted the sword and temporal administration. Paul says in 2 Timothy 2: "No one serving as a soldier entangles himself in civilian affairs." He exhorts Timothy and any bishop to other duties than those of a magistrate; he does not want the minister to be entangled in those things that distract from teaching and studying. Who does not see that administering the affairs of the poor is a most holy task? The apostles served the poor here in the early church. But what did Peter say? "It is not right for us to neglect the word of God to wait on tables." Would he who said this have accepted the administration of the sword? Let him believe this who believes the most absurd things.</p>
      <p>Therefore, even if princes have given such donations to bishops, it has not yet been proven that they did well. We can, however, prove that those who received them did wrong.</p>
      <p>Let the bishop teach, let the magistrate govern; let the bishop carry the book of the gospel and lead the sheep by good example, let the magistrate carry the sword and do what Paul commanded in Romans 13.</p>
      <p>I have received fuller information about the state of the King of France from Mr. Beza; but they agree with those I recently sent, and now they are not at hand. Later I received a mandate from King Charles, the King of France, by which he pardons all involved in the crime of sedition in the kingdom, frees all captives, recalls exiles, and grants freedom of religion until the controversy is settled by the council opened by the Pope at Trent or by some other convenient means. This too is not at hand; if you do not have it from elsewhere, I can send it in eight days.</p>
      <p>Horrible things are written to me from Germany: that the Neunburg assemblies have ended and a conspiracy has been discovered, I do not know what the situation is. I will write about this when I have more certain information; for I do not want to write such ominous things unless they have been confirmed to me by more certain evidence. May the Lord keep us from all evil; here He must be diligently prayed to, all must be drawn to repentance. I have long believed the cup of the Lord to be at the door, now I believe it more and more.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on His faithful! Farewell. I wrote this hastily, and not even a moment is granted to me to breathe from my labors, but I am more and more consumed by sorrows. Meanwhile, the Lord is my hope and my only refuge, in whom I am otherwise secure and at peace. Zurich, February 21, 1561.</p>
      <p>Perhaps I will write shortly through our Egli. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Consuls and Philipp and Pontisella and the other brothers.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother. To Johannes Fabricius, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
