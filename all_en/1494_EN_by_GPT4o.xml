      <p>Greetings in Jesus Christ, who is the true and only salvation, most honorable and dearest teacher in the Lord.</p>
      <p>As soon as I departed from your integrity in the city of Zürich, I had the intention to write to you. Although I cannot write joyful things due to our sins, I have nevertheless hastily or thoughtlessly written these letters, in which I wanted to express that I am neither now nor ever will be forgetful of the kindness with which you have treated me, though I have deserved nothing. Therefore, I give you the greatest thanks, for at this time, when my affairs seem more afflicted, you have recognized me as a friend and brother and have proven your friendship with countless benefits. And although I know that this is not owed to my smallness, I am glad that during this time of my exile you have accepted me into your friendship, and I am sometimes grieved that I am in such a condition that I cannot do good to those whom I would most like to; but may Christ do good to them, especially to you and your whole family. Furthermore, most honorable man, as for me, I endure a very grave fate; for fortune is heavier upon me than upon others in many respects. I am a veteran in the ministry and the senior among the preachers of Augsburg; moreover, I have passed my sixtieth year, served the church of Augsburg for more than twenty years, thirdly, I am the father of many children, fourthly, for the sake of the gospel, I have been cast down from a not insignificant degree of dignity before the world not once, and finally, a not small portion of my grief is the affliction, or rather the devastation, of the church of Augsburg; for to see the sheep of Christ deprived of their most faithful shepherds and scattered, if not exposed to wolves, yet entrusted to hirelings, to see also the adversaries, hypocrites, and scoundrels triumphing, indeed glorying with brazen faces in iniquity, blaspheming the eternal word of the Lord and all things that were done rightly and orderly in the church according to the institution of the gospel, these things, I say, can easily disturb the strongest hearts in Christ. But since we know that God is faithful, not tempting beyond what we can bear and moderating all things according to the measure of strength he grants, he, I say, can and is wont to lead rash counsels to happy or good outcomes by his divine artifice. For our proscription sounds far more vocally in the hearts of the children of God than our sonorous sermons once did, and no wonder; for if the blood of Abel once had its voice, why should not our proscription have its language, since our exile is nothing else than an inviolable seal of those things which we have previously taught piously. Therefore, let sorrow and faint-heartedness depart; for it is no small part of happiness to be made conformable to the image of the crucified. Therefore, I will remain unmoved, not relying on my own strength, but on the rock Christ, in whom I can do all things with St. Paul; for he is the one who strengthens and encourages me. Therefore, you will pray with me to the Lord, that it may be granted to remain for a while, so that I may not always have to wander. And, if at any time you have to write to the brothers in Chur, remember me and continue to commend me there. I have nothing new, except that a good friend, a courtier of a certain prince, wrote verbatim about the Council of Trent: "Some hand reports from the council that our most illustrious prince sent two truly noble legates to Trent, who in these days wrote and sent propositions or decrees concerning the Eucharist, savoring of old iniquity and filled with anathemas. On the next day of Catherine, another session will be held; I believe they will decide on penance, extreme unction, and the sacrifice of the mass. The council decreed safe conduct for the Protestant theologians invited to the council, and they will await the conversion of Paul. The most illustrious prince sent Eunobulus, who was a table companion of the late Dr. Luther in Wittenberg. These two will do nothing in Trent until the theologians of the Elector of Saxony, Maurice, also arrive there. The confession of faith of our most illustrious prince will be presented to the council; many German matters will also be proposed. A protest is being instituted so that the council is not recognized as judges." So he wrote. A great rumor has spread in Augsburg about the return of Maximilian from Spain to the Genoese, which I do not think is unknown to you, also about the liberation of the Magdeburgers, and finally about the Nurembergers and others who subscribed to the Augsburg Confession, whatever the Council of Trent may have decided. May your integrity fare well along with your most honorable wife and children and sons-in-law, whom you will greet most diligently in my name, among whom you will act as a nomenclator and greet each one by name from me; for as they are all of such a liberal appearance, so I have been most liberally received and treated by them. May the Lord God be the rewarder of all of you. Hastily at St. Gallen in the house of my good host Hansen Rietman, the baker. December 3, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Ehinger, son or exile of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>I would like these enclosed letters to be sent either through his nephew to Lord Peter Paul Vergerio, etc.</p>
      <p>They say the Emperor will return within a few months; for the Spaniards do not have what is necessary for need and luxury at Innsbruck as they had in Augsburg. Some merchants say confidently that neither the rich in the Tyrolean entourage can acquire as much money as necessity would require, nor the poor by theft; in Augsburg, everything is for sale; now my door is open to them. Lord Anthony Fugger is said to be preparing his house for the convenience of the Emperor. The minds of many are very disturbed.</p>
      <p>The Magdeburg war has been settled on terms, if you consider the words, very harsh, as I have read; but I hope the execution will be much more equitable. I would gladly make a copy of it if I could.</p>
      <p>Then it is known that the French intercepted eight ships loaded with precious goods, estimated at 300,000 ducats, which were being transported from Spain to Maximilian, who was driven back by the force of the storm. Many evils threaten Hungary. There was also a rumor at St. Gallen that the Turk was defeated in Hungary; but so far nothing certain has been reported except this one thing, that he was forced to lift the siege of a certain castle with great loss of his men, the Hungarian knights fighting very bravely.</p>
      <p>Five wagons loaded with silver are being transported from Spain through Augsburg to Flanders; they are estimated to equal five hundred thousand florins.</p>
      <p>There are some who say that you in Zürich have publicly declared the reasons for refusing the council, which prevent you from participating in this council. If anything exists with you either in German or Latin, make a copy of all these things for me at my expense.</p>
      <p>Then I have not yet seen your book On Christian Perfection; send me all these books along with Bibliander's book on the Italian abomination or against the abomination of judges, and I will pay promptly to the one who hands them over or through another good man here I will certainly satisfy you; for there are good men who demand these from me.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the church of Zürich, most learned and worthy lord and most revered teacher.</p>
