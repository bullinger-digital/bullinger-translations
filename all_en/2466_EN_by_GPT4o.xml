      <p>That I have not sent you any letters before now, do not be surprised, most excellent Bullinger, for as far as it pertained to nurturing and fostering our mutual friendship, which was the only opportunity available to me, I judged it to be more than sufficient if I conveyed my greetings through our Calvin, just as I received them from you through him from time to time. But since a great opportunity now presents itself to me, I could not pass it by without sending these, however they may be, to you. This is indeed the reason: Perhaps you might have desired, and it seemed to be my duty, to remind you about our otherwise well-known Lelio, so that our entire nation would not be marked with suspicion, and that a grave one, because of one man's influence. This, however, should be far removed from everyone's minds. For you should be convinced that his opinions and chimeras, indeed blasphemies and monstrosities, are displeasing and abominable to us. But why I delayed, this was the reason. For I did not think he would remain with you for long. But since I see him continuing, I could not and should not dissemble any longer. There are also reasons that otherwise sufficiently spur and impel me of my own accord.</p>
      <p>One indeed is that through letters recently sent to me, the deacon, and the elder of our little church, he has spewed his blasphemies more than before: besides the fact that he says we are all in error and darkness (although our church agrees with yours in all things), he dares, like a giant speaking about the most holy Trinity, to say, indeed to boast: I will overturn this tower from its foundations. The other is that since one of our Italians, otherwise a good young man, is with you, he, as we suspect and have almost discovered from his letters written to a certain fellow citizen, drinks from his cup. For he also makes mention of a certain three-part chimera, which he attributes to us. This indeed instills fear in us lest he does the same with your other young men. It will be your duty to discern and ensure that your church and especially the youth suffer no harm in this matter. For who could or should have the slightest fear concerning you ministers and teachers? I add that this stay with you is to be feared, lest as it gains him the greatest favor, it may be of the greatest harm among others, so that he is not considered at least as so pestilent and deplorable; otherwise, he would not be tolerated by you, let alone praised by some. These are the things I thought necessary to write to you at present; I leave them to your prudence and piety to consider, and as for me, I am quite sure you will be convinced of all my sincerity, so I will ardently pray to the Lord that he may guide and govern you with the spirit of his counsel and strength. Farewell, my Bullinger, and know that I love and respect you from the heart.</p>
      <p>Given in Geneva on the 14th of November.</p>
      <p>Yours, Celso Martinengo.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor among the Zurichers, to be greatly respected by me. In Zurich.</p>
