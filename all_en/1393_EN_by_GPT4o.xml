      <p>I am responding to your letter a bit late, most honorable Mr. Bullinger; for I have just returned from Augsburg, where I visited the envoys of our most serene king. The one who arrived later at the Emperor's court has been recalled home; however, Moresinus will fulfill his duties at the usual and appointed time. I have no doubt that you have already been informed about the Turkish incursions both in Africa and in Hungary. It is a great calamity for Germany, as we are torn apart by internal conflicts, while the enemies of the Christian name rage and wreak havoc on our innards and limbs. The Turkish army is said to consist of sixty thousand cavalry in Wallachia. King Ferdinand has recently sent several infantry units to Hungary via the Danube, of which about seventy, being drunk and fighting against the sailors, drowned. If only all of those men had been similarly taken by fate; for Germany will never be well as long as these assassins and mercenaries roam freely in the empire, for whom neither virtue, nor peace, nor the preservation of justice is the end of war, but rather the most vile stipend, license, and free action of plunder. The Emperor still has four infantry units with him in Augsburg, who are inflicting irreparable damage on the poor hosts for the second year now. Duke Christoph of WÃ¼rttemberg has just gone to the Emperor and, as I hear, has been summoned to offer three hundred thousand gold coins for reconciliation and, moreover, the castle of Hohenwiel; these are the imprudently undertaken and more shamefully abandoned fruits. Magdeburg is still under heavy siege, and recently Maurice and the remaining neighboring princes are said to have interceded for them to mitigate the conditions of peace, but the Emperor remains steadfast in his opinion. For it is easy to wage war with someone else's money. What end is to be brought to this forsaken and abandoned city, the mind shudders to recall. Oh the times, oh the customs! I am inclined to exclaim with Livy. Where are your spirits, which used to stand firm? I know you are aware of the noise and fervor of the present council due to your prudence.</p>
      <p>The electors of Trier and Mainz have already arrived there long ago, and the one from Cologne will soon embark on that journey; our man from Strasbourg, with almost his entire household dismissed, left seven days ago. The first bishops of Germany are compelled to go to Trent at his command, to whom it is sacrilege to contradict; each clergy provides expenses to their bishop while he is abroad. The ones from Trier and Mainz expect to be away from home for three years; from this, one can infer, for they have arranged their domestic affairs for such a long delay. What our side will do in response has not yet been sufficiently agreed upon; for now, some are consulting on how this action can be more conveniently instituted.</p>
      <p>It is absolutely necessary for our people to appear at the council; for they have pledged to do so in two assemblies. Then the desertion of this cause would bring irreparable damage; although no one can hope that anything good and fair can be either begged or won from this kind of people, nevertheless, we must do our part and commit the outcome to the Lord. If only the King of France would adhere firmly to his protestation; but the minds of princes are often lightly moved by the cause of religion and tend to use it for present convenience. Moreover, the authority and influence of the French cardinals and bishops are not insignificant at court.</p>
      <p>In the city of Augsburg, five churches still hold very pious and free sermons with a large attendance of people; but I very much doubt how long this freedom will last. Everything is uncertain and changes daily regarding the Emperor's departure and where to; for the Italian and Hungarian wars seem to keep him in Upper Germany for a longer time. The Emperor has summoned the wealthier and more superstitious citizens of almost all the towns situated above Augsburg towards the Alps to himself, to whom he has entrusted the governance and moderation of those places, thinking that the people will follow the manners and examples of the magistrates and thus purer and sincere religion can be abolished and antiquated, just as, alas, we see it done in Constance and Ulm. If only he would tighten the reins and bit on those who not only refuse to approach him but also strive to drive others away from him. I ask that you ensure these enclosed letters are delivered to Geneva by a trustworthy and certain messenger as soon as you conveniently can; for they pertain to the Marquis of Naples. I ask that you commend me to your family and to Bibliander and the Englishman Butler. Farewell. Strasbourg, September 6, 1551.</p>
      <p>Christopher Mont.</p>
