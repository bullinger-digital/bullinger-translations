      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The testimony of the Scottish school and the brothers in the Kingdom of Scotland, who proclaim Christ, given to our confession through this public document, which I am sending, has greatly delighted me. For I wanted to make both you and the good men there with you participants in this joy of mine. From Germany, nothing worth mentioning is reported, except that the Austrian princes are living in conflicts. Maximilian is said to be hurrying to Prague to seek aid and establish levies. Thus, Ferdinand has set out for the County of Tyrol. Switzerland will scarcely escape; it will also be demanded to bring help against the Turk, to involve itself in an unnecessary war. Farewell.</p>
