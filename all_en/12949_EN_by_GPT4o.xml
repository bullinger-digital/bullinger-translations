    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Altieri's pain over the dire developments in Germany would have almost disappeared due to Bullinger's and [Konrad Gessner's] letter [not received], if not for the unexpected news of the defeat of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and his capture by the merciless Emperor Charles V. This disastrous news almost robbed the devout of their last courage. But although God allows such things, they console themselves in the faith that He will one day rescue both the Elector and them from this misery. Meanwhile, all those who were unfaithful to [the Schmalkaldic League] and refused to help, even though it was their duty, must reckon with a harsh punishment from God. [The devout in Venice] are trying to compose themselves and hope for good things from the prayers [of the people of Zurich]. For them, [Bullinger's and Gessner's] letters would be encouraging.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] All lovers of freedom should know that they will lose it if they do not oppose the machinations of the Emperor. Yet, they could not lose their salvation through any tribulation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] This chaotic letter shows how great Altieri's pain is, which impaired him while writing. Greetings, also to the colleagues.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Altieri would have sent the letter from Bartolomeo del Prato [No. 2874] long ago if he had had a trustworthy messenger. Bullinger should reply to del Prato, as he holds him in high regard. Again, greetings.</p>

      <p>Most illustrious and esteemed in the Lord, your letters almost drew us away with their joy from the sorrow we had too bitterly conceived from the affairs of Germany being so unhappily conducted, if not for the unexpected and lamentable event of the most illustrious Duke of Saxony, which recently renewed our grief. Alas, as they say, the Lord has delivered him captive into the hands of the most merciless Emperor! This matter has so sharply afflicted the spirits of the pious that we seem almost cast down; for nothing could be heard from us either more bitter or more atrocious. But we are consoled by the hope that, since such things have happened by God's will, it must also be believed that both the Duke himself and we will eventually be rescued from these troubles, although a severe judgment awaits both those who rashly deserted this cause and those who, when they could and absolutely should have, refused to help voluntarily. Meanwhile, we will be of strong spirit, as much as we can, especially aided by your prayers; which will be easier if you write to us frequently. If you do this, as I hope, it will be most gratifying not only to me, who uniquely observes you, but to all the pious.</p>

      <p>Moreover, all those who are most ardent in defending liberty should set this before their eyes, that unless they oppose the endeavors of the Emperor, they will soon lose it, although the children of God cannot perish, even when they seem utterly overwhelmed by the greatest calamities.</p>

      <p>These things, which I have written to you tumultuously, are so that you may recognize the bitterness of my grief, which has drawn me away from writing. Farewell in the Lord and love me mutually and greet the other brothers in my name.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I would have sent the letters of Bartolomeo del Prato long before now if I had had someone to whom I could freely and safely entrust them. But write back, I beg you, most candid Bullinger, not so much for my sake as for his! For he loves you in a wonderful way. Again, farewell. Given in Venice, on the third Ides of May 1547. Yours most devotedly, Baldassare Altieri.</p>
