  <input>Gratiam et pacem a domino, charissime Heymryche. Hic, quem vides, Carolstadius est, homo sane talis, qualem se Luterus esse credit, cum tamen non sit alius, quam ipse Carolstadium esse prędicat. Eum deduci ad iter, quod Basileam pergit, facito. Strennue pauper est, quapropter, qui quid potestis, iuvate et opitulamini, non ut nostra hauriatis, sed ut de nostro quid ei refectionis obveniat.

Vale et Gervasio salutem nostro nomine iubeto.

Tiguri, 22. die junii diluculo 1530.

Huldrych Zuinglius tuus.

Carolstadius ad nos transmigrabit, donec ei divina bonitas prospiciat. Liberos abit adductum, quorum tres habet, et eos mares.

Heimrycho Bullingero, Brangarti evangelistę, fratri suo charissimo.</input>
  <output>Greetings and peace from the Lord, dearest Heymryche. This one you see is Carolstadius, a man indeed such as Luther claims to be, although he in truth is no other than he himself proclaims he is Carolstadius. Make him go on the journey that goes to Basel. He is a poor man, so help and assist him with all you can, not to get for ourselves, but so that something of ours may come to him as sustenance. 

Farewell and give Gervasius my regards. 

Tiguri, early morning of 22nd of June 1530.

Your Huldrych Zuinglius.

Carolstadius will be travelling with us, until divine goodness provides for him. He will be taking his children with him, of which he has three, and they are all boys.</output>
