      <p>Greetings. Although, as I understand, the people of Bruges have worked on your advice with our most esteemed senate for Johannes Blattner, so that he may be sent to other parts for the sake of studies, nevertheless, driven by necessity, it seemed to the school authorities and the entire senate to recall him here along with Konrad Alder and it was assigned to me to inform them of this. Therefore, I write to them and send money, with which they may satisfy their creditors. I also write to the lord provost. When they arrive, I think two others should be sent in their place, through whom I will ensure that the senate writes again to the lord provost. My stipend here has finally been set such that I receive annually 120 local florins, 50 bushels of wheat, 10 bushels of oats, 15 urns of wine; all calculated to 200 florins. I am content with whatever the Lord has given. Indeed, I leave behind better things, but I do not care; for me, what matters is piety and a spirit content with its lot, and having food and clothing, I will be content with these. I did not want you to be unaware of this.</p>
      <p>I can still learn nothing certain about the Valesians. We also hear that the Rhaetians are in turmoil; I expect something certain from you here. Schertli, who will leave here today, sends you many greetings, and thinks he will soon come to Zürich as well; what he is planning, you will learn better from him than from me. Farewell. All of ours send you greetings.</p>
      <p>Lord Jodokus is somewhat unwell, yet still without danger to his life. D. Musculus and D. Eberhard send you many greetings; my wife and children also pray to the Lord for perpetual health for you and yours, whom you will also greet in my name. Bern, 15th of May, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
