      <p>S. P. Lord Johannes Andronicus greeted me very kindly in your words, most illustrious lord, most esteemed brother in Christ, for which I give you the greatest thanks I can and pray that you do not cease to pursue and embrace me with the humanity and benevolence you have begun. Your letters, in which you did not hesitate to respond to the questions of the Emden brothers, were delivered to me most faithfully, and as they were full of benevolence and piety, they could not have been more pleasing to me. The fact that I have not responded sooner, nor given thanks, was not due to laziness, much less contempt, but due to a lack of messengers. Therefore, let us love each other mutually, my lord and brother, and let the unity that is usually seen among the children of one family be apparent in our concord and love. I will make every effort to ensure that our begun friendship takes root and grows for the glory of God and, as I hope, for the edification of His church. Today I told Mr. Froschauer some things, which he said would not be unpleasant to you, and since a messenger from Basel offered himself, I wanted to briefly mention them, and I beseech you again and again that they may be pleasing. On the 3rd and 4th of June, a public disputation on the Lord's Supper was held between a certain Johannes St√∂ssel, preacher of the Duke of Saxony, and Mr. Peter Boquin, professor at Heidelberg, in the presence of the Dukes of Saxony and the Palatinate, along with the excellent and noble Count Georg von Erbach. But it was more of an altercation than a disputation.</p>
      <p>The theses of both parties were published, but the matter was left unresolved.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, from that colloquy, the best prince (if any other) the Palatine was not moderately confirmed in the true opinion, who was slandered throughout the city with infamous pamphlets and libels as a Sacramentarian, along with all his counselors, the ecclesiastical senate, and professors, who were all also depicted as Sacramentarians among the common people. As they were growing beyond measure in Germany, they could not be more conveniently restrained than if they were all slaughtered at once, which writings moved the prince's mind to diligently inquire into the author, and it was finally discovered that the son of a court preacher was spreading these, who, along with his father, was forced to leave the Palatinate. The other court preacher is pious.</p>
      <p>With this monster expelled, there remained one parish priest more devoted to Luther than to Christ, who was deprived of his office on the first of September and also forced to exile from the Palatinate.</p>
      <p>I think Caspar Olevian succeeded him, who began to preach the gospel in Trier a year ago. He is a man of the most upright doctrine and morals, and endowed with not a little zeal.</p>
      <p>Three excellent and most learned men have been appointed over the students who are supported by the prince's stipends (about forty, if I am not mistaken), who have also embraced the true opinion of the Lord's Supper, retain it, and defend it vigorously. I therefore hope that the whole Palatinate will soon be brought back.</p>
      <p>For the prince ordered it to be publicly announced in a sermon that he retains the opinion of the Lord's Supper which our churches follow. From these, you will easily make a judgment.</p>
      <p>The excellent and truly noble Counts von Erbach are in the place of teachers to the Elector, and about forty Saxons wrote a supplication to Duke Johann Friedrich of Saxony, in which they ask for a synod to be convened from the rightly (that is) thinking doctors, in which they wish to exclude the Osiandrists, Anabaptists, Zwinglians, and Sacramentarians, who have already been condemned many times. However, they want to hear those they call Majorists, Adiaphorists, and those who defend free will, so that they, who have already been frequently condemned otherwise, may now be judged and condemned solemnly.</p>
      <p>The conditions proposed are most unjust, namely that the Sacred Scriptures, along with the Augsburg Confession, the Apology, the Smalcald Articles, and the writings of the third Elijah Martin Luther, should be in the place of a judge. However, Count Georg von Erbach wrote annotations on this supplication, in which he excellently describes the tyranny of the Saxons and declares the utmost injustice. He writes another form of synod, which could be followed and retained without any prejudice to the Swiss, Savoyard, French, and English churches.</p>
      <p>For he advises that the ministers of the principal churches in the empire be convened first. If they agree among themselves, it will be well done.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, those who are not subject to the empire will be heard. If, however, there is no agreement among the imperialists, the other churches remain in their liberty and integrity. If ours are heard once (such is now the fairness among the principal princes and the clarity in our cause) that I do not doubt victory at all. Furthermore, at my recent urging, Count Georg (to whom, beyond all merit, I am dear and familiar as a son or brother) to propose this form of synod to other princes under the auspices of the Elector, he replied that your letters to him and his brother Count Eberhard (which I also read diligently) were an obstacle, in which you gravely and prudently dissuade the colloquy. But having compared the forms; on the one hand, the one you thought should be followed, on the other, the one the count had written, I could not find your counsel to be in conflict with the count's thoughts, because you dissuaded a general one in this ulceration of minds, he proposed a national one, so I did not cease to urge him to proceed.</p>
      <p>What will happen in the end, I do not know.</p>
      <p>This one thing I know in the meantime, that the truth can be opposed, but not conquered.</p>
      <p>But enough of this for now.</p>
      <p>Today I received two letters from Wilhelm Klebitz, one written in Groningen, the other in Emden, in which he indicates that Tilemann Heshusius, who had publicly slandered the Countess of East Frisia in Bremen and called it the asylum of all Sacramentarians, was expelled from Bremen with the greatest ignominy through the efforts of Count Albrecht von Oldenburg (who had summoned him to court, taking up the defense of his sister). The state of religion in Frisia is uncertain, the sons of the countess are held captive in Sweden, and a change of affairs is feared upon their release.</p>
      <p>Concerning France, I wish that many things were as true as they are joyful and pleasing, which are reported. The firstborn of the King of Sweden is said to be about to marry the Queen of England.</p>
      <p>May God preserve the pious church.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Give many greetings in my name to Lord Martyr, Walther, and your other fellow ministers, my dearest brothers. Hastily in the Froschauer workshop, Frankfurt, September 11.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Petrus Dathenus, minister of the Flemish church.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and teacher. In Zurich.</p>
