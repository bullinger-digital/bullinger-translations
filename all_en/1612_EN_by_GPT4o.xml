      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you, dear friend. We have received your Latin and German copies of the book you dedicated to us, with gracious thanks for this and other favors, showing your kind intentions. Regarding the aforementioned book, we are sending you herewith a sample of our wine, the best we currently have. If we could be with our people in Reichenweier, we might have improved it, graciously hoping you will consider our current situation and how our affairs unfortunately stand, and regard this small gift as a sign of our goodwill more than the work itself.</p>
      <p>For we are well-disposed towards you with grace. Dated Schaffhausen, the 6th of April, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of W[ürttemberg] etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
      <p>"The barrel is over 6 eimers full with very good wine and was taken from the warehouse to Alsace and there given away, the head costing 5 b 4 haller and the money taken in the city treasury, 9th April 1552."</p>
