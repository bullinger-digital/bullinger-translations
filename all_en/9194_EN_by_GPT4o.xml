      <p>Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely, to Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Your letters cannot but be most delightful to me, reverend brother in Christ, as they breathe so much piety and humanity.</p>
      <p>I sincerely congratulate you on the strength of body you proclaim, which by the grace of God is sufficient for you to fulfill your duty; may the gracious Lord grant you this for many years to the glory of His name and the edification of the church. Together with you, I glory in the Lord that by His generosity, at the age of seventy-four, I am not deprived of strength to adorn, however I can, the role I have been assigned, except that the trembling of my hands somewhat hinders my writing. I only strive with my Lord that I may not languish in my function, but may become more ardent until the very last act of the play. I am sorry that you are deprived of the abundance of your books. I have sent to our printer to send some to you, which I faithfully assure you he will do, unless all the books have been sold. As for what you write about the Turks and those who side with them, we must admit that we live in an evil age and have fallen into very perilous times. And when this matter comes to the minds of the pious, they admire the inscrutable judgments of God to the point of astonishment, wondering what will become of the pious: so many Christian kingdoms occupied and devastated by the Turks, and now the threat hanging over our own heads, the Christian religion pushed into a corner and torn apart by endless dissensions and contentions, and finally, cruel persecutions by the papists everywhere harassing and vexing it; for three transgressions and for four, the Lord will not turn back. I also greatly fear what outcome our most obstinate contentions and the spirits of wicked men, most alien from love, will have. Would that they would heed the sound advice of your little book, which you recently published on the concord of ministers; but that is more to be wished for than hoped. You can learn something about these dissensions from Gwalter, an excellent man. Our people still persist in creating new things, they criticize the prayer in which we ask God to deliver us from all adversities.</p>
      <p>We use in our prayers the canticle of the Blessed Virgin, John the Baptist, and the old man Simeon.</p>
      <p>They do not tolerate this.</p>
      <p>We use at the end of each psalm, when recited with the people present, "Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit"; they call this babbling.</p>
      <p>But I cease to trouble you further with these vanities. We ask God for a remedy for these, meanwhile we do not cease to counter such evils as far as the Lord deigns to supply strength. I have not yet received your book on the persecutions of the church. I wish you, my esteemed brother in Christ, to live many years in safety and to work for the restoration of the church of God until the end. I have sent to our Julius six crowns of our currency.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted brother in Christ, Bishop and servant of the Church of Ely, Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely.</p>
