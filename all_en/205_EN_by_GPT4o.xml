      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not sent you any letters, dearest Bullinger, since the return of our Sulzer to you, is simply that there has been no one to whom I could entrust a letter, which I mention so that you do not suspect it was due to any negligence. I received your letters and those of the beloved Haller two days ago. I am still uncertain about what I should do in the matter you both are involved in, because I have not yet received any letters from Augsburg, which greatly troubles me, so much so that the poet's line applies to me concerning my own home: "Love is full of anxious fear." Added to this is the fact that Haller described the state of that church in such a way that I am somewhat deterred; for among other things, he wrote to me: "Here it is also my duty, I think, not to hide from you what some brothers and other pious people think of you; as they are suspicious, they seem to perceive a danger in that, in your published commentaries, you appear to align too little with our side and to insist too much on presenting the matters themselves and attributing power to the sacraments, although they themselves do not deny the presentation, which, however, is done in their own way, and that you have studied both sides so that you have not clearly pronounced on either, and thus, that the adversaries here assert their part is defended, and boast about your writings, twisting them in some way to their own understanding, while ours (though only the more practiced) can explain and interpret them to a better part. They think there is a danger that if the adversaries' side, now cast down, could be raised by you if you were to treat such matters obscurely." Haller writes to me quite extensively about these and other matters pertaining to the same issue, which somewhat hold back my spirit from readily accommodating to that church. I am considering how troublesome it will be to live among brothers whose minds are burdened with a sinister suspicion of me, and how difficult it will be to act among those who are still occupied with a spirit of contention, so as not to offend either side, especially as a stranger and ignorant of the customs of that people, to which is added the fact that our Haller, whose presence might perhaps refresh me for a while, will not remain there. As for the sacramental cause about which they have contended, I can testify with a good conscience before Christ that I utterly detest whatever carnal, crude, and absurd interpretations are imposed on it, knowing the matter itself to be spiritual, about which Chrysostom says: [Greek] that it requires spiritual senses of sincere faith, and that whatever is attributed to that external and visible symbol is to be understood not properly, but symbolically and sacramentally. However, although I feel this way, I will hardly be able to satisfy those who read my writings with a judgment not sufficiently refined. This thought torments me at present, which I wanted to open to you as a sincere brother in Christ and of like mind, so that you may consider with me what you think should be done, no differently than if you were in my place, from which fate I pray the Lord to preserve you forever. I love Haller very much and know how candid his mind is towards me, so it would be most desirable if we could live together in some place. But these are the circumstances that somewhat trouble me, about which I ask you to write to me when you have leisure. Among other things, Haller asks that I do not commit myself to the people of Basel unless I have first written to him about it. I have decided to obey him, although no one here has brought anything of this to me so far, and otherwise, I judge that I should not hasten to assume any condition, but should wait for certain and clear signs of divine counsel. I would have written about this to our Haller, but there is no one at hand to whom I can give letters going to Bern, nor do I dare to inquire about such matters from the brothers of this church, lest I arouse any suspicion in them. Therefore, I await the first opportunity, by which I may respond to Haller's letters. You, if it seems appropriate, can communicate this to him.</p>
      <p>If you have any news from Augsburg about what has happened there since my departure, please let me know. I cannot certainly understand what the people of Strasbourg, Constance, and Lindau are planning; for I very rarely go out. May the Lord grant that some evangelical republics at least may so sanctify His truth that they would rather risk all their fortunes than accept antichristian mandates and deny the known truth, so that there may be some place for declaring heavenly power and glorifying the divine name in this most corrupt age.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, brother and dearest host in the Lord. Greetings to your most honorable wife and all your children, and finally to the dearest brothers in Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 19.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, lord and dearest brother.</p>
