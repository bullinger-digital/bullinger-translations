      <p>To the honorable lord and father, you have long understood sufficiently the form and nature of the governments of these lands, therefore you will be less surprised by the things I am now writing to you.</p>
      <p>Know then, that in our lands there is great unrest, for which the people of Bergell are the primary cause, to whom the leaders and partly the lower Engadiners have allied themselves.</p>
      <p>They are strengthening daily, riding from community to community, and have also brought a large part of the Oberhalbsteiners (who are a powerful people) to their side; it is almost like a plague. For when our lords from the Three Leagues sent a distinguished embassy to the Oberhalbsteiners, among whom was also the land judge Florin from the Upper League, they treated them so disgracefully that they barely escaped with their lives, thanks to the help of some honorable people from those places, who earnestly drove away their own.</p>
      <p>And God has arranged it so that no one from Chur was among the envoys; otherwise, no separation would have helped. For they are so bitter against the people of Chur, for no other reason than that they would like to have more power; for Chur is remarkably rich. Therefore, a certain number of people have risen up against the city of Chur, numbering in the several thousands; one must therefore be on guard, whether this unfortunate people will attack by day or night and make an attempt; for the real leaders know all the paths and ways, and have also experienced war. Here in Chur, we are also preparing as much as possible, with artillery and all munitions.</p>
      <p>If you want to know the reasons the people give for their undertaking, it is this: they insist that all lords should be idle.</p>
      <p>But if I had not seen all things with my own eyes and grasped them with my hands and stumbled over them with my feet, I might think that the people were serious.</p>
      <p>But you should believe me and will in the future experience it as truth in its essence: Härtli von Salis and his followers, who are helping with such unrest, have brought the Spaniard into the country with great promises and have engaged him, have also conducted business with the Spaniard until the end, carried out his practices, spent money, rode around, been with and among him, as much and as long as they saw that they could not achieve much at this time.</p>
      <p>They have fallen to the point of wanting all lords to be idle; for they think that this would be significant among the common people, who do not understand their practices.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they lie with the Spaniard under the covers, and this so openly that it cannot be hidden from all right-minded people; for Härtli's son has been promised an annual pension of a thousand crowns from Milan. And although many simple country people allow themselves to be led around by the nose, the people of Bergell cannot have any excuse, as they claim they want all lords to be idle, but in their court, there are more than anywhere else in the Leagues, those who hang on to all lords and always to the nearest, whom they let go unpunished. Therefore, many honest men can see and indeed grasp the deceit and fraud, and truly fear that this is just the beginning of the misery.</p>
      <p>My lords write to the honorable council of the city of Zurich and request that they have a confederate loyalty towards us and help protect against violent force, should the need arise.</p>
      <p>If they have any concerns, they use the law; then the guilty will be found. The leaders know that Chur has particularly valued the Spanish alliance; therefore, they let the greatest anger fall upon the city of Chur, although also upon others; for the courts are united with Chur and otherwise a large part in the Leagues, and that is the best. The nearest villages show themselves friendly and offer much good, and one must therefore wait. - I did not want to leave you uninformed about these things in great haste.</p>
      <p>If you or Dr. Collinus, my lord brother-in-law, want to write something, you can do so with this messenger.</p>
      <p>I could not write to the lord landammann Bäldi; for I did not have the time.</p>
      <p>If you send him this letter, it would be of service to me. You can also inform other lords with you; for you will undoubtedly find it to be as I write, as it is in the report.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur, the 10th of February in great haste, in the year 1565. Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
