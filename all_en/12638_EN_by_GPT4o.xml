    <p xml:id="regest1">The last thing heard was a letter from Georg Frölich [No. 2574], according to which the [Schmalkaldic] army has moved from Ingolstadt to Donauwörth. There is a fear [in Zurich] that the [Schmalkaldic League] may have become negligent, even though their enemy is cunning, powerful, and experienced. If they continue to wander around aimlessly and achieve nothing, who will bear the high costs of the war? However, Bullinger comforts himself with the thought of divine providence and goodness, and with the knowledge that the cause [of the Protestants] is just and that the Lord has never abandoned His own.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am pleased to report that our army, having left Ingolstadt, has moved towards Donauwörth. This is the latest information we have. We are very concerned here, lest our forces become negligent. The enemy is extremely cunning, powerful, and experienced. Our forces are wandering aimlessly at times. The expenses are increasing. If they continue to wander and achieve nothing, who will ultimately supply the enormous and more than royal expenses? But in these thoughts, I am greatly comforted by divine providence, grace, and mercy, and the goodness of the cause, and because I see that the Lord has never abandoned His own, and has always broken the impious attempts, arts, power, and ferocity. Let us pray diligently that He may do so now as well, or, if it seems good to Him to test our faith and prove us, that He may grant us constancy in faith and patience in trials.</p>
