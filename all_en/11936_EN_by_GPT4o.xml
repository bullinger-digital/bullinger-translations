    <p xml:id="regest1">From Speyer, it is reported that the Electors and Princes have granted the Emperor [Charles V] 24,000 foot soldiers and 4,000 horsemen, which he will divide with King [Ferdinand I] to fight against [Francis I] or [Suleiman I]; the mentioned estates and princes want to declare Francis [I] an enemy of Christendom due to his alliance with the Turks, of which the Confederates will soon be informed; their response needs to be carefully considered, as their reputation in the Empire is at stake, and it should be as unanimous and general as possible. Greetings to [Diethelm] Röist. He is very concerned about news and its transmission. He hopes that no disadvantages will arise for him through [their communication to] Treasurer [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, but he trusts Bullinger's judgment on his trustworthiness. At five o'clock [in the afternoon], he has not yet found a messenger, but he wants to send the letter quickly and not use a city messenger to avoid suspicion. [1. Enclosure:] Draft of a letter from the Confederates to the Imperial Estates: They view with concern the conflict between [Charles V] and [Francis I] and wish for its resolution, but ask for leniency if some Confederates go to war due to their alliance obligations or if they cannot prevent disobedient subjects from doing so. [2. Enclosure:] Asks Bullinger to inquire about Swiss legal decisions regarding the inheritance claims of children who were placed in a monastery by their parents but were disinherited after the Reformation due to starting a family or had once renounced their inheritance; similarly inquires about the validity of such wills drawn up at the Chamber Court, the Court of Rottweil, or the Land Court, and asks for concrete examples from the Confederation. He has forgotten this so far and asks for a prompt response, which does not have to be sent immediately by this messenger.</p>

      <p>Dear and good friend, there has once again been a message from Speyer, and the situation seems very dangerous. The Electors and Princes have granted the Emperor 24,000 foot soldiers and 4,000 horsemen at their expense. They are to be divided between His Majesty and the Roman King against the French and the Turks, as it suits them best. The division has been made so that the Emperor will take 16,000 foot soldiers and 3,000 horsemen; the remaining 8,000 foot soldiers and 1,000 horsemen will be taken by the King for defense against the Turks. The mentioned estates and princes want to declare the French, because he has allied with the Turks, as their and the common Christendom's enemy. Soon, you Confederates will also be written to by the Empire and warned against the French, as you will well understand, etc. Therefore, consider how you wisely act. Much will depend on your response. Good honorable people in the Empire and favorable to the Confederation speak much about it, that if you do not act prudently, it will cause much trouble. If you Confederates separate from each other and give a divided response, you will greatly strengthen your adversaries. If the places then follow the same footsteps as those who have taken money and caused much misery, it will sound bad before God and all honorability in the Empire. And perhaps it would be most appropriate to give a general response without bias to both parties. I will share with you further thoughts and speeches of wise and understanding people, etc.</p>
      <p>Please convey many, many services, good wishes, and greetings to my kind lord Röist. Always keep me brotherly in your prayers.</p>
      <p>You know and believe not how I, against my habit, strive and exert myself to learn these things without delay and to hear the good opinions of understanding people in this matter. May the faithful God grant temporal and eternal peace through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>You should be certain and without doubt that I will spare no effort in investigation, also in writing down everything that I may consider important to you. However, that such does not bring me any disadvantage. Regarding Treasurer Lavater, since you suggested to me that he is no less trustworthy than Mr. Röist, I will let it happen, for I trust your judgment so much that you can now, from experience, well assess whom to trust or not.</p>
      <p>I write this at three o'clock; I have sent it at five, but cannot find a messenger. I would like one to go further and be with you by Tuesday morning. I will close the letter, as I have sent out another messenger, so as not to delay it; I do not need to use a city messenger to prevent suspicion. I will write the time on the letter.</p>
      <p>Given on the 4th day after Palm Sunday.</p>
      <p>AB.</p>
      <p>Dearest lord and brother, I earnestly request you to inquire as much as possible from those who are usually sent to your lords' meetings, whether such cases have also come before the common Confederates and what has been said about them, what might also be expected from them in this regard; namely, that the elders, inside or outside a Confederation, establish a will and disinherit some of their children for no other reason than that the children followed them in their childhood and went into monasteries, but later, when they became aware of the matter, left again and entered a state in which they are blessed with children by God.</p>
      <p>Item, what has been said in such cases, where the children have renounced their inheritance out of ignorance.</p>
      <p>Item, how it is handled with those who have not renounced and yet are disinherited by the elders solely for the aforementioned reason.</p>
      <p>Item, whether such wills are allowed to stand if they are drawn up before the Chamber Court or the Court of Rottweil.</p>
      <p>Item, how in the case they are drawn up before the Land Court. And if you could provide me with some examples of how the common Confederates have dealt with this and what has been said; for I am somewhat concerned about a good friend, for which I earnestly ask you to make every effort on my behalf and to inform me of such.</p>
      <p>I wanted to send this to you earlier, but in the haste, it slipped my mind. As soon as you can, please inform me; it does not have to be immediately with this messenger.</p>
      <p>Bullinger's own.</p>
