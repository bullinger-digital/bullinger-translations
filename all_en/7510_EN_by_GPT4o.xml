      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray with all my heart and diligently commend my respect for you.</p>
      <p>If your affairs were such, Bullinger, most illustrious man and highly esteemed friend, that you were in good health both in body and mind, nothing could be more pleasing to the whole church of God and to us personally. I, content with mediocrity, still enjoy prosperity and moderate health. Some years ago, I had decided to send my son Jost [Iodocus] to you for the sake of learning, piety, and especially to acquire knowledge of the arts, out of my great respect for you. However, since he either did not want to or could not fulfill my wishes, I arranged for him to learn the manual craft, which we call furriery, not so much for the sake of practice but because the trade is in great demand here. He has now learned this craft for several years and has been declared a partner by his master in this art and profession. However, since the true and uncorrupted voice of the gospel resounds in your republic and moral discipline is practiced with piety, I wish for him to practice and refine this craft with you at this time. Therefore, most illustrious and esteemed friend, I commend this my firstborn son of better character to you with the recommendation that is fitting for a son to be commended by a father, humbly asking that you provide him with an honest and pious man where he can further practice this craft. I do not desire that he should do so for any common profit, as others are accustomed to do; for I wish to provide him with all necessities, as Mr. Christoph Tretius, my singular friend, will arrange with you on my behalf; but I only ask that he make greater progress in this craft of furriery and learn the German language. If I obtain this from your piety and if you pursue my son with the benevolence and humanity with which you are accustomed to pursue all others commended to you, I promise you perpetual gratitude and will serve and gratify you and yours in any matters with both diligence and willingness. I ask that you accept and consider the small gift that Mr. Christoph Tretius brings to you on my behalf as a token of my highest respect for you. What remains, I commend myself and my son to you and all the people of Zurich, my greatest friends, of better character, and I pray to the most good and great God that He may bless all your endeavors with the grace of His Holy Spirit. Farewell most happily for the edification of the church of God and our consolation. I greet all your colleagues, our most esteemed lords and brothers.</p>
      <p>Given in Wieliczka from our salt mines on June 22, 1568. Mr. Christoph Tretius will report on Polish matters, both ecclesiastical and political, as he has all knowledge and insight.</p>
      <p>Most devoted and respectful to you, Andreas Szadkowski, notary of the Wieliczka salt mines, by my own hand... with piety and distinguished learning... indeed to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger... bishop of the church of Zurich... most esteemed, lord and friend most... </p>
      <p>"Mr. Andreas Szadkowski, scribe of the salt mines in Poland 1568. Commends his son, sends money".</p>
