      <p>Most esteemed Lord. I hope that the Spaniard to whom I sent letters from you in July has delivered them in good faith. He was indeed a good man and very fond of you and your piety. His name was Julio, and he reported some remarkable things about you. Otherwise, I do not usually entrust letters to just anyone. In those letters, I wished to be informed by you whether my letters written last year to the most honorable man, Mr. Adolf von Baers, and sent through Froschauer to you, have been delivered to Mr. Adolf. I would not want them to have been lost. And I have not yet been informed, even by a word, whether he has received them or not. Therefore, my brother, make sure that I know something more certain about this. Then I hear that you have the Polychronicon and other Greek authors, which you have translated into Latin from Greek. Why do you keep this treasure to yourself? Share it with the church and the brothers. Otherwise, I do not think much of those new Greek books, which today are brought to light from ancient writers. For I fear that some do not use them in good faith. However, since your faith and integrity are very well known to me, I would indeed value what comes from you. Therefore, my brother, make sure that we may enjoy those good authors sometime and soon. Perhaps you have heard what the powerful of this age are planning regarding the celebration of a Council. It is said to be free by them, but it will be celebrated in the old manner and for no other purpose than deceit. May the Lord scatter all the plans of the impious, and preserve His afflicted church and deliver it from evil. Give my most dutiful greetings to your Cornelius, and to those who love me who are with you in Cologne. Farewell. ZÃ¼rich, 28 August 1560. Your Bullinger.</p>
