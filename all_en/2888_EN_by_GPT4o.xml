      <p>I cannot now, as you love me, write anything, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, except that I send a full document concerning the response of King Ferdinand; another, as soon as I received it back from you, I sent to Basel to be received next Sunday and will diligently ensure it is copied for you. I add another document, which my excessive haste recently left behind, so that it would not be sent with the other one. Forgive me through Jesus Christ, that I write nothing else; there is a domestic matter that greatly torments me, for which reason I must now write much. I am very grateful to you for your most loving letters. I will make sure on the next occasion that, if not in learning or piety, at least in the length of my letters, I will match you. Pray diligently for us with your household, which I earnestly ask you to greet courteously along with all friends. I have delivered your letters to Fuchs, whom I have also informed about the messenger through a young man and I think he will write. You will pray for him continually; he could not calm his troubled mind so as to dare to be present with us at the Lord's Supper. I grieve exceedingly for his situation and hope that the spirit of the Lord will sweetly overcome this bitterness of mind of a good man with the sweetness of charity. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Biel/Bienne, 7th April 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his H. Bullinger.</p>
