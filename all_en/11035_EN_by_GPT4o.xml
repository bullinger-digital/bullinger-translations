      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and godfather, the bearers of this letter have been highly recommended to me by Dr. Vadian from St. Gallen with an earnest request that I should assist them. Therefore, I ask you to take them under your protection, along with Mr. Pelagius Amstein, the preacher from the Rheintal, who is being severely accused, but through testimonies (witness statements), as they are then directed against the servants of the gospel. Let the poor, oppressed, and troubled be commended to you, and you will have fortune and salvation. And may God be with you.</p>
      <p>Greet for me the Schultheiß of Bern, etc.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, April 25, 1537.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your entirely willing.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise Hans Rudolf Lavater, currently at the Diet in Baden, his kind, dear lord and godfather.</p>
