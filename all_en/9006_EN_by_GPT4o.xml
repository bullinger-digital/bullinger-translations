      <p>You will hear the most terrible, cruelest, and most monstrous news from our Lochmann, and I do not doubt that in France alone more than three hundred thousand will offer their throats, without regard to their dignity, sex, or age. We are undoubtedly in the same condition, and perhaps this is the last time I write to you. Whether this is truly a universal conspiracy and is now being revealed can hardly be doubted.</p>
      <p>My father, consider that we are in the same danger, and if ever before, now pray with us. I am specifically targeted and think more of death than of life.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Geneva, the first of September 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours, Beza.</p>
