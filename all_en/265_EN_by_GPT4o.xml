      <p>Greetings. Although I am reluctant to make those recommendations that might in any way be burdensome to those to whom they are made, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, the request of pious people often prevails, who demand this duty from me for themselves or their own, so that I cannot possibly refuse. This is the case now, as it has been before, when the parents of that young man, whom you will see in person and who, if I am not mistaken, has been there for a month and a half, are very good people and most accommodating citizens, but with very modest or rather no fortune, earnestly desire from me that I diligently commend their cause to you. For they would like their son, who has been devoted to letters since childhood and is now entering his eighteenth year, to be supported for a while by that alms which your people kindly bestow upon poor students, until better times come, so that he may not be forced to abandon his studies entirely due to this poverty, especially since there is an elderly widow among us who, if I remember correctly, bequeathed a hundred gold coins to the young man, and her last day seems not far off, as she is clearly advanced in age; then he could complete his course of studies more successfully. Therefore, my dearest and best brother, if you can help truly pious people here without great inconvenience and trouble to yourself, I earnestly beseech you again and again to do so for my sake and for the sake of my dearest cousin Zwick, who is very familiar with them. I know you will earn the favor of Christ himself by this, as by scarcely any other means. Besides, there is nothing now that I can write; for I am sending this little letter to the city uncertain of when the young man's mother will set out there. Farewell and commend us diligently to Christ, and be assured that we too, if you perhaps ever recommend someone, will attempt nothing that does not clearly demonstrate our gratitude to you. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Griesenberg, 12th of September, 1548. Yesterday to you through our Gwalther. Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
