    <p xml:id="regest1">Urgently requests a response regarding his further studies, as he does not want to miss the opportunity to accompany Martin Peyer to Wittenberg. Bucer returned on January 21 with news, but Gwalther still knows nothing specific. On behalf of Bedrot, he reports on a Hessian-Saxon delegation to England led by [Franz Burchart], which was richly gifted; Reginald Pole's brother [Henry] has instigated a conspiracy, whereupon the guilty were executed, allegedly including the Bishop of London; the kings [James V] of Scotland and [Henry VIII] of England have made peace and are striving for a connection through marriage politics. In light of the military and diplomatic advances of the Turks, war is generally expected. [Johannes?] Sturm demands, on behalf of the Strasbourg church, a public account from Erasmus Sarcerius for his accusations against Nikolaus Gerbel. Gwalther is particularly supported by Christian Herlin, who also tutors him privately. Has not yet found a messenger for the letter to Nicholas [Partridge]. Bullinger should urge Stephan Willi to return Gwalther's lute tablature. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am eagerly awaiting your letters every day, most gracious patron, in which I would like to be informed about what I should do at the upcoming Frankfurt fair or where I should move. I believe you have understood my desire from the recent letters I sent to you; I would like to know your advice on this matter, as I am so eager for it that nothing could be more pleasing to me than your letters, which would testify to your opinion. Therefore, I ask you, dearest patron, to relieve my mind, which is hanging between hope and fear, with your writings as soon as possible. Martin Beyer has received letters from his people, who give him the freedom to leave; he now desires only one thing, that I accompany him on his journey. Please make it possible for me to visit the Wittenberg school with my dearest friend and sweetest companion, whom I have so far regarded as a brother. The opportunity is, as far as I can guess, most convenient; I earnestly beg that we do not let it pass. For what could be more convenient to alleviate the dangers and tedium of such a great journey than a most faithful friend, to whom you can safely entrust not only your belongings but also yourself? There is also another very great advantage, as he, having previously been a follower of the same school, now knows and understands well how we should arrange both our studies and our way of life there. As for the expenses, which many object to as excessive, they will not be greater than elsewhere, except that in Basel they will indeed be less, but in the meantime, they are not so favorable to my studies. I ask you again, most loving patron, since you alone are the one who has provided and still provides me, an orphan, with advice and assistance, to carefully consider what is in my best interest, and if you have ever taken the utmost care of your Rudolf, grant this now (if it seems to be in my interest), that I may be the companion of my dearest friend, whom I now hold dearer than anyone else among foreigners. But if your opinion is otherwise, I will do whatever you advise; I only ask that you ensure I can have your response on this matter as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Bucer returned to us on January 21, bringing much news, but the knowledge of all these things has not yet reached my ears. However, Mr. Bedrot has instructed me to write to you: Four envoys were sent to England under the auspices of the Landgrave and the Duke of Saxony, the first of whom was Franz Burchart, Vice-Chancellor of the Duke of Saxony, who, after a long debate with the English sophists, were finally dismissed, honored and indeed burdened with honors and gifts. The king himself frequently conversed with them, holding various discussions about the reformation of the church, and finally dismissed them, each with a gift of five hundred angels. Meanwhile, a new conspiracy was discovered, which Reginald Pole's brother, with his brother's advice, had plotted against the king to hinder the reformation of the church and restore papal tyranny to its former seat of dignity. He, along with others involved in this plan, paid the king the deserved penalties. The Bishop of London, too, as it is rumored, who was thrown into prison a few months ago, has now been forced to undergo capital punishment. The cause of Christ is progressing vigorously in the British kingdom, the king supports the pious excellently and does not cease in the duty of a truly good and pious prince. A firm and valid peace exists between the Scots and the English, so much so that the King of Scotland has sent his daughter to the English king's court.</p>
      <p>This policy of the king displeases other princes greatly, and they say that the King of France, when these things were recited to him, said that the King of England is showing himself in all things as those who wish to be expelled from power and, exhausted by the administration of the kingdom, desire to abandon or lose it.</p>
      <p>Everyone here expects war. All fear the forces and power of the Turks; for they, having made a new incursion, have devastated and captured many regions from Hungary. Now Suleiman is trying to obtain free passage through the kingdom of Poland under certain conditions. The envoys of the Emperor, Ferdinand, and the Turks are also meeting in Vienna soon to negotiate a truce. I believe you are not unaware that the Venetians are also being harassed by Turkish incursions. Therefore, I will now conclude my writing, if I add just one more thing, which I believe will cheer you up.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Sarcerius will now, I hope, pay the fitting penalty for his cynical impudence, who in his Rhetoric, that very excellent work indeed, in which he attacks the Zwinglians and tears them apart with savage insults, also accuses the very good old man and most learned Nicholas Gerbel, a citizen of the city of Strasbourg, of sacrilege, and even defends it by affirming it to be at least theft. When these things reached him, he was struck with the utmost bitterness of mind and began to be indignant and to rage, then he sought the advice of other ministers of the Strasbourg church. They, by the common decree of all, had a learned and serious letter written by Sturm, which they sent to Sarcerius through their own messenger, demanding that he himself ensure the printing of Sturm's letter and add his own, in which he either sings a recantation of such a foul crime to the good man or convicts him of this crime. I would have sent you a copy of Sturm's letter, if I did not know it was going to be printed and if the brevity of time did not prevent it.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write, except that my studies are proceeding quite successfully and I am treated kindly by the learned, especially by Mr. Christian Herlin, second to none among the mathematicians of this time, who assists me both publicly and privately. For he publicly teaches Euclid, and privately he has explained to me and Martin Beyer the institution of the sphere, the Geography of Mela, and the more difficult passages of Ptolemy, and he still does not cease to promote my studies in every way and at all times.</p>
      <p>I have not yet been able to find a messenger who would travel either to England or Antwerp; but if I find someone, I will ensure that I write to Nicholas as you instructed. Furthermore, I ask you to tell Stephan Willi to return my book written in lute tablature to me. For I have written to him about this matter three or four times; he neither writes nor sends the book. Therefore, I ask you to ensure that, moved by your authority, he takes care to return my belongings to me.</p>
      <p>Please greet, in my name, your mother and your wife with all your children and the entire household, as well as Georg Stadler and his wife.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, January 25, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Forgive, please, the blots; for these things had to be written by me in haste.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich, my faithful and dear lord.</p>
