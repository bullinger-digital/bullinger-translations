    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's letter [not received] was both informative and pleasing. The latter, because Myconius also believes that prayer [hours] not only promote the piety [of the individual] but also serve as an admonition to the church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The Emperor [Charles V] is a fox, like Herod once was. Even though God has visited him so often, he remains stubborn like Pharaoh. He is completely fallen to the lust for power. [Francis I] of France once insightfully wrote that the Emperor does not intend to be an emperor like his predecessors, but wants to be a monarch of Germany. If he takes Augsburg, he will gain such wealth that he can subdue all of Germany with it. As his slaves, both the [Catholic] and the [Protestant princes] will then have to give up their precious German freedom. Then the Emperor will also march against the [Confederates] to avenge his grandfather Charles [the Bold], Duke of Burgundy; a fear that Erasmus expressed about 30 years ago. The [Confederates] must therefore remain vigilant.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The day before, all the guilds of Basel voted and elected a captain and a banner-bearer for both the company and the banner, to be prepared for anything.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Those who try to justify the Emperor's actions now claim that God wants to use him as a rod against the ingratitude of his own. Myconius made them understand that by doing so, they [indirectly] declared the Emperor godless, since God has always punished his people through the godless. Consequently, they like Charles V just as little as he does, who considers him a Herod, a Turk, a son of the Antichrist, and an even worse emperor than the [Roman Caesars] Maximinus [Daia] and Maxentius! The Emperor's supporters should therefore expect that the one they praise so much might well deprive them of their lives. During the conversation, the Basler Peter Wegerich appeared, who had just returned from Zurich. He conveyed greetings and reported that [Conrad] Gessner was bringing a letter from Bullinger [not received] to Myconius. He also told of an envoy [...] from Lucerne, who tried to justify himself to the Zurichers on behalf of the Five Places for the visit of the Bishop of Constance [Johann von Weeze] and discussed the attitude of the Innerswiss to the latest events. This pleased Myconius very much, especially since he knows that these places are always ready to provide troops for money.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Here now is Myconius' opinion: The Emperor will soon make himself hated even among the [Catholics] and will have to retreat. For waging war against the French is quite different from wanting to destroy Germans by Germans! God is on the side [of the Protestants]. If the Emperor attacks them, he attacks God himself. And if it is true that the Emperor uses the services of this robber, the Count of Musso [Gian Giacomo de' Medici], he will soon experience something similar to what [Charles III] of Savoy once did.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [P.S.:] Myconius will soon write to [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You gratify me beyond measure, most excellent and faithful Bullinger, by informing me of the current tumult. I cannot adequately express this in words. It is of great benefit to me. For they stir joy in me, which I know, and are a cause of devotion in prayer, and they provide a means by which the church can be admonished and urged to pray.</p>

      <p>The Emperor (Kaiser Karl V) is a fox to me, like Herod. I hope, therefore, that he will meet the same end as he did. It is indeed strange that, although he is visited by God with so many plagues, he does not repent; a sure sign that his heart is hardened like Pharaoh's. The desire to dominate, the most vehement of demons, agitates the man. The Frenchman (Franz I) once wrote that his intention among the Germans is not to be like his predecessors, but to be a monarch. Does it not appear likely from what he attempts today that he foresaw this? If Augsburg is conquered (which the Lord forbid), he will have treasures with which he can easily subjugate all of Germany to himself. What will happen then to those who now try to oppress their brothers? They will be his slaves, having lost all the freedom that Germany has gloried in until now: A fitting reward for those who rashly fight against their brothers. If Germany is oppressed, what shall we (the Swiss Confederates) say about ourselves? Will he not attempt what he once conceived against us, which he imbibed with his mother's milk and which his teachers instilled in him? I indeed heard with these ears from Erasmus about 30 years ago that he would avenge his grandfather Charles, Duke of Burgundy, who was killed by the Swiss. From that time, he sought an opportunity, which he now evidently considers to have been offered. What then shall we do? Shall we remain idle? The neighbor's wall is burning. Unless we take care, the fire will also catch and consume us.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, our senate held a selection through all the guilds. They elected two leaders and two standard-bearers, one for the main banner and the other for the lesser, so that they are prepared for any occasion.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Those who are of the opinion that the Emperor cannot sin, after they cannot deny that he is now attempting something insane, say: He wields a rod against us indeed, sent by the Lord because of our ingratitude. But I publicly: "Do you say so? Do you therefore wish to be the scourge of God and thus impious; for God never afflicted his people except through impious idolaters. So you like the Emperor as much as I do. He is a Herod to me, a Turk, a son of the Antichrist, worse than Maximinus and Maxentius, because he has hitherto pretended to be a friend of the Germans and now shows himself to be such; and therefore he is such to you, you feel with me." (Here Peter Wegerich, our citizen from Zurich, intervened. He greets in your name and reports that you sent letters through Gessner, which I have received, etc. He explains about the Lucerne envoy sent to you on behalf of the Five Places, to excuse them because of the Bishop of Constance and to explain what their intentions are in these disturbances. I was very pleased, for I feared them. For, as you know, they rush wherever money is offered!) I return: "Thus," I say, "you praise your Emperor, whom you wish so well. A truly excellent praiser! It would be a wonder if he does not reward you, once he knows, either with a noose or a sword." Thus it is necessary to shut the mouths of those beasts more than beasts.</p>

      <p>But listen to what I think: When the Emperor sees that he has stirred up such a multitude against himself and even some who have not favored the gospel of Christ until now, and begins to despair somewhat, he will change his mind and depart. I am persuaded of this, whatever the Lord will grant. It was one thing to fight against the French; it will be another to want to destroy Germans by Germans: That which you yourself know better to consider. Let him see, therefore, what he undertakes! The Lord stands with us, whom he himself attempts to remove from our midst. Hence he will fight not against us, but against the Lord, who will also try to protect himself, indeed he will protect himself strongly. Let us pray to him in faith, that he may do so, and he will do it. If the Marquis of Musso is the one we know, the Emperor will act unfortunately with the same leader. You know who this is and what he is like. Unfortunate is he who associates with such a great robber! What Savoy felt, let the same Emperor feel, and I will laugh in the Lord.</p>
