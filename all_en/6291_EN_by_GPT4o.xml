      <p> Greetings. I do not cease to trouble you, most excellent man, with my affairs and letters; for I am sending a package addressed to Mr. Gabriel Schlüsselberger, a merchant citizen of Nuremberg, which I would very much like to be properly and promptly taken care of by you or by our Linerus, indeed I beg you and Linerus himself by our friendship, to assist me in this matter, and I will not be ungrateful in the future, if I can reciprocate to you. Among us, the plague continues as it began; it seizes and takes away many everywhere. Last night my daughter Margarita, the wife of our Ludwig Lavater, died; driven by the force of the disease, she gave birth to a little child, for she was pregnant, and she gave birth quite successfully the day before yesterday. The little child passed away soon after baptism; the mother herself followed at the 11th hour of the night; she left behind 7 little children to her husband. From this, you can infer the great sorrows I am enduring. I therefore pray that you pray to the Lord for me. Otherwise, I am firm in hope in the Lord, whose providence I know governs all things, and finally that the Lord is just and his judgments are just, indeed merciful and most compassionate. I know that all things work together for good to those who love God; therefore, I await the Lord my God and have offered to Him all my children, of whom I believe 7 still survive; for one of my sons went abroad, about whom I have heard nothing certain for several months. I have offered myself and all that is mine to the Lord; may He do what is good in His eyes, and have mercy on me and mine. Such is the plague, that once it begins to strike in homes, it hardly ceases before it has finished all, and it greatly infests people and relatives. But such is the will of the Lord. Lavater sends to you these two sermons about the plague that were delivered and written. He greets you, your family, and other good men. I also bid them farewell, especially the venerable elder and well-deserving of the church, Fortmüller, and other brothers and fellow ministers, etc. Farewell forever. </p>
      <p> Zurich, the last day of October 1564. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. May our Linerus be safe above all. </p>
      <p> To the pious and honorable Josua Keßler, city scribe of St. Gallen, my kind lord, dear and good friend. St. Gallen. </p>
