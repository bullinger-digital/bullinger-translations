      <p>You have indeed gained great favor with me, most learned Bullinger, for you have deigned to visit me with your most delightful letters and to gift me with your offspring; for nothing comes from you that has not always been and will not always be most pleasing to me. Certainly, it pains me not a little in the meantime that my abilities have either not yet allowed or still do not allow me to declare how much I love you and acknowledge my debt to you. But if my circumstances are ever to improve, I will indeed make it so that you understand that I both honor your singular piety, as is fitting, and remember that extraordinary kindness which you showed towards me in Z체rich. Now, however, I am compelled, while I find nothing that I can offer you, to ask for a new favor from you. I am very eager to know what you and the other most learned men who are in Z체rich think about predestination and the providence of God. If you ask the reason, there are some here who have been among you and assert that you are too melancholic. However, many among us, in whose number I confess myself to be, embrace the opinion of Johannes Calvin as clear and most agreeable to the sacred writings. And we give great thanks to God that the excellent work of the most learned and best man Johannes Calvin against Pighius and a certain Georgius Sicilianus has recently appeared at the time when this question began to be discussed among us.</p>
      <p>For we admit that he has brought much light, indeed he has handled this whole matter in such a way that we have seen nothing either more learned or clearer until now. Nevertheless, we wish to know what you think, to whom we rightly attribute much. We certainly hope that you do not disagree with his excellent and most learned opinion. At least you will deign to explain what in that little book you either approve, desire, or entirely reject, if indeed you are to reject anything, which we do not easily believe. And these things indeed are these. As for the state of our affairs, Johannes von Ulm, an excellent young man, who is recalled to his homeland by the letters of his family, will explain better. Religion remains intact; the most excellent king is in very good health and adds much daily to learning and piety. But these things more broadly and better, as I said, Johannes von Ulm. Farewell, most illustrious man, and love me in return. You will greet on my behalf the provost, my host, along with the other best and most learned brothers, accurately.</p>
      <p>London, September 10.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Bartholom채us Traheron.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and best man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a brother to be especially honored.</p>
      <p>In Z체rich.</p>
      <p>Traheron.</p>
