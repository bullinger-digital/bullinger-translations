      <p>Greetings. I was surprised that you have not written for such a long time, and there was nothing to sustain me, except that you were not writing to Gastius either.</p>
      <p>I was thinking there must be some reason, whatever it may be. Finally, he said: "Bullinger is bathing," and you wrote that you had returned home from Urdorf, etc. I am completely reassured, I no longer suspect anything bad, but I hope that the bath benefits you well, so that you recover the strength you have had until now; for it is absolutely necessary for both your church and us in these most calamitous times. For indeed, I have seen nothing more calamitous; it seems the Lord is thus preluding to the day of His judgment. Let Him indeed prelude, only may He find us truly waiting for Him in all patience and sound faith, and it will be well for our souls. Regarding Otto's death, if I did not know his salvation was certain, I would have been very distressed for many reasons. But I could not begrudge heaven. That Wolf succeeded him is not displeasing; however, it would have been better if he could have stayed with his studies for a few more years; that young man would have been a miracle. I was very worried about Gessner, which he can hardly believe, as he does not care for me at all, completely forgetful of everything I once contributed to him to the best of my ability. However, I rejoice equally, as I previously grieved, that he has been restored. You recommended a certain person from Cologne, whom I would have helped if I could; I advised him to approach the rector and Amorbach; for they indeed have some influence.</p>
      <p>They provided food for eight days; afterwards, he returned to me to say goodbye, intending to depart for Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>But to the matter at hand. It is written from Bologna that a truce has been made for two years, for which reason Mirandola has long been released, Parma is now being released, and the soldiers (a certain proof) mostly pass through Bologna. For this reason, I do not believe it to be true, what Calvin wrote these days, that the Swiss in Piedmont are so enclosed in the cities that they do not dare to leave due to their small numbers, and that they are waiting for help from France.</p>
      <p>The Turk is said to be heading for Sicily with 200 galleys and a large fleet of cargo ships, and there are those who assert that they have already landed at the promontory of Actium. Hence, a levy in the Kingdom of Naples, Florence, and almost all of Italy.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Crescentius, the president of the Council of Trent, died after he fell into a flux of the belly out of fear, as it is said.</p>
      <p>He had risen one night to write to Rome; entering the room alone and looking at the door, he saw a black dog of remarkable size coming towards him and going under the table at which he was sitting; trembling and horrified, he took a light and searched for the dog, but it vanished. Sorrowful and sighing, he invited two bishops to dinner on the third day, one of whom was Roman, named Iacomellus, who recounted the event as it had happened in Bologna; the cardinal affirmed that from that time he had lost all pleasure in eating and drinking and was getting worse by the day. The force of the disease, after raging for several days, departed, and he was added to his own. The one who reported these things adds: "This is the end of Crescentius, who two years ago on Palm Sunday entered Bologna with indescribable pomp and triumph, to the admiration of all." Furthermore, it is said that the Emperor is in a fortified place among the Carinthians and the enemy at Trento.</p>
      <p>Farewell and congratulate Wolf and Haller in my name. Greet Mr. Pellicanus diligently, Gwalther, and Theodor. He complains that I write nothing, while he does the same.</p>
      <p>I equally wonder; he fills others with letters and stuffs everything he knows, yet he does not greet me, etc. Farewell again with yours in the Lord. In Basel, on the eve of John the Baptist, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>We wonder if the Quinquepagans have been among you. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and best, the most diligent minister of Christ, his most esteemed friend in the Lord.</p>
