      <p>Honorable Lord and Father, I cannot withhold from you the new news that we have here; you may compare it with your own.</p>
      <p>Firstly, a letter has come to the Count who resides in Vaduz, stating that the Huguenots have won.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the bailiff of Feldkirch has also written and mentioned that it comes from the imperial court.</p>
      <p>Following this, a letter from the Abbot of Pfäfers has arrived; it shows the opposition, according to the king's letter.</p>
      <p>This letter has somewhat disheartened us; yet, as I have spoken here with some who have recently come from Schwyz, and have sufficiently understood from them the great sorrow and complaints in the Five Places, as it was also said in Schwyz, the Lutherans are strengthening themselves again, and that all night and sleeping drinks have been abolished, etc., I could immediately conclude that the situation is not entirely as it seems, they are not yet completely defeated; for if they were not concerned about their pride, they would not have shown so much affection to our people, that they would show some sadness.</p>
      <p>Following this, two honorable men from Genoa and Milan have arrived this Friday, who have reported that in Italy it is known that our people have won, that is, the Huguenots, and when asked how it happened, they spoke exactly as your letter (which has come to me with confidence) shows; it does not miss by a hair.</p>
      <p>Yesterday evening, shortly before your letter arrived, I again spoke with two other distinguished men who have come recently from Milan; they said the same.</p>
      <p>In summary: all who come say the same.</p>
      <p>These have also reported that the constable is captured; also, how the first post came to Milan and they wanted to fire celebratory shots, and now as they were pulling away the artillery, another post came, through which they forgot the celebratory shots and canceled it, so that I have no more doubts.</p>
      <p>However, my urgent request to you, my lord and father, is to continue to inform us of what comes at any time.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend myself to your reverence, and also commend the same along with your household to the protection of God.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur on the 11th of January, in the year 1563. I could not send this back; for I have spent this whole day writing, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>Today, however, a fine, noble person from Milan, a merchant, comes and says that in Milan it is known that the Lutherans have won, and that the cavalry of the Guise has been completely shattered.</p>
      <p>I have spoken with this merchant myself, as well as with many others who have come from Milan and Genoa.</p>
      <p>The letter, which some leaders sent out just before the battle, given on the 9th of December in Paris, which those from Schwyz sent to a council in Appenzell, I do not have at hand now; for I have sent it to Captain Georgius.</p>
      <p>In the same state, that 14 companies of Spaniards and 10 Gascons came to them in the camp on the 7th of December (if I remember correctly); Fröhlich saw them on the Saturday before St. Andrew's and died the Friday after.</p>
      <p>Compare this with yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ, to be honored.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
