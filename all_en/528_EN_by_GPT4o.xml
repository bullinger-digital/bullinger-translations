      <p>S. D. I hope that the efforts of my brother have been successful; for I have sent this diligent man bearing letters given by the most honorable council to him. I will not respond further about the skeptics and academics; let us be Christians, and let our speech be: "Yes, yes" and "no, no." All of ours in the city and countryside are very averse to the alliances of princes.</p>
      <p>Everyone prefers, if it pleases God and He favors us, to preserve the given freedom and maintain our infantry, so that we do not sell it to kings, but in times of necessity, we oppose it against enemies for the fatherland. All of ours are devoted to religion, peace, and the fatherland; we will pray diligently, so that we do not drink from the cup of the Lord's wrath as we deserve.</p>
      <p>About the glorious Valentinus, consider this: He is a black priest with a long face, of average height, not thick, named Valentinus, who was once an assistant in the Zuger Piet in Baar many years ago. After a long time, he came to Lungern near Bremgarten; there he was a pastor, and when he was accused by his mistress, as if he had to do with a white mare, my lords of Zürich appointed their bailiff in the Freiamt, named Vogt Holtzhalb at the time, to bring the priest to justice. But the priest evaded justice, fled, and came down when the accusation arose, around Freiburg. I now have my thoughts, whether it might be the Valentinus who might have become a doctor in the meantime; for it is well 10 years or more since he came from there. Valentinus was slanderous, barking, and cunning against Christ; for I disputed with him about justifying faith at Kappel around the year of our Lord 1524 or 1525. But one would have to recognize politely whether he was in the Zuger Piet and in the Confederation as an assistant.</p>
      <p>As soon as one mentioned Lungern to him, he would notice it and not want to be the one he actually is. If he were not, it would be very bad to cast suspicion on him, even if he were like the devil. Therefore, one must act prudently and let no one notice the true purpose until one knows who he is. Mezlerus contended with Bern, spending the night in Zürich while passing through.</p>
      <p>If the imperial forces intended to attack us, our situation would now be good and their advantage smaller; they would not find ours unprepared. If God helps us, we are confident to receive them. We would much prefer to live in peace and have them as friends and neighbors.</p>
      <p>If you have or receive any more and further news, let me know; I know nothing at this time. If your brother could be reconciled, as he was punished, it would be good; if not, we must let God prevail; we will pray to Him for grace. God be with you, your household, sister, and all yours. May 23, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, always.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his very dear brother. Griesenberg.</p>
