    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the commentary on John. Myconius was completely surprised that Luther is reviving the dispute thought to be settled; the disunity among the leading theologians is the only thing that can fundamentally endanger the Reformation; since the attack occurred in a letter to Froschauer and not publicly, it should be ignored for the time being; perhaps Luther will reconsider. It is not true that an oath is required from candidates for church service in Basel; Bullinger's question was likely prompted by the case of [Rudolf Schwyzer], recommended by him and Theodor [Bibliander], with whom Myconius wanted to discuss the [First] Helvetic Confession instead of an exam; [Schwyzer] was not willing to do so and managed to have [Hans] Rudolf Frey recall him to Gelterkinden after the visitation. Theobald Nigri writes that the French [King Francis I] has left Luxembourg and his army is turning against the imperial troops moving towards Picardy, while Emperor [Charles V] himself is waiting in Antwerp for the Diet [of Speyer]; soldiers passing through [Basel] are suffering hardship and report that the Emperor has owed them pay for two months; the "Hellhaufen" is said to be planning an attack on the imperial forces; despite the uncertainty of the rumors, it is certain that the Protestants are in danger; God thereby teaches us to expect help from Him alone. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. For the gift sent for John, may the Lord repay you as you deserve; for I can do nothing but show a benevolent and friendly spirit.</p>
      <p>I had not expected such a thing from Luther as you write. But I see what it is: It is not enough for Satan to have the disturbances with which the Christian world now overflows, unless there is also discord among the men of God; for from this, he can hope that the gospel will be removed again, not from elsewhere. Indeed, I am of the opinion that it has taken such deep roots that no force can uproot it unless dissension arises among the leaders of the word. I had thought all was settled, from which I hoped neither the Turk nor the Spaniard would cause any harm to the gospel, and indeed I was completely at rest until you disturbed my tranquility with this writing.</p>
      <p>I have indicated the matter to a few good and intelligent men, to see if there is any way to find a plan to prevent any harm from arising.</p>
      <p>However, they all unanimously agree that you should ignore the matter, since the letters to Froschauer are not public, and we should all pray to the Lord to grant peace concerning the sound understanding of His word. I like this plan, and all the more because I found in your writings that you are not pursuing Luther with hatred, as you have not done so until now. Therefore, there is nothing else to say now but to ignore the insults until another way is given, by which silence must be broken as if compelled. For who knows if he might regret his actions? You know how to deal with enemies so that they may be won over to the Lord. May the Lord grant us His peace.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you ask, whether we compel those to be ordained to the ministry to swear, etc., I say in truth that nothing of this kind has ever come to our mind, let alone into use. But I understand where your question comes from, namely from the one whom you recently recommended to me with Theodor. Listen briefly, therefore, to how I acted: He returned your letters shortly before dinner on October 11th; I, thinking of something else, ordered him to return to me the next day; in the meantime, I would see what the letters contained. Meanwhile, Rudolf Frey, one of the deputies, came to me and reported that the same man had approached him and what he had requested; he therefore entrusted me to explain the matter to the brothers. When this was done, we agreed: our custom hitherto observed should be proposed to him and to hear what he would answer. I was given the mandate to carry out the matter; I obeyed and used these words: "By the mandate of the brothers," I say, "this custom has been observed by us so far, that we examine those to whom we entrust the teaching of the gospel of Christ. But since you have taught for some time (he interjected: 'sixteen years') among those whose religion agrees with ours (for otherwise I have not found it so far), we only require this, that you take our confession once published and which we all the Swiss cities wrote together a few years ago, and look at it overnight, and if anything occurs to you that is less pleasing, explain it tomorrow; then we will deal with the rest." He immediately replied: "I have been examined." Then I: "You do not understand me; for we want you to read the confessions I mentioned, to keep the appearance of an examination for the sake of example." He was silent until a relative standing by said: "You hear what is required." But he repeated: "It is not necessary, it is not necessary." Thus he refused to read what I wanted. "If it is not," I said, "that you read, you must go to Frey and tell him what we have done, and return tomorrow." He left and was not seen by me again. With Frey, he then acted in such a way that he was recalled to the village of Gelterkinden during this week, when our field visitation is taking place, so that the matter may come to an end. Otherwise, this matter has not progressed so far.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to answer to your request. I have nothing certain about the war in Picardy. However, Theobald Nigri wrote these days on September 6th that the French [King Francis I] had left the Luxembourg territory after devastating everything he could, but had strongly fortified the captured town; now his army is following the imperial troops heading towards Picardy; the Emperor [Charles V] himself is waiting in Antwerp for the day of the Diet [of Speyer]. A large number of Italian thieves pass through here; they sell what they have, even their swords. Some were asked why they left the Emperor's army; they replied that they were sick, lacked money, and had nothing to eat. A German soldier belonging to the margrave came these days, and when asked why he was here, he replied that a very significant part of the Germans had been dismissed, to whom two months' wages were owed; but no one should hope for a penny. There is a rumor that the Swiss came to the German army, which they call the "Hellhaufen," in recent days and intend to attack the imperial forces. There are other rumors which, because they are despised by most, are not worth writing, although they are serious. However, it is much more certain that, whichever side wins, the Protestants are in danger. But I firmly believe that the Lord has arranged it so that we trust Him and adhere steadfastly, rejecting and despising all other things on which people usually rely. May the Lord increase His spirit in us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your household, Theodor, and Pellican. Basel, October 15th, 1543.</p>
      <p>Os. Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the excellent theologian, brother in his Lord.</p>
