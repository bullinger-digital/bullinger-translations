    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger received Myconius’ letter from August 23 [No. 2997], but not the desired edition [of the Satires] by Persius. Therefore, he asks Johannes Gast again to procure it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] On August 24, an embassy assured Emperor [Charles V.] of his friendship before the Zurich council and declared that the Emperor wanted to form an alliance with all the Confederates, with the Duchy of Milan, and with all other imperial territories in Italy. What can one say about such empty promises? The people of Zurich replied that they wanted to discuss this with all the Confederates on occasion, as it concerned everyone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The godless imperial soldiers have now reached Kempten, Isny, Memmingen, and Ravensburg. Complaints from the poor afflicted population will surely soon be heard. The Emperor is said to have been forced to relocate these troops due to the great inflation around Augsburg. But there is probably a secret plan behind it. Myconius should advise! Bullinger had already learned from a letter addressed to the Zurich council from the Basel council about the report of the messenger who returned from Vienna [...]. However, he is grateful for Myconius’ attention.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The statement [sent by Myconius] and written in Hebrew is not quite understandable for Bullinger and [Konrad Pellikan]. Theodor Bibliander has not yet seen it. The astrologers had prophesied to Emperor Maximilian I a victory in the battle against the Confederates at Dornach... Thus, their predictions are just hollow and contemptible chatter! This in haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Enclosed are two German poems sent from Ulm, proving how biting Johannes Hoffmeister, this obscure monk from Colmar and alleged “friend” of Bullinger, was. He expressed his “friendship” in silly books that Bullinger ignored.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to all and also from all colleagues.</p>

      <p>S. D. I received your letter dated August 23, but I have not seen Persius, whom I was supposed to request from Gast. Therefore, I ask you to still procure for me such a Persius as I requested.</p>

      <p>On August 24, an embassy presented the Emperor's friendship before the Zurich council and offered an alliance, which he desires to form with all the Swiss Confederates and with the Duchy of Milan, indeed with all other imperial territories in Italy. What more can be said? These men promised almost golden mountains! Our people responded that this matter concerns all the Swiss Confederates, with whom they wish to consult in due time and place.</p>

      <p>These impious and nefarious soldiers have recently arrived in Kempten, Isny, Memmingen, and Ravensburg. We expect complaints from the miserable people at any moment. The Emperor is compelled to place his garrisons in these cities. Around Augsburg, everything is at a very high price, and the soldiers do not have enough to feed themselves. Furthermore, I suspect there is also a hidden plan. You divine. What you write about the one who was in Vienna, I heard long ago, for your council wrote everything to ours. I read it. Nevertheless, I give great thanks for your diligence.</p>

      <p>We do not recognize those Hebrew elements correctly. Theodor has not yet seen them. Astrologers predicted favorable outcomes for Maximilian when the Swiss Confederates clashed with the imperial forces at Dornach. Therefore, I value the judgments of astrologers as much as the most vain and worthless nonsense. I write this in haste.</p>

      <p>I am sending two German poems, which I received from Ulm. Read them and see how virulent that obscure monk from Colmar, Johannes Hoffmeister, is, my singular friend! For he has testified to his friendship, with which he embraces me, by publishing the most foolish books. But I rightly despise the most vain scoundrel.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell and greet all the brothers. All the brothers greet you. Zurich, August 30, 1547. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother. Basel.</p>
