    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Just yesterday, Blarer wrote [not received]. Now he learns through a letter written by a man in Nuremberg on June 14th that Emperor Charles V has sent troops and 1500 horsemen to Duke Eric of Brunswick-Calenberg, all of whom were then killed by Wilhelm von Thumshirn. This will cause the Emperor great concern!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In Ulm, the [Imperial Estates] are gathered to form a new [Swabian] League.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger should give the enclosed letter to Hans Schöner and also advance him money if needed. Blarer is expecting a money transfer for Schöner, which he will send to him with the first secure messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Request for prayer. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] Blarer hereby recommends Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz, who is looking forward to meeting Bullinger. He and his pious wife [Anna, née Zehntmeier] (both very amiable people) are recommended to Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother. I wrote to you yesterday. Now further news comes from Nuremberg from an honest man (the letter is dated Nuremberg, June 14th), that the Emperor has sent 1500 horsemen along with several mercenaries to Duke Eric of Brunswick, to assist him, but they arrived too late and were all killed by Wilhelm von Thumshirn. It is believed that this will cause the Emperor much trouble.</p>
