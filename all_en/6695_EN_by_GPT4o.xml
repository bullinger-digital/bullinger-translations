      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I give thanks to our Lord God, that He so governs our affairs that all things turn out happily. May Gwalther also bring favorable and desired outcomes! There is no need for me to repeat at length the mission and request of Mr. Beza. For you know everything. He was willingly received by our people and the ministers of the Church of Geneva are to be united with us, especially since they are allied with you Bernese by treaty. However, regarding the appendix of the French churches, it seemed to us that it should not be added, lest it be detrimental to the churches. Furthermore, it seems unworthy that mention of the oldest and most powerful kingdom should be made by us only through an appendix. It is better for those churches to issue their own document, in which they testify to their agreement with us.</p>
