      <p>S. I am certainly glad that my previous letters, which I wrote for the Martinmas fair, have somewhat satisfied you, but I am sorry that you did not receive them sooner. I was completely unaware of Muralto's journey to you, nor does anyone among my people want to acknowledge that it was indicated to them. In the meantime, I had only one messenger through whom I wrote a few things to my brother. Whatever the case may be, I am and will always be yours. I rarely leave the house this winter and almost never, except where duty calls me, because I greatly fear the recurrence of illness, which constantly threatens me with something and now tugs at me from this side, now from that, and somewhat settles in the joints of my fingers; but as long as I can walk and perform my duties, I consider myself healthy enough. It pains me greatly to hear that you are so troubled by cough and catarrh; but these are so typical of both old age and winter that they can hardly be avoided by any means, and therefore must be borne more patiently.</p>
      <p>I received the copy of the Landgrave's letters later from the gentlemen with whom I had shared it, nor did I suspect such a necessity to return it, because I recognized it not as the original autograph, but as the hand of another scribe. However, since you request it, I am returning it along with some other news sent at the same time.</p>
      <p>As I thanked you before for the booklets, so I thank you still and seek a way to show my gratitude to you. I would have gladly arranged for Rotulan wine to be sent to you this year as well; but the difficulty of transport and the inconvenience of the road have prevented it from being done so far. What will happen in the future, I cannot yet promise; however, our Steiger greets you very diligently and seeks a way to attest his goodwill and benevolence towards you. The same is done by both treasurers, MÃ¼linen, Diesbach, and many others. We have nothing from France. I wonder what those quarrels among the ministers are; I sense much about this matter, but I cannot yet determine the subject of the disputes with certainty.</p>
      <p>The Palatine writes to our people, and although he had previously granted Ursinus, he now denies it again, even though he is very unwilling to remain there. These things happen due to the suggestions of the counselors, whom you know. We are therefore still stuck regarding the theologian; however, Mr. Coladon, who was dismissed from Geneva and now resides in a village of our dominion, offers himself to us. Many are inclined towards him because they see that he does not think about returning to France; meanwhile, others fear that he cannot be received without offending the Genevans and that this will cause new hostilities from them towards us. But these fears do not seem too great, since the man is pious, learned, and honest and was dismissed there for no evil crime. However, nothing has been decided here yet.</p>
      <p>Regarding the grain purchase, there is much talk, and it is not without reason that it was refused to be exported to foreign markets; but since it is taken so seriously, my lords let it go. However, other necessary provisions will also be made. The Venetians have written much about the Turkish victory and published pictures, but nothing about the loss of Cyprus; they seem to have only stirred up the hornets. Our urban and private affairs are moderately well. Our Samuel Telamon, along with his father-in-law, sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>We would also like to be connected to you or yours by some kinship after such a long friendship; but since we recognize that we are not equal to be joined with you, and therefore would face rejection, we dare not propose anything.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we pray for every blessing from the Lord for you and yours. Farewell, most esteemed lord and dearest father.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the day of the winter solstice, 1571.</p>
      <p>I write nothing about the affairs of Geneva, as those will be explained by your and my Felix Lavater and Johannes Collin.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
