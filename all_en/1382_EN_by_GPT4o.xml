      <p>Greetings. I am so troubled, my dear godfather, that I can hardly write to you about our Eberhard, whose affair has come to light, as I have always feared. He had relations with a young maiden, who was somewhat related to his wife; he fathered a child with her. He wanted to attribute the child to his own son and arrange for the girl to marry him, hoping that the son would take on the responsibility with money and property. However, the son refused to do so. The matter has been long in the court, the girl was imprisoned, and it has come to light that he confessed today how it all happened. Because of this, he has left the city, wanting to renounce his citizenship today; but it was too late for him, as he left in time, and there is concern that if he is caught, it will go badly for him, and not only because of this incident, but also because he publicly threatens our city of Bern, claiming he knows all their secrets, and if he goes elsewhere, he will reveal everything. He also has dealings with those from Solothurn and the abbot of St. Urban, which makes my lords very displeased, not to mention the great scandal and uproar in the city and country. May God have mercy and not let His innocent church suffer for this! My intuition did not deceive me; I have often told you what I think of him. If he comes to you, be cautious; for one like him is not easily found, deceitful and pliable.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, regarding recent news, I know nothing new, other than what I wrote recently. The word is, though not yet entirely public, that the King of France has attacked Lorraine; the Emperor wants to go to the Netherlands; the Turks have, with the help of the Hungarians, killed many of Ferdinand's men in Hungary and are attacking many places forcefully. Ferdinand would like to have Meissenburg reconciled and helped; the Emperor does not want this, thinking it would be disgraceful for his majesty to have conditions imposed on him. Also, the King of France has betrothed a daughter to the King of England. In England, the sweating sickness is raging terribly. Dr. Peter Martyr is said to be certainly dead. Also, from Prussia, someone has come, saying about Osiander that he lent the prince 12,000 guilders at high interest to establish a new sect, seeking nothing but honor and wealth. About Corvinus, he says that he has been imprisoned in Minden for several years, is very steadfast, and is being treated poorly, not being allowed books or any other human comfort. He has given me this information; when you have read it, please send it back to me.</p>
      <p>At the Zurzach market, I will send you a bundle of books by Vergerius, about which he has written to you, as I suspect, where you should send them further. With this, I commend you to God. My people greet you and your entire household. May you all be greeted by God. Given in Bern on August 24, 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
