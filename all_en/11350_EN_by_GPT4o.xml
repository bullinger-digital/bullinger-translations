    <p xml:id="regest1">In the meantime, a young man [as an assistant for Zwick] has been found. Wishes for more detailed information about the English King [Henry VIII]; the princes are unreliable, although the determined actions of George [of Württemberg-Mömpelgard] are pleasing. Thanks for the Vigilius [HBBibl I 113], but has not yet been able to read the [also printed] letter of Vadian; to the latter, he has sent new writings of Schwenckfeld. Inquires about a remark concerning Bucer, which he supposedly made in a letter to the people of Zurich, and confirms the forwarding of letters to Memmingen and Kempten. Hears from Augsburg only that the sermons [of Blarer] are well attended; refers for further information to Pellikan. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>Regarding the young man, there is no need for you to be concerned anymore; for we have found one as we desired.</p>
      <p>Make us aware of the situation with the King of England, once you have heard more certain news than what you have written. If we are deceived, it is without our knowledge; for we should have known and must know that there is no hope placed in princes. While Prince Georg [of Württemberg-Mömpelgard] is acting bravely now, let us praise the Lord and accept this in such a way that we do not place our trust in men.</p>
      <p>I thank you for the gift of Vigilius, and I will return the favor when the opportunity arises. I have not yet read Vadian's letter, being hindered by a thousand tasks. I also sent to Vadian in these days what was published by Schwenckfeld about this matter. It is certainly unfortunate that new and very intricate questions continually arise.</p>
      <p>The Lord, however, knows whether this is done for good or ill. Furthermore, some are spreading that I wrote to you that Bucer freely admits to having denied the faith and prostituted the truth. I do not remember doing this; however, I wish to know if I have written anything like this in my letters to you. I sent your letters to Memmingen and Kempten with a reliable courier. From Augsburg, we hear nothing except that there is a very large and indeed rare attendance for hearing the word, which is fortunate and auspicious. The rest is with Pellikan. Farewell, not only in my name but also in the name of my brother, Thomas, and all the brothers. I wish your wife and mother well.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, 9th September 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere of friends and brothers.</p>
