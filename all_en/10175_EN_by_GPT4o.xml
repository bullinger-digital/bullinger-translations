      <p>To the incomparable hero Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word among the Zurichers, revered patron.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I am here completely at a loss, uncertain of what to do. I turn to you, imploring your help. I am deprived of all hope and counsel unless you protect me with your aid, it will be over for me. For what hope would remain for a wretched person like me, who has wasted his youth without any fruit, irretrievable time? Youth, I say, flies by, the best time for studying, and with me left behind, it cries out: no one seizes me from behind. You can imagine how little time is left for studying for those who are involved in such great affairs of their lords. There is no hour, indeed no moment, that I can call my own, or that I can freely devote to the muses. You know that Homeric saying: "For wide-seeing Zeus takes away half of a man's virtue, when the day of servitude seizes him."</p>
      <p>I therefore ask your kindness to deign to provide me with some counsel regarding my uncertain affairs. If a stipend not less than that of others is granted to me, I will return to you when it is possible. Otherwise, the muses will have to be left behind unwillingly. I wish to be informed by you as soon as possible, so that I may know what to do as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and keep me commended to your kindness. I beseech you, lord, and may you heed and have mercy on me.</p>
      <p>My lord Capito sends you many greetings along with the other brothers. Farewell again. Given hastily in Capito's house.</p>
      <p>Yours at your feet, Konrad Ge√üner.</p>
