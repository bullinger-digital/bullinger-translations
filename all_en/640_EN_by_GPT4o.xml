      <p>Greetings. You never fail to show us your most sincere diligence, dearest Bullinger, so that our council rightly owes you the greatest thanks. The arrival of that pious, serious, and wise man is most welcome to them, and we are all truly convinced of his most esteemed integrity. May the Lord, the president and avenger of all justice, grant that, according to our clear hope and from other regions, men may come to us who are unwavering and focused on one sole equity.</p>
      <p>To Mayor Lavater, you should indicate that it seems best to my lords, since our confederates from Zürich currently have their captain here, that he should not separate himself from the other three places. They are very eager to see him among them, and it is also fully expected that they will enter the monastery; however, we cannot know for sure. Whether it happens or not, it will not matter; for one will not be less assured of all fairness against honorable people. It might happen that Bern and Zug do not ride into the monastery; but even if it does happen, it would not matter. In summary, we trust that our concerns will have favor with everyone according to fairness and justice, etc.</p>
      <p>We have requested nothing else from our dear confederates than that they should treat us according to what we have right and reason for; this is the mindset we still have today. And it will be evident whether the Abbot's people, out of favor and hatred, have more desire to quarrel than to be peaceful, and whether we are not inclined to act in fairness?</p>
      <p>Regarding recent news, I have inquired with the most trusted merchants that the Duke of Württemberg is reinstating the evangelical preachers; and there is suspicion that the Emperor intends to hang some princes and cities for the sake of religion, so that he may find more favor and willingness for his undertaking. However, there is no doubt that since the Diet in Augsburg, the Emperor has been planning how to install his dear heart from Savoy and to form a confederation with some compulsion; for these matters have long been known to our people, and my lords have long informed their confederates.</p>
      <p>On the 20th of July, one of our notable citizens wrote from the imperial court with this opinion and these words: "Regarding recent news, I have nothing special to write to you at this time. His Majesty is currently with the prince and the entire court in Ghent, where they are to swear in the prince; afterwards, they will move through the country to the frontier against France and also have the prince sworn in. And what is further planned and whether they will move into Germany before winter, time will tell. For now, it is assured that he will not start a war this year; but something might happen by next spring. The common saying is that he is very concerned with Savoy, wanting to reinstate the Prince of Piedmont, who is at court, into possession of his land, which the French and those from Bern hold, either with love or by force; in such a way that some are concerned he will prepare for it this winter and start something by spring, and also challenge the confederates, etc.</p>
      <p>Granvella left the court 8 days ago for Besançon, where he has his house. Some suspect that there is a secret plan, that he will try to make the confederates compliant again, as the Bishop of Constance did 3 or 4 years ago. In summary: it is important to be vigilant, and with a warned matter, one can defend oneself better. The envoy from England is still at court, but cannot learn anything substantial about his affairs or missions, etc.</p>
      <p>So much writes an honorable man from the court. Otherwise, I have not been able to learn anything, except that someone arrived today from the land of Württemberg, who says that soon 2000 Italians are to come to that land and will have their stay in the Neckar Valley until further notice. I do not fear anything serious, except that he might attempt in late autumn to lock us out of the supply chest and thus create a separation; for hunger is a grim tyrant. Therefore, it is important to keep the heads together; otherwise, it would have been done. And now, traveling due to the governing and breaking pestilence would be a dangerous and harmful thing, which the Emperor would not be a little pleased about to our misfortune. May God graciously keep us.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From St. Gallen, very quickly, on the 19th of August, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop in the renowned city of Zürich, most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
