      <p>S. P. D. Your letter (most illustrious man) along with the booklet, which you gifted me, was delivered by my most honorable lord, Consul Willi. Your gift was indeed very pleasing to all of us, and the most honorable lords, the consuls, have instructed me to express great thanks for your kindness, and especially I give and hold the greatest thanks for the gifted booklet. The subject of the book is both pleasant to read and extremely necessary for a Christian person to know.</p>
      <p>May the most gracious Lord God deign to preserve your safety for a very long time, so that the church of our Lord Jesus Christ may enjoy your pious and learned labors for many years!</p>
      <p>If I had had any certain and noteworthy news, I would not have omitted to write. Regarding the agreement of the Venetians with the Turks and the death of King Philip, there is only an uncertain rumor, as it is spread among you. Recently, when we were in the senate, these things, which I add below, were sent by the commissioner from Kleve.</p>
      <p>"First, you should know, my lords, that I have always spoken and still do, so that I may learn all things; but so far I can know nothing particularly certain, except that actually the 9000 Spaniards are in the Duchy of Milan, and those who were around the villages on Lake Como have returned back into the city of Como, and it is openly said that up to 25000 Spaniards are yet to come, and it is believed that they will march through Piedmont into the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Some believe they will march against the city of Geneva, although it is generally said that such troops will go through Piedmont to the Netherlands. It is also said that the Milanese will send out a large number of soldiers, which cannot be known for certain. If it happens that something new comes in the future, I will diligently inform you, my lords, of everything, etc.</p>
      <p>Given in Kleve, on the 26th of February, in the year 67. Balthasar Plant, commissioner in Kleve."</p>
      <p>I too, as soon as we have anything, will inform you, my lord. May the merciful God preserve you safe for his church for a very long time! The most honorable lords, the consuls, and Mr. Gantner, who will write next, have instructed me to send many greetings, and I wish the most illustrious man, Mr. Gwalter, and the other lords, teachers, and patrons to be well.</p>
      <p>Chur, 3rd of March, in the year etc. 67. Johannes Pontisella, most loving of your kindness. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, singular patron and my lord to be honored with perpetual faith.</p>
