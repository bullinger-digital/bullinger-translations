      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand, etc. Regarding your letter concerning the tithe and the dispute that arises from it, I have read everything and have thus turned to honorable, sensible, and good-hearted people and have spoken confidentially with them to understand what should be done and what can be hoped for. We find little agreement, except that it is very unpleasant that our people have been accused and that they have not been instructed, saying: if no good decision is given, one will lie, etc. This distresses many people, or those who understood it, badly, etc.</p>
      <p>Consider that it will not remain unchallenged; for one is not at all inclined to begin unfriendly or violent actions with honorable people, etc. However, the fact that one refuses to give the tithe, which has belonged there from ancient times (unless one has other documents), pleases no one; for the one who demands it should prove in documents and seals that it is his, but the one who is in possession is not acting according to the form of the law. Whoever does not want to give something that has been given so far should prove that he is not obliged, and not the one in possession to prove his possession. A farm has been lent to someone; he has given the rent for it.</p>
      <p>Now he no longer wants to pay rent, but demands that the landlord prove that he should pay rent. This is not allowed, but he is told to show why he no longer wants to pay rent. If he says: the rent is not used properly, it does not concern the one who gives the rent; if one says: it is different in religion; then it is shown that the tithes are given to the teaching and the poor, to which they should be directed, - this is not yet proven for all tithes. Moreover, it is true that where the authority, whose right it is to give, acknowledges such; but if the possessor does not acknowledge it and is under another authority, the objection will not help. My lords of Zurich have reformed the tithes in the places where they are lords and the possession belongs to their foundations and monasteries, and not further. The bishop of Constance, the cathedral canons of Constance have tithes and rents in Wänigen, Bülach, and elsewhere in my lords' jurisdiction and territory, where they could also say, we want to keep them for the proper use, since it is in our lands, etc. But they have never done that, but have let the bishop and the cathedral canons follow their rent. They lie as they use or misuse it.</p>
      <p>You know that the abbots of Petershausen, Kreuzlingen, Fischingen, Rheinau, Wettingen, Muri, Einsiedeln, St. Gallen, etc., have an unspeakable amount of goods in my lords' territory.</p>
      <p>Among them are the rightful old church or parish tithes; they insist that they be paid to those to whom they have belonged from ancient times, and they do not refuse anything under the guise of the gospel, having done so from the beginning. Therefore, I cannot hope at all that they will protect anyone or stand by anyone who uses the opposite. It is also not only used in this way under my lords, but also under and by the Bernese, Schaffhausen, Basel, and everywhere in the empire, that one lets everyone remain with their temporal goods, that is, in the possession of the goods: yes, even if there is another authority. Waiting for God to grant grace that it may become better.</p>
      <p>For those who are in possession and under foreign authorities can only be driven away with the sword. But the gospel does not allow that the sword be used for such matters alone.</p>
      <p>It is even much worse when the goods called spiritual are withheld because they are not used properly, and yet now, those who withhold them do not use them solely for teaching, church, and the poor, etc. And we find so much that, as soon as a day is set in Baden (as one expects, it will soon happen) on which yours will also come, your messengers should ride down beforehand to turn to our lords, with a request to do the best in the matter, and also to inform them. For the inserted note, if it were to go to a court, would be quite weak, as sensible people think; I have kept the note for your further decision. I would like to do everything that is possible for me and that I consider significant.</p>
      <p>But as the matter itself appears to me, I fear that little will be gained. I have not wanted to withhold my very good, faithful opinion in response.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Greet my lord Tscharnner and lord mayor Martin along with my other good lords and friends. Given in haste, Zurich, January 21, 1558.</p>
      <p>I think that examples of our copious letters have been offered to you recently. I repeat the examples through a convenient and safe messenger, as well as the acts of the envoys.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>It is otherwise true that after a request made to the king, it will not be heard that any new action will be taken against the believers. From Calais, the outcry grows here too, it is said to be won; waiting for more certain news. To the well-learned, pious, and faithful lord Johannes Schmid, preacher in Chur, his dear lord and godfather.</p>
