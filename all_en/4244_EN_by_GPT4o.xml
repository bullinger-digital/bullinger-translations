      <p>To Lord Bullinger, my most esteemed patron, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Since I have nothing else to add to my recent letters to you, I still wanted to at least greet you with this one. If you are well, that is good; indeed, I and my whole family are well by the grace of God. However, I have not received any letters from you for the past two months, and I am eager to be reassured of your well-being along with all your family. I therefore ask that, when you have the opportunity (for I know you are continuously very busy), you would be so kind as to cheer me with your letters. To confess frankly, nothing can happen to me that is more pleasing than your letters, which I am accustomed to kiss, and the more frequent they are, the more delightful they will be. Here, moreover, there is nothing new except what I mentioned in my recent letters to you, concerning the Spaniards who are staying in Como and the surrounding areas, for it is not clear what they are planning. In our regions, everything is quite peaceful; may God grant that everything continues to improve, as they say. The bearer of this letter, namely Mr. Nikolaus Pelizarius from Chiavenna, is taking with him the son of a certain nobleman, whom he wishes to place with an honorable citizen in Zürich and to stay there until he acquires knowledge of the German language. I therefore pray that you will assist him in placing the boy with a reputable man.</p>
      <p>His father is called Matthäus della Torre, a noble and upright man, who will fully provide what you promise for his son. You will also do me a favor if you take the boy under your recommendation.</p>
      <p>And these few things I wanted to write with a quick pen. It remains, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, that you hold me in your commendation and greet all your household in my name, I ask again and again. I understood that my brother Kaspar was there and did not greet you in person; I took this very badly from him, as I should have, and therefore I wrote to him sharply rebuking him. I ask, however, that you forgive him; for I think he was hindered by his own business and also compelled by the importunity of the sailors, who hastened his departure, so that he could not fulfill his duty towards you.</p>
      <p>However it may be, I again pray that you do not take it badly. Farewell again and again, and love me as you are accustomed, and greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, March 24, 1560.</p>
      <p>The same as above, your most devoted Friedrich von Salis, commissioner of Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my ever-esteemed lord. In Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
