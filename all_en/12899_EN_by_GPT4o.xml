    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The people of Strasbourg seem to have been misled by Emperor Charles V! If Gast knows anything reliable about this, he should report it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony defeated the Imperial forces on March 2, killing about 1000 cavalry and numerous foot soldiers, and made the six remaining companies swear not to march against him for half a year. It is reported from Constance that, among others, Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, Landgrave [Christoph] of Leuchtenberg, Count [Georg] of Helfenstein, and Count [Johann] Georg of Mansfeld-[Vorderort] were captured and taken to Denmark. The Elector is also said to have brought his wife [Sibylle, née of Jülich-Cleves-Berg] and his children there for safety, as he now intends to march against the Emperor. When the latter learned of the defeat in Nördlingen (on the way to Nuremberg), he set off back towards Ulm. He sent the Bishop of Augsburg, Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, to Rome to recruit new troops.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Gast should also inform Myconius, Francisco de Enzinas, Johannes Oporin, Johann Herwagen, and Nikolaus Episcopius of this. Greetings. Unfortunately, Bullinger does not have the opportunity to write to Myconius as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S.:] Pope Paul III sent an army against England with the English Cardinal Reginald Pole, but missed his target, as Edward VI was crowned on February 20 and the entire kingdom has already paid homage to him. In Hamburg, the English, French (Francis I), Danish (Christian III), and Polish King [Sigismund II Augustus or Sigismund I], as well as the Elector of Saxony, formed an alliance with the Hanseatic cities. Bullinger, who must break off here, learned this from Augsburg.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I fear that Strasbourg has allowed itself to be brought under the Emperor with smooth (flattering) words. If you have any certainty, please write.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>On March 2, the Elector defeated the Imperial forces and completely scattered them, killing about 1000 cavalry, many foot soldiers, and forcing the 6 remaining companies to swear not to fight against the Elector for 6 months. During and after the battle, many nobles were captured, including several lords such as Margrave Albrecht of Brandenburg, Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, Count of Helfenstein, Count Georg of Mansfeld, etc. All of these were taken to Denmark. The Elector also sent his own wife and children there for greater security (as reported to me from Constance), as he is now fully prepared for battle. He intends to confront the Emperor. The Emperor was on his way to Nuremberg. However, when the defeat of the princes at Nördlingen was reported, he retreated back to Ulm. He sent the Bishop of Augsburg with 50 horsemen hastily to Rome for fresh Italian troops.</p>

      <p>Inform this to Myconius, Dryander, Oporinus, Herwagen, and Episcopius, etc. Greet them for me, etc. I would have gladly written to Myconius. I cannot.</p>

      <p>The Pope sent an army under the command of Reginald Pole, the English cardinal, to harass England; but in vain, for on February 20, Edward VI was crowned and received by the entire kingdom. Then, in Hamburg, the English, French, Danish, Polish, and Saxon formed an alliance with the maritime cities, etc. I cannot say more. I have just received this from Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To my dear lords and brothers Myconius and Johannes Gast, preachers in Basel.</p>
