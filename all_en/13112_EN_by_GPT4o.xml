    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Herewith, Blasius sends a letter of recommendation [No. 3038 from October 12], which Celio Secondo Curione has written for a young Italian [Lelio Sozzini?]. The people of Chur have also given him a letter of recommendation as well as a considerable amount of travel money and entrusted him to colleagues who were traveling to Padua. Blasius also returns Bullinger's writing [“De sacramentis”] on the use and efficacy of the sacraments. He and Johannes Comander thank him very much for it. It will certainly be very useful for settling the dispute between the colleagues [Agostino Mainardi and Camillo Renato]. If only it were printed! For undoubtedly there are many people in the Grisons and elsewhere who err on the question of the sacraments (which Bullinger has presented very clearly) not out of malice, but out of ignorance. With his treatise, Bullinger can dissuade these people from their errors and also contribute to the settlement of the dispute.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] From Italy, there are no confirmed reports about the new war [between Emperor Charles V and Pope Paul III]. It was only reported that there is a truce for 20 days (others say, for three months). However, the governor [of the Emperor] in Milan [Ferrante Gonzaga] is said to have broken it, and allegedly, for this reason, the armies of the Emperor and the "Puppet" (or the Pope) are growing daily by recruiting new mercenaries (even in the Grisons and among the Swiss).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In recent days, the Bishop of Chur [Lucius Iter] was informed by letter from the Imperial Court that the Emperor grants the Electors, Princes, and other Imperial Estates the permission to freely seek the true religion. If Bullinger knows more about this, he should inform them. May the Lord preserve him for a long time. Greetings. In haste. Comander and all the others send their regards back.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Heinrich Bullinger, greetings. I am sending you here, along with a letter (in which Celio Secondo Curione recommended to you a young Italian, whom we have also earnestly recommended to our brothers traveling towards Padua with letters and a considerable travel allowance), your most clear demonstration on the use and efficacy of the sacraments, for which Comander and I are greatly thankful to you (and for writing to us so diligently). For we have no doubt that it will greatly assist us in settling this dispute among the brothers - and we would always wish for it to be published. Who would doubt that many (not only among us but elsewhere) err in ignorance (not malice) regarding this question of the use and efficacy of the sacraments (which you have most clearly elucidated in this work), whom you would undoubtedly recall from error by its publication and reconcile many who bitterly contend among themselves, etc.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, from Italy, nothing more certain about this new war has been reported, except that a truce for 20 days, some say for three months, is said to have been declared. However, some assert that the administrator of Milan has broken it, and therefore, the armies of both the Emperor and the "Puppet" (or Pope) are daily increasing with the recruitment of new soldiers, even from our own and the Swiss.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Finally, I do not want to leave you unaware: In recent days, the Bishop was informed by letters from the Emperor's court that the Emperor has granted the Electors, Princes, and other states of the Empire the freedom to inquire about the true religion, of which, if you have any more certain information, please share it with us. Farewell, most esteemed man in the Lord, whom we all hold in the highest regard, may He deign to preserve you for us for a long time. Yours, as much as he is, Blasius, at the divine rule of קֹהֶלֶת.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and most humane man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most steadfast defender of sincere theology, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most revered lord.</p>
