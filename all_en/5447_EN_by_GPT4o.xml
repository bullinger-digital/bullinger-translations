      <p>S. Finally, I am here again, having escaped from the midst of the Greeks, and yet I would not have thought of returning if not for the advice of Condé, who thought my service would be useful in Germany and Switzerland. Therefore, he is in Orléans with the lord admiral and about seven thousand soldiers, prepared with a brave spirit to endure the siege until reinforcements are sent. He sent the remaining troops partly to Rouen, partly to Bourges to protect those cities which are of the greatest importance. The enemies were still at Blois, but they sent part of their forces to occupy the less fortified regions around.</p>
      <p>The Poitevins withstood the enemy's attack, but were finally conquered with a truly miserable slaughter, because the people of Tours, Saumur, Chinon, Laon, and several other scattered church congregations had taken refuge there. The enemies, indeed more cruel than the Turks themselves, have no regard for age or sex. I also hear that the people of Angoulême have surrendered, which will undoubtedly drag along some other cities, so that I truly fear for Queen of Navarre, about whom I have heard nothing for a long time.</p>
      <p>To these evils is added the sudden and treacherous oppression of the people of Mâcon, right before the eyes of our Swiss, who were only five miles away. Elsewhere, that is in Dauphiné, Provence, and Auvergne, our affairs are more favorable, but I do not doubt that all the forces of those parts will immediately gather to protect Lyon, especially since the enemies have received new reinforcements from the Italians, namely three thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry who are said to be not far from Geneva and have blocked the roads. The Bernese troops were sent back by our people because they did not want to advance or for some other reason. In short, the matter itself shows that it was a great expense to us and of no use.</p>
      <p>But whose fault this was, I still do not know. But it is truly lamentable that in such great and certain dangers so few are moved to extinguish the common fire, and no money is found, not even with the best securities given, while in the meantime we see the enemies so diligent and prompt in contributing to mutual aid. For otherwise, unless the Guise had been strengthened by foreign soldiers, Swiss, German, and Italian, they would have perished or been in exile long ago. Meanwhile, what should I tell you about the massacres, slaughters, devastation, famine, plague, sword, and what not. For with all these plagues at once, the miserable kingdom of France seems not so much to be chastised by the Lord as to be destroyed to extermination. But yet the Lord lives and will undoubtedly look upon His own, and I am entirely confident that if even Orléans remains to us, certain destruction threatens the enemies. For it is already certain that English reinforcements have landed in Normandy with forty ships, and on the 15th of this month, Andelot, the admiral's brother, enters the borders of Champagne with three thousand selected German cavalry and five thousand infantry.</p>
      <p>And would that you too would finally awaken and imitate the example of the German princes. For if it were so, we would soon see a marvelous change of affairs and indeed the papacy utterly overthrown. But even if it happens otherwise, we will not despair, because our hope resides in heaven where the hands of the enemies cannot reach. At Strasbourg, I left the mother-in-law of Prince Condé, with his five children, that is, a six-year-old daughter, a four-year-old son, another three-year-old daughter, and two six-month-old twins. For this crowd could not be safe enough at home against the rage of the people spread through all the fields, nor could they endure the inconveniences of the siege of Orléans. However, the prince kept his wife and eldest son with him.</p>
      <p>The admiral and many others of the first nobility also have their families with them there, which is a sad spectacle that I wish would finally move all who profess Christian charity. As for me personally, by the grace of God, my wife has safely reached Strasbourg, where I was forced to leave her, exhausted, for a time. I am returning to my port, where I do not know if we will be safe enough, or even if I will remain there longer. For whatever the church advises, that will be the counsel I follow.</p>
      <p>You have, my father, a long and sad letter, but he will certainly console me who pronounces the mourners blessed. Therefore, the heavenly Father must be prayed to, if ever before.</p>
      <p>Which I earnestly request from you in the name of the Queen of Navarre, a most courageous and truly heroic woman, and of Condé himself, the admiral, and countless other brothers, and at the same time I wish you, my father, and Mr. Martyr, Mr. Gwalther, and the other brothers most esteemed in the Lord, all good and happy things. Basel, the first of September.</p>
      <p>Yours, Beza.</p>
