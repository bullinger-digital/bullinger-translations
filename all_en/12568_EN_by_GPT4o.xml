    <p xml:id="regest1">Either Myconius expressed himself ambiguously in his communication [in letter no. 2508] about the people of Strasbourg, or Bullinger misunderstood Myconius' statements. It is regrettable that some [people in the Confederation] unfortunately act as if the war does not concern them, even though it affects everyone! It is certain that [the Schmalkaldic League] values the Swiss [mercenaries] and will not let them go easily, even if (it seems) Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg demands it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- If he could, Myconius would kill all the envoys of the Antichrist [Pope Paul III] in Switzerland. They only cause harm and endanger the [Swiss] confederations. The threat that [Emperor] Charles V must be helped was probably invented by some Swiss, as if to hold back those Swiss who want to run to the [southern German] cities [of the Schmalkaldic League as mercenaries]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The Emperor is convinced that today's [German Protestants will not coordinate their forces] any better than the peasants did in the year [15]25. Therefore, he laughs at the current conquests and believes that the [Schmalkaldic League] will not be able to hold them for long. Caution is therefore advised!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Myconius has asked [Rudolf] Gwalther for information about the people of Nuremberg. He could never stand them. Zwingli also hated them for their talkativeness and impudence.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Myconius already wrote yesterday [No. 2519]. He now sends [Rudolf] Gwalther news about the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Either I wrote unclearly about the people of Strasbourg, or what I wrote was not correctly understood by you. For the good people have expressed it as a complaint that, although the current war is a common concern for us as well, some act as if it does not pertain to them. They have the Swiss with them and certainly hold them in high regard, and they will not easily let them go, even if, as I hear, Duke Ulrich of Württemberg requests it. If the messengers did not have their rights and the security to go and return wherever they are sent, I would indeed kill all those sent by the Antichrist! For they achieve nothing in Switzerland except to sow discord and keep the separated ones apart. What else will this ultimately lead to but the destruction of our alliance? Good men believe that the threats about aiding Charles are fabricated, indeed suggested by some of our own - if fear can keep at home those who would otherwise go out to the cities.</p>

      <p>Charles is convinced that our people will not rally now any differently than they did in the peasant uprising of 1525. Therefore, when couriers arrive announcing this capture, that occupation, etc., he laughs with these words: "They won't hold it for long; it happened the same way in the peasant war." It is therefore necessary to be careful that nothing is done rashly or more securely than is appropriate - which will indeed be the case, as long as we do not lose sight of the Lord.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I asked Gwalther to write if he has any information about the people of Nuremberg. I could never attribute anything to those people. And Zwingli, of blessed memory, always found them detestable for their talkativeness and insolence, by which they claimed to be the foremost in the gospel, although they did nothing but chatter about it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell in Christ with your household. I wrote the rest yesterday. I entrusted the matter of Cologne to Gwalther. In Basel, hastily, the last day of July in the year 1546.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
