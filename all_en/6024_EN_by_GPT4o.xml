      <p>Most illustrious and esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter dated January 7th. I am very glad that you have accepted my just excuse and I willingly continue to remind you of those things you have entrusted to me. As for your apology to me for what you call persistence, it is nothing; for I greatly approve of your zeal and concern for the church of God, and I strongly urge you to persevere in it; for it is the duty of a shepherd to watch over the flock.</p>
      <p>May God bless you and your labors. From Italy, nothing is heard about their preparations that I think concerns us.</p>
      <p>They are fortifying maritime places because of the Turk, and the Venetians have gathered several thousand men in their dominion to equip a fleet, which they will launch as soon as the opportunity of time permits; the other Italians are doing the same; however, regarding the other borders of the region, nothing has been changed. They say not even one of the fathers remained in Trento.</p>
      <p>I had intended to send you the decrees of the 3rd, 4th, and 9th sessions now; but due to a friend's error, I cannot do so; I will send them at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>I had already given the eighth to Mr. Fabricius to be transmitted to you.</p>
      <p>I am sending a booklet by Johannes de Turrecremata. We hear that Ochino has gone to Poland; it is regrettable that he was unwilling to repent; may God convert all who resist the truth or destroy them if it is expedient for His glory. I grieve for the sake of that province, Poland I mean, which now may it not be the sink of all errors.</p>
      <p>We have received grave news about the plague raging in the Palatinate; we must pray that God protects His church and delivers it from evil.</p>
      <p>We here are free from that contagion; if it returns to us early this spring, may the Lord's will be done; in His hand is our life and death.</p>
      <p>Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my lord, and pray to God for us.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, January 25, 1564.</p>
