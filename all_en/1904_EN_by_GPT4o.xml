      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. As you have informed us in your recent letter about a learned man named Doctor Charles Du Moulin, and how he wishes to settle in Mömpelgard with your further recommendation, we kindly inform you: since he, as you mention in your letter, has given up his position and conditions for the sake of the word of God and has left Paris, we are all the more willing and inclined to accept him as a servant with special favor, should he wish to make use of himself as a learned man. You may write to him with the next opportunity you have, but also inform him that the plague is somewhat prevalent in Mömpelgard, which is why we are not staying there at the moment. Whatever response you receive and how he wishes to be supported, please report to us at the earliest opportunity. We kindly rely on you.</p>
      <p>Dated in Riquewihr on the 21st of June in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>New times are so earnest and changeable, sometimes changing in just 2 days, that one cannot know well where the difficult situation will ultimately lead. There is concern that all of Germany will be punished with many severe rods, unless the times are such that it all falls apart; for the times will also come to an end. In summary: there is no improvement, no matter how great the warning comes. May the dear Lord grant a gracious end. I am not in the best condition, having entrusted myself to the care of doctors for a while.</p>
      <p>Be entrusted to God and all your good friends. To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
