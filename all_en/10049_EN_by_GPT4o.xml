      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to Heinrich Buchter, greetings and Christian innocence from God through Christ.</p>
      <p>Aristotle, the Stagirite, by no means the least among philosophers, thought that lascivious pictures contributed so much to the corruption of morals that he did not hesitate to advise rulers that these should be completely banned by laws. Therefore, it would be all the more disgraceful if any Christian were to be driven to such madness as to take for himself something as august, which he sees has been rejected with such indignation by the nations. And since I was not ignorant of this, I was not so foolish as to have something painted that I certainly felt would obscure my faith. Therefore, what I have imagined, I have taken care to have painted in such a way that it is not only not an aphrodisiac, but does not even disagree with the greatest mysteries of our religion. This is what we abundantly demonstrate in this little book, which we dedicate to you at present, especially so that you may understand that such a picture, as you recently saw returning from the workshop in Zurich, does not disgrace monks and men devoted to good letters, and also so that you may see that among Christians, let alone among the Greeks' Alcibiades, Silenos still survives.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>April 3, 1527.</p>
