      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, my willing service to you, etc. I have received your letter through the lady. The matter shall be resolved with God's help; where I can serve you, I will not spare myself. I have dispatched Mr. Walther's letter for Augsburg at the same hour.</p>
      <p>Beloved by you, to show my greetings and humble service. Our dear ones have read both of your letters with joy, thank you with respect for all honor, love, and goodness, etc. Herewith a letter that came to me from Augsburg; I also send you your requested red flahada, which, if it pleases you, would be dear to us; I will inform you of the cost when God helps me to come to you on the upcoming day in Baden. I hope my letter has reached you well through your messenger. I have little news, only that there is supposed to be a new pope, a Bolognese named Boncompagnia, which is good news.</p>
      <p>As for the situation in the Netherlands, Mr. von Stetten will inform you. Herewith, I also commend you to the protection of the Almighty.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Hans Liner. To the venerable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, faithful servant of the church in Zurich, my dear and beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
