      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I do not know how to repay so many benefits bestowed upon me. I am very pleased with everything you have given in this volume.</p>
      <p>You have added a preface about the future council, which contains the truth itself, even if the Imperial constitution prescribes free access for all and grants a place for argumentation according to conscience and the divine scriptures. But thus are the foxes caught. The Pope calls his own; the Emperor admits free confession for all; but I wish to see what you write about the future council, and what hope the pious should have regarding those who are determined enemies of the faith and persecutors of the gospel.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write now; everything is conducted in silence and will eventually burst forth. However, some are spreading this: It is said that Duke Heinrich has captured a peasant; the same is said to have shot a deer. This one is presented: the judgment has been made, he is to be bound to a deer by the horns and let run. A large deer was caught, the peasant bound to it, the deer let run into the forest; horsemen pursued and could not find any trace of the man, whether he was shaken off or lost. Behold the cruelty of that incendiary, whom the Lord will finally cast down to hell.</p>
      <p>I will send the index of books after the fair is completed. Our people feel the most severe headaches and many breathe their last, even if they use various medicines. Our Myconius has barely recovered, which you will hear more about from Jakob. Farewell. Basel, March 12, 1551.</p>
      <p>Greet Dr. Bibliander in my name, to whom I will write very extensively about various matters shortly.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius from the heart. Hastily.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest teacher.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
