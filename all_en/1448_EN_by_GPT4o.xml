      <p>S. D. If you had received the letters which I sent to you at the end of August and in September, most esteemed compater (godfather), the ones I received in Gloucester on October 22, dated in Zürich on August 29, would not have been so full of complaints. I hope you are now more certain of the spirit and mind I possess towards you. I will not respond to excuse myself to you, although I have (even with you as judge) serious and honest reasons that would prevail with you. But you will understand other things, which must still be kept silent. Neither you nor all that is yours displeases either God or our king, but rather pleases greatly; and for that reason, you are grateful to both. You say that I displease you, but you only say so, I know; far be it that your matters should become distasteful to me.</p>
      <p>I have no one dearer to me in Christ among all the learned under heaven, and rightly so: in many respects, I have been and am aided by you and yours. If it pleases God, and in whatever matter I can be of use to you, you will find me most ready to be both mindful and grateful to you and yours. I have immense thanks that you deign to send me your pious and learned thoughts in letters, which you compose for the people in sermons; although since I left Zürich, apart from your useful and excellent Decades written by hand, I have received nothing, except up to chapter 40 in Isaiah and in the epistle to the Romans. I desire the rest of your works, and I will abundantly satisfy the scribe. What remains in Isaiah I have not yet seen: I pity the unbelief of men, to whom we continually commend serious and honest things. But this I especially want you to be persuaded of: if I do not write to you hereafter every month, consider either illness or death to be the cause. You do not know at all how deeply your complaints affect my mind. I know you have no one in Christ who loves you more. As for the rest, when I come to London, I will take care, as I can, to send the king's letters, by which he will testify his mind towards you; and I will diligently try to relieve the care of the pious Italian, who endures the harsh necessity of exile, through the royal majesty; if I can do anything, I undoubtedly owe myself to him. Do not be anxious about the expenses in sending letters to Strasbourg: I will gladly bear them. Would that all that you have sent or will send hereafter had come to me! I greatly lament the loss of my letters on the journey. But God and men always regarded them as they ought: therefore, they torment my mind less.</p>
      <p>What was spread about the death of Mr. Martyr, by the grace of God, was false and deceitful; he lives and is well, and stands firmly in the battle line of the Lord, a pious and brave soldier. If he had anything to commit to the press, I know he would send it to you. Regarding the annotations on Genesis, he has not yet decided to publish them publicly: he is working on something in the epistle to the Romans. I will take care, as much as I can, that none of his writings are lost. Meanwhile, as you do, always do for the glory of Christ. They are greatly appreciated by me and all to whom the true worship of God is dear. I do not doubt that you labor vehemently in these endeavors, and endure the hatred and envy of the accomplices of the devil and antichrist; but the dangers are fortunate, which are joined with such great glory of God. You will understand about my labors, which are small and slight in the vineyard of Christ, through John Rodolph, a good and pious young man, whom I ask you to receive paternally upon his return, and also to consider him commended to you by me: pursue him with your favor: he conducted himself here modestly, piously, and studiously, as you will later understand, if it pleases, by the letters of all the learned and pious who study in Oxford; and, to tell the truth, I find it difficult to bear his departure. Let him return, if it pleases the magistrate of Zürich and you, to us for one or two years, and I will take on part of the expenses. When two Zürichers left here, I lent forty-five English crowns; if they satisfy me with books printed in Zürich, it will be well satisfied.</p>
      <p>What great and perpetual business I am overwhelmed with, you will learn in person from this messenger intervening. Spare the rough and very hurried pen, I ask. Greet your wife with the whole family, Mr. Bibliander with his, Mr. Gwalter with his, Mr. Pellican with his, Mr. Butler, my fellow countryman, with his, and please tell him from me that he is not only born for himself and his friends, but also his country claims a part. I wish that he would visit us at least once, and perhaps he would not regret the journey. May the Lord Jesus always be present to the consul, the whole council, and your republic, and always protect his church. Hastily, as you see, in Gloucester, October 27, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, as I ought to be, always most devoted, John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester.</p>
      <p>I ask you to remember to greet Mr. Gasner and Master Otto in my name, the best and learned men, whom I love very much in Christ. And if it pleases Mr. Gasner to come to us sometime, I would arrange for good companions, who would inform him about the rivers, fish, and animals that we have here.</p>
      <p>The rest, which I would communicate to you, I defer. Farewell again, and pray that we may long prosper in Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed compater (godfather).</p>
