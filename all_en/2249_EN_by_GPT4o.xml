      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished lord, greetings through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I received some time ago from Mr. Peter Martyr your most learned little book, which you sent to me, on the grace of God justifying, a booklet that is by far most pleasing to me for two reasons: first, because it contains a subject most pleasing to all the pious and explained by you with singular grace; secondly, because, as it was given to me by you as a gift, it is an open testimony of your love towards me, so that at the same time, he who conveys the grace of God to us through Christ, easily testifies how much grace I have with you, and that for no other reason than your singular kindness and piety. For this reason, I have indeed willingly and justly returned to you the gratitude due; but, being hitherto distracted by my many and various affairs, I have not been able to do so as I should and as I greatly desired. Now, therefore, with these letters, I give you the greatest thanks, my most learned Bullinger, for your little book sent to me and for the singular grace explaining the grace of God obtained for us through Christ and providing testimony of your grace and love towards me. Then I beseech you, if I have been slower in returning the gratitude due to you, which I have certainly paid in my mind, to forgive me and to consider my slowness in writing as kindly. For I am so pressed by so many and such great affairs and occupations, both of my necessary studies and of my family and domestic matters, that I can scarcely write even four lines to you, my most revered father, let alone to others; so little leisure remains for me from necessary occupations. My wife is pregnant, I am without a servant, I must read both in theology and in philosophy, and what not. Nevertheless, I will take care, as far as it can be done, that if not long letters due to occupations, yet some, even if very brief, letters I may send to you out of duty, especially when something new or necessary occurs that is not unworthy to be written to you. Meanwhile, farewell well and continue to love me as you do. I greet all those holy and learned men there. May God preserve you. Strasbourg, on the calends of April 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Girolamo Zanchi.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the Church of Zürich and most revered father.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
