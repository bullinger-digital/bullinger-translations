      <p>Greetings. About a month ago, my most esteemed sir, I sent you my letters along with a certain booklet and some printed Italian sheets by Lord Vergerius, all of which were sent in a package to Froschauer through Peter the bookseller from here; they were also sent to Doctor Gesner, the physician. However, since I have not yet received a single word of response from anyone on your side, I wanted to ask you now to at least write whether you have received them or not, when you can. I will be careful in the future, even if there were a thousand of Vergerius's works, not to trouble you with any business. If perhaps you were offended by anything in my sincerity or even excessive writing, please feel free to let me know. I am indeed conscious of having written nothing that is not true, or at least that I do not consider to be so.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, although I assume that you are not unaware of the news, I write nonetheless what I learned yesterday from Antwerp through certain and trustworthy letters: namely, that England is being shaken by internal dissensions, the people, who seem to stand by the gospel, are strongly opposing the queen because she did not want the papist religion, but the Christian and pure one, as it was under the king, and they do not agree in any way that she should take the King of Spain as a husband, but rather an Englishman who would allow free religion. They have closed all entrances so that no one can enter or leave England. The English, along with their goods and ships, are being held by the Emperor so that they cannot leave Antwerp, thus forcing them to agree to the queen's will.</p>
      <p>I have read the excellent and very strong book by Calvin against Servetus and I am sending one to Massario, the Italian, who resides with Gesner.</p>
      <p>It is astonishing that there are still those who disapprove of that deed, namely the death of that abyss and cesspool of all heresies, nor do they reject the doctrine but retain it, although they do everything secretly and in corners. Farewell and satisfy me with a single word when you have time. From Basel, the 26th day of February 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Guglielmo Grataroli, physician. To the best pastor of the Zurich church, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed sir.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
