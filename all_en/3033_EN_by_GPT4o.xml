      <p>Greetings. After the previous letters were closed, Apiarius came and informed me of what was decreed by the senate. The matter was presented differently than I had thought; for mention was made of you and your work. The senate wants it to be first reviewed by the school authorities, and although they are very inclined to have it printed, they fear that some disturbances might arise from the opposing side because the mystery of iniquity is undoubtedly explained there with the Roman idol. Froschauer's letters were read aloud before the senate, which (since he strongly insists that the name of the city of Bern be added with the consent of the magistrate) aroused suspicion in many that Froschauer seeks to exempt himself and the people of Zurich, but involve our people in the dispute that could arise from it. And if this is the case, I would prefer to have nothing to do with this matter, lest I be blamed in the end as an accomplice who did not give prior warning. Therefore, I ask you to consult on what should be done. If this is known, then it is better to let it go; otherwise, it is thought that all displeasure would gladly be placed on my lord. Otherwise, my lord would be very pleased and would consider it a great honor if your work were published here.</p>
      <p>I wanted to add this to the previous letters so that you know what has been done. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Dated as before.</p>
      <p>We still very much wish to review these your writings and to enjoy them for our benefit.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed and dear lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>October 10, 1556.</p>
      <p>To print the Apocalypse in Bern.</p>
