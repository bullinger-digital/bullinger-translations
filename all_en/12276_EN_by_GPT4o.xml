    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer sent more news through the [Zürich] messenger the day before [...] [No. 2227]. He thanks for the letter [from Johannes a Lasco to Bucer dated June 23, 1545], which he will copy and return through Matthäus [Molckenpur] or [Katharina] von Zimmern. What he has read so far from [a Lasco's] letter and book [“Defensio verae doctrinae”] pleases him greatly. - He thanks for the efforts regarding [Konrad] Curio [Hofherr]; may he meet the expectations! - The death of [Kaspar] Megander is a painful loss for Blarer and the church. Blarer heard that Megander was hated by many because he demanded strict moral discipline. May a worthy successor be found! - There is nothing to report about the outcome of the Diet [at Worms]. All decisions were postponed to another Diet [in Regensburg] on [January 6, 1546]. Matthäus [Molckenpur], who was one of the envoys [of Konstanz], will gladly report to Bullinger about it. Bullinger should not mention Blarer's letter [above No. 2227] to Molckenpur. - Blarer recommends the good [Thomas Grunder]. - Greetings. - [P.S.:] Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander], who should send the mill [sketch by Gerhard Westerburg].</p>

      <p>Yesterday, through your messenger, I wrote to you at length about our affairs and common matters. I am grateful for the letter, which I still retain by a certain right of mine in you and yours, to be copied. I will certainly send it through our Matthäus or surely through the noble and pious woman from Zimmern, who will soon travel back there. For I think that in the meantime, it can be without any inconvenience for you, until you receive it through either one. The copy will be of no harm to anyone, for I will keep it to myself. The taste of both this and the booklet is greatly pleasing to me. For I have not yet read it all.</p>
      <p>I am very grateful for your concern about Curio. For I hope, through your kindness, that he will meet our expectations.</p>
      <p>I cannot help but deeply grieve that your Megander was taken from the church at such an inopportune time. Indeed, he now receives from the prince of pastors, Christ, an unfading crown of glory, admitted into the joys of his Lord. Meanwhile, the church is deprived of the care of such a good pastor, not without great loss, especially in such a scarcity of faithful ministers. I hear that Megander was particularly hated by many for this reason, because he vehemently opposed a more licentious life and urged stricter discipline more than others; yet this will be attributed to him as praise by all good people. May the Lord soon provide another worthy of this stewardship of His mysteries in his place! Amen.</p>
      <p>The outcome of the Diet was such that there is nothing to write about it. Everything will be continued in another Diet on the calends of January, which began in these, with equal, I do not doubt, success. Our Matthäus will gladly tell you more about these matters (since he was one of our envoys). But be careful not to tell him that I wrote to you that he will soon be there, etc. I commend this good man to you as much as I can.</p>
      <p>May your household be well with all brothers and friends. I both ask and hope to be perpetually aided by your intercessions with the Lord. August 28.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Greet our Theodor most accurately and remind him of the mills.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zürich.</p>
