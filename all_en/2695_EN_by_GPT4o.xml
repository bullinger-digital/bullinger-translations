      <p>S. D. Greetings. Since pious and learned men advise it, and you also insist, go with Christ our Lord guiding and protecting you to Wittenberg in Saxony to Dr. Philipp, to whom I am writing a letter of recommendation, asking him to receive you at his table or, if that is not convenient, to take you under his protection. Froschauer will give you 4 thalers for travel expenses; with these, I think you can comfortably reach Saxony; you will act as befits a frugal person. In Frankfurt, together with your master, a good man will be sought for you, to whom you will be recommended, who will lead you to Saxony; he will be given 20 of our gold coins, 16 of our batzen or 15 from Constance per gold coin. These will be given to Philipp or your patron, so that you may spend the greater part of them on food or board, and use some for your necessities. This is allocated for half a year; for if I pay you another 20 for the other half, the total will be 40 gulden. The very generous Republic of Zurich pays the same to its stipendiaries, and the illustrious Collin gives the same to his sons. I am not so well-off, but I will do more than my means allow; for I must also support Rodolphus, Christophorus, and still educate two girls, Veritas and Dorothea. I pay your three sisters 30 gold coins each year. See, my son, what expenses I incur.</p>
      <p>Regarding household management and daily expenses, I say nothing. Therefore, behave yourself and be frugal, do not incur unnecessary expenses. For I cannot afford it. I have often spoken and written about this matter, nor do I think you have lost my booklet.</p>
      <p>I send the guidance to your master's wife; there is no need for you to double the expenses with the last ones; she does not need to be extravagant; it already costs a lot for the pasture, etc. However, I ask this of you: 1. Prepare a booklet like the one you see your brother has; when you leave, ask Martyr, Zanchus, Sturmius, etc., to write their opinions in the book with their own hands.</p>
      <p>Take an example from Rodolphus's booklet. 2. Ask your teachers for testimonials of diligence and life and send them to me through Mesikomer; I will keep them until you return home. 3. If you have friends or know good men whose recommendations might benefit you in Saxony, ask and receive them from them. 4. As soon as you arrive in Wittenberg, deliver my letters to Dr. Philipp and ask him to receive you, or if it is entirely inconvenient for him (but do not mention this until he himself says it is inconvenient), ask him to protect you, be a father to you, and advise you where you can live comfortably or find lodging. 5. Attend all of Philipp's lectures; from others, choose the theological lecture of Major and in mathematics that of Caspar Peucer. See that you do not burden yourself with lectures; see that you are diligent, you will soon be recalled. Learn the Latin and Greek languages, dialectics, rhetoric, the arts, and with these, theology. As soon as the opportunity arises, write what lodging you have and what kind, at what price, who the teachers are, and what lectures. 6. Do not argue with the Saxons. Say that you are here for the sake of learning, not for the sake of contention. Write diligently about all your affairs. There is a university in Rostock by the Baltic Sea; there teaches the learned Dr. David Chytraeus, a special friend of mine. Write to him immediately that you are now in Wittenberg by my order for the sake of studies, asking him to deign to recommend you to his friends, whom he has in Wittenberg as the best; send him my greetings, that I wrote to him in July and sent letters through Augsburg and now again send others to the Frankfurt fair.</p>
      <p>Do not take too many belongings with you to Saxony in books and other things; what you can leave with Rodolphus, do so; otherwise, the transport costs too much. Be frugal and save. Carefully keep your handwritten booklets and collections from lectures. I cannot say more now; Rodolphus will add other things. May Almighty God faithfully protect and guide you, my dear child, and grant you His grace, that you may become learned, pious, modest, and honorable to the glory of God and your salvation.</p>
      <p>May God faithfully protect you. Grace to everyone in Strasbourg and thank your teachers sincerely, and those who have done you good. Behave honorably, godly, and well, be humble and quiet on the road, and wherever you go. Pray to the Lord that, as He was with Jacob and Joseph on their journey, so He may be with you. Your mother and all your sisters send you their grace, asking you to be obedient, quiet, diligent, frugal, and godly. They all greet you sincerely.</p>
      <p>Write to me what you have received and spent since the lord was here above and reckoned with me; for since then you have not sent me a report as before. Also, note what he now gives you for clothes, in total, what you owe him, and send it to me through Caspar.</p>
      <p>Be friendly to the Collin brothers, Rodolphus and Theodor, do not be contemptuous and proud, take care of your affairs, study, and do not attach yourself to any companions, except occasionally and rarely, as is proper.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and keep you forever. Farewell. Zurich, August 22, 1555.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Whatever else you have, letters and rings, that you want to send up, give it to Caspar in a leather bag; we will send the bag back to Rodolphus through the Wüsten or Heinrich Wüsten. And if it happens that you can come to Melanchthon and he has great, rich lords, see that you let them do their work, do not argue with them in Saxon, but take care of your own affairs.</p>
      <p>Consider this equally, if you have your lodging outside his house, but the table in his house. However, try how the matter will arrange and develop. May God grant grace.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Heinrich Bullinger, residing in the house of Dr. John Burcher, the Englishman, in Strasbourg.</p>
