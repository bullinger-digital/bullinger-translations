      <p>Because I hope to be present shortly, I will respond briefly to your letter, H. Bullinger, brother. I spoke of Coelius's book as I had written, not impious and heretical. But let me have said it.</p>
      <p>Is not a book impious and heretical in which it is taught that a man can be saved without Christ? See if he said it on page 196. Then you add that it is not yet known as a wolf, but I say it is already known by those who wanted to read the book thoroughly, and shortly [...] you will see the judgment of many, which will stand out. Finally, you say you are upset that I provoked him and did not rather follow your advice. But it upsets me that you cannot bear him, who barks at such a book. What then? [...] should it have been allowed for the error to spread like cancer and devastate the churches? You say the man is preparing an apology, I do not doubt, and in it, he will produce your letters, which he boasts of having, and then those who will respond will be forced to make you almost guilty of the same crime (take it kindly, I write as a brother), and so I fear it may happen if you wrote as he claims. If he had a dispute with me as a private person, the case would still fall, because he harbors evil; but how much more, when my princes fight for me, who have warned the Basel Senate with very serious letters to restrain the man's slander. Since he refused to acquiesce when justly accused, let him have what he deserves.</p>
      <p>I will remain for another month before I return to Sarmatia. Our Duke condemned Gribaldi's doctrines with great solemnity; the senate of the school was present at the judgment, many counselors from the chief, many theologians. Thus it is; he will depart marked.</p>
      <p>I am absolutely certain that I (although I was the author for the Duke about summoning the man) am free from all suspicion, as if I ever agreed with him.</p>
      <p>War burns in the north. The King in person attacks the Livonians; I fear Germany may become involved. A colloquium will take place, the Bishop of Speyer will attend on behalf of Ferdinand. My lord will not go, because Augustus, given authority by the diet, says he must go to Denmark to his father-in-law.</p>
      <p>Again I beg you, Bullinger, take it kindly, that I have dealt with you more freely about Coelius's book, as befits a brother. Farewell and expect me shortly.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, July 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Vergerius</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother. Zürich.</p>
