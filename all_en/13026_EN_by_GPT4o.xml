    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The response of the Augsburg council [from August 4] to the letter from the Zurich council [from July 28] concerning Johannes Haller will certainly also be received by Bullinger for reading. Haller wishes to remain in Augsburg for a few more weeks, as preaching has not been prohibited, especially since Emperor Charles V wants to leave the current state of religious affairs untouched until the general reform. The insult of those of different faiths is prohibited under penalty of death. The [Protestants] expect nothing from such a reform but rely on God's providence. Haller is not in greater danger than any other citizen. Frölich will support him to the best of his ability, even though he is the most hated. Bishop Otto Truchsess von Waldburg even wants to accuse him before the Emperor for the publication of the "Epitome belli [papistarum]"!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The weakened, inactive Emperor postpones everything to the [Reichstag beginning on] September 1. Germany is to blame for its own suffering and will miserably crumble. Bullinger, pray for Frölich, who especially needs God's assistance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Greetings, also to the colleagues and the authorities. In haste between two meetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Hans Schöner has no valid reason to complain at all. He has ridden himself into his misfortune! The chapel, which is [in the legal dispute with Augsburg], does not belong to him. He has also unnecessarily provided himself with a bodyguard and refused to return to Augsburg. Instead, he sought help from the Bishop of Mainz, Albrecht of Brandenburg. Additionally, he published an unfounded defamatory pamphlet [“Warhafftige anzaigung”] against the Augsburg council. Therefore, he can expect nothing more from Augsburg.</p>

      <p>Dear esteemed lord and brother, the letter written by my gracious lords of Zurich in response to the matter of Mr. Johann Haller, our mutual dear brother, will certainly be acknowledged by my lords' letter, which will undoubtedly not be withheld from you. He wishes to remain for a few more weeks, as preaching is not prohibited, but rather the Emperor wants the current state of religion to remain until a general reformation! It is forbidden under penalty of life and limb to offend anyone on account of this. There is indeed no hope for us from the reformation, but from the divine ordination of the Lord. Brother Haller is not in more danger than any other citizen here. I myself, as insignificant as I am, will support him, although I know I bear more hatred and danger than any of the Augsburgers. For the Bishop of Augsburg publicly defames me because of the published "Epitome belli" and threatens me with the Emperor's judgment.</p>

      <p>The Emperor is weakened here and nothing is being done, but all cases are postponed and suspended until September 1. In summary: Germany has suffered violence due to its own fault and will be miserably shaken. Pray to the Lord for Brother Laetus, who certainly needs the Lord's help more than others afflicted.</p>

      <p>Farewell. Greetings to all the brothers and lords of Zurich. In haste between meetings on August 4, 1547.</p>

      <p>Hans Schöner truly has no valid reason to complain; and if I must speak according to my conscience, he has brought such misery upon himself willfully. The chapel he mentions was no more his than mine. He was excessively provided with a bodyguard, did not want to return, but instead attached himself to the priests in Mainz and let a very disgraceful unfounded book be published against a council. Therefore, I know no advice for his case. He will achieve nothing here! Yours, G. L.</p>
      <p>To the Christian learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the Christian community of Zurich's esteemed (Antistes), to be delivered.</p>
