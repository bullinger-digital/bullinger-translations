      <p>Well-learned, worthy, especially gracious, dear sir, I send you my friendly greetings and entirely good-willed service beforehand.</p>
      <p>Especially gracious, dear sir, Mr. Hans Nußbaumer, known as the schoolmaster, deacon here in Winterthur, has informed me that he needs a testimonial from you and other of your colleagues regarding his knowledge, teaching, and conduct (moral behavior), and has therefore earnestly requested me to kindly provide such a reference. Therefore, since it is appropriate to share the truth with the petitioner, I hereby confirm, as it is my duty to do so, that I am not aware of anything other than that the aforementioned Mr. Hans Nußbaumer has so far preached and taught faithfully according to his understanding, and has also conducted himself piously and decently. I do this to inform you of his request with good intentions. For I am entirely inclined to serve you and the good gentlemen.</p>
      <p>Dated Wednesday before All Saints' Day in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Hans Huser, Mayor of Winterthur.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, worthy Master Heinrich Bullinger, parish priest and preacher at the Minster in Zurich, my gracious, dear sir.</p>
