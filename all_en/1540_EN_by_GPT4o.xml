      <p>That you have diligently labored to appease the wrath of our Pharaoh and to help our miserable brothers, you have indeed proven yourself to be the same person you have always been. For I well remember how faithfully and vigorously you have always devoted yourself to this cause. Although I have reason to fear that little progress has been made with letters, which is not new for courtiers to evade. Indeed, the king's envoy recently confessed this to me in my ear when he was passing through here. Therefore, a person would be needed if we wish to achieve anything. I hear that this matter was discussed in Baden, but that deliberation perhaps vanished. I am so convinced of your faith and diligence that I consider it superfluous to urge you with a single word.</p>
      <p>In the other matter, I wish we had been so satisfied that we could thank you and your colleagues without exception. But because we have experienced with bitter pain that there is sometimes less help from you than we had been promised, I prefer to complain to you openly about it rather than to harbor resentment by suppressing it. You write that you were surprised why, when harassed by a wicked and insolent scoundrel about the doctrine he was slandering, we asked for your opinion? We were greatly mistaken: for when he accused us of impious doctrine, we referred the judgment to you as a mark of honor. I do not see why this should have been troublesome for you. Certainly, however much labor might have been undertaken, I did not think the burden would be so unpleasant for you that it would bring as much relief to the brothers. You write that it is difficult to simply subscribe to disputations, especially when there are things in them that the reader might think could be treated differently and perhaps more conveniently. But I never believed, nor do I think today, that you are among those who are so pleased with their own that they read nothing foreign without disdain. Nor was it my intention to dictate a formula to you to which we would want you to subscribe precisely. It was more than enough for the doctrine, which we uphold as received from the word of God, to be approved by your vote: nor was it a matter of whether it was handled skillfully or cleverly by us. Indeed, the crude and entirely artless treatment showed that we had no other purpose than to refute the man's wicked slanders and to testify that we teach nothing but what is drawn from the pure source of the word of God. What I had asked, that it would not be burdensome for you to give our magistrate a response as if on a new and untouched matter, was not to be feared, in my judgment, that anyone would accuse you of lying. For what compelled you to profess about what no one had inquired? But I easily endure that it seemed otherwise to you. That you desire modesty and humanity in us, we gather from the fact that less faith was placed in our letters than was fitting. I wish Hieronymus were not a bad man as they have proclaimed to you. I wish that what you seem to have noticed in him he would attribute all to the grace of God. But for him who has seditiously disturbed a peaceful church, who has attempted to divide us with deadly dissension, who has burdened us with every kind of reproach without ever being provoked by the slightest injury, who has publicly accused us of attributing a tyrannical rule to God, indeed of fabricating a poetic Jupiter in place of God, it is very absurd to be defended by your patronage. Furthermore, whether he attributes everything to the grace of God who boasts that equal grace is offered to all, but its efficacy depends on the free will of each one, who babbles that hearts of flesh are given indiscriminately to all, that is, capable of grace, but that whether one receives it depends on his own motion, you will see. In sum, it greatly pains me that there is not a better agreement among us concerning his cause. I was truly astonished when I read in your letters that the manner of teaching I use displeases many good men, just as Hieronymus is offended by Zwinglian. I beseech you, what is similar? For Zwingli's booklet, to speak familiarly among us, is so filled with harsh paradoxes that it is far removed from the moderation I have applied. You have not rightly interpreted that a new work is promised by me, in which I would undertake to demonstrate that God is not the author of sin. For when that calumny weighed on me as an impostor, to refute it, I objected, as was true, that I had sufficiently testified in a published book how much I abhor that blasphemy. I understand the book published long ago against the Libertines. And yet the wickedness of this scoundrel compelled me to append what remained concerning predestination to my response against Pighius. If I seem to err to you, I will gladly allow myself to be advised by you. However, why I should not frankly and undisguisedly express what has been given to me, I abundantly recount there.</p>
      <p>Hieronymus himself has been expelled by public judgment into perpetual exile: indeed, the false rumor that we sought a harsher punishment was spread by slanderers and foolishly believed. Our Farel, especially for treating the maid's cancer, has so devoted himself to the man that he might almost seem bewitched. It was easy to shake off the trouble from us on the first day, but at the request of pious brothers, the effort was to purge the Bernese territory of that pestilence. Now, since the response was ambiguous, the scoundrel boasts that you support his error.</p>
      <p>As for the outcome of the tragedy you wished to be informed about, I wish it were possible to provide it at present. But I am greatly mistaken unless you soon hear that he has paved the way for himself with certain preludes to stir up greater disturbances. However, concerning your response, forgive me if I have freely complained to you from the inner feeling of my mind. I willingly forgive our friendship for having frustrated my expectation. Among others, I dissemble as if I were entirely satisfied in every respect.</p>
      <p>However, because my brother's father-in-law is somewhat concerned about his son, who is being raised there, I am compelled to trouble you on his behalf. I wish to obtain this one thing from you in his name, that you call the boy's teacher to you, inquire about his progress, and if you find that the father's hope and wish are being disappointed in him, inform me at the earliest opportunity.</p>
