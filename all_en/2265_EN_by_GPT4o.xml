      <p>Greetings and Peace. I have learned from the letter you recently wrote to me, venerable godfather, of your usual benevolence towards me; you show yourself so concerned about me that if you were my father, I could hope for nothing more. Indeed, this letter was doubly pleasing: both because I saw that I was not neglected by you, and because at that time God had cast me into such calamity, in which I was compelled to mourn not only the common fate of the church but also my own private one. Struck by these twin blows, why should not a woman's mind seem to have immediately collapsed? But the spirit of the Lord was present, who stirred up his prophets to console me: among whom you were one, by whose letters I was especially refreshed. May the Lord Jesus repay you with his blessing! For after receiving and reading them, I began, with God's help, to gradually lift myself against such a weight of calamities: and thus far I support myself as much as I can with the word of God, often rereading your letters, to spur this sluggish flesh. You will do what is worthy of your piety if you continue to support me in this way, now somewhat aroused by you, with more frequent letters. For I am grateful that you express a desire for me to be there, nor would I prefer to be anywhere else. But since God, by the command of my lord husband and the advice of friends, finally drove me out of England and brought me safely to Antwerp, I took the opportunity of somewhat convenient company to visit my relative in Frankfurt, where by God's mercy the senate has granted the foreign church freedom for the entire ecclesiastical ministry of both word and sacraments. This has made me more willing to stay here in rented private lodgings until I see what the Lord God will do for my lord husband. About whom, since I have heard nothing so far, I am quite anxious. Yet I know he is in God's care. Therefore, I rest in the providence of my God: and although this burden of widowhood is heavy, I console myself as much as I can with prayers and the word of God.</p>
      <p>I ask you by Christ to help me also with your prayers and letters. I beg you to greet most dutifully my dearest godmother, your wife, with the whole family. I wish health to Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gualther, Mr. Sebastian the schoolmaster, and all the brothers. I pray to the most good and great God that he may continually grant you the increase of his spirit. Farewell, most loving and venerable godfather in Christ.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, April 20, the day after the church of the White Virgins was opened to us, where Mr. Valerand Poullain, my relative's husband and the church's pastor, gave the first sermon and baptized a child born on the Rhine. May God grant this church just and worthy growth in his name. Pray for it. Our pastor, my relative, earnestly asked me to greet you in his name and to commend his ministry to your prayers and those of the other fellow ministers. Again, farewell in Christ. A.D. 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Rachel prays for your health and that of your wife. Daniel is still in England. When he returns, I will send a most honorable matron, who has lived with me until now. I commend my lord husband to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Your most loving godmother, Anne Hooper.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful and vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, dearest godfather and venerable father in Christ. Zürich.</p>
