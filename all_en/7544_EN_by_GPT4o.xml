      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, dear brother, and amidst various and numerous disturbances, I respond to you briefly. The report that is being announced everywhere throughout Rhaetia to the communities is pleasing.</p>
      <p>Your letter, however, is displeasing in every respect, not because it was written by you, and as far as you are concerned, but as far as it concerns [injustice, treachery, and corruption]. I pray to the Lord to assist and heal you in these difficulties. I see [...]</p>
      <p>This week, the most illustrious prince, Christoph, Duke of Bavaria, son of the Elector, a young man of 17 years, passed through here. He studied in Geneva and came to us via Bern. He was received and dismissed in the most friendly and honorable manner and went to Basel accompanied by some of ours and the Bernese.</p>
      <p>The prince is of great promise; may the Lord bless him! Also, in these days, Peter Datheen came; you will understand what he has done from the attached writing. He prayed that I would encourage you to attend the cause and, if you know anyone who is wealthy, to encourage them to contribute something. Therefore, fulfill the role of a good messenger and respond if there is any hope. A diet has been declared in Aarau for the four cities of Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen on August 8th.</p>
      <p>They say that new forces clashed at Groningen and again about 300 Albanians were lost; Alba sent Scipio Vitelli there; he himself is hiding in the most fortified castle of 's-Hertogenbosch; new forces are also coming from Spain and Italy. You have here the pretext under which Egmond was killed. The German knights' captain, who is in France under Casimir and Duke Wilhelm, the best have pledged themselves to the Uranian. Claus von Hattstatt leads a regiment of landsknechts and otherwise a count also leads a regiment, likewise a baron from Lorraine with 4000 Gascons and French; they will be on the Meuse on August 1st, and great seriousness is being applied.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God grant grace; for it is very much needed. Also praying to God faithfully. Greet for me the three mayors, Mr. Karl, Pontisella, Ganthner, all of them.</p>
      <p>Most hastily. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 30, 1568.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
