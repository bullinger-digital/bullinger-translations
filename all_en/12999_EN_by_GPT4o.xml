    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger remains silent because he is upset about Haller's letter [not received]. However, it is now clear that he had good reason to be annoyed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] A Reichstag was announced in Augsburg for September 1st. In three days, the dictator, Emperor Charles V, is expected to arrive in the city. Accommodations have already been arranged for some princes. Many are expected to come, including numerous Spaniards. The fate of the pastors is uncertain. They have become a laughingstock for everyone! Ottavio Farnese, Lord of Camerino, son-in-law of the Emperor and grandson of Pope Paul III, has been here for eight days. Mayor Hans Welser, who anticipated [this influx], has left for Pfäfers with his entire family. Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, is to be quartered in his house. The two prisoners, Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse, are also to be brought here. Duke Heinrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, on the other hand, will appear as a free man. Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, his son Antoine, Bishop of Arras, and some abbots will be Haller's neighbors! He might even be forced to accommodate Spaniards himself. So this is the protection that the [Augsburg councilors] promised!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] But what of it! According to the wishes of the people of Zurich, Haller will remain in Augsburg. With steadfast faith, he will face the future and proclaim the Gospel, which he has preached to the merchants, to the Herodians and the Pharisees as well!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings. If Bullinger writes, he should express himself cautiously. Haller does not know when he will be able to write more.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] He has just learned that 40 horsemen are to be quartered in the St. Anna Monastery, where Nikolaus Müller known as Maier, Michael Keller, Sixt Birck, and he himself live together with Thoman Ruman. As soon as one says something to [the Imperial], they make it clear that they are now the masters. They corrupt boys and girls. This clearly shows how well [the Augsburg councilors] care for pastors and the church, indeed, how they care for the edification [of the population]!</p>

      <p>S. Because you have not written back, I gather that you are offended by my recent letters; but the current situation proves that I had good reason to write with indignation.</p>

      <p>A Reichstag has been announced for the first of September in our city. We expect the dictator, Emperor Charles V, to arrive within three days. Accommodations are already being assigned to each of the princes. There will be a great number of attendees. Many Spaniards are gathering. We do not know what will become of us. We are a laughingstock to everyone and are oppressed by immeasurable dangers. Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Camerino, the Emperor's son-in-law and the Pope's grandson, has been here for eight days. Mayor Hans Welser, foreseeing this, has gone to Pfäfers with his entire family. The Duke of Alba, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, will be staying in his house. The captive Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse are being brought here. Duke Heinrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel comes as a free man. My neighbors will be Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, the Bishop of Arras, and several abbots. I fear I may also be forced to host Spaniards. This is the protection they promised us!</p>

      <p>But what of it! You wanted me to stay. Therefore, I will remain and with strong faith, I will face whatever comes! The Christ I have professed before the publicans, I will not deny now before the Herodians and Pharisees!</p>

      <p>Farewell. If you wish to write, do so cautiously. I do not know when I will be able to write more. July 14, 1547. Your forever, Johannes Haller.</p>

      <p>After I wrote this, we were informed that 40 horsemen are to be quartered in our monastery, where Nikolaus Müller known as Maier, Michael Keller, Sixt Birck, and I live, along with Thoman Ruman. As soon as anyone says a word, they assert that they are the masters. No citizen can say anything against them. Strange things are happening! Boys and even girls are being corrupted! This is how well they care for us and the church! This is how much we are building up!</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, his revered father. Zurich.</p>
