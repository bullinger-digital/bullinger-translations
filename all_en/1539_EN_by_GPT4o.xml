      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Two days ago, your letter was delivered to me, most esteemed Bullinger, and on that very day, I sent royal letters and those for Hooper from here to the courier; I entrusted them very diligently to Mr. Richard, our singular friend, so that by his efforts they may be delivered to the king and to Hooper; he will not refuse this duty, I am quite sure, due to the old bond of friendship between us.</p>
      <p>I approve of the content of your letter to the king and do not doubt that it will benefit both Hooper and religion. The bishops have ordered Hooper to be silent, accusing him of heresy, as our Thomas Knithus wrote to me from England; I am sending you letters that can be translated into Latin by the efforts of Mr. Butler (to whom you should commend me a thousand times). From there, you will understand what Satan is plotting, against whom we must strongly resist. And I ask, since you can greatly benefit the reborn church, that with the common consent of you, Calvin, and other learned men, a document be published to the king, so that he may be rightly instructed in this controversy. Otherwise, as you see, the truth is in danger, for the defense of which you have labored greatly, do not allow it to be utterly lost among the English. I am sending you the news I have received about the war turmoil in the regions of Saxony. They were written to me by a friend from Cologne. He also added in his letter that a man in gold is carried on a banner with the inscription: "If God is with us, who can be against us?" They also carry a virgin on another emblem with a serpent depicted before her, to whom the virgin speaks these words: "Away for now, Satan!" I do not affirm how true these things are; however, they were written to me by an honest and trustworthy person. If you need my assistance in any matter, I am most ready.</p>
      <p>My wife sends her most diligent greetings to you and your wife. May she be well and safe from me. I wish you, your family, and all the people of ZÃ¼rich a happy, quiet, and peaceful coming year. May the Lord, in His mercy, grant you and all kingdoms the peace of Jesus Christ! Strasbourg, January 21, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Burcher.</p>
