      <p>Most illustrious man, today I came to Chur and received your letter dated the 10th of this month, which indeed was delightful to me for many reasons. Now I write back briefly. After the synod is concluded, I must return to the ministry and settle many matters both there and in the Valtellina. But after having dinner with my people, I will finally come to you, my Bullinger; for it will not only be celebrated in Vicosoprano but also in that valley recently acquired by water, so that we may take possession. But listen, brother in Christ: the departure of the Bishop of Chur to Rome first stirred the courtiers to think about Raetia and to think about revenge; but later, when two of the highest cardinals traveled here over a span of almost two months with eight bishops and another crowd, you should know for certain that they have corrupted some with prayers and bribes to destroy me. The matter, I say, is certain; thus, with human prudence and help, I will scarcely escape. Everything is filled with traps. But I trust in the Lord: help me with your prayers. Around the first of January, I will be with you, if God wills. In the meantime, send a small vessel here to Chur, which I ask of you. Lord Franz Bonet shared with me the letters you recently wrote to him. That good brother loves you sincerely and sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>There are many things for us to accomplish here in the synod; among other things, I affirm that it will happen that the venomous man (I mean Camillus) will be expelled from Raetia. Farewell and greetings to your whole family, school, and church. May the Lord bless your labors. Amen.</p>
      <p>Chur, 15th of November, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zürich, honorable lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
