      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, most excellent man and most revered father to me, along with those papers which you sent back to me. As for that noble boy, he has been placed with our Beraldus as agreed, from whom I dare to promise you that he will be both faithfully educated and liberally treated. Indeed, he will be so recommended to me personally, and also to other colleagues, that we will leave nothing undone that can assist his studies and also shape his character. Regarding the price and other conditions, Beraldus himself, I believe, is writing to you. If perhaps the price seems higher than you expected, two things must be explained to the boy's father: namely, that the price of wine has tripled this year with us and grain has also become a little more expensive than the previous year; secondly, that it is our condition that we collect nothing at all from annual taxes, as citizens usually do, but that everything must be purchased with ready money in the market and forum. But in summary, I assure you that no profit is being sought here by Beraldus, but only that he can honestly nourish and educate the boy without his own detriment and prove his trust to all of you. But about these things, I believe, you have no doubts and will arrange everything according to your wisdom.</p>
      <p>We too are greatly troubled by this concern about the Genevan alliance. For there is no doubt that, unless the Lord provides, certain ruin threatens that church. All good and wise men who are there have long seen and warned about this, and especially he upon whose head some are trying to transfer all the blame for this matter, undeservedly indeed and very (not to say more harshly) shamelessly, since no one has made a greater effort to settle this whole dispute. May the Lord, therefore, have mercy on us and unite the minds of the princes, and block the plans of Satan. May He also confirm this excellent will in your most illustrious council and all of you, that you may interpose your parts here. For without a doubt, this effort of yours will be pleasing to all the pious, and so useful to the church of God that nothing could be more so. Therefore, there is no need for me to write to you at length about this matter. But still, I ask that you do not rest until the matter has been obtained, for which I do not doubt that the Genevans themselves will soon send to you.</p>
      <p>About our affairs, I have only this to write. In Lyon, they say it has been decreed by the king's edict that no one from these regions may be received by any host under a roof who has not first registered their name with the city's magistrate. Thus, certain destruction threatens all exiles if they have gone there. But the Lord will also provide for His own here. In the church of Anjou, the number of the faithful has increased so much that a third minister had to be sent in recent days. We also sent a minister to Paris, where a church has also been established. Pray to the Lord, my father, that He may expand His kingdom, and strengthen our brothers who are in the jaws of the lion with the spirit of faith and patience. Surely, in the end, the tyrant will be forced either to destroy entire cities or to concede some place to the truth. Meanwhile, see to it that no rumor of these matters spreads in such a way that some, who run here and there to catch all rumors, can hinder these most excellent plans with their reports.</p>
      <p>But enough of these matters for now. All our brothers and fellow ministers greet you, and especially our Viretus, who recently lost a little boy, his only male child. My wife, in very uncertain health, commends herself to your prayers and those of your most excellent wife. Farewell, my most esteemed father. May the Lord Jesus keep you, guide you with His spirit, and more and more confirm you, protect and cherish your entire church.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, 12th of February.</p>
      <p>Th. Beza, your most devoted son.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of God and most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, D. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed father. In Zurich.</p>
