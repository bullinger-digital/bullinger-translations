      <p>Honor to God alone. Strasbourg, June 8, 1550.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Two days ago, I received your letter, dearest Bullinger, dated May 17 in Zürich. In it, you express gratitude for some diligence and effort in sending books and letters to England, and you promise to repay the favor. I certainly do not recognize having done anything, except that I owe it and much more to your kindness. Furthermore, in similar matters, you will have the authority to command. However, I included books, not letters, for Mr. Hooper in the merchandise: I entrusted both his letters and the royal ones to Mr. Richard's servant along with the book dedicated to the king.</p>
      <p>The word of God is being promoted daily through the work and ministry of Mr. Hooper, and I pray to the most good and great God to strengthen what he has begun. A certain friend from England wrote to me that the king, after Easter, called Hooper to him and wanted to reward him with the bishopric of Gloucester. Hooper refused. Not long ago, he was summoned by the council, who insist that he accept. He excused himself, saying he could not, with a good conscience, allow himself to be marked by papal vestments and shaving (which is not yet abolished among bishops). They conceded that he would be free from shaving: he must wear a white linen garment when he enters parliament. However, they consider this to be abolished by the authority of parliament.</p>
      <p>These are the matters concerning Hooper, now to other things. That impure preacher of ours is considered by me no differently than a publican and a heathen, unless he is reconciled to your church and that of Bern. Bucer is more than licentious in the matter of marriage.</p>
      <p>I once heard him disputing this question at the table, where he affirmed that divorce should be granted for any slight cause; so much so that he is not without reason considered by our Winchester as the author of the book published in favor of the Landgrave. I do not know what the mercenary Bucer is plotting in England, who, not yet having seen the wolf, fled from this church. He is in poor health, and rumor has it that he is either becoming childish again or almost becoming foolish: which is usually the role of an unstable and wandering mind.</p>
      <p>My relative came to me unexpectedly a month ago. I am glad he bid you farewell kindly. I have provided for his condition here. I was angry that he did not bid you farewell and give thanks. But he must be forgiven, both because of his otherwise timid age and because of his rather rough and negligent early education.</p>
      <p>There is nothing certain about the Emperor's arrival: it was reported that he would leave Brussels at the end of May; however, now the rumor comes that he did not leave at that time. I sent your recently sent letters via courier to Antwerp; they will reach Hooper's hands in ten days. I know nothing else, except that the papists have reinstated their religion in established temples, and they have not a few supporters. May the Lord preserve and increase what remains of true knowledge. You will greet your wife and all the learned from me as dutifully as possible. Farewell. Strasbourg, June 8, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Burcher.</p>
      <p>Hooper has certainly accepted the bishopric; for Bucer's wife has returned to take her mother and children to England, and she announces this. The Emperor is certainly hastening towards Speyer.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dear pastor of true religion. Zürich.</p>
