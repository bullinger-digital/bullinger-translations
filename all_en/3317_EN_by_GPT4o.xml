      <p>Greetings. I am truly ashamed that, having been favored by you with so many gifts of your unique works, I give nothing in return; I could indeed justly be called ungrateful, which is nevertheless an unworthy name for a good man. Therefore, to at least offer you some token of my gratitude, I send you this cheese from Saanen, which I hope is of good taste, though not such as to match your kindnesses towards me. If a greater opportunity presents itself to me, I will deserve more from you and yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>May all your people be safe.</p>
      <p>Bern, 17th of September, 1557.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
