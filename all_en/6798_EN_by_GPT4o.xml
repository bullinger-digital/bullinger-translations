      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The consul has returned from Cham. The Elector Palatine sent me letters, as did Dr. Johannes Crato, the Palatine's physician, and several other friends. What can I say? I believe the assembly has been dissolved without any fruitful outcome. The Emperor is hastening towards ruin. The Duke of Württemberg and the Count of Zweibrücken have strongly insisted on excluding the Palatine from the peace of the empire, and they have achieved so much that the Palatine, when called to the imperial council, was gravely received and ordered to abandon the Zwinglian doctrine, reserving everything to the Augsburg Confession, etc. But he bravely and freely confessed the truth and did not yield. Afterwards, he occupied his place in all the sessions. He invited our consul to his table and conversed freely with him about religion. Thus, nothing special was decided or settled at the Reichstag; everything hangs in anarchy. Some princes have indulged in much pomp, arrogance, gluttony, and drunkenness. Friends write to me that they are ashamed to mention it, etc. In Spain, the inquisitors are raging most cruelly. Not long ago, they burned a noble German from Mörsperg, and soon after, a Count from Fierren with his English wife. They had a two-year-old child, whom they snatched from the arms of the king and threw into the pyre, etc. Therefore, they are worthy of being relied upon by the Moors, Africans, Turks, etc. Farewell with your family.</p>
