      <p>Greetings. Your letter, venerable father in Christ, has been delivered to me.</p>
      <p>I am most grateful to you for considering us even amidst the gravest of your occupations. I have faithfully communicated everything to the councilors and Mr. Philipp, my colleague; for in this way, we can keep them in their duty, so that later they too, if they have anything worthy of knowledge, will not hesitate to share it with us. Therefore, reverend father, your service is most welcome to all of us.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new now with which to repay you; for it is credible that the acts of the Solothurn assembly have already been sent to you as they have been to us; however, I have attached a note, which was sent to our senate in Solothurn along with the acts. I am very concerned about the letters of the most distinguished man from Salis, and I cannot find out by what chance they did not reach your hands. I had given them to a messenger, who seemed to me most reliable, who himself had come to inquire if I wanted to send any letters, promising to take care of it diligently. However, I do not doubt that in those same letters, Friedrich von Salis informed you of certain things about his mission, about which he had also written to me before. Therefore, even if they are now outdated, I am sending my letters to be read, which you, after reading, should return to me. Farewell, most distinguished man, with your entire family, most happily.</p>
      <p>In haste, as you see.</p>
      <p>Chur, October 5, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. News from Basel, which has come to the common Confederates (except Zürich and Bern) on the recently held day in Solothurn: Polweiler, with his 20 companies of foot soldiers and 500 horses, is to be moved from Alsace through Markirch into Lorraine. And through the free lord of Helfenstein, the current governor in Ensisheim in Upper Alsace, another 20 companies of foot soldiers and 2500 German cavalry, who had previously been assembled in Austria, are to be brought here and will soon arrive in these lands to follow Polweiler's troops.</p>
      <p>It is then considered that both kings, from England and France, will camp against each other near Paris, and both Polweiler's and Helfenstein's regiments are to have the intention to raid back and forth in France and to attack and damage the king of France in and around his lands. It is intended by Polweiler, and it has been heard and reported, that he wants to conduct and arrange his campaign in such a way that he will prevent the Confederates from reaching the king in France. This from Basel. But it is said to me by Mayor Ambrosi that he has been written to by our soldiers from France (the place is called, as I think, Chalon; I am not yet accustomed to the French names; I do not doubt, I have also written false names to you recently, like Rüß for Rätz, etc.) about how they have been mustered, honorably and well paid, and are willing to move on to Paris, etc. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant president of the Church of Zürich, his patron and most esteemed benefactor.</p>
