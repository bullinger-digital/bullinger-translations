    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for sending a collection of letters by Erasmus - Vadian has meanwhile taken the book to St. Gallen -, which have embarrassed him and aroused his sympathy for the aged author. Attributes Erasmus' move to Basel to his concern about the fate of [Thomas] More and [John Fisher] and advises Myconius to strive for his friendship in order to fully win him over to the evangelical cause. Sends a copy of his letter to Melanchthon [above No. 636]. Speculates about the reason for a critical remark by Myconius regarding the politics of ZÃ¼rich. Sends him the requested book. Asks for news. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I give you, most learned Myconius, the greatest thanks for the book of Erasmus' letters. I have not yet read it in full; for Vadianus snatched it from my hands, though I offered it willingly, and took it to St. Gallen. However, I have read several letters, in which I have never seen anything more foolish. For either he gnaws at the reputation of good men, or he obscures certain Christian doctrines by disputing them on both sides and turns them into doubt, or he shamefully flatters certain worthless men. Is it not indeed a remarkable impudence that he boasts so much of the gifts, wealth, and friendships of princes, abbots, and bishops? I truly pity the pitiable old man, and I attribute those trifles to a senility returning to childhood. That preacher pleased me more, although I have not read him entirely either. I attribute his flight to you in Basel to the fate of More and Fisher. Perhaps he thinks it safer to act among a free people than under the protection of princes. What if Ferdinand, at some point, incited by some monks and jesters, ordered Erasmus to be taken as the primary author of disturbances and heresies in Germany or to be secretly put to death? Perhaps the miserable old man fears this, and letters written back and forth may instill fear in him, astonished at the lust of certain princes and their momentary change. Certainly, the fate of More has reminded me of human misery, and that nothing is more slippery than the favor of princes, and nothing is more inconstant and dangerous than fortune. To serve Christ the Lord and His truth from the heart, to die for this is sacred and by far the happiest thing on this earth. I would meet the man amicably and address him honorably. What if such a great man in his old age were to come over to us entirely? I beseech you, consider prudently what I have said and think that the opportunity is very valuable.</p>
      <p>I feel the same about concord as you do. I wrote to Philipp, but for certain reasons, I did not want to write to Luther. Return the copy with the next messenger, and tell me what you hear about the concord, which they praise so much.</p>
      <p>What our people are doing that could so displease those good men, I truly do not know, unless you think it is because they are acting too anxiously in the Solothurn affair or because they did not want to write to the Duke of Savoy as bluntly as they requested, without you and others. In the meantime, we will diligently observe what you have instructed to be guarded.</p>
      <p>I am now sending a copy, about which you say in vain that you have instructed Binder to do certain things.</p>
      <p>What do you hear about the Emperor? What about the future council? What about the schemes of the French?</p>
      <p>Utinger wishes you well. My mother and wife wish your wife well. I do not want you to be worried about the plague. If it takes me away, the Lord will provide a more suitable one for the church.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 2nd October 1535.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
