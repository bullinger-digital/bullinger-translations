      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, greetings. Here are 16 letters of Petrarch printed under my care; I know well that you have seen and even cited them in your writings; nevertheless, have this as a memento from your Vergerius, who holds you in such high esteem. Pole's book in favor of the papacy will be published at the next fair, but not without antidotes. If only Sleidan's history could also be published; but I fear that Antiochus will take care to suppress it; I know what I am saying. Our duke has returned from the assembly, having achieved what he wanted there; he obtained the investiture, which he had not yet received, and was received honorably by the king and, as it appeared, even affectionately, if indeed affection can exist between such different minds, not in trivial matters, but in the most serious matter, namely religion, whose diversity often dissolves and disrupts the firmest friendships. A proposal was made, which had three main points: to seek a way of concord in religion itself, to seek a way of reconciling the princes, states, and orders of the empire, and to make a contribution against the Mohammedans. But the first two were for the sake of ornamenting the last, so that they would not deal with money with unwashed hands. Now they will proceed with the negotiations, but with all the princes absent; for even the Bavarian has returned home. Meanwhile, another meeting... for they have gathered for the wedding of the Duke of Mecklenburg with the daughter of the Duke of Prussia, all the princes of Saxony, the King of Denmark himself, envoys of the maritime cities, and others, and there are already five thousand horsemen, from which a very serious embassy is destined for the Emperor; the bean is being ground against the Duke of Brunswick and those who would support him; they say Albert is there and is stirring everything up. When I say Albert, I mean a thunderbolt against my priests, in short, wars, dreadful wars, and if only I could also add the following verse: and I see the Tiber foaming with much blood, but with this gloss: with the blood of priests or Epicureans. Who knows, perhaps the time has come? Let, let the army grow strong and enjoy prosperous fortune for a while, then God will suggest plans.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the pope, having recovered Britain through violence and impostures, sends Cardinal Morone, Pole's ape, as a legate to the assembly, to urge reconciliation with Germany; indeed, the most holy antichrist hopes that he may now rightly imitate England. Prayers have been instituted among those idolaters, in which they ask that their god may now grant that light to the Germans, which he granted to the English. O sycophants, indeed demons.</p>
      <p>What if the legate, who comes with such nefarious mandates, is forced to flee, leaving behind his hat...</p>
      <p>Let the Saxons understand the matter. Ferdinand, whom does he love more? Certainly no one. You ask: whom? I say, me. He had already complained that I had infected the nearest regions of my homeland with Lutheran, indeed Zwinglian (thus about me) poison. But behold, Satan brought to him how he might inflame his mind more, three of my manuscripts, which had fallen from a brother on the road; in one I treated Pole with dignity, in another Pope Gregory the First, in the third I advised the brother to bring to me from that part of Istria, which is subject to Ferdinand, two experts in the Slavic language. How do you think he was moved, what complaints he uttered about me, how bitterly he threatened. My prince had already left from there, otherwise he would have remonstrated with him; but he will not lack with the envoys. But see the singular benefit of God towards us; for the supreme king, and indeed very angry, can do nothing against me, a little man, who is two days' journey away from him, and I am daily in the sight of all, lest you think I am anxiously hiding in some woods or darkness. But the Lord will carry our cause and his glory further.</p>
      <p>Concerning the English, certainly know that it was not as you suspect, that those who dwell with you were overlooked because they are with you; indeed, I had obtained for them; but it pleased the Lord to move the hearts of those who distributed, in this way. Who knows if the others perhaps were more in need? Certainly, when I was in Strasbourg, I expressly told the magistrate and the other English that it was the prince's intention that those who were in Zurich should be taken into account. I suspect the magistrate wanted to favor those who live with them. The prince does not have, does not have bitter zeal against you as against no one, indeed his mind abhors persecuting, I say with the sword, even the Schwenkfeldians, Anabaptists, Servetians (not that he wants to favor them in the least, but in religious disputes he thinks it should be conducted with utmost charity and gentleness, and severity should be put aside). You wrote that you are preparing a writing or apology on the matter of the supper. But I wish it would not be exacerbated, indeed I do not praise Calvin for having written two letters, one of which I saw, the other to a pastor in Nürtingen in the duchy, the other to a Saxon, in which he attacked those who think against him with very harsh words. It promotes nothing and irritates much. In my judgment, no more suitable remedy can be applied to this great evil than to send away contentions and pray to the Lord. Hear in one word the state of this cause. Antiochus with his continually urges that the Zwinglians not be tolerated; some prudent men of this age, to please him, say they would otherwise be condemned, not of their own accord. Therefore, since these who depend on man will not suffer themselves to be admonished by your or others' writings, indeed in favor of Antiochus himself they will show greater indignation, I would indeed suggest silence, to endure while Antiochus is with us; then indeed all will be more tranquil.</p>
      <p>Greet Zwingli, Lavater, Josias, and the rest, the sons and other brothers in Christ. Pray for me, who love and esteem you also. If you send any letters to Schaffhausen, advise our Roger to often inquire from Doctor Poier if he has a message for me. When the cold has subsided, that is around Easter, I hope to finally come to you; in the meantime, it is not permitted to leave the duchy. Farewell, Bullinger, and love me as you do. Your pontifical causes great laughter everywhere; it has never been seen here more; I will return it in good faith. In Göppingen (for I am staying here because of the plague in Tübingen, to be closer to the king, who holds me in delight). February 20, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your brother Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Indeed, my king says he thinks I was a Lutheran, even when I was performing legations, but cleverly dissimulated, so that in the meantime I might learn what is happening in the papacy and in the courts of kings, and later flee to you and expose them. O ingenious majesty. Laelius will show you the letter; I beg you, add, change, correct in your way; I think you will judge it worthy to be published for the glory of the popes, their servants and maidservants, that is, kings and queens.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, honorable brother.</p>
