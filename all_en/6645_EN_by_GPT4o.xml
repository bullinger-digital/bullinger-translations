      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, this evening, which is the 12th of this month, I received two of your letters, and since I have to preach tomorrow, I hope you will forgive me if I am brief.</p>
      <p>For at the very moment your letters were delivered to me, the interpreter of the lord ambassador announced that he is thinking of going to Zurich and further, indeed tomorrow very early. I am sending the note of the interpreter, which he sent a few days ago. If it suits you, you should pretend not to know; for as you see, what he writes about Orbaisio, he wants to be kept secret. Meanwhile, we have nothing certain from Rome. Regarding the Cardinal of Emden, some consistently affirm that he has been removed from the scene and that Borrhomaeus would have suffered the same penalty, had he not been at the Florentine wedding in the meantime; others still doubt whether he has been killed. Whatever it is, much of their strength has been broken by this sudden death of the pope, and many pestilent practices have been buried with the pope. There have been other writings from Cum, saying the cardinal should have been killed in a place called Capella in Rome. You are expecting what has followed the pope's death; when I hear something certain, I will inform you. - As for us, it is thus: it is considered that now Paul's lord Batt, along with his followers, will appear strong and magnificent. Good care will also be taken that no disgrace happens to the city. The Palestinians cannot easily start anything by force; they are too weak for the God's house, and they will not quickly overrun from behind the mountains. For even if 6000 or 7000 of them came (they cannot do more), I think they would regret it. But this city of Chur might be pressured in a market under the pretense of a disturbance being made, to separate. But I and others would not laugh at them. For I am especially targeted; they rage against me because I am said to have most powerfully broken the plans of the Beatiners, which were certainly pernicious to both the republic and the church. Therefore, I advise our people to be vigilant. They will, as I think, come and call upon the League. If they cannot, I fear a foolish deed; but I can hardly believe that the God's house would allow this, namely after the departure of the lord Batt. This is what some Beatiners are contemplating. But however the matter falls, it would be introduced in such a way that it would cause much less harm than if the priests' counsel had initially gone their way. And they say here, what I know well: if not some of those who want to be evangelical had resisted the lord Batt with force to prevent this bishopric, it would have already happened, and we would have escaped the curse. But I have learned what men are. Now I understand Psalm 55: "Hear my prayer, O God; for the terrors of death have surrounded me;" I often repeat Psalm 62: "Truly my soul waits upon God." From the letters of Bäldi (who not obscurely leans towards the Beatiners because of the relationship with the Hessians) I have sufficiently understood what foul lies my adversaries spread about me; things I never thought of, they assert I said in a sermon. Although I have written to Bäldi once or twice about the state of our affairs and what is being done for the business of religion and the fatherland, yet he believes the enemies of truth rather than me. As soon as the people of Glarus forget in what fears they stood and who brought them therein, they will see that those who are causing this here are the same. Who in all Rhaetia has labored more for the Glarus people than I alone? For these my services, I cannot receive such gratitude from evangelical men that they would believe the truth rather than the most foul lies. I am glad that they go about with such baselessness and that there is no truth in them: they dare not say it publicly, now behind the scenes. Now it is an easier matter for a right-minded person; who would not rather believe an honorable council of this city of Chur, yes, the small and great councils, than a few lying slanderers? You know what the adversaries have attempted, what response they have received from the senate. I have been answered more by the council than I wanted to write to you at that time, namely among other things, that I should not let myself be deterred; a city would put life and limb for me. So I have warned them as a true servant, to be on guard against disaster, and in that alone the truth is spoken, etc. Those others have been punished, as you know. These things with you. I look to no mortal, I rest in one God, and by sitting and being silent, with God's help, I will conquer and triumph over my enemies. But I do not say what I have felt with myself: I am a man. - The old man who died here so suddenly is said to have been called Lorentz Rosenboum, his son Cunradt; they are the ones you wanted to know about. I have nothing new about mine. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Chur, at night, very hastily. Forgive me. May God preserve you and yours in His grace! Chur, January 12, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, lord Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. To Mr. Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
