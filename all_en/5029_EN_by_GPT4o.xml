<letter xml:id="file5029"><body><div><p>You have received that the five adversarial interlocutors among the cardinals and bishops are not only suspected but indeed considered heretics, because in the matter of the sacrament they seemed to agree with us somewhat. Therefore, they did not want them to converse with us any longer.</p><p>For this reason, the colloquium has been suspended for fifteen days now, and I greatly fear that it may be entirely broken off. - - - - - - However, it happened not without the admirable artifice of divine providence that the bishops themselves, who had their assembly at Poissy, disagreed among themselves on the tenth of this month, so much so that they almost came to blows.</p><p>Now indeed they are wholly engaged in drafting canons, some of which I have seen, and they are so crude and coarse that from them you can easily recognize that the pope's minions want no reformation of the church. They retain the mass, sacramental confession, acknowledge the authority of the pope, want to have images, and approve pilgrimages. Today they are to return to the court, where without a doubt they will bring not ordinary monstrosities.</p><p>If the hope of the colloquium is cut off this week, I will request a mission at the beginning of the next. Meanwhile, from the time the colloquium was announced until this day, it cannot be said how much the number of the faithful of the church has increased. But not without disturbances.</p><p>For on the 12th of this month, our people left Paris to hear a sermon in the field, since they do not have a temple in the city. They were eight thousand in number.</p><p>When the papists learned of this, they shut them out of the city walls as they were returning, but in vain, because they entered the city by force: and when a fight was initiated on both sides by our adversaries attacking, many were wounded and some killed on both sides. Nor is it otherwise in other parts of the kingdom.</p><p>Therefore, it is thought that necessity will compel the queen, the nobles, and the counselors to grant our people the ability to meet publicly and to provide some temples. Today we are in great fear, because in various regions of France the faithful have occupied temples without waiting for royal permission. This, however, has greatly displeased the queen and the nobles.</p><p>The cardinals and bishops demand that they be restored.</p><p>While I write this, the princes are already in council to decide on this matter. But because there are also some cardinals and bishops among the counselors, our people have presented a supplication to the queen, praying that it may not be granted against right and justice to allow a vote in this deliberation to those who are sworn enemies to us. However, how much we will obtain, I do not know.</p><p>If by edict the people are ordered to restore the temples, seditions and slaughters are to be feared. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Concerning the Augsburg Confession, I ask you not to be troubled, because the ecclesiastics will not accept it.</p><p>Our churches also will not admit it, because they have decided to follow their own French confession. All our interlocutors do not want it.</p><p>Calvin also strongly dissuades that it be done. Therefore, I see no danger threatening from it.</p><p>Yesterday we changed our lodging.</p><p>For Cardinal Castiglione has returned to the court (for the assembly of prelates has been dissolved) and reclaimed his house in which we were staying. Therefore, by the queen's order, we have been sent to the lodging of the Duchess of Ferrara, which she knows, as she has testified, to that prince not</p></div></body>.</letter>
