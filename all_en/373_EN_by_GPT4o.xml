      <p>S. Having left the city and the crowd of people, I seem to be able to write more freely, although even desirable things are less permissible. I have already sent you two letters some time ago, in which I briefly mentioned my circumstances to you as they were at that time. For I did not know then whether I should stay in Augsburg or elsewhere. But having been informed that I could not bear the power of the Pope there and that I was exposed to both plots and dangers, I immediately decided to yield to necessity. However, in order to do so with less loss of my possessions, I acted with the full knowledge and consent of the council, so much so that, even with their strong urging, I pledged not to bind myself to any service within a short time; in return, they honored me with a distinguished gift. Therefore, I, with my whole household, moved to Kaufbeuren and here I remain in the detestable papacy until the Lord provides more. You can now send letters to me quite safely, namely, first to Lindau to Mr. Hieronymus Papius or Consul Podmaier, who will then easily send them to Isny and from there to Kempten and Kaufbeuren, especially at this time, while you have not yet been afflicted by Jupiter's thunderbolt. But after the Bernese have persisted in restoring the dominions of Savoy and you have assisted them with troops, alas, how difficult it will be for us to maintain correspondence.</p>
      <p>The calendar of this year has been published among you, which shows that you are well and sufficiently warned. But what will such widely scattered minds do? What will so many diseased members do in the body? You have seen the power of the Emperor and the yoke of all Germany except the Swiss. The Pope is afraid, the Frenchman trembles, it will be yours to weigh the matter well before you either resist or commit anything to Mars. I want these things to be said as you once heard me in person; for my mind has never changed, nor do I wish anyone to be turned away from a healthy purpose, much less for the reasoning of counsel to be entangled. Nothing new is heard here except the arrival of the Prince of Spain in Italy. He hastens to make his journey to Germany, where, according to the opinion of some, he will be inaugurated into the empire before the Emperor himself departs, who is almost perpetually in poor health.</p>
      <p>The religion called the Interim is sailing with full wind in Augsburg, Nuremberg, and Ulm; masses are held not only in individual churches but also at St. Anne's, where the preaching of the gospel had been established. The people are pliable and patient, enduring all these things, even the sale and removal of houses and the tributes of money, interpreting everything well. However, I prefer to be a spectator here than an actor there, etc. The Saxons and Meisseners have not yet accepted the Interim; the people of Bremen, as rumor has it, have also been struck by the Emperor's anathema.</p>
      <p>King Ferdinand is urging the Hungarians to expel all Lutherans and Anabaptists from their territories. They have responded that they will not tolerate any impiety, to which the king is said to demand a clearer understanding of their response. There is a rumor that the people of the Five Towns, if it comes to arms, will join their forces with the Pope until the rest of their confederates come to their senses and reconcile themselves with the Roman Church; it is certainly too hard to hear; write back what you think about this. May the Lord our God, the Father of mercies, have mercy on us and not allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear, and preserve you, dearest brothers, from all affliction. Amen.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to Gwalter, Pellican, Bibliander, Gesner, Gwalfius, and all good men, especially the lords consuls and the chief scribe.</p>
      <p>December 18, 1548. Kaufbeuren. Yours sincerely, Georg Laetus.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned and pious lord Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the Christian Church in Zurich, my dearly beloved lord and brother, to be delivered.</p>
