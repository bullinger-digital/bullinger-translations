    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Although the [Zurich city] messenger [Andreas Müller] was already dispatched early this morning with a letter to Bullinger [No. 2980], the current [Konstanz] messenger [...], who must go to Winterthur, is now delivering a document [about the revival of the Swabian League]. Bullinger may have it copied, but he should return it to the messenger, as it does not belong to Blarer. The messenger has been instructed to allow Bullinger time for a copy. This document contains important information. For example, it lists the territories with which Emperor Charles V plans to enter into an alliance. It is also notable that it speaks of "disobedient" ones, but they are never named. Blarer is pleased to be able to render this service to Bullinger, especially since he has repeatedly requested information about this league.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] If Bullinger has already read the document [with Konrad Zwick's answers to the questions posed to him by Blarer] delivered in the morning by the Zurich city messenger, he should send it with the Konstanz messenger. Otherwise, he should ensure it is sent at the next opportunity. Bullinger should read the document thoroughly because Blarer is very keen for Bullinger to learn exactly how negotiations have been conducted so far and to ascertain that Konrad Zwick is not to be blamed for anything.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] From Augsburg, it is heard that the Emperor desires the cathedral for himself and future attendees of the Imperial Diet and has asked the Augsburg council to arrange the interior of the church as it was before. At the same time, he assured that no one would be prevented from practicing their religion, and the churches do not have to be returned to the bishop [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] or anyone else. What a ruse!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Two o'clock in the afternoon, in great haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [Enclosure:] The Elector of Saxony arrived in Augsburg on July 24th [correct: 26th], the day after the Emperor's entry, in a carriage guarded by 400 Spanish shooters, evoking pity from many people, while he himself endured the triumphal procession with a cheerful face.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Landgrave Philip of Hesse is being held captive in Donauwörth and is not being treated very well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Many consider it certain that the Catholics will claim the cathedral for their idolatry. The other churches are to remain with the [Protestants] until a reform of religion and a church order is decreed, to which all must commit, while those who refuse will either be outlawed or killed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The Emperor has dismissed the German infantry and cavalry soldiers except for one troop (those of [Nicolò] Madruzzo). If the rumor is true, this one will also be sent elsewhere shortly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The garrison stationed in the city has been dismissed. Apart from the Spaniards, of whom it is said there are fewer than 4000, the Emperor has no other troops. They are causing havoc in Donauwörth and the surrounding area, have devastated Rain am Lech, killed the people there, and robbed everything. They are lightly armed, and a train of over 5000 people follows them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Whether the Imperial Diet will be held in Augsburg is uncertain.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] So much for Frölich. Bullinger will have seen his daring judgment [about Hans Schöner].</p>

      <p>Friendly, dear sir and brother, although I have already written to you today by your messenger, I could not refrain from sending you these writings that have been given to me to read, since this messenger must go to Winterthur anyway. You may read them. However, you should return them to me without delay, as they do not belong to me. If you wish to have something copied from them, you may do so. I have instructed the messenger to wait until you are finished. I find all sorts of things in them, which is why I did not consider it useless to send them to you, especially since it is mentioned with which lands the Emperor intends to enter into the new alliance; also, because among other things, the disobedient ones are mentioned, and no one knows whom he means by that. Therefore, consider it a favor. It happens in the best way, as you have often asked me for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>If you have read the writings that I sent you today by your messenger, then please return them to me with this one. If you have not yet read them, then let them come to me next time and read them diligently, so that you are accurately informed about how things have been handled, and my cousin is excused by you - for that is my sole concern.</p>

      <p>Item from a letter from Augsburg: The Imperial Majesty has requested the church of Our Lady from the honorable council to be cleared and restored to its old state for himself and those who are to come to the Imperial Diet, while also assuring that no one will be driven from their religion, nor should it be understood that the church is to be handed over to the bishop or anyone else. What a ruse!</p>

      <p>Given in haste, on the 8th of August at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>

      <p>The Elector of Saxony arrived here the day after the Emperor entered the city (that is, July 24th), escorted by 400 Spanish guards, in a carriage, with the pity of many good people, although he himself allowed himself to be led in triumph with a cheerful face.</p>

      <p>Many are certain that the Catholics will soon occupy the Marian church here with their idolatry. The remaining churches will stay with us until a reformation of religion or a ceremonial formula is prescribed and ordered, to which all must swear, and those who refuse will either be outlawed or killed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Emperor has dismissed all German troops, both cavalry and infantry, except for a single troop under the command of Madruzzo; if the rumor is true, even they will be sent away shortly.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The soldiers who were stationed here for guard duty have been dismissed. Apart from the Spaniards, of whom it is said there are no more than 4000, the Emperor has no other troops. They are in Donauwörth and the surrounding areas, devastating everything. Rain am Lech has been completely devastated by them, the people miserably slaughtered, and everything else taken by robbery. These Spaniards have light armor and a train of over 5000 people with them.</p>

      <p>Whether the Imperial Diet will be held here, I do not know at all.</p>

      <p>I have described these things from the letters of Frölich. You see the diction, what it is like. And you already know what he allows himself.</p>
