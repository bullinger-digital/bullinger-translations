      <p>S. D. Certainly, for many reasons, venerable father, your letters have been most pleasing to me; for while nothing can be sent from you that does not delight me greatly, at this time your letters were full of sweetness, as in the midst of the storms of business my memory with you is not obliterated, not to mention the pleasantness of the matters contained therein. Although indeed the times are turbulent and dangerous, yet the Lord God, in His abundant and inexhaustible goodness, interposes many things to cheer and console the pious amidst the sorrows.</p>
      <p>With great pleasure and joy, I received the light of truth shining through France, England, Scotland, and other places, and since the beginnings are very serious and dangerous, as the harvest is still in the grass, we will earnestly pray to the Lord, whose is the husbandry, that He Himself may give the increase and deign to bring to a happy completion that which He has begun. That our neighboring allies of the Five Cantons oppose with all their might the doctrine of truth along with other enemies of the truth is not new; they hold to the old ways, and because their works are evil, they flee from and hate the light.</p>
      <p>The Lord will also put an end to this. The business of our most distinguished council is of singular prudence; they do not wish to fail in promoting the evangelical business of Mr. Peter Martyr, yet they recognize it as unworthy to expose their own to dangers. The wonderful goodness of God is set forth to be seen.</p>
      <p>As much as the doctrine of truth is despised among us, so much more do others embrace it with desire. Would that our life could be amended, I would by no means doubt the grace of the Lord; repentance and the hearts of the pious must be diligently urged to prayer. I give you immense thanks for your usual kindness towards me.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deign to keep you and all yours safe for us and His church for a long time. I return both papers, as I understood you wished.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet all of you.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continue to love me as you have until now; for I do not wish to burden you with more at this time.</p>
      <p>Stein am Rhein, August 11, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, his esteemed relative as to a venerable father.</p>
