      <p>Greetings. I have written to you with my own hand and in good faith what I received three days ago from Augsburg, from which you, with your wisdom, will easily infer what the good and God-fearing, and those devoted to the Gospel of Christ, should hope for from these assemblies. But since not what they attempt, but what will seem right to our heavenly Father will happen to us, we will fear no one outside of Him, with whom on our side, even the angriest world with its prince will not advance against us in the slightest, and we will both despise and conquer it with unbroken and exalted spirits, surely with the Lord wonderfully exercising His power in our weakness.</p>
      <p>My brother, the German, praises your kindness towards him as always, now also in the highest terms. He claims to have seen a certain letter from Philipp recently given to you, of which I ask you greatly, if it is not too much trouble, to send me a copy. Commend me and my household diligently to Christ the Savior and love us as you have consistently for many years. Although I do not write as much as in previous years, because the necessity that was there then is not present, I do not diminish my zeal and love for you in the slightest. Greetings to all the brothers and friends. 1550, August 5.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, a friend like an incomparable brother.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>Imperial Diet at Augsburg 1550.</p>
