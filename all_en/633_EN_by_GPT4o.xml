      <p>S. D. A meeting is announced through this Baden for the upcoming 3rd of September. Today, indeed, the people of Schwyz write to us that some outlaws have killed the president of Mendrisio, who was a Schwyz citizen named Mertz, along with the president Oswald Wydler, a scribe, and two assistants, two bailiffs. They do not write the reason, nor what kind of murderers they were or what became of them. Our people urge that they investigate everything diligently, act prudently and promptly, so that nothing is done rashly. These, indeed, seem to be omens of troubles.</p>
      <p>I could add many other things to these if I had the time. Therefore, let us encourage the people to repentance and prayers, to steadfastness and patience. Ask if Gastius, Laelius, and Caelius want to write to me; for this messenger would safely deliver everything to me; he is indeed a good man.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 17th of August, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed lord and brother, Oswald Myconius. Basel.</p>
