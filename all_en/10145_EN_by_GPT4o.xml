      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You demand long letters from me. I would have provided longer ones if leisure had allowed it, but this messenger, who was sent by the council, set out on his journey as quickly as possible. It was not permissible to delay him. Since I was involved in both the morning sermon and the consistory, I could not fulfill what my spirit greatly desired.</p>
      <p>Everything you responded to Bucer pleases me, as well as what you wrote to the magistrate about the Turkish expedition.</p>
      <p>Megander spoke with us in the same vein during the sermon. Above all, I am pleased with what you compile on the Hebrews. Continue and act so that I may have daily what is printed. Until now, I have never dared to present that epistle to the people from the pulpit, but now, since you make everything so clear and provide such a great opportunity for reflection, I will attempt it next week.</p>
      <p>Moreover, what you promised, namely that you would be my guest in Bern, fulfill this promptly so that we may console each other in turn.</p>
      <p>What we discussed with the Anabaptists in Zofingen over 9 days is now being organized for printing; I am now writing again to Christoph: 1. we discussed the state of the debate, faith, and charity, 2. the mission of the Anabaptists, 3. the church, 4. excommunication and its execution, whether by the church or delegates in the name of the church, whether this word should always stand: "Let him be to you as a Gentile" etc. [Mt 18:17], or if it can be changed to another penalty etc., 5. the magistrate, 6. the oath, 7. taxes, 8. our mission and sustenance, 9. infant baptism. Megander and Sebastian Oeconomus were the actors of the tragedy, from the Anabaptists Linggius, a learned, cunning, eloquent man and a remarkable hypocrite, most apt to deceive, another Johannes Hotz from Gr√ºningen office, Hottinger from Zollikon, in total 23 of them. You will see everything in the records. Once Christoph has undertaken to print them, I entrust them to your and Leo's revision. I could not return what you sent. I will transcribe it through a scribe.</p>
      <p>Farewell and continually send on the Hebrews. I would have written to Pellican, but the messenger is waiting.</p>
      <p>I don't think I will have time to write. Farewell.</p>
      <p>25th of July.</p>
      <p>Yours, Haller.</p>
      <p>May all fellow students be well.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his dearest brother by far.</p>
