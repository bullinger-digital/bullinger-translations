      <p>Greetings. Because there are many, most illustrious man, who eagerly desire and demand that whatever letters can be found, which Mr. Calvin, a man of blessed memory, wrote to friends, be brought to light, whose effort I see is necessary in accomplishing this task, now, as I have also done before, I ask of you, indeed I earnestly beg and beseech you, to diligently collect whatever letters you have ever received from him and send them to me compiled, so that if you wish your copies to be returned to you before they are committed to print, they can be transcribed.</p>
      <p>For it cannot be done so quickly; for copies must be sought from many and indeed from those far away. Recently, thirteen of his letters were sent to me from Paris by a friend, who exceedingly desires and demands this edition. I already have many collected with me.</p>
      <p>Mr. Beza also has many, which he received by Mr. Calvin's command; for shortly before his death, he ordered that whatever was written by hand at home be handed over to Mr. Beza; he has also told me several times that he intends to arrange them in order and wishes to use my assistance, which can be nothing more pleasing to me, and I hope, with God's favor, to undertake this shortly.</p>
      <p>I know, most excellent man, how much benefit will return to all the pious from this labor. Therefore, I would like you to indicate with the first messenger what you think of this our plan; if it is approved, do, if you please, send to me as quickly as possible whatever of his writings you have that are not yet published, and write what you wish to be done.</p>
      <p>These are the things I thought should be written to you now, so that you may understand what I desire and have decided. It will be most gratifying if you respond to me at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p>I write nothing about the state of French affairs, because I do not doubt that Mr. Beza diligently writes everything; therefore, lest I do what has already been done, accept this one thing, that that kingdom is so disturbed that more serious tumults are to be feared than before.</p>
      <p>For what do the enemies of the gospel not attempt? You are not unaware that horrible massacres have recently been carried out in many cities, nor is there any doubt that their madness would have raged through the remaining cities and towns, had not the Lord, in His mercy, restrained their wicked attempts.</p>
      <p>We must continually pray that, having mercy on His church, He may restrain and curb all the wicked. Farewell, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe, guide you with His spirit, and bless your labors. Brother Budaeus and the remaining friends respectfully greet you.</p>
      <p>Geneva, August 26, 1565.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, always most observant of you.</p>
      <p>I had omitted, but I also earnestly request from you, most excellent man, that if it can be done in any way, you obtain from the friends of Philipp Melanchthon copies of the letters which Mr. Calvin ever wrote to him, and indeed there are many, as I know. I am confident that you will easily obtain this by the authority and favor you possess with the acquaintances of that man while he lived, or his heirs.</p>
      <p>I would also like you to perform and obtain the same from the friends or heirs of Mr. Blorer, the minister among the Bremen people; for I certainly know that Mr. Calvin was accustomed to write to him often and indeed about very serious matters. Therefore, most courteous man, may you deign to confer such a benefit upon us and not hesitate to take the effort to recover those letters, and if you understand that they are with some others, please ensure we have them, and in this regard, I, along with all the pious, will be most indebted to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>If Mr. Gwalther, Wolff, Frisius have any letters of Mr. Calvin left by their father and other friends in Zurich, I ask you to remind them to add them to yours. I would commend those young men to you, unless I were certain that they are most commendable.</p>
      <p>Their grandmother, departing from here to France, asked me to commend them to you when I wrote. However, if they write to their father and grandmother, it will be well; I will take care to deliver their letters.</p>
      <p>It also now comes to mind Mr. Sulcer, the pastor of Basel, to whom Mr. Calvin often wrote; he, I think, will not deny you copies of the letters.</p>
      <p>You see, most distinguished man, how much I dare; but you are not unaware of my purpose and spirit.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, most respectfully.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
