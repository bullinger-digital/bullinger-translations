      <p>S. D. I send you, dear brother, the letters and theses and give the greatest thanks for your diligence; I have nothing worth mentioning at the moment. The Swiss Diet has just now begun.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Claronensian case, they do not entirely agree. Froschauer has returned from Frankfurt; the elder is dead.</p>
      <p>He brought with him that vast book of Brenz, in which he surpasses himself in bitterness; he sings the same song and interprets it very badly, because we call ourselves brothers and in turn ask to be recognized as brothers by them.</p>
      <p>He rages; but in this way, many will recognize him more correctly. When I have more leisure and strength, I will write more extensively. Farewell with all yours and our brothers. April 14, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, my kind lord and beloved brother. Winterthur.</p>
