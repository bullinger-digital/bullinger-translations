    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius should excuse Bullinger's late response to letter [No. 2278]; at the right time, no messenger was available. This is mentioned upfront, before Myconius suspects otherwise. - The Schwenckfeld matter should be left to God, and conversations with Schwenckfeld should be avoided. Although he feigns piety and moderation, he only wants to infect others with his scabies. Myconius wanted to convey the concerns [of the Schwenckfelders] to [the people of Zurich] kindly and without ill intent, and a dispute almost broke out! One must beware of further dealings with [Schwenckfeld]. - Thanks be to God for the victory [of Landgrave Philip of] Hesse; may [Philip] now proceed in the right way against Agag and Ben-Hadad, so as not to incur God's wrath. However, Bullinger fears that this is only the beginning of a much worse war. The Spaniard [Charles V], incited by the powerful, is known for his cruelty and pride. He offers the religious discussion [as a diversion]. - Bullinger thanks Myconius for his news. If he has any updates about [Philip of] Hesse, the [negotiations between] England and France, and about the [Schmalkaldic League] in Frankfurt, he should share them. Bullinger has already read the letter from Elector [Johann Friedrich I of] Saxony and [Philip of] Hesse requesting Bucer to be sent to the Regensburg [religious discussion]. Myconius should not send the letter. - The Zurich envoy [...] has returned from Milan. Bullinger has not yet seen him, but heard that the [Swiss envoys] were only granted an audience after nine days, during which [the Marchese Alfonso d'Avalos] curtly and arrogantly said he would respond with nothing other than what was stated in the letter addressed to the Swiss. As soon as Bullinger knows more, he will report it. [The Marchese] certainly intends only harm. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I am responding to your letters, esteemed sir, later and more slowly because, when I have time to write, I lack messengers, and when I do not have time, they present themselves unsolicited.</p>
      <p>I mention this right from the start so that you do not suspect any other reason. Let us entrust the Schwenckfeld matter to God's judgment. Let us avoid conversations with this virulent man. He pretends to have remarkable piety, modesty, and fairness, but he stings and bites subtly, and he does not wish to listen to learn, but to spread his scabies to others. We have seen how unfortunately all his affairs turn out: You, without ill intent, transcribed to us what you had received from others, and soon that mention of Schwenckfeld would have caused some discord among us if charity had not intervened. Now everything has been removed from the midst, and things are in order. Let us be careful now that you do not have any dealings with this unfortunate man!</p>
      <p>We give thanks to the most good and great God, who granted our Hesse a celebrated victory. May He grant the noble prince to use the victory rightly and well and to deal with Agag and Ben-Hadad in such a way that he does not incur divine wrath. I suspect and fear that these are the beginnings of a great war and the greatest conflagration. It is known that the Spanish temperament is cruel, ambitious, proud, and impious, and many magnates fan the flames so that it burns more fiercely. The discussion he offers, he offers according to his Spanish nature: This will be revealed by the outcome unless the Lord prevents it.</p>
      <p>For the things you diligently recorded in your letters, I give great thanks. If you have anything further about the army and plans of Hesse, the English or French war, or about the Frankfurt assembly and similar things worth knowing, I ask you to share them. I have read the letters from the Elector of Saxony and Hesse to the people of Strasbourg, asking them to send Bucer to Regensburg for the discussion. I advise you not to send that letter if you have it and were planning to send it.</p>
      <p>Our envoy has returned from Milan, whom I have not yet greeted. However, I hear from others that the marquis did not admit them to the discussion until after the ninth day, and when they presented their mandates, he responded curtly and arrogantly that the report of the envoys was imperious and that he did not wish to give any response other than what was included in the sealed letter addressed to all the Swiss orders. Thus, I hear. When I have more certain information, I will write. I have no doubt that the Spaniard seeks opportunities to harm and subjugate. May the Lord destroy the most impious and cruel scoundrel.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 27, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Basel, his most esteemed and dear brother in the Lord. Basel.</p>
