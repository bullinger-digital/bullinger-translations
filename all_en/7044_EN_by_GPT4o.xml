      <p>Greetings. I read your letter written on February 2nd with great pleasure; however, it was surprising that you did not receive the three letters I wrote since the beginning of September. This consoles me that our friendship does not depend on the exchange of letters, as it has taken such deep roots that nothing can shake it. We had already understood that the Spanish tactics of Maximilian were not proceeding as he hoped, nor were they enjoying success, as the besiegers were receiving more trouble from the besieged, and there are those who will free them from the siege, and even more who will bring aid to the Belgians in liberating them.</p>
      <p>In Antwerp, the house of the Franciscans was burned, and several prostitutes were found. The Lord will turn all tumults to the glory of His name, even if, when the wicked are punished, the righteous are often also involved. We must look to the providence of the Lord, who invites all to repentance through such great calamities, and we must see and almost feel that sins disturb the entire nature of things, overthrow cities, and destroy everyone. In some places, the plague is beginning to rage in nearby villages.</p>
      <p>You have heard that the King of Scotland was miserably killed by placing several vessels filled with gunpowder under his chamber, by the force of which his body was thrown a hundred paces. I wrote that I received and devoured with great pleasure your homilies on Daniel; when others on Isaiah are published, they will be found here.</p>
      <p>My wife and children send their greetings to you. Please convey my greetings to the most honorable council and all friends. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Paris, March 5, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
