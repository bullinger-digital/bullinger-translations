    <p xml:id="regest1">Johannes Comander from Chur writes that many mercenaries roaming around Tyrol have been recruited and are allegedly being used for an incursion into Valtellina; the interrogation of a spy captured in Valtellina could uncover evil plans, as Gian Giacomo de' Medici was in Innsbruck and is currently staying at Hohenems Castle. Has previously sent warnings to Peter Im Haag. Urges steadfastness and fear of God. When the situation becomes somewhat clearer, Bullinger and Haller will address the discussed matter.</p>

      <p>Today I received a letter from the preacher of Chur, written on Monday, March 15. The letter reads word for word as follows: "A significant number of mercenaries have come into the County of Tyrol, reaching the borders of our land. They have been loitering there for a while and have been troubling poor people. Recently, they were mustered, and eight thousand are to be paid for a month. It is rumored that another twenty thousand will soon follow. While there was much curiosity about which way they intended to move into Italy, suddenly the news came that they intended to fall into Valtellina. Therefore, our people are making efforts to prevent this from happening. On Sunday, March 14, letters arrived for the council in Chur, stating that a spy had been captured in Valtellina. He will now be interrogated, and the plot will be pursued. For certain, there is great treachery at hand. Gian Giacomo de' Medici, the murderer, was in Innsbruck. Now he is at Hohenems near Feldkirch. The emperor will not come this year. But a bond has been placed over us, the Three Leagues, the Bernese, the WÃ¼rttembergers, and all those who are in the truth. May God graciously protect us. Whatever further I learn from the traitor who has been captured, I will write to you immediately. For the villain is from our land, where the scoundrel, the Medici, has many spies. I fear these are the old plans that were undertaken during the life of our Zwingli but were not brought to the desired end, etc."</p>
      <p>This is the content of the letter from Chur. I did not want to withhold it from you for your benefit, as I have also sent some warning to my lord Peter Im Haag beforehand. You may send it to him or keep it, as you see fit.</p>
      <p>Always be manly, brave, humble, and God-fearing. God will not abandon us for the sake of His holy name and His honor.</p>
      <p>When we see more clearly where things are heading, we will also look after our last discussed matter. The situation will arrange itself accordingly.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, March 19, 1535.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours entirely.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, pious, and wise Sulpitius Haller, bailiff of Lenzburg, his kind and dear lord.</p>
