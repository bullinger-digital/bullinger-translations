      <p>S. D. The arrival of the schoolmaster Ammiani to us would have been most welcome, if only we had had enough leisure to treat him as he deserved. However, it is especially pleasing that you have deigned to send a response from the people of Basel to the people of Geneva. You compel us by this means to send our response to you (which you requested in previous letters). It did not seem of such importance that we should have sent it to you; otherwise, I would have sent it long ago. However, it is as follows:</p>
      <p>S. Although we have no doubt about the pious diligence and singular diligence of our dearest brother John Calvin and his other collaborators, who, by their exquisite and diligent care and vigilance, which they have hitherto provided in the church of Christ, could have seemed to have done enough for us, furthermore, the overseers of the church of Zurich, our brothers to be observed in the Lord, for their exact judgment, with which they are endowed above the other ministers of the church of Christ, have written their opinion to you most diligently, which they also wanted us to see, we could have been content to remain silent. However, since it seemed good to your eminence to hear our opinion on this matter as well, as much as the brevity of time allowed, we have reviewed the debates of Servetus which he had with the ministers of your church, as well as his books filled with blasphemies against the most holy Trinity and the entire church of Christ, by which he attempts to renew heresies long since suppressed along with the heretics and to spew them out and impose them on the church of Christ to the great scandal of the simple, and we cannot judge otherwise, by the gift bestowed on us by God, than that they are different from sound doctrine and not to be tolerated, either to be proposed or read in the assembly of the pious, nor do we doubt that you, by your remarkable prudence, will suppress his attempts, lest his blasphemies spread like a cancer and consume the members of Christ. For to overturn his ravings with long arguments would be nothing other than to rave with a madman. Therefore, we all subscribe to the judgment of the ministers of the church of Zurich, our dearest brothers in Christ, commending in the meantime your eminence together with your church to divine grace."</p>
      <p>We have nothing else new from Germany, except that Margrave Albrecht has scraped together and enlisted a new and very strong army, as if from a Trojan horse, with which he has recovered most of what was taken from him by the Nurembergers, driven the Nurembergers into the city, and was not far from capturing all their cannons. They say that Charles, having dismissed the army, will hold a diet at Augsburg, so that, with a feigned peace, he may once again lead the orders of the empire by the nose.</p>
      <p>It was not permitted to write more due to business. My fellow ministers greet you. I bid farewell to Mr. Theodor, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalther, and also John Frisius. Farewell. Schaffhausen, November 3, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his brother and lord to be observed.</p>
