      <p>S. I received your letter written on September 1st along with these, which I am sending back to you, and I thank you. I am very sorry that the MÃ¼lhausen magistrate does not guard itself more diligently against this contagion, but rather invites this sore upon itself, which I fear may eventually become a pestilent abscess. But it often happens that some evil arises from a neighboring evil. As for our affairs, restitution has been made to the Duke of Savoy, and the articles of pacification have been read to each community. Hence, the thoughts of many hearts have begun to be revealed; for some have offered the prince all obedience, provided that the freedom of religion agreed upon is maintained for them; others also seem to incline towards the Savoyards regarding religion, and the situation is still uncertain; but I will soon hear from the ministers how the matter of religion is being arranged.</p>
      <p>Many have good hopes; I do not know what to hope for. The Duke himself, after our departure, came to Tonon and Ripaille with 600 horsemen to receive the people into his allegiance. The Swiss envoys, in whose presence, as witnesses, the restitution was made, experienced something that greatly displeased them: They were summoned to the Duke to meet him on a certain day at Gex; therefore, when they hurried there, perhaps hoping for some reward, they were again informed on the way, when they were not far from Gex, that the prince had not yet arrived. Thus, disappointed in their hope and expectation, they took that invitation as an insult and returned with indignation. Some think this will greatly benefit the Genevans in the upcoming action, which is being arranged so that their affairs with the Duke may also be settled. Otherwise, I have nothing of any importance. In France, things are calm. It is written from the camp that 20 banners of the Swiss are divided into two parts, one part led by the consul of Fribourg, Nicolas de Praroman, and the other by Pfyffer of Lucerne, and thus they are stationed in garrisons, they have plenty of provisions, and the payment of wages is prompt, moreover, they know of no enemy. Therefore, some think they will return after the third month; but you perhaps have more certain information about these things.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a booklet by our Aretio, which he compiled from the acts held with Gentile. They have also printed in Geneva a volume of various theologians' writings against the same errors previously published, among which is also a letter by Mr. Simler.</p>
      <p>But since you have already seen all these before, it did not seem necessary for me to send them. I am waiting to see what you now receive from Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you; greet yours also in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 13, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my esteemed lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
