      <p>What charity commands, what necessity compels us to do, reverend and esteemed brothers, this very thing we do, that is, we commend the cause of the wretched exiles to your piety. However, what their calamity is, although it cannot be unknown to you, we can still affirm that the matter itself far surpasses, in breadth and depth, whatever you have heard so far about the impudence, treachery, and brutality of the adversaries.</p>
      <p>Indeed, what may seem utterly incredible, although the fury of the enemies seemed to have reached the highest degree, they nevertheless do not cease to devise much more savage and atrocious things daily than ever before, as you will learn more fully from the speech of Ricald, our dearest brother and fellow minister. Since this is the case, and whatever seems necessary to partly alleviate and partly avert such great miseries of the brothers, they are also coming to you from your most honorable senate to seek some assistance and counsel. Since your authority could greatly aid in obtaining these, we ask you again and again in the Lord, that you do not hesitate to hear them and to embrace them with your singular charity, as it will seem expedient. For in this way, you will certainly do what is pleasing to the most good and great God and will bind countless wretched brothers to you with this one benefit.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend and esteemed brothers. May the Lord Jesus keep you from all evil and bless your holy ministry more and more.</p>
      <p>Geneva, December 1572.</p>
      <p>Theodor Beza, in the name and by the mandate of our entire ecclesiastical college, have signed.</p>
      <p>If any assistance can also be obtained from the brothers of St. Gallen, we earnestly ask you to undertake the cause of procuring this from them.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and esteemed fathers and brothers in the Lord, the pastors and teachers of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
