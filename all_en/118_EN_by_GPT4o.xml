      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard), etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings beforehand. Well-learned, dear, special one, it is appropriate for us to write to you, as the thoughts of Philipp Melanchthon regarding the document titled "Interim" have recently come to us, that we also wish to send you our good and gracious opinion, and it seems to us that in many places people are beginning to become weak, etc.</p>
      <p>As for the situation in Konstanz, we desire that you inform us of what you know about it. We hear that they are still in Augsburg, and it is said that they will certainly be reconciled. We have written to you with gracious intent and did not wish to withhold it. Entrusted to the Almighty hereby.</p>
      <p>Dated in Basel, the 12th of May, in the year 1548. G[eorg], C[ount] of W[ürttemberg], etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, our dear special master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich, to be delivered.</p>
