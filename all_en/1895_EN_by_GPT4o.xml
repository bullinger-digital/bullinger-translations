      <p>You will all, especially you, most holy man, forgive me for not having written to any of you for such a long time. Indeed, nothing has diminished my respect for you and your church, and in all things, we feel the same in the Lord and find great consolation in our mutual agreement with you. But the reasons for my long silence have been some serious disturbances and concerns that the Lord, in His divine will, has sent me, exercising me somewhat, to His glory, and also certain troubles that Satan has stirred up against me and our churches here, and still does not cease to stir up. As for my disturbances, I know you are not unaware that the Lord took from me almost a year ago the companion of my life, my wife, whose memory can never die within me, both because of her piety and virtue and because of the children I had with her, who are constantly before my eyes. How grievous this wound has been to me, according to the flesh, and still is, you can easily imagine, without mentioning the care of the household, which was entirely entrusted to her and has now fallen upon me alone, who am otherwise unaccustomed to it and by nature entirely alien to it since her death. I say nothing of my health, which is so worn out that, even when I seem to be in the best health, I am never truly well and can only devote the morning hours to serious matters without discomfort to my health.</p>
      <p>This was also the reason why, seeing that I could not be equal to the care of the household, I turned my mind to a second marriage; for I could never have sufficed both for the care of the household and my ministry in my current state of health, and even now I can scarcely suffice with new troubles constantly arising, against which I must continually struggle.</p>
      <p>But just as the Lord wished to test me with the death of my first wife, so again, in His kindness, He has alleviated the sorrow of my soul by giving me another wife; for He has given me again a pious and faithful, I hope, companion of life, in whom I can find nothing lacking in duty so far, so that I may now much better attend to my ministry by the grace of God, if only my health does not hinder me.</p>
      <p>It would be too long to recount all the troubles here, but Satan tries everything against us because of the restored, albeit somewhat, use of discipline in our churches; for he feels that his hypocrisy is being deprived of a place among us, which, with the observance of discipline, reveals itself and cannot long endure. For all hypocrites want to appear holy, and they prefer to be praised rather than reproved. And since the use of discipline contains nothing else but reproofs, through which their feigned holiness is attacked and the corruption of our nature is accused, it cannot be otherwise than that hypocrites are gravely offended that their feigned holiness is attacked (by which they otherwise wish to be held in esteem), and they mix everything up and down, if by any means they can render the use of discipline odious to all and defend their hypocrisy against it. And here Satan does not sleep, but employs all his arts to hinder the use of discipline. The cunning of our hypocrites here is remarkable.</p>
      <p>They do not want to appear to act against the use of discipline, but, when they see themselves shamed by the use of discipline, they cry out that they are treated more severely than others, and they wish that all may be marked with the same coal, as they say, and they are entirely devoted to inventing new accusations against as many as possible. If we do not comply with them, they immediately fill everything with clamor and vociferate that we are respecters of persons, even if they cannot prove the accusations they bring forward.</p>
      <p>Thus, there is someone here who is troublesome to us, who, having been removed from the public ministry of the word by the magistrate's order because of a certain scandal, cannot rest until he finds someone to share in his shame. And because he cannot find anything in the life and conduct of all the ministers of both our churches that he can justly reproach (thanks be to God!), he seeks cracks to sow dissension in doctrine and invents many things to render our ministry more odious. He takes occasion to slander our ministry from the controversy over predestination, which he greatly exaggerates.</p>
      <p>And to briefly summarize the whole matter for you, I taught them that they do not rightly discuss predestination, who, through that doctrine, try to diminish and elevate the merit and dignity of Christ's death and priesthood, and that this is mainly done because the power and condemnation of our sin in Adam is not explained diligently enough by most, and therefore we do not agree with those who so press certain passages of Scripture on predestination that they entirely deny that Christ died for all. Hence, that good man seeks all occasions to set us against Master Calvin, who seems to most to have written too harshly on predestination, and he accuses us everywhere, as if we condemned the name and doctrine of Calvin.</p>
      <p>But since he has never heard anything from me, nor has anyone else, that could be twisted to slander Calvin's name, whom I otherwise revere and love as a man of God, he found another, one of our colleagues, whom he began to accuse on many counts, if by any means he could achieve that, just as he was removed from his ministry and compelled to public penance because of his scandal, so he might also compel this one to the same. It is a comfort, indeed, to have companions in punishment. He brought forward three heads of accusation: first, that a certain colleague of ours had said that Adam's sin was not sufficient for the condemnation of the human race; second, that someone could be saved even without any knowledge of Christ the Lord; third, that he had taught differently from Calvin on the doctrine of predestination and had slandered Calvin's name. However, he could not prove these heads of accusation with any testimonies, but he desires that our colleague be compelled by us to public penance and removed from his ministry. But although I do find some things lacking in that very colleague of ours, of which he has been admonished once and again in the assembly of all the elders, I cannot recognize the guilt of those things for which he is accused in him. For he does not acknowledge the first two heads of accusation in any way, and the accuser cannot prove them with any testimonies. As for the third, he acknowledges it in such a way that he admits he disagrees with Calvin, but he does not therefore slander Calvin's name or writings in any way. You have an example of one controversy, most learned man, briefly outlined, of which we do not yet have an end.</p>
      <p>But there is another much more serious one, if we consider the circumstances: One of the ministers of the word in our German church, not Martin Micronius, stirred up a tragedy in the church on three points, and not only without consulting us all, but even deliberately avoiding us in this matter, because he suspected that we would oppose him.</p>
      <p>First, he taught that sponsors (godparents) at the baptism of children should not be admitted in the church, whom we commonly call sponsors; then he publicly condemned in a sermon all churches that did not use public assembly in the use of the Lord's Supper as guilty of idolatry and violation of the Lord's institution, and he pronounced that all who said that genuflection in the Lord's Supper should be tolerated in any way were all surgeons of the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>Finally, he taught that the article in the creed about Christ's descent into hell was a plantation not planted by the Lord and therefore should be uprooted. Admonished about all these things by us and all the elders of both churches, after long tergiversation, he finally acknowledged his fault in the assembly of the elders, not only for having spread these new doctrines among the people, which could not otherwise be impugned by the word of God, but also for having conceived an evil suspicion of us all and not wanting to communicate with us about these things beforehand. But now he regrets having acknowledged this fault of his and complains that he was persuaded to acknowledge his fault by human reasons rather than by the authority of the divine word, although he himself testified with his own hand that he agreed with our doctrine in Christ, according to the word of God and from the heart; for he subscribed with his own hand to our doctrine in these words and himself gave thanks to God our Father through Christ Jesus in the assembly of all the elders not long after, that He had revealed his error to him in this controversy with us through His Holy Spirit. And yet now all these things are nothing to him, and what he previously confessed to have done in Christ, according to the word of God and by the authority of the Holy Spirit, he now says he disapproves by the authority of the Holy Spirit and burdens us all with the suspicion that we teach all these things beyond the word of God and compel others to teach the same with our authority. You have another of our troubles, most esteemed brother in the Lord, through which it was almost the case that both our churches, unless God had miraculously intervened, would have come to extreme danger here. Nor are we entirely out of danger yet, as the minds of many here are; but we trust in the Lord, in whose sight, as far as that matter is concerned, we are well aware. In five days from now, we expect that colleague to present his final mind to us; may the Lord grant that we may see a good outcome to this case! Even among these troubles, others always arise, which completely overwhelm me, but do not affect me so gravely, not to mention the courtly affairs, from which I cannot entirely extricate myself. But why this complaint, you may ask: first, so that you may remember us and our churches in your prayers, and then so that you may understand that I cannot always write to you when I wish.</p>
      <p>I now have in hand the ceremonies of our church and its entire governance in our ministry.</p>
      <p>I hope it will be published by winter. I write, however, not without Theseus, I mean our Micronius, whom I greatly congratulate for our church here. My king of Poland is said to be preparing for a new marriage.</p>
      <p>Many think that he is considering restoring religion among his people and that I will be called by him. But I cannot yet promise anything certain about my affairs. Our king of England has been languishing for a long time but is now recovering again (thanks be to our Lord God).</p>
      <p>I would gladly know what you wrote to Hoper about predestination; I have not been able to see it because of the man's absence, although he has promised several times to send your letters to me. Farewell, most upright man, and please commend me to all your colleagues, especially to Master Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalter, and Gesner. Hastily, in London, June 7, 1553. I did not have time to reread; therefore, forgive me if anything is poorly written.</p>
      <p>Yours truly and from the heart, as much as he is, Johannes a Lasco with my own hand.</p>
      <p>Commend us to Master Calvin, if it is convenient for you, and explain to him our tragedies here and ask him in my words not to believe anything rashly about us, if anything is spread about us to him, until he learns the whole cause from me.</p>
      <p>To the most holy and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
