    <p xml:id="regest1">The [Bernese colleagues] have seen Luther's "Short Confession" and noticed how it declares all those who deny the physical presence of the body of Christ and its consumption in the Lord's Supper to be heretics. Oecolampadius and Zwingli, the main advocates of the Bern Disputation [of 1528], as well as the Zurich and Bern brothers, insofar as they adhere to the results of the Bern Disputation that contradict the Lutheran standpoint, are condemned in it. - Due to their love for their churches and for the truth, the [Zurich pastors] could no longer remain silent; they have responded moderately to the audacious Luther. Enclosed is their [“Orthodox Confession of the Church of Zurich”]. - Hopefully, the Bernese colleagues will not be displeased that they are mentioned in this writing. Otherwise, their critical remarks are welcome. It would also be possible for the Bernese to counter Luther with their own treatise. The Zurich pastors want to combine their forces with those of the Bernese to better resist the opponent. - They have written to the Bernese authorities, sent them the [“True Confession”], and called on them to remain faithful to the truth recognized in the Bern Disputation. - The Zurich pastors call for reflection, zeal, and unity among themselves and with the Zurichers, who gladly stand by them in loyalty and friendship.</p>

      <p>You have seen, esteemed and beloved brothers, what Dr. Luther has spread throughout the Christian world with his published concise confession. You undoubtedly understand where that writing is directed. He condemns all at once with the infamous crime of heresy, those who deny that the natural body of the Lord is eaten and received corporally and orally by both the impious and the pious in the Lord's Supper. He condemns Oecolampadius and Zwingli, of blessed memory, the first defenders of your Bern Disputation. He condemns the Zurich brothers and indeed also the Bernese brothers, as they assert and defend the doctrine contrary to the Lutheran opinion, which was asserted in the disputation and accepted by the entire Bernese church.</p>
      <p>You are not unaware of the horrendous and abominable things he has written against us and our churches. Therefore, for the sake of our holy and innocent churches, to say nothing of other reasons, you cannot remain unmoved, not with the zeal of the flesh and emotions, but with the spirit and justice.</p>
      <p>We, certainly, stirred by zeal for the truth and our churches and with pious care, have finally broken our stubborn silence and have responded to Luther and his most audacious condemnation not immodestly. For we do not repay insult with insult, but, dealing with the matter of truth and the churches, we present arguments and scriptures. We send here an example to your charity; for we have defended both you and your churches and have cleared you from the slanders of that infamous reviler.</p>
      <p>We hope this will not displease you, that we make an honorable mention of your churches in ours. It will not displease us if you find anything in our response that is not sufficiently consistent with the truth or not well considered and indicate it to us amicably. Nor do we prescribe to you with these letters. It is also permissible for you, if it seems useful, to respond to Luther, following the old example, where several doctors of the churches sometimes responded to one or another adversary.</p>
      <p>We wish to join our forces with yours in the Lord, so that truth may finally prevail and solid peace may be established among our churches, so that we may more strongly withstand the attacks of adversaries and enemies. The Lord and truth fight for us. Hence, if you prefer to abstain from our communion (which we do not expect), nevertheless relying on heavenly aid, we will continue in our established plan to fight the Lord's battles.</p>
      <p>We have also written to your most honorable senate and people, urging them to constancy in those things which were asserted and accepted in the public disputation from the word of truth. Furthermore, we have joined an example of our response to them; we inform you of this, so you may not be unaware of what we are doing and seeking among your people.</p>
      <p>We urge you by the coming of the Son of God in judgment, that if ever, carried away by sinister suspicions, you have agreed less solidly among yourselves, or have been colder in spirit towards us, that you may, putting all those things aside, embrace each other with mutual sincere charity and us also with unfaked affection.</p>
      <p>You will find us faithful brothers and friends, who wish to hear you discussing gladly, and to share our counsels and aids with you faithfully and gladly. May the Lord Jesus keep you in His holy will.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 12, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your brothers, pastors, readers, and ministers of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the learned and faithful ministers of Christ and the Church of Bern, preaching Christ in the city, all dear and esteemed brothers.</p>
