      <p>S. I received your letters yesterday sent through this Fietz; therefore, through the same, receive these few words.</p>
      <p>In the Saffoischen matter, nothing further has been handled. A messenger has gone to Camerach; he carries my lord's response there.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, last Tuesday a post came from the Duke, indicating that Lord de la Croy, who has been his foremost envoy in the peace negotiations, is coming out himself and is already on the road. He arrived on the following Friday along with several others; however, he has not yet been publicly heard.</p>
      <p>My lords are all summoned for tomorrow. I suspect the Duke wants to insist on renewing the old alliance along with the peace, and it is almost believed that if he leaves the lordship of Gee to my lords, he would achieve much. However, nothing is yet clearly revealed; some trust the matter well, others not at all.</p>
      <p>There is also another envoy here from the Duke of Longueville regarding the purchase of the lordship of Columbier, which the Duke is doing from the heirs of my lord Schultheiss von Wattenwyl of blessed memory; in this, my lords have something to say.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing from Lyon, except that it is dreadfully dying. The people of Geneva can now be shown no greater thanks than by rejecting all peace negotiations with the Duke and restoring nothing to him. But whether this is feasible, I do not know.</p>
      <p>If only they themselves were grateful and recognized with how much danger our people have so far defended their freedom! They were indeed the cause for which, but not through which, our land occupied that place, and therefore our people require gratitude from them as much as they from us. May the Lord protect both!</p>
      <p>Here you have news again from Mathias Walther and the Lafaters. Amadiensis promised to write and send letters to me; if he does this before he leaves, I will send them through him. He sends his regards; as do all the other lords and friends. Give my regards to the lords consuls, your wife, and all who are of your household, in my name.</p>
      <p>All of mine also send their regards to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 30, 1564.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my esteemed lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
