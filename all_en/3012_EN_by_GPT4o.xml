      <p>S. D. Reverend man and dearest brother, I very often recite the sweetest verse, in which the numbers of the Greek poet are, the sentiment is divinely given [...].</p>
      <p>Since therefore you rightly invoke God and serve the church piously, your family will also be under God's care. By God's grace, your son Heinrich is doing well and is progressing successfully in the best studies of doctrine; I wholeheartedly wish that God keeps him safe and makes him [...]. He is considering a degree, but I wanted him to do nothing in this matter unless you command it [...]. I would gladly write much to you and am not hindered by occupations, even though I am not lightly burdened; but both the magnitude of the matters and of my pain is so great that I cannot establish other topics.</p>
      <p>But perhaps we will converse shortly; for I also expect the usual exiles of the church. I wish health to all of you and especially to Peter Martyr and Lelio. Farewell and be happy.</p>
      <p>On the 16th of September.</p>
      <p>Philipp.</p>
