      <p>Philipp, by the grace of God Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc.</p>
      <p>Worthy and well-learned, dear friend, we have received your letter along with the sent booklet and have understood your opinion as nothing but just. We thank you for the booklet along with the congratulations on our release, graciously acknowledging it, and are inclined to recognize you in all grace and do not wish to hide from you that we have already read some of the booklets, which we found excellent and very pleasing; we also intend to read them with all diligence in the future.</p>
      <p>And since some have spread and said that we have fallen from faith. That is not so; it was never our intention. We are just as little fallen away as you and others, and if our opinion had been rightly understood, much different things would have been said about us (than that we should have fallen from faith); for the fact that we came into custody at Halle in Saxony was solely caused by the demand that we should consent to what the Council of Trent decided, and as we refused, we were taken into custody, etc.</p>
      <p>Which we did not wish to hide from you in our gracious opinion, and we are favorably disposed towards you with special grace. Given at Ziegenhain on the 24th of December in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, signed.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and well-learned, our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich.</p>
