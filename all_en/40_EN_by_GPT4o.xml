    <p xml:id="regest1">Although Erb rarely writes and Bullinger and Gwalther almost never get around to writing (as they are occupied with many ecclesiastical and secular duties), Erb knows that the misfortune of the church [of the Lordship of Riquewihr], increasingly plagued by deceitful adversaries, is well known to the people of Zurich. They should pray incessantly that the faith [in the county] does not perish!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">The state of the church in Riquewihr is as follows: During the [Basel exile] of Count George of Württemberg-Mömpelgard, the Christian way of life in the lordship is deteriorating! Even the nobles and political officials lead a completely corrupt lifestyle: They seek their own advantage, turn a blind eye to public scandals, and thus show such great contempt for the word of God as never before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">The Count lives in Basel and has too many worries to be able to counteract these dire conditions. He is treated poorly by both Emperor Charles V and his brother, Duke Ulrich of Württemberg. Even the payments due to him from his duchy are being withheld by the Duke! He is almost in despair (as is common among nobles), thinking that he is doomed. The hostile Habsburgs in neighboring Ensisheim are spreading the rumor everywhere that they will rule over [the Lordship of Riquewihr]. They want nothing to do with the tithes and other payments owed to the lordship, to which they would be obligated. And these are not even large amounts! Thus, the people blame the Gospel for this evil.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Erb and his colleagues preach with all their might against it, but achieve little. In short: The devil has become the master. But this is the retribution for the ingratitude [towards God] and the lack of repentance! May God impose the deserved punishment without delay, so that the pious may experience somewhat calmer times and the Gospel [once again] be revered. But why worry so much? May the will of the Lord be done!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">The few pastors in Riquewihr will likely be brought to ruin by Charles V. But they will be blessed, for God is with them. He, however, is undoubtedly of the devil! He will [soon] realize this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">There are many flatterers who believe that the Emperor will act rightly in the matter of religion. Let them believe in their Emperor! Erb does not share this opinion, for he knows how cunningly Charles V has acted in the past. For him and his followers, Christ is the only Redeemer. And He holds the Emperor's heart in His hand and can turn it at will. [So much for the church of Riquewihr.]</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">The report on the delegation led by Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo to Pope Paul III regarding the Council of Trent, initiated by the Emperor and the Imperial Estates, is probably already known to the people of Zurich. Likewise, certainly the Pope's response and the resolutions made by the Emperor and the Imperial Estates in response. This reveals the nature of these flatterers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Bucer, along with some other preachers from the Imperial Cities, was summoned [to Augsburg]. They are to work out an agreement on the contentious religious issues there, which is to be valid until a free council can be convened.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">The people of Zurich should pray for the church [of the Lordship of Riquewihr], so that neither Christ nor the truth is betrayed there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">Greetings to Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and the other pastoral colleagues along with their families. Also, greetings to Gerold Meyer von Knonau the Younger, who has not been heard from since his departure [from Riquewihr]. Perhaps he has become a supporter of the Emperor... Another greeting. In haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[P.S.:] Personal greetings from Oswald Fürstenlob and Nikolaus König.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">The young [letter bearer], Bartholomäus [Hermann?] from Magdeburg, who worked as a teacher at the school in Hunaweier last year, is recommended to the people of Zurich.</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you. Although I rarely write and you, occupied with many duties both ecclesiastical and secular, almost never write, I know that the adversity of our church is well known to you (as it is increasingly troubled by the insidiousness of malevolent and deceitful people), so that you pray incessantly for us, that our faith may not fail.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>And so that you may know, most esteemed men and brothers in Christ, the state of our affairs and the evils we are troubled by, receive this in brief: In the absence of the prince, all Christian discipline has perished! The nobles themselves and those whose duty it is to govern the state are men of the most perverse lives, seeking their own gain and turning a blind eye to public scandals. Furthermore, there is as much contempt for the word as ever, even in so many adversities.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The prince resides in Basel and cannot remedy these evils, being sufficiently burdened himself. He has an unfavorable relationship with the Emperor, not to mention his brother, who even refuses to pay what is owed to him from the duchy. Hence, our prince (as is the custom of princes) almost despairs, thinking that his situation is hopeless. Finally, the neighboring adversaries of the House of Austria from Ensisheim, etc., who spread everywhere that they will rule over us, have anathematized all debts, tithes, revenues, and whatever is owed to us under their dominion (though it is not much), so that none of them will pay us henceforth. And so it happens that the common people, in their usual manner, blame the Gospel for this evil.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Meanwhile, we cry out until we are hoarse, yet achieve little, we admonish, we rebuke, we console, but make little progress. In short: the devil has become our master. But this is the retribution for ingratitude and impenitence, etc. I pray that if it is God's will, He may impose the deserved punishment immediately, so that the pious may finally see somewhat calmer times, and the glory of the Gospel may be spread more widely. But why am I anxious? May the will of the Lord be done!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>We brothers here await the Emperor, though we are few, to devour us. We will be thrice blessed. Let him see to it. For God is with us. Who doubts that Satan is with him?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>There are many flatterers who think the Emperor will rightly consult on religion, to whom I do not subscribe, knowing with what deceit he has acted thus far. Let them have their Emperor, for us Christ is the only salvation, who holds the Emperor's heart in His hand and will turn it wherever He wishes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The acts at the Pope regarding the Council of Trent by Cardinal Cristoforo, acting as legate in the name of the Emperor and the Imperial Estates, and the Pope's response, as well as the deliberation of the Emperor and the Estates, if I am not mistaken, you have. There you may see the ways of the flatterers, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Bucer has been called with some other preachers of the Imperial Cities to consult on maintaining common peace in religion, while the Emperor is free to convene a council.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Pray for us, most holy men, and for our church, that Christ and the truth may not succumb in temptations. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Greet Pellican, Bibliander, and the rest of your fellow ministers in Christ Jesus with your families, also our Gerold, who has written nothing since his departure, perhaps having become an imperialist... Farewell in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. In great haste. Riquewihr, February 10, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>

      <p>Oswald Fürstenlob and Nikolaus König send their greetings with my own hand.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>We commend to you this young man, Bartholomäus from Magdeburg, who was a teacher at the school in Hunawihr last year, etc.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished men, Heinrich Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther, most vigilant churchmen of Zurich, brothers to be revered in Christ.</p>
