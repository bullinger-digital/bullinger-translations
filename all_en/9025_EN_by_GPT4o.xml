      <p> Greetings. I received your letter, my most esteemed lord and father, written on the fifth of September, only on the twelfth of the same month, which is why I did not write to you last week through the grain merchants, our usual couriers. Indeed, I sent the sadness and most grievous evils, as they were reported to us by the king, to my most illustrious lord, Mr. Simler. If they are true, there is no fault with the king; but this cannot be persuaded to our people, who, unless the king takes action against the instigators of sedition, if these things happened without his knowledge, will break the treaty, which had been violated before. </p>
      <p> For they argue, by reasoning from the greater to the lesser, that if he does not keep faith with his subjects, he will not keep it with us either. And certainly, what dealings should you have with such people, why should their friendship be sought, about whom it can most truly be said, as is written about people of the same kind in 1 Maccabees chapter 7: There is no faith or justice in them; for they have violated the covenant and oath they had given. As I recently wrote to my lord Mr. Simler, the king wants to be considered innocent of all these things. If this is the case, our people say, and he alone cannot punish the guilty, why does he not seek our faith and help? What will be achieved, the lord knows; I firmly believe, as you piously write to me, that God will preserve his church, as he has preserved it until now. I could not share your letters with Mr. Tobia; for he had already departed and, as I suppose, is with you there. We have no news from Italy or the Netherlands. In my name, I wish you to greet the daughters Veritas and Dorothea, the son Johann Rudolf, and the whole family, as well as Mr. Lavater. I write a few things to Mr. Simler and my dearest compatriot until I can discuss more with them in person, which I hope will be soon. May Almighty God keep you safe for a long time for his church. Farewell, my most esteemed lord and father. </p>
      <p> From Haldenstein, 15th of September, 1572. </p>
      <p> Yours most devotedly, Johann Baptist Müller. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man and exceptional servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his lord to be honored with perpetual faith. Zürich. </p>
