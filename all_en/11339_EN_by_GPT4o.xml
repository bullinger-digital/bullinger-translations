    <p xml:id="regest1">Will forward the letter [No. 1291] and bring up the matter of Ulrich [Zingg] with [Diethelm] Röist, who is in charge of the appointed accountants; afterwards, the succession will need to be discussed. [Werner] Steiner has no documents about the people of Unterwalden and Bern [or their conflict of 1528/29]. Sends Konrad Escher's instructions, but absolutely must have them back within eight days. Asks to be kind to the bearer, a poor brother.</p>

      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to Johannes Stumpf.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>I will ensure that the shared letters are also available and read by other lords and brothers. In the meantime, I will faithfully carry out the task with Röist, who is the head of those appointed for the accounts. I will also advise him to expedite the matter of Ulrich Dürter. Once that is done and the brother is provided for, there will be an opportunity to discuss appointing a successor.</p>
      <p>Steiner has nothing of what you heard about the people of Unterwalden and Bern.</p>
      <p>I am sending Konrad Escher's instructions, but on the condition that you return them within 8 days through a reliable messenger, so they are not lost. I promised to return them within 8 days and pretended that I would not share them with anyone.</p>
      <p>Farewell and treat me as a brother. I do not want you to treat me as a slave, but as a brother. Zurich, 14th of August, 1539.</p>
      <p>Be kind to this poor brother; for you will be doing a kindness to Christ.</p>
