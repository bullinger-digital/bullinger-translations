      <p>Greetings. What we have responded to you and the brothers, Calvin, dearest brother, we have also responded to the senate, and it did not seem advisable to us to conceal what we had previously written to you for the same reason, lest we appear to be liars or to have done something out of pretense and favoritism once the matter is discovered. Therefore, after recalling our opinion, which we impose on our agreement, and illustrating it with some aphorisms and scriptural testimonies, we add that we wrote to you, our dearest brothers, about the same matter two days ago. We added that Hieronymus is mistaken if he thinks that Zwingli made God the author of evil or that God compels us to sin. For although something of this might seem to be inferred from his book on Providence (for in this part the booklet sent by your magistrate was more detailed), yet other books of his should also be examined, which he published before and after that one, in which he clearly attributes sin to our wills, etc. At present, we could respond with nothing else. If Hieronymus does not allow himself to be overcome by simple truth, we can add no further force. May the Lord grant you counsel, so that what is for the glory of God may be done for the benefit of your church and all the pious.</p>
      <p>However, we gladly read in that addition by the magistrate, which we just mentioned, that you have prepared a special book in which you will show that God is not the author of sin. I therefore pray that we may soon be able to see it. For believe me, many were offended by your Institutes on Predestination, and drew the same conclusion that Hieronymus drew from Zwingli's book on Providence. In my opinion, the apostles touched upon this sublime matter only briefly, and only when compelled, and they moderated it in such a way that the pious would not be offended, but all would understand that God wishes well for all men, and offers salvation in Christ, which they can receive not by their own strength but by faith, the true gift of God, and thus they are chosen for Christ's sake and his grace, and not for any regard of their own, while the reprobate perish by their own fault, not by God's malice, since God is philanthropic and provides the way of salvation to all, which, when they do not enter due to their own rebellion, they perish, etc. Therefore, it will be useful and salutary for many to explain this treatment according to the gifts granted to you by God, and to derive all blame onto man, attributing all the good things of life and salvation to the pure grace of God, and to us nothing but misery, blame, and humility, that is, what humbles us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed and dearest brother and lord, together with all the pious. If you wish to do us a favor, you will write at once what has been done in that matter. ZÃ¼rich, December 1, 1551.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
