      <p>Greetings. I have returned these days from Lausanne.</p>
      <p>I took my brother's son with me there and, by order of the council, together with Lord Manuel, I inspected the state of that school, which, by the grace of the Lord, is moderately flourishing.</p>
      <p>Your Brenwald would have had an honorable position there if he had not wanted to conduct himself more arrogantly than was appropriate; he left before we arrived.</p>
      <p>We hear he has gone to Heidelberg.</p>
      <p>He left his fianc√©e in Lausanne.</p>
      <p>Blasius is well with all his family and sends you his warmest greetings; he would have written back if my presence and other occupations, which coincided with this, had not prevented him. We received nothing new there except what Mr. Beza had already written to you, except that it was reported to us that the Turk unexpectedly occupied the island of Malta, but the fortress is still held by our people.</p>
      <p>This same information was also written to our senate by some noble Savoyards while we were away. Lord Gerard of Wattenwyl writes from Spain that Tunis was captured by the Turk and Dragut, and the king of that place was captured there with all his family and soon beheaded. These are sad things; but it is to be feared that more serious and sadder things will follow.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Bishop of Sion has also died, and in his place, these days, by the common counsel of the decurions and the chapter, as they call it, Hildebrand von Riedmatten has been elected.</p>
      <p>The decurions, together with the chief captain, reserved some articles for themselves against the bishop and the chapter, which were also granted to them; but what or what kind they are, I do not yet know. Some nobles also report today that the Duke of Savoy has occupied Casale in Piedmont (this was free, as I hear, and subject to no one).</p>
      <p>Our alliance is not yet concluded; I hope by the grace of the Lord that this delay will be completely resolved; for not everyone is cheerful anymore and so much is being done about it that it should help in the end. Nevertheless, I do not cease to fear and pray to the Lord not to lead us into temptation.</p>
      <p>The peace of Savoy is also not yet sealed; I think they have lost their seal. Meanwhile, our people enjoy full possession as before, which I wish they may enjoy perpetually! All of ours diligently greet you, especially Steiger, Diesbach, Grafenried, Ludwig Zehender, who recently celebrated the weddings of both his son and daughter; he betrothed his son to the daughter of Adrian Ginner, a wealthy and honorable citizen, and married his daughter to N. Wysshan, the son of Mr. Caspar Wysshan, a senator.</p>
      <p>But I think you knew this before.</p>
      <p>Your father-in-law, mother, and wife also greet you. Greet all of yours in my name.</p>
      <p>In Bern, June 28, at nightfall, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and compatriot, to be honored with perpetual respect.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
