    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letters [No. 1962 and 1963] through a messenger appointed by Vadian and unfortunately upset the latter by offering him only a coin through the maid; however, he will make up for the oversight. Regarding the rumor [about Cochläus’ stroke?], there is nothing more to learn than what Bullinger already writes about it in his letter, and he will also learn this from the enclosed letter, which is to be sent back with the messenger Alban [Hamman]; to whom of the two [...] it is best to deliver what Bullinger has sent will probably not be so important. Are Zwingli's works now in print? May God bring His people closer together. Has not yet read Osiander's book [“Coniecturae de ultimis temporibus”] and asks Bullinger to send him the “Speculum Osiandri.” Thinks like Bullinger about Schwenckfeld. The book intended for [Hans] Welser [“Hoffnung der Gläubigen”] will be forwarded. Bullinger will probably receive what is to be expected from Jakob [Ruf]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I received your two letters yesterday, which our Vadianus wanted to send to me from St. Gallen through this messenger - as the messenger himself affirmed. I made a mistake in this matter, as I was not at home and received and read the letters in our garden near the city from the maid, thinking of nothing less than that a messenger had been sent here to deliver them to me. I only arranged for our maid to give him a single batz, assuming he had other business to conduct here. As a result, he left very upset, not waiting for me and indignantly throwing away the coin. However, tomorrow or the day after, I will write to Vadianus and make amends for that payment. I am grateful to you for your service.</p>
      <p>Here, certainly, no other rumors are being spread than what you write and what you will learn from Frecht's letters; I ask you to return them now also through this Alban of ours. I did not think it mattered to whom I sent these first; I do not see what advice Vadianus and I can give here.</p>
      <p>Zwingli's works are now being printed, if I am not mistaken, and are sweating under the press. I will pray to the Lord, as much as I can, that He may bind us more and more closely together and remove scandals from His kingdom as far as possible.</p>
      <p>I have not read Osiander's book; therefore, I pronounce nothing. Please ensure, I beg you, that I have the "Speculum Osiandri" you write about.</p>
      <p>I judge the same about Schwenckfeld as you do. May the Lord rebuke him as soon as possible, so that he no longer mixes poison with the invitations to Christ's wedding. Ah, let us pray for the church of God as fervently as we can, that in the spirit of Christ, it may successfully conquer and overcome all its enemies, especially the domestic ones! You will also pray for us, my venerable and most beloved Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I will send your booklet to Mr. Welser tomorrow or the day after. With the surgeon Jakob, I have no doubt that you will act as is appropriate and obtain what is needed from him.</p>
      <p>My brother and Zwiccius send their greetings to you and commend themselves to you respectfully. Greet the friends and brothers, especially your household. September 4, 1544.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the church of Zurich, a lord and brother to be honored and cherished above all others. Zurich.</p>
