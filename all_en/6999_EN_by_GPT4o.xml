      <p>Christian love and loyalty, along with the offering of my willing service beforehand. Reverend and gracious Lord Bullinger, my most recent letter was sent on the first of January through your servant; I hope it has reached you by now. This letter of mine contains nothing special, only because I had the opportunity to send a message, I did not fail to write due to good friendship and to share the serious events that are unfortunately unfolding before our eyes, as I mentioned earlier, that an unforeseen war has arisen in our land at Thuringia. Thus, the Elector of Saxony has attacked and besieged his cousin Johann Friedrich, who is called a protector of the Empire, in his fortress named Gotha. And the Empire's aid has been called upon, which has then been commanded by the imperial majesty, as you can see in the enclosed copy.</p>
      <p>Thus, our lords here have also sent a number of troops on horseback and foot. It is to be feared, if the aforementioned Johann Friedrich has a rear guard (as some believe), a great disruption will occur in the entire German nation. As they say, they are said to be very defensive in the fortress of Gotha, also well supplied with provisions and troops, so that it would require great effort and expense. Some also suspect, since he has royal majesty's provision from France, he might have help and reassurance before him, which time will reveal. Concerning the Elector and the Count Palatine, he is still in Amberg and intends to move again at Candlemas. It is very quiet here on his part; he has forbidden some preachers from the pulpit, who in their sermons were more inclined to unrest than to edification and peace. But in all churches, he allows his preachers to preach, through which many come to understanding, but it requires much effort because it is a coarse and ignorant people.</p>
      <p>From the Netherlands, some write that they are also in arms, with about 12,000 men together, to relieve the city of Valenciennes, which is besieged by the opponents; and in the advance, they plundered and burned a pleasure house of the Bishop of Arras along with several abbeys.</p>
      <p>Thus, it is truly in a bad state in all of Christendom, but we have well deserved this with our godless lives.</p>
      <p>Herewith the supplication in German, which has been distributed here, from the Dutch churches. Otherwise, nothing at this time; if you have any news with you, I ask you to share it with us when convenient. With this, I commend myself to your love and service, and may you be greeted by me and my wife, and I commend you to the protection and care of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Given in Nuremberg on the 14th of January, 1567. Your willing servant Gabriel Schl√ºsselberger</p>
