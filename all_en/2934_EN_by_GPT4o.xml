      <p>Greetings. I have just received the letter you sent me on the 22nd of April.</p>
      <p>You have done a favor by explaining the history of the Tugins so diligently. The rest agrees with the printed account, except for the part where it narrates that the books were burned by the executioner of Lucerne, which you indicated was done by the officials.</p>
      <p>This cruelty is more than Vandalic, but they present their excuses, which are at least plausible to the ignorant or malevolent. However, the Lord is the one who knows how to turn even our evils to the glory of His name, and I do not doubt that the atrocity of the deed will arouse the zeal of many, as it certainly has happened among the Seduni. For now, the best books are being bought more eagerly and imported, as the seven Bibles were handed over to the flames with such savagery. Moreover, in recent days, a rather large and long German sheet was posted in the public square of Sion, which contained the main points of the true religion clearly and well confirmed by the scriptures, and it was read with the gathering and applause of many. Because a certain priest dared to tear it down, he was summoned to court by the citizens for having invaded with a nefarious hand and unjustly the most pious writing near their tribunals.</p>
      <p>The people of Goms, who live high in the Alps, are fiercer against the truth of Christ than the other orders and still oppress it, aided by three others. However, the people of Sion are moderately inclined towards piety and have a pastor who is not entirely lazy, who promises some sparks of the gospel, acquires the best books, and is excellently encouraged by the more sensible citizens. I am writing to him today. The people of Brig also have someone who favors the kingdom of Christ, whom the bishop recently imprisoned because he denied purgatory, but released after four days because he is young and not ungrateful to his own. We had previously heard that the people of Visp do not abhor the gospel, and they have a pastor who is not ignorant of the evangelical profession, but not very constant, as he follows the desires of the flesh too eagerly. Meanwhile, however, the seeds of a more sincere faith are sprouting everywhere in that region, which may the Lord bless, increase, and confirm, amen. For the rest, I have nothing now, and all is in deep silence.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. Basel, 26th of May, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
