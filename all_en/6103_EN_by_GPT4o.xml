      <p>S. P. Your letters were pleasing to me, my most revered parent in Christ, by which I understood that you were pleased with what I had written to you in my previous letters. As you advise me to persevere in this endeavor, I will indeed devote myself entirely to it and diligently invoke God to bless my efforts with His divine favor. As for me, my lord, since I cannot repay any part of your merits, nor even conceive of a gratitude that matches them, I will always show a benevolent and grateful spirit. I received money from my parent at this fair and letters by which I was informed that our affairs are in good condition and that the cities of Lower Germany are free from the plague, which was pleasing and delightful for me to hear. He also writes some astonishing things about nocturnal fires and certain dark clouds surrounding a translucent cloud; three suns were also seen, and similar things. As for me, he advises that if I fear the plague, I should descend to him along the Rhine. However, it seems more prudent to stay in Germany for a while to learn the German language. Yet, if it rages so severely in all parts, it is better to sacrifice some knowledge than life. My honorable father greets you and thanks you for having embraced me with such humanity and benevolence. He wrote two letters to me and one to you, which I am very surprised have not been delivered to us; I believe they were entrusted to negligent couriers. If I receive anything, I will send it. If there is any news, your printers there will bring it from the Frankfurt fair. Farewell, most distinguished lord, in Christ; kindly convey my greetings in my words to my lady, your wife, to your daughters Dorothea and Veritas, to Brigitte, the most faithful maid, and especially to your son-in-law, Mr. Josias. Basel, April 11.</p>
      <p>Yours with due devotion, Johannes Utenhove.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant minister of the Church of Zürich, his most revered lord and teacher. Zürich.</p>
