    <p xml:id="regest1">Will gladly receive Heinrich Lavater if he is willing to accept the modest circumstances. Otto Werdmüller fulfills the hopes placed in him. The church in Strasbourg will fare better now that the council is fulfilling its duties: Anton Engelbrecht has been dismissed. Jakob Ziegler proves to be ungrateful. Bedrot is surprised that no one has yet published a biography of Zwingli to counter the defamatory slanders. This could easily be done in the form of a preface, as has now been done with Oecolampadius's life. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I will gladly receive Lavater if he is willing to accept my modest circumstances, especially since you have recommended him. My house is rather small. But since it is not possible for me to have a larger one now, I must be content with this. The annual cost of living will be 25 florins of our currency. For even others, younger in age, pay the same amount. Otto will not disappoint the hope placed in him. He soberly corrects a style that tends to excess, and experience will refine his judgment. I believe he will soon give you a taste of how valuable his work is.</p>
      <p>The reason for my delayed response is the lack of messengers, and your letters were also delivered to me later than expected. Everything here is quite satisfactory now, and I hope the church will fare better since the council is now more seriously fulfilling its duties. If you are unaware, they recently dismissed Anton, the former suffragan of Speyer, who had been preaching here for eight years or more, a man truly made for anything but maintaining the harmony of the churches. But Ziegler has also nurtured a monster until now. What kind it is, it now reveals itself. Oh, ingratitude worthy of a beating. But I prefer you learn about these matters from others, if you have not already heard about them through our Bucer, whatever it may be.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that none of your people have yet recommended Zwingli's life to posterity, even briefly and concisely, so that the malicious slanderers do not have such an opportunity to blaspheme. This could be conveniently done in some preface, just as now the life of Oecolampadius by Ezechiel Grynaeus will not only make it more marketable. But it will also defend this most blessed soul from calumnies. Forgive me, excellent man, for my trifles.</p>
      <p>Otto commends himself to your trust. Please diligently greet Collin and Theodor in my name and farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, March 3.</p>
      <p>Bedrot.</p>
      <p>Regarding Lavater, I wish to be informed as soon as possible, so that if it is not possible for him to come, I do not deny others who may wish to live with me in vain. You can inform me of everything through Froschauer.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful ecclesiast of the Zurichers, his incomparable lord and friend, Zürich.</p>
