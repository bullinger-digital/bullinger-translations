      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters, my dear brother, but I have not yet read even half of them due to being hindered by business matters and a weakness of the head caused by the variety of affairs. Nevertheless, I am sending back the letters of the excellent man, Mr. Ruinelli, whom you will greet in my name. The peasant uprising because of the tithes displeases me so much that it could not displease me more. They must indeed be restrained and brought back to fairness with suitable measures. Such attempts are truly seditious and greatly offend our adversaries, and not without reason. While we heard the slander of our ambassador (?), some members of the senate were present. I responded: 'Since he is in the city, what if we approached him and inquired? [The response to us:] It is the duty of the magistrate to act appropriately in this matter.' However, when I inquired today about what had been done, I learned that the matter had not yet been brought to the senate and that some people disregard that man's many accusations for various reasons. Therefore, I doubt what will happen. I myself do not think much of his accusation, if I consider more closely how easily he could deny what was previously said. I advise you, therefore, to keep this to yourself and not to burst out; about which Simlerus also writes to you... However, you would do nothing more foolish (forgive me for this) than if you were to write an apology to the Swiss envoys. If you are unaware: they would not read it, they would spit on it, tear it apart, trample it, etc.</p>
      <p>What I have received from friends from various places these days, I am sending so that you may read it with friends and acquaintances, and then return it. I cannot write more now.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends in order.</p>
      <p>Most quickly. Zurich, July 18, on which day 68 years ago I was born into these hardships and miseries, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Froschauer thanks you and will wait a while longer, etc.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and good friend Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
