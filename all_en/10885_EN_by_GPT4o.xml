      <p>Greetings from God through His own Christ. I feared, lest you (venerable men, most beloved teachers and brothers in Christ) accuse me of either ingratitude or negligence if I did not send a letter with our Erasmus to you, since I have not sent any letters to you for so many months. Although, indeed, for my sake, there was no need for any letters to you, because Erasmus himself will be my letter to you, as he knows very well what kind of mind and spirit I have towards you. Nevertheless, I could not refrain from writing, partly to express my gratitude to you for Erasmus, who has been with us until now, and partly to request again that you send him back to us as an apostle. For it must not be passed over in silence that he has not only shown himself commendable by his learning, piety, and virtues of all kinds, but also by sweating, teaching, watching, and enduring, he has exhibited himself in such a way that he has drawn everyone into admiration of him, and he could not help but bring much fruit to Christ, which we experience daily in the duties of the simple people entrusted to us. And this is the testimony that we give to him. Therefore, as far as it concerns me, I implore and beseech you all (most learned and upright men) by the bond and union which our church, through Erasmus, has contracted with yours, to take up the care of this matter with the renowned council and magistrates of the city of Zürich and, if you can, to persuade and effect that our Erasmus be sent back to us for a few more years by your pious magistrates. This indeed will happily result in the praise and glory of God's name and the salvation of souls; and you will not fail in your duty of spreading the divine word, which will be as pleasing to me as anything most pleasing.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, dearest lords and brothers.</p>
      <p>From Riquewihr, 15th of June, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Johannes Froschius, treasurer and prefect of provisions of Riquewihr.</p>
      <p>To the venerable men, equally conspicuous in piety and learning, pastors, doctors, and ministers of the word of the city of Zürich, their most beloved lords and brothers in Christ.</p>
