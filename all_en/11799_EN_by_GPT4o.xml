    <p xml:id="regest1">Although exhausted from the long journey from Zurich to Wittenberg, he wishes to thank Bullinger and his colleagues for the help and friendship shown to him and to share some news that reached him during his absence from his homeland. Six somewhat educated pastors are proclaiming the Gospel there, and soon all of Transylvania will embrace the teachings of Christ, although the devil - as everywhere the Gospel is purely proclaimed - opposes it; there have also been reports of unrest due to the evangelical proclamation. In a letter dated April 23, it is reported that the Moldavian [Voivode Petru Rareș] will soon occupy Transylvania with the help of the Turks; behind this are the Hungarians, who seek to destroy the pure teachings in this way; he asks Bullinger and his colleagues to pray for the Transylvanian church. He requests Bullinger to write something about child education, especially about education, because without it the [evangelical] faith will not last long. He asks Bullinger to vouch for him with Christoph Froschauer for the works of Bullinger and [Konrad] Pellikan he desires at the next Frankfurt fair, as well as the new Bible [“Biblia sacrosancta”]; he will send the amount immediately upon his return [to Kronstadt] through a reliable messenger. If the Turk [Suleiman I.] should occupy the homeland - which God may avert - it would make it impossible for him to work among his own, and he would sell his books and belongings and come to Zurich as quickly as possible, where he could at least earn his livelihood in some capacity. Greetings to Pellikan and his wife [Elisabeth Kalb], to Theodor Bibliander, and to the other colleagues. He asks Bullinger to apologize to Pellikan and Bibliander for not writing to them, as the messenger was in a great hurry.</p>

      <p>To the most learned and pious Lord, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, my esteemed Lord and superior, Peace to Zurich. Although my body was utterly exhausted from the long and arduous journey, and my mind had become almost entirely estranged from all literary pursuits, nevertheless, as soon as I returned safely and unharmed to Wittenberg (thanks to Almighty God), I was quite anxiously concerned to write to all patrons and good and pious men, upon whose work and friendship I had relied, as soon as possible. First, to make it known to them that I am by no means among the ungrateful, whose nature is not only to fail to give thanks for received benefits but also to hurl many insults and reproaches at them. To free myself from this suspicion, I intended to write to you briefly. Secondly, by doing this, I could share with you a few new things that were written to me from my homeland during the time I was absent from Wittenberg, not doubting that they would be most pleasing to you. Namely, that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is being preached more and more each day in the paternal land, with great fruit, by six moderately learned ministers of the word, with God's cooperation, and that soon all of Transylvania will embrace this doctrine of Christ, with great joy and thanksgiving. Nevertheless, as is usual where the word of the Lord is sincerely preached, that slippery serpent, the roaring lion, does not rest, but as Peter says, goes about day and night, seeking whom he may devour, etc. Thus, I hear that various warlike tumults are being stirred up there, and indeed solely because of the preaching of the Gospel. It is written to me (the letters are dated April 23) that the Moldavian great duke of the Wallachians, with a very strong hand of Turks taken with him, is about to occupy the lands of the Transylvanians, which may God the best and greatest avert. The head of this matter, however, is the Hungarians, who think that in this way the pure doctrine will be uprooted. Therefore, I ask you, most excellent and learned man, to pray without any delay for that Church together with your colleagues, so that Almighty God, who willed his only-begotten Son to die for it, may deliver it from those troubles and dangers of external and internal enemies according to his will and preserve it for a long time in the propagation of his name, which I do not doubt the heavenly Father will do, provided we pray to him with constant prayers through his Son, through whom he wishes to be invoked and to hear us. Then I also ask you, my esteemed Lord and teacher, to fulfill what you promised, and among other things you would write, I would like you to also rely on two or three arguments about the education of children, especially how they should take care of educating boys and young men in the study of good literature, for unless this care is taken by them, this religion cannot last long. Nevertheless, I leave this task of persuading them to you. Furthermore, you know, most humane man, that I lack your works and those of Lord Pellikan, along with the Bibles that were recently published by you, so I ask you to assist me in this matter, so that I may obtain these and your works and those of Lord Pellikan at the next Frankfurt fair, for Lord Christoph Froschauer will easily be persuaded when you vouch for me for the time of the year, for as soon as (God willing) I return home, I will in good faith pay everything, I will indeed make every effort to send this money to him either by my own messenger or otherwise by a certain and faithful courier. There is no reason for that good man to doubt my faith. If it should happen that the Turk occupies the paternal land (which God may avert), so that I cannot act among my own or even come, having sold all my books and other things, I will come to you as soon as possible, there to perform some office at least to sustain my body. Farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>Given at Wittenberg, June 14, 1543.</p>
      <p>I ask you to convey many greetings to Lord Konrad Pellikan along with his most honorable wife. Then to Lord Theodor Bibliander along with the other Lords and brothers in Christ Jesus. Martin Hentius Transsylvanus, most devoted to you in all things.</p>
      <p>Excuse me to Lord Konrad Pellikan and Lord Bibliander for not having sent them any letters, for the courier was in such a hurry that I could scarcely write to you.</p>
