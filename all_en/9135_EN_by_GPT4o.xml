      <p>Honorable, well-learned, especially dear sir and brother, my willing service and all good things beforehand.</p>
      <p>This week, a messenger from the dispersed Gallic churches or the poor Christians, who have escaped from the severe persecution in France, leaving everything behind, and are poor and destitute, has appeared here with his credentials. Some have been received in Geneva, some in Bern, and he has petitioned for assistance in their great need and poverty. We presented this to our gracious lords last Wednesday, who gave us a friendly, good response. The city and land of Bern have contributed over 1000 crowns, and I am therefore compelled to appeal to you as well. Therefore, I am now writing to you and Dr. Campell as the prominent servants and ask, on behalf of the poor people, that you also do your best with the capable, wealthy people, urging them to extend their rich and generous assistance in this need. We ask this not only in my name but in the name of all other servants, my fellow brothers, that you do your best for God's sake. If you then collect something together and cannot manage it yourselves and send it to me, I will arrange for it to be distributed by Mr. Treasurer Manuel in Bern.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God and send greetings to the honorable mayor, Mr. Carolus, Mr. Pontisella, especially Dr. Campell, Bonet, and others, etc.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, December 19, 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Heinrich Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear sir and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
