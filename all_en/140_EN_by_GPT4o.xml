      <p> Greetings. In reference to my previous letter, I inform you that all the cities, especially those that have accepted the Gospel, are coming together in Augsburg on June 4th to give a response to the Roman Imperial Majesty regarding the Interim. May the Lord grant His grace. Duke Maurice has departed with all his forces that he had in Augsburg, as has Margrave Hans of Brandenburg. There is a terrible outcry, which the pen cannot bear to write; I wish I had other means to inform you of this. Be true to one another, and if anyone outside your country gives you good words, do not trust them. For my part, may God grant that it is pure. Treachery is the best among us. </p>
      <p> We are trusted by a large foreign people. Where it will ultimately lead, you must consider well. Once again, trust no one. I know why. Let my words hold some weight with you. The Lord can still set everything right for His honor... for we Christians should have enough. What I have written before, you should consider in Christian love and not abandon me. Meanwhile, I will do for you and yours in the Lord what is dear to you and your church in the Lord. Pray to God for me; for I am very troubled. </p>
      <p> Given, you know well where, on the last day of May in the year 1548. Your old friend, whom you know from the signature. </p>
      <p> To the pious and faithful servant of Christ at the church in Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and old friend, to his hands. </p>
