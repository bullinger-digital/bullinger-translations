      <p>Greetings. Three days before our Herter arrived here, most illustrious and excellent man, I received letters in Zurich from a certain Italian, which indicated that by the grace of God you are recovering day by day.</p>
      <p>Indeed, no news could have been more pleasing or desirable to me; for I was so troubled in spirit and consumed with grief, since the rumor of your death had spread here, that even though some were saying for several days that you were out of danger, I could hardly find peace. But the happy arrival of our Joachim completely cheered me up, indeed it truly blessed me, when he informed me about your health. Therefore, we give immortal thanks to the most good God from the heart, that He has still preserved you alive for us, whom we thought had departed from this life, and that He has not yet deprived us of you as a parent and, having mercy on us all, has prolonged your days; for He knows what is best for His own.</p>
      <p>Now, He did not want us, already bereaved of that other excellent parent, the late Johannes Calvin, who was most dear to you, to be overwhelmed with grief, if He were to add sorrow to the bitterness of pain; thus, a most merciful father is accustomed to indulge his children, so that if he chastises them with one hand, he supports them with the other. Therefore, we can never sufficiently commend His mercy nor celebrate His praises, who daily heaps so many benefits upon us. Moreover, we all congratulate you and pray to God through Jesus Christ the Son, that we may soon hear that you have fully recovered and been restored to complete health. Meanwhile, all of yours who are here respectfully greet you and wish for your safety with utmost prayers, especially all our ministers, the Marquis of Vico, and Budaeus, your brother.</p>
      <p>May the Lord always be with you, sustain you with the strength of His spirit, and strengthen you, so that you may be able to benefit His church for a long time.</p>
      <p>Since nothing new is reported here, I will not add anything, and if there is anything worth knowing, you will receive it from Beza.</p>
      <p>Geneva, October 16, 1564.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, with my utmost respect. In Zurich.</p>
