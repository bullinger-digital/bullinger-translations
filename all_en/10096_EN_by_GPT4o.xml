      <p>Bartholom√§us Westheimer sends his greetings to his dear Heinrich Bullinger. Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your brief letter written to me. The exile of you and your father, the excellent old man, has greatly tormented my spirit. However, my spirit, when I was a guest with you, predicted nothing else about Bremgarten but such betrayals to come. To whom or to what these should be attributed is not for this place or time. Our senate is growing colder by the day. They have abolished certain lectures. You would see the deplorable state of all things. What can I say? I sincerely wish to be dissolved and to be with the heavenly ones. Regarding the money I owe, I promise in good faith that I will repay it shortly, as I hope, and free you from it. You would see Westheimer sincerely favoring you and yours, poorer than any Homeric beggar. For the relatives of my wife do not keep faith with me. I have summoned Balthasar Hiltprand to court. This tragedy (if I may write so) will have to be served for several days. However, once it is finished, I have decided to visit Zurich.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Written in great haste in Basel, on the 21st day of February.</p>
      <p>In my name, send many greetings to your parents and brother, and finally, more than a thousand times in my name, greet your dear little wife, truly the darling of your heart. May the best and greatest keep you and yours and the church of Christ safe for a long time. Forgive the hurried phrasing.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the church of Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
