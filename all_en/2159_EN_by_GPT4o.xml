      <p>Three days ago, I received your letter dated December 28th, most illustrious Bullinger, to which I will respond in order. First, I completely relieve you of the care, anxiety, and trouble you have taken upon yourself in receiving and sending my letters, and it is indeed not fitting for such a man as you to be occupied with such humble duties; in fact, I ask for forgiveness for having been a burden to you in this regard for so long. At least I ask this: since I cannot immediately inform the brothers in Italy to stop sending my letters to you, if any are still sent in the meantime, please forward them to Laurentius of Cremona; for I have written to him to take on this task, and when he receives letters from you, he will ensure they are sent to me. Therefore, you will have no other concern in this matter than to forward the letters you receive from me or elsewhere to him. But listen to this: I am now writing to Bassa Fontaneum that I have indeed received his letters, but since they were of considerable importance, I was alarmed and absolutely do not want him to write to me about such matters in the future, nor do I wish to write to him. It is enough for him if, wherever I can, I will support him, and if I see a great and arduous task, I will also write and send my own messenger; but I refuse to write daily and about trivial or even moderate matters, and I am now writing the same to Baionensem. I ask you to at least take care of these two letters to them, and thereafter I am free. I know what I am doing; I will abstain in the future and also for this reason, because if letters are sent by others than you, they could easily be lost. I have said enough; this is how I have decided to act.</p>
      <p>When the people of Strasbourg saw that Martyr was being called by me, they offered him a position; thus he will remain with them, as he writes to me. I have tasked several people to inquire whether the person you wrote about twice is alive or not, and I will add at the end what has been reported to me. I gave your letters to Charles de Moulins; I think he will reply. I ordered an inquiry about the letters I sent to Tuttlingen. I wrote to you why I could not go to Augsburg, and when I found a reliable messenger going to Lindau, I sent letters to Matthew Roth, the minister of that church, to ensure they reach you. He is a good man; he will not fail if he encounters a messenger. The brothers in Augsburg urge me to go to them; they hope for some benefit from me, however small. They write that on the eve of Christmas, a huge bundle of new Italian pamphlets was brought there and the next day they were all sold out; so many understand my language and are also fervent. They add that there will be no danger for me there because I am under the protection of this duke.</p>
      <p>Now to public matters. The Roman King writes that he will come to the diet; it is rumored everywhere that it will convene; the people of Augsburg deny it, presumably because they do not want it to be held there. But I believe it will happen; but I will add a few words about this at the end. For tomorrow I will have a conversation with a friend who usually knows such things. The Emperor knows that there is a suspicion among everyone that he wants more power, so he tries to extinguish it with words. The Pope seems convinced to the point that he has begun to favor him more than ever. The Venetians cannot easily believe it, even though the Emperor's envoy recently dealt with them extensively. We know they are very anxious; for they clearly believe that the marriage of England and the Emperor will bring that most wealthy kingdom under his control. Indeed, if they trusted the German princes to be more steadfast than they were when they recently waged war against the Emperor, I know they would not refuse to enter into an alliance for common defense. But they fear they might be abandoned as prey to Charles. You can be certain that Germany is afraid and yet nothing is being done about it so far.</p>
      <p>If only we could now see the Swiss Confederates allied with these princes, with the Venetians, with the Duke of Ferrara, while the Emperor is still alive. Otherwise, it is certainly to be feared that English gold will elevate him even further, and I think it is more to be feared from corruption and bribery than from soldiers; for with what other means than these did he arrange the marriage?</p>
      <p>Among other things, we hear that the Emperor has promised the Pope his efforts to convene and execute a council; for there is a decree from the Augsburg diet that those disobedient to the council should be suppressed by public arms. The Emperor will seize this pretext to wage war in Germany. But I say again, I do not fear war as much as gifts; I fear that he may corrupt and defile everything with them, especially since few appear steadfast. The Duke has ordered prayers in his churches to ask against impending storms, and he is holding a diet of the entire duchy on important matters. If your Swiss perhaps think of entering into a new alliance, we would use this duke, who would act with others by his authority. We must certainly pray to God not to abandon us in such great dangers. Our adversary has never been more powerful or more cruel; he overthrew Germany with less power, what will he do now?</p>
      <p>The Duke of Bavaria has gathered the envoys of all his cities and asked for a huge sum; the response was that the subjects are ready to give whatever the duke wants, if only he will allow them to have the gospel openly. This is true; therefore, there is reason to rejoice that the Lord has so many of his own there. But, although the prince has denied it, it does not matter; he will soon be forced to consent, whether he wants to or not, when the number has grown even more.</p>
      <p>This torments me, Heinrich Bullinger; for few have this divine cause at heart, oh how few, oh how sluggish we are. The children of darkness completely surpass us in diligence; woe to us. But now I will end. Farewell and be well with your whole family, school, and church. May the Lord Jesus bless your holy labors. Amen. TÃ¼bingen, January 13, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>I have found good men who know that Blessed one; they said this prince kept horses for him and soon went to war and there is a rumor that he is dead, and one of my friends promised to ensure that I will know for certain within a few days; for he will write to someone who was with him in the war. When I find out, I will write to you. The diet is cooling; I do not know what has happened that they have again called it into question; so those who usually know such things assure me.</p>
      <p>I want to briefly reveal to you the source from which many evils can be expected in Germany; it is this: almost all the princes and cities have decided to bear, tolerate, and endure inconveniences and servitude as long as Charles lives, because they hope for better things after his death; but he, who knows this well, seizes the opportunity and spares nothing and will not spare in the future. He will think and work on appointing his son as his successor and will hope they will not restore him.</p>
      <p>The only remedy for this evil would be to remove the fear of the princes and cities, and there is only one way to remove it, that is if there are good and strong alliances between you and these and the Venetians and others. Unless these are made, I predict many evils; I wish I were a false prophet. Farewell again and be well again, most excellent Bullinger, my brother. January 14, 1554.</p>
      <p>The same. Charles de Moulins writes to you. The Duke has sent his own man to France to commend his affairs to the king, and now two other imperial princes are commending their letters to his majesty; these letters are included in the bundle that pertains to Bassafontaneo.</p>
      <p>I commend him all the more to your piety. Moulins is now using my hospitality until he finds his own.</p>
      <p>To you, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
