      <p>Your, my Bullinger, is my authority to write now; for he has announced about the messenger and has urged me to write very dutifully. I am well by the grace of God, although I am in great labors and do not have my comforts here, which I am accustomed to elsewhere.</p>
      <p>In these 40 days, I have been able to complete many things here and begin others, all of which you will see. I had almost decided to stay here until Christmas; but I am recalled to the duchy and am forced to go, even if the plague rages everywhere. If only I had your spirit at least in this matter and did not fear it! If anyone seeks me, they will be informed of my return to Tübingen, although I will not be there for long. Let him come there, who wants to see me; for at least he will find my people. Again, there is a rumor of future assemblies, and I think they will finally happen. But another rumor brings not a very happy message: that persecution is growing in England and that Philip is attempting an alliance with some princes and bishops of Germany. May God destroy their plans!</p>
      <p>The money sent here by our duke is still n... If I do not come there myself this winter, I will undoubtedly send one of my people, who will handle some matters there, and indeed I will send him soon or I will come myself soon. Greet the noblemen and all the brothers. I would like you to share this letter with Mr. Laelius, to whom I send my warmest regards. Strasbourg, November 14.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, my most honored brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>I beg you, send the brief catalog of heretics, in which you were of course omitted, and also send your letter, which you wrote to me about it.</p>
