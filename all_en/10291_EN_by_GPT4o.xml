      <p>Our friendly greetings and all the best beforehand.</p>
      <p>Honorable, well-learned, especially dear and good friend. A small book has come to us at this autumn fair under your name, written about the history of the holy apostles, and dedicated and attributed to us and our community through a letter of dedication, printed at the beginning of the book, delivered by the honorable Christoph Froschauer, the book printer, and especially recommended and commended by our preachers. We have received this willingly and accepted it with friendly thanks from you. And we hereby send you, not as a comparison (compensation) of the value, nor as any reward (compensation) for your diligence and effort therein, but solely as a small indication of our grateful will, a modest gift; which you will kindly accept from us. We will not forget to earn all this in a friendly manner when the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>Dated Friday after the Exaltation of the Cross in the year etc. 33.</p>
      <p>From us, the council of Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>To the honorable well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, our especially dear and good friend.</p>
