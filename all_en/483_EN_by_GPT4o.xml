      <p>My humble and willing service is ready for you, especially gracious, wise, dear sir. You should know that I was with you along with Gwalter in your residence, also with my cousin, and informed you about my dealings concerning the abbess, and consulted with you and Gwalter on how to proceed with the matter.</p>
      <p>Now, what the advice was, is still well known to your wisdom, so there is no need to write about it. Furthermore, it has come to my attention through some good patrons and other people that some useless people are saying that I claim you sent me to Zell, which is not true. Therefore, my entire humble request and desire to your wisdom is that you would tell those who might write or report such things to you that whoever spreads such talk does me violence and injustice. It will not be found true in any way. As for the possible reason why some useless people attribute this to me, I cannot think of any other cause than that they might want to make a wager, so that your wisdom would harbor hatred and aversion towards me; but I am of good hope that your wisdom will not give credence to such people, and I also humbly ask that your wisdom will take this letter from me in the best possible way and also defend me against those who attribute such things to me.</p>
      <p>For the matter is not so. Nothing more, except may God grant you His grace, peace, and unity, as well as strength and power, so that you may thus preserve your flock in your teaching.</p>
      <p>Dated Saturday after Laetare, in the year 1549. Your humble and obedient servant, Thomas Leimer.</p>
