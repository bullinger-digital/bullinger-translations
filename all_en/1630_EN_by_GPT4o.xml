      <p>Georg Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard).</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you, dear friend. After you informed us in your previous letter how the driver, who transported the wine we graciously gifted you to Zurich, was given not only his agreed wage but also a crown as a reward (although he was not authorized by us to demand such a reward), etc., we have been informed by his master, the innkeeper at the Rappen here, that such a reward remains unpaid.</p>
      <p>Therefore, our gracious request to you is that you inform us of this matter (and whether the person who delivered and transported the wine is satisfied with the reward or how the situation stands) and let us know at your earliest convenience, so that we can better address the innkeeper who has approached us about this.</p>
      <p>The books you requested, we are sending to you herewith, and we have no other news to write to you about, except that the King of France has approached Strasbourg. We did not want to withhold this gracious information from you in haste. Dated Schaffhausen, the 4th of May, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Due to urgency, we have not been able to write more in response to your letter this time, as we have been writing all night and all day, and are now very tired of writing.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg, etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
