      <p>S. Tell Musculus that I will diligently take care of my wife's health. She is still troubled by feverish paroxysms, but there is hope that she will be better soon. I would greatly wish to have a man born for letters, who could be put into some small place, which he could handle, and which could be built in due time. However, it is not the case that anyone should suspect him of having a different opinion about Christ's presence in the supper than the people of Zurich and Bern; for he knows that nothing else can be proven from the Scriptures and persuaded to the truly pious. Furthermore, he is not a Swabian, but a Lotharingian, and it is well known how well the Swiss have always deserved from the Lotharingians, with Charles, the most arrogant tyrant there, who was the maternal great-grandfather of our Emperor Charles, having been slain and defeated, so that he himself should be grateful to the Swiss for this reason, and they, in turn, should be more kindly disposed towards him than towards any Swabian. Yesterday we received certain news about Frecht and the captive brothers, that they are indeed being held at Kirch, which is near Egg, by German soldiers, but they are allowed to act freely in their own conduct, and they have never been burdened with chains or bonds, not even on the journey when they were led by the Spaniards, but (which you may wonder at) they were treated very humanely. They were first detained in the castle of that town, then, with some Spaniards following the Emperor and others flying to Italy, they were led to certain not unpleasant houses in the town, with servants added, by whom they are said to be treated most humanely. It is believed, however, that they will soon be released. For the fury of the Interimists is somewhat subsiding, and it is certainly reported that the Augsburg council has forbidden the priests to show themselves in the market or streets or to wander idly; if nothing happens to the parents, they will not investigate the cause itself.</p>
      <p>The people of Ulm have also proclaimed a meeting for the parish priests, to discuss something about preaching the gospel; what this is, we will soon understand.</p>
      <p>Prudent men, not alien to the Emperor's court affairs, consider it certain and undoubted that the Emperor is the highest and most deadly enemy of the Pope, if either he himself or another, succeeding him after his death (for they say he is on the verge of death), will support the French king's side, etc.</p>
      <p>As for our [Greek] and other shaved ones, we certainly know of perpetual factions among themselves and the recently elected bishop of Constance. Our abbot is supposed to come personally to the bishop in a few days, and to both of them, the abbot Gergwig Blarer of Weingarten. It would be of great necessity (but I entrust this to you in good faith) to ask these appointed fellows once, what they have so necessary to accomplish with their sending and wandering back and forth in these worrying and suspicious times? As God lives, they do nothing to advance our holy religion. But it is always allowed to go on, and everything is suspicious, what Doctor von Watt writes; for the people of St. Gallen are bad abbots, etc. But God willing, it concerns us in St. Gallen alone and not also Zurich and Bern and other Christian cities, which are much more important than us poor quarrelsome people, and wherever possible, it will be kindled at the heads rather than at the feet. They alone do not act in this matter, and they consider that malicious belly of Kreuzlingen, who has so far, as it is said, devised not a few things, to be very malignant.</p>
      <p>The people of Constance have on the 12th of this month arrogantly abandoned all things of the confederation and shifted over to the imperial side, hoping to retain what they agreed upon in the conditions that were last proposed by the imperial majesty and to which they have submitted. However, the fishermen have insisted fiercely, as they have never liked to see the bishop outside the city. Yet many have lamented that the day in Baden has been stretched so long after the arrival of the messenger. Much has been disputed about it. May God protect us from wars. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 19th September, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most famous city of Zurich, [lord and] singular friend.</p>
