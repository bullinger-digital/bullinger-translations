      <p>Greetings. Although friendship does not consist solely in the exchange of letters, I know that it is greatly cherished and delighted in through letters and mutual conversation. Therefore, it is all the more grievous to me that the three letters I wrote to you since the departure of our son have been intercepted or lost. However, I am fully convinced that I am loved by you, and I do not doubt your most willing disposition towards me, which you can always experience. I thank you, as I have before, for your gift, which I have not yet received due to the negligence of the couriers. Master Gwalther will ensure that the package is finally sent. It was distressing to hear of the death of your daughters; but you are well-equipped against such trials, knowing who has reclaimed the deposit, and that we must bear whatever burden is placed upon us while we sojourn in this desert, awaiting better lodgings. You can learn more certain news about our affairs from Lyon than I can write. My wife sends you many greetings. Please convey my greetings to the most honorable council and all friends. Farewell. Paris, January 27, 1568.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
