    <p xml:id="regest1">Widenhuber heard some time ago from his "godfather" Johannes Fries that Christoph Froschauer is diligently working on Johannes Stumpf's "[Swiss] Chronicle." The friend [Melchior Gügi] has designed an excellent picture of the city [St. Gallen] and would like to come to Zurich in two or three weeks to explain some otherwise unknown details to the woodcutter [Heinrich Vogtherr the Elder], so that everything is well worked out. Widenhuber will accompany [Gügi]. - Additionally, [Joachim] Vadian also has some useful [material] for the "Chronicle" about the city of St. Gallen and Thurgau, which he wants to arrange in good order by hand. In the three years [from June 1529 to February 1532], during which the abbot [Kilian Germann] and the monks were expelled from St. Gallen, Vadian thoroughly explored the monastery and the library, so that he now knows them better than the monks do; they will be surprised by this! Some prominent citizens are also interested, so it would be a shame if Vadian took his knowledge to the grave. - Since Vadian is overloaded with business and, as a former mayor, has to attend the council daily, he now wants to use a ruse and apply for leave for an alleged spa treatment at his house [Wienachtshalden on Tonisberg, northwest of St. Gallen], but in truth work on [the manuscript about St. Gallen and Thurgau], although he was annoyed by Froschauer's reminder. He wants to be finished by August. - Widenhuber asks Bullinger to seek a postponement from Froschauer. In the enclosed letter [not received], Widenhuber also addressed his request to [Froschauer]. Since Vadian keeps his plan, [to write about the abbey and the city of St. Gallen], secret, Bullinger and Froschauer should also remain silent about it; for if the abbot [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee] and the monks found out, they would immediately want to know what is being written about their monastery, and perhaps even question the Zurich authorities about it. - Bullinger should not take his writing amiss. Widenhuber wishes Bullinger would come to him once, so that he could repay Bullinger for the benefits he has received from him.</p>

      <p>My friendly, willing service beforehand. Especially gracious, dear Sir. I understand that Master Christoph Froschauer is diligently working on the work, namely the Chronicle of Mr. Johannes Stumpf, as I understood from my godfather, Master Johannes Fries, some time ago, etc. Now I have a good companion who has diligently painted or portrayed my lord's city here; he intends to go to Zurich himself, as he would like to show the woodcutter this piece (which is otherwise not very well known), so that everything is done diligently. I will also come with him myself, as he has now been waiting for me for some time. This will happen now (God willing) in 14 days or 3 weeks, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, my Lord Vadian also has some chapters before him, which will serve very well in this work or Chronicle, namely about the city of St. Gallen and the region of Thurgau, very lovely, amusing, and useful to read. He wants to arrange this in good order with his own hand, as he has experienced and seen these things with good leisure, and in the three years when the abbot and the monks were expelled here, he went through the monastery and the library in all corners, so that he knows more about their things than they themselves. You will be amazed at this. Some prominent citizens (who are favorable to the truth) also have a special desire for it, as it will certainly be beneficial and good for the true, Christian faith. Therefore, it would be a shame if he took this knowledge to the grave with him.</p>
      <p>And there is no lack in this place, as he is so burdened with many tasks; although he is not in office now, he is still the former mayor, so he must also be in the council daily. However, as he has shown me, he now wants to use a ruse and take leave from my lords for a trip to Baden in his house; yet he does not want to bathe, only to further and write this work, although he is somewhat unwilling, as Master Christoph has urged him and does not like delay, etc. However, he wants to pursue it in such a way that it should be finished by the coming August, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, gracious, dear Sir (who can do much with Master Christoph), my friendly request is that you would kindly ask and arrange with him that he does not press him too much, so that this useful work does not remain unfinished and may have a little delay. In this enclosed letter, I have also asked him myself, etc. For my Lord Vadian keeps these things quiet, so that few people here know about it. Therefore, my request to you and Master Christoph: Please also let it remain with you, as the abbot and his monks are idle, as soon as they become aware of it, they will immediately want to know what is being written about their monastery, before it goes to print, they might well inquire with my lords in Zurich about it; therefore, it is good to remain silent. I think well, it will not be as pleasing to the abbot that it comes to light. However, only the truth will be shown with discretion and no one will be harmed, etc. Now, for the time being, nothing more, gracious, dear Sir, then please do not take my writing amiss. Offer myself as a small servant, where I could serve you or yours, I would be very willing. Herewith commended to God, the Lord, along with your household. I would gladly suffer if you came to us here once, so that I could also earn a little the good you have shown me, etc. Dated in St. Gallen, May 14, Anno 1545.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Hans Widenhuber.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, Preacher of the city of Zurich, my gracious lord. 1545.</p>
