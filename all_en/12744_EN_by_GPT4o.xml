    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] To ensure Blarer has no doubts about the messenger [...] whose services he has used, Bullinger informs him that he has received well the letters written by him at [Castle] Griesenberg [No. 2655, No. 2676, and No. 2679]. However, Bullinger does not know if his letters have arrived. He had entrusted his last letter [not received] to the servant [...] traveling through Constance from Hans Wyss and asked Blarer to show him the safest way to Augsburg. But Blarer was [still] in Griesenberg at that time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] [Johannes] von Ulm and his fellow student [Augustin...] prove to be diligent. They are offered books for purchase by [Johannes] Fries. In total, there are 56 volumes (26 folio volumes fully bound in leather, 7 quarto, and 23 octavo volumes), costing a total of 23 florins. For the folio volumes, 10 batzen each are demanded; for the quarto volumes, 4 or 5 each, and for the octavo volumes, 3 each.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Among them are: [Konrad] Pellikan's publications on the Bible; Zwingli's writings on the New Testament and the prophets, as well as other treatises by him; the works of Hieronymus, Ambrosius, Cyprian, and Basilius [the Great]; the first editions of the works of Cyrill and Chrysostomus; the "Annotationes" on the New Testament by Erasmus and some of his "Paraphrases"; the works of Bernard [of Clairvaux]; the dictionary "Cornucopiae" and the "Calepinus"; some writings by Luther and Melanchthon; several publications from Bullinger's pen, and much more that cannot be listed here. Bullinger has convinced the young men to buy these works.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] However, he wants to obtain Blarer's approval first. He should hurry, as Fries needs money. If the books fall into the hands of a bookseller, they would certainly cost more than 60 florins. Blarer should arrange for the sending of the money. Von Ulm should acquire the collection and make it available to his companion, especially since they live together. The books were formerly the property of the deceased Werner Steiner.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Enclosed is the [“Historia vera de morte Diazii”] intended for Blarer by Francisco de Enzinas. Bullinger includes a copy of the letter addressed to him [No. 2647] from [Theobald] Thamer and his [copy] of the response to it [No. 2675] and requests the return of the documents. Thamer is the field preacher of Landgrave [Philip of Hesse].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] What is happening in the [Schmalkaldic] camp? Where are Emperor [Charles V] and [Elector Johann Friedrich] of Saxony? What is [Duke] Maurice doing in Saxony? What is happening in Augsburg? Are King [Christian III] of Denmark and [Elector Frederick II] of the Palatinate still alive? Blarer should answer these questions to make up for his long and burdensome silence!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] It is all the better that God has taken Blarer's brother-in-law [Heinrich von Ulm] (certainly the only sincere nobleman in Thurgau) from this wicked world, so he does not have to see what Bullinger and Blarer fear!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I have received your letters, most esteemed brother in the Lord, written at Griesenberg, and I assure you, do not doubt the fidelity of the messenger. I am surprised whether you have received all of mine. I sent the last ones through the servant of Johannes Albinus, who was traveling through Constance to Augsburg, and there was nothing in them except to advise you on the safest way to travel. But you were still in Griesenberg at that time, etc.</p>

      <p>Your young men, certainly two excellent youths, are diligent in their duties. They are offered books for purchase by Fries for 23 florins of our currency. I strongly advise them to buy them: if one lacks the means, the other should buy them, from Ulm; and for that money, they are hardly so well bound. The larger ones, in folio, beautifully bound in boards and entirely covered in leather, are 26; the medium ones are 7; and in small format, that is 8 leaves from a full folio, 23. In total, there are 56 volumes. He will give the larger ones for 10 batzen each; the smaller ones for 3; the medium ones for 5 or 4. In total, they all amount to 23 florins.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>They include: the works of Pellikan on the Bible; the works of Zwingli on the New Testament and the prophets and other works by him; the works of Hieronymus; the works of Ambrosius; the works of Cyprian; the works of Basilius; the first edition of Cyrill; the first edition of Chrysostomus; the Annotations of Erasmus on the New Testament; some of his Paraphrases; the works of Bernard; Cornucopiae; Calepinus; some works of Luther and Melanchthon; many of Bullinger's works; and many others, which would be too long to list here. I have advised them to buy them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>However, I did not want them to do anything without consulting you. Fries certainly needs money. If you agree, let me know, so that others do not snatch this treasure of books from them. Afterwards, they will buy those books from booksellers for no less than 60 florins, I am sure. Therefore, if you could raise the money, it would be good. I would buy them from Ulm. He could lend them to the other while they are together. The books belonged to the late Werner Steiner, of blessed memory, etc.</p>

      <p>What Francisco de Enzinas, the Spaniard, wrote and gave to you, you have here. I have added a copy of the letter from Thamer, the preacher of the Landgrave of Hesse, written to me in the camp, and my response. After you have read them, I ask you to return them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>What is happening now in the camp? Where is the Emperor, where is the Saxon, where is the Hessian? What is happening in Saxony by Maurice? What is happening in Augsburg? Has the King of Denmark and the Elector Palatine passed away? I offer you material to write about, to make up for your most burdensome silence to me!</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell together with all yours. In Zurich, on the very day of Andrew, in the year 1546. Your Bullinger.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I rejoice from the heart that your brother-in-law, then among the nobles alone (in my judgment) in Thurgau sincere, has passed away. The Lord has taken him from unspeakable evils, so that his eyes do not see what I fear we will see. May the Lord be gracious to us!</p>
      <p>To Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, the most faithful minister of the church of Constance, his always esteemed lord and brother. Constance.</p>
