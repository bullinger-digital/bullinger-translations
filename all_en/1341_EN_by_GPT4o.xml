      <p>From Konstanz: Several old mercenaries have come here to the city, coming from Duke Moritz's camp near Magdeburg; they have been there the entire past winter and until now, saying that recently a large departure from the city has occurred, and that those in the city have set up a camp in front of the city, causing the enemy great damage, which is why the soldiers are very unwilling, and those who were there in the winter are now dying rapidly, becoming sick with camp fever and otherwise, as these mercenaries themselves also look very ill. They also say that before they would fight again in such a manner, they would rather have their heads cut off. They have been with Captain Eckle, do not hold back their words, and when warned, they say they must speak the truth. One among them also said that they are all full of devils in the city, or God has miraculously intervened with them.</p>
      <p>Onophorus Heuruß recently: "I write to you certain, true news, although people did not want to believe it before, that the Roman King has taken the land of Transylvania without any sword strike, in homage and at the invocation of the monk.</p>
      <p>My dear brother-in-law Peter Scher recently, who sends you many, many services, greetings, and all good wishes, and commends himself to you in faithful intercession.</p>
      <p>"It was written to me 6 weeks ago by some prominent councilors that the reconciliation between the Roman King and the Duke of Württemberg was on amicable, good terms. But since then, other rumors have come, and nothing more is heard about it; for the king is said to have achieved some new fortune."</p>
      <p>The Imperial Majesty is said to have first established a new lodging in Augsburg near St. Ulrich; it is expected that he will remain there longer because of Parma and Magdeburg, whatever may come of it. I am waiting for letters from Augsburg; but in the last letter, there was no assurance of any movement, although according to your news, the couriers are said to have arrived in Speyer.</p>
      <p>On July 10th, someone was in Balingen, requesting to arrange 40 or 50 horsemen, wanting to raid in the Hegau against the soldiers who are running into France, and since Duke Christoph has promised many soldiers for the defense of the court, the mentioned person has gone to Stuttgart to see if he could get some horsemen. Writes my brother-in-law Peter Scher.</p>
      <p>I received your letters, the variety of which delighted me greatly. Now, in turn, after the seventh hour past noon, which I received, I thought to write to you, as I happened to come across those who are going there. Take it in good and fair measure. I can add nothing to them. Pray for me and the Church of Christ, that in the remaining days of our lives we may see the good of Jerusalem, the city of God. July 14th after dinner in Wülflingen.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
