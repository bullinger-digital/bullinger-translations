Because Ulrich [Zingg] has been removed from his office in Dürnten by the council, the pastors [of the Wetzikon chapter] request the intercession [of Bullinger, Jud, and Megander] so that the church community can be properly provided with a pastor again.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, I hereby send you the chronicle of the late Hans Füßli; please return it to Peter (from whom I borrowed it) without delay. Since brother Ulrich from Dürnten has been removed from his position by our gracious lords and is also not suitable for preaching due to his lack of speech, and because the parish has been inadequately provided for a year and a day, the common brothers (moved by the murmuring and displeasure of the community and otherwise) have taken the cause to write to you and our fathers in common (for more emphasis and consideration), so that the sentence may be executed and the parish properly provided for, as it is located at the border, tainted by Anabaptists, and populated with stubborn and quarrelsome people. In this matter, please do your best, as you can well understand everything from the writing of the brothers (done by me according to their command). Herewith, I commend you and your household to the Lord, and I remain always at your service as your slave and subject.</p>
      <p>Given at Bubikon, August 12, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Stumpf.</p>
      <p>To the pious and faithful M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the gospel in Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
