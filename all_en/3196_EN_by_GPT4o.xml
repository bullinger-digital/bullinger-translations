      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I received from Mr. Vergerio something like what you write, dearest compater in the Lord, but somewhat obscure, regarding the union of Poland with the Protestants. He also recited some things about Mr. a Lasco, but he did not indicate that he wanted to disturb his plans, except that he thinks it unwise if such tender beginnings are immediately thrown into difficulty through the article of the Lord's Supper. He came here during dinner on the 22nd of this month, and left the next morning.</p>
      <p>When I was called to him, I had not yet received your letters. If he returns to us, I will do as you advise.</p>
      <p>The people of Geneva have again unsuccessfully attempted to form an alliance with ours. I fear that this matter may someday bring about some evil. As for the other matters concerning us, you can learn from Mr. Wolf.</p>
      <p>Haller, our dearest brother. Farewell excellently. All of mine greet you and yours, especially our little Heinrich. Greet in my name the lords and brothers there, Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gualther, Mr. Frys, and the others. Bern, 1557, May 24.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and compater. Zurich.</p>
