      <p>Greetings. If you are well, most esteemed lord and compater, it is good; we also are all well by the grace of the most good and great Lord. May the Lord grant that henceforth we may also always be well together with you! We give you great thanks for those new things sent to us, which serve us so far, that we may give thanks to the Lord for the success of the pious and help to avert the dangers and schemes of the impious that threaten from all sides, which we do and will do by the grace of the Lord. We hear of the betrothal of your son Johannes Rudolf, to whom we all, together with you, wish and pray for all good things, and hope that he may have such a companion in life as any good and wise man might wish for himself. As for the 20 florins, you will have them ready, and there is no need for you to ask or command for them; either my mother-in-law or our Wilhelm, the new treasurer, will count them out and give them to him. As you write that perhaps some of ours might visit us, let it be as you see fit; however, we would prefer that they spare their expenses and efforts, although they would be most dear and welcome to us.</p>
      <p>These things hastily poured out, most esteemed lord and compater, now, I ask, consider kindly; for as you see, my hands refuse their duty, which are now alone sufficiently afflicted in me; all other things by the grace of the Lord are as well as can be with me and mine. We ask you to deign to convey the greetings of all of us to your most honorable matron and family, along with your sons-in-law and daughters, and also to Lord Gwalther and Wolf, beloved and honorable brothers. Farewell in the Lord most happily.</p>
      <p>At the Baths of the Swiss, July 22, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most reverent and observant Wolfgang Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and compater. In Zürich.</p>
