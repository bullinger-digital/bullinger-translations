      <p>Greetings. Recently, I showed your reverence, most esteemed sir, the reasons for the postponement of our current business. Since the celebration of Christ's birth is approaching and I will not be sufficient to endure so many labors further, and the means we intended to use were delayed, I entered the most honorable council on December 1st, when both the senior and junior members had gathered. I urged them to join me with a colleague (since the care of the church should also fall upon the magistrate, as in 1 Kings 2) who is faithful, peaceful, healthy, and steadfast; the present dangerous time requires this, in which it is least fitting for the sheep to be deprived of their certain shepherd; I briefly reiterated the absurdity of the opinion that no one should be compelled to do good, showing what kind of fruit would eventually arise from this. Soon after I had left, they called me back and asked whom I would recommend and advise. I replied: "Brunner has left Rhaetia, etc. In my judgment, there is no one else who would execute this office better than the unique Campell," and I testified this without private affections, even for the testimony of my conscience and my own salvation. What happened? Some thought it should be awaited until Gantner would amend himself at the general synod, where the controversy would be debated. The highest and new tribune, a man of integrity and eloquence, responded to them: "What? Shall we again debate and subject to new and doubtful questions the faith that our ancestors have long defended and obtained from the sacred scriptures? Was Gantner the only one found to have dispelled darkness in such great light? Far from it.</p>
      <p>Consider how useful and proper it will be for you if you call your religion into question with new debates, the profession of which our ancestors have followed with such danger and diligence!" Thus, I was instructed by him.</p>
      <p>From here, they ceased to bring anything further about Gantner; therefore, it pleased everyone to elect a new minister. When Gantner, if he himself were to fall, anxiously instilled in his supporters to choose Marius over Campell, the hated one from Engadin, knowing what kind of person Marius was, namely, an irregular one, for whose sake he often defamed him in front of everyone, so that if he were to be deposed again, he would have a return to that church and thus no peace would ever shine upon the afflicted church. And certainly, this persuasion had some weight with many; for the entire council was plainly divided over these two, and it was almost the case that Marius was elected beyond all expectation; so many are there who seek not the salvation, but the destruction of this church (which I say only to you). Marius had 13 on his side, while Campell had 15, from which the entire assembly consisted; thus, the white stone was for Mr. Campell, who will be summoned by the council's letters for Christ's nativity. Now, some are marvelously enraged that citizen Gantner has been so degraded, as I say, and unless Campell pleases all the rustics, he will be rejected. Indeed, some are nurturing monsters, by which means they might depose me, because I have not shown myself to be a traitor and a mute dog. But let them do what they can, if they find anything admitted and sinned by my fault worthy of dismissal.</p>
      <p>May the Lord God, the best and greatest, break the stubborn and fierce spirits of his enemies and graciously convert them by his spirit to the honor of his name. Amen. You have, most illustrious sir, a very happy outcome of this tragedy, except that men who love truth and peace little cannot rest and daily plot something new and wicked against those who favor just causes more than others, nor is there any doubt that Gantner will be a feigned member of our fellowship and will always be thinking of revenge wherever he can, especially since he has been forbidden the office of preaching even among the villagers.</p>
      <p>When he recently wanted to pursue this against the authority of the magistrate nonetheless in a village near the city, as he says he owes more to God than to the magistrate, he was again prohibited by the lord of Rhaetia. Thus, truly, an arrogant and deceitful heart digs a fraudulent pit for itself. What will follow later, if Mr. Campell enters the new priesthood, I will write another time; for he will fly to many as little pleasing and agreeable. These things to you as quickly as possible, most reverend sir, father, so that you may know what the matter is, etc. However, I have received nothing from you this week, which I write because I do not know if you have written and do not hope, since I have not yet received it, and therefore they would have been either intercepted or lost through carelessness. December 4, 1570. Chur.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Iconius.</p>
      <p>Both Mr. Consuls, Mr. Pontisella, and all good men send their greetings to your reverence. May Ernius be safe among the rest of yours.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned Mr. Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
