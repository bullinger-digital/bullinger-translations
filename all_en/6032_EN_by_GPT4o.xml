      <p>Greetings. Here you have the letter from Mr. Beza, which I was forced to retain longer than I wished, as I did not have a messenger through whom I could send it. Now, however, I am sending it through this one of yours, through whom I also received yours, for which I thank you.</p>
      <p>Today, the matter concerning Glarus is being discussed.</p>
      <p>All senators who were outside the city have been summoned; Steiger also returned yesterday, with whom I immediately discussed these matters; he promises every effort. The Saffoisch (Savoy) negotiation is postponed until March 6th, when one should come together for news, although it is believed that nothing will come of it; for it becomes more apparent over time that the Duke (although he does not want to have a word of it and cannot be placed) or at least some of his lawyers not only knew about the Geneva betrayal but also dealt with it, with which our citizenship is newly very dissatisfied, so much so that it is believed they will reject all further negotiations and, with God's help, want to keep what they can.</p>
      <p>For they fear that if they are brought into a legal agreement with the Duke through peace, they will never be able to regain their position. I always thought that their negotiation should be included in ours, so that a common peace concerning them and us would be made; so I understood that the Duke does not want to hear that he should let his claim to Geneva fall; so they do not want to hear that they should be forced to restore some jurisdiction to the Duke, but rather demand much more at their expense.</p>
      <p>My lords have seriously advised them to consider what might arise for them and us from this; therefore, they should do something.</p>
      <p>But they do not want to hear it.</p>
      <p>Then I thought, if the three cities, ZÃ¼rich, Basel, and Schaffhausen, would advise them and admonish them that they should not dare to avoid greater evil, to let go of some external matters, so that they might remain with the religion and other freedoms, my lords might perhaps tolerate it; but they cannot ask anyone for it, as it might be interpreted in any way, and especially since one must worry that our citizenship will now completely reject and refuse the peace. Then the effort would be in vain.</p>
      <p>I show you this with the best intention; always consider what should be done.</p>
      <p>Regarding recent news, as it stood in France, Beza will undoubtedly write to you. He also wrote something to me; besides, it is written to Mr. Mayor Steiger that the conclusion of the Council of Trent was accepted and signed by the Pope, the King of Spain, and the Duke of Savoy; it is also sent to the Emperor, where there is no doubt that he will also sign it.</p>
      <p>In France, it was proposed to the King; he did not want to do it, yet he was persuaded by the cunning of his mother, so that both he and the mother signed. The evangelical princes are very dissatisfied with this, and many of them intend to withdraw from the court.</p>
      <p>If this were the case, much evil would follow, but God wills to avert it. He instructed me to write this to you; otherwise, he knows nothing special at this time; he also sends you many greetings. Many others do the same.</p>
      <p>May all yours be well.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 7, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
