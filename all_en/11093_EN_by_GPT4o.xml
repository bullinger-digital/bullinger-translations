      <p>The grace of God through Christ be with you and all your household. Amen. You should also greet all of us most kindly, together with our son, etc.</p>
      <p>I have, dear friend, made a final agreement with you regarding my beloved daughter, as you well know. I think about it a lot, and if it is the will of God and for her salvation, it would be my joy. To give my wife an honorable marriage, as you know, would not be regretted. On this matter, although I know that you are diligent, if there is anything further to handle, to discuss, or whatever you encounter, please write to me along with your advice with this messenger, as you understand me; for many reasons urge me to do so, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding my son, etc., I will, as soon as possible, handle matters in Strasbourg; therefore, bear with me as you have so far.</p>
      <p>Also, as we hear, the matter in Bern has turned out well, as I told you and trusted. Therefore, everyone strives for unity. Capito, Bucer, and also from Bern, I hear, are with my gracious lord in Montbéliard, having ridden there from Bern. Thus, we wait for when they come down to us, etc.</p>
      <p>Do not forget my coat of arms.</p>
      <p>With this, greetings in greetings, from omnes et omnes, wife, mother, maiden, son, Leoni.</p>
      <p>Done in Riquewihr, the second day of October in the year 37.</p>
      <p>What news?</p>
      <p>Your willing Johann Vogler, citizen of Zurich, steward in Riquewihr.</p>
      <p>To my beloved [lord and friend], Master Heinrich [Bullinger], preacher in Zurich, to [his] hands.</p>
