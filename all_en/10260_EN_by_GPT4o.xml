    <p xml:id="regest1">The invitation extended to the people of St. Gallen for a meeting with Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen in Zürich was made with the best intentions and hope of reaching an agreement on matters of marriage law. They would like to have Vadian as the representative of St. Gallen present. The people of Zürich hope that the meeting will provide an opportunity for new friendly discussions between the cities. Bullinger wishes for the swift completion of Vadian's Epitome, for which he is providing him with the geographical sections from his ongoing commentary on the Acts of the Apostles.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>The invitation extended to my lords of St. Gallen was made with the best and most Christian intentions, along with those from Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, our fellow believers. It is now (only) proposed by good Christians (primarily at my instigation) for the good of us all, and it will therefore be very beneficially undertaken against the confessed truth but to confirm it. The articles that were written to you press us. We hope that God will grant us further unity, so that it may not be said continuously, this city holds thus, that one thus. The dear, good Christians here with us might also suffer. Also desiring that you would become part of the pot with some good-heartedness. We hope that the conversation will provide so much occasion that we will come back into further friendly discussion. We hope that Bern, Basel, etc., will also desire this. In summary, it is proposed in the best form and undertaking. May God send it well. I have also written such an opinion to the others, whether they might (especially Bern) be moved to make some friendly request further to my lords, apologizing for some disparagement, etc. May God grant grace.</p>
      <p>The promise of the Epitome delighted me in a wonderful way. May God grant that you successfully complete this rather arduous and extremely useful task with minimal effort. I would indeed wish it to be ready by St. John's Day, but if it is not possible due to business and the difficulty of the undertaking, let it be as it may, as long as it is written. In the meantime, I will continue writing the commentary, leaving it to you to review in passing and as much as the Epitome allows, whatever pertains to geography and topography.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious and distinguished man, Lord Joachim Vadian, the most prudent consul of St. Gallen, his especially esteemed lord.</p>
