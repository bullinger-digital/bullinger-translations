      <p>Since you have here, most learned Bullinger, that most illustrious hero, Mr. Johannes a Lasco, who is most loving towards you and an indefatigable soldier of Christ, and Mr. Lelio Sozzini, your own as if he were your son, who are accustomed to write to you accurately and copiously about all matters, there is no reason for you to wonder at my silence, as I, hiding in the wilderness, have been transformed from a Franciscan politician into a rustic Carthusian. As often as I received your letters, I read them most gladly and replied in three words.</p>
      <p>Now the departure of that young Pole, Konrad Krupka, whom I have most diligently recommended to you, makes me ask you in the greatest way not to fail him in those things which his noble and pious parent requests from your humility. From the German letters he writes to you, you will know what needs to be done. You will have done me a great favor if you help him in whatever matters you can without inconvenience to yourself. May the Lord Jesus keep you with your whole family.</p>
      <p>Pelsnicze, December 20, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Francis Lismanini [has] signed.</p>
      <p>I send you this writing so that, if you have not yet read the book of Hosius, Bishop of Warmia, on the express word of God, you may obtain it. Mr. Vergerio provided the occasion for writing, for Mr. a Lasco and Mr. Calvin, who is mentioned here under the name Caligula, and you will not waste good hours against that windy apostate bishop. To the most reverend Lord Heinrich Bullinger, of the vigilant and most faithful church of ZÃ¼rich, to the most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
