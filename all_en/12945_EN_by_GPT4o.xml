    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] To the most divine and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, Johannes Vulteius (Ethelontés) sends his greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] When you, my most beloved teacher of all, called our comrades yesterday and, as is right and proper, then spoke to them about any transgressions, I would have been exceedingly glad to be there as a listener. I am very astonished at the wretchedness and wickedness of those who always delight and rejoice in the misfortune of others! For my part, I truly hold it that if I am angry with someone, I do not simply slander them maliciously, but if I see that they are acting unlawfully, I take them aside and tell them my criticism to their face. You would have done better to do the same if you do not want to stay out of these things; an advisor or a teacher must make clear statements. I expect and request from you a benevolent examination, for I say this not to criticize you. To obey the teachers and - to put it briefly - simply to fulfill one's duties, that is, in my estimation, what befits a noble person; writing lies about us and causing you unnecessary work does not belong to it. However, there are some people who are particularly diligent in this opposite course of action: Like children, they secretly bring accusations against us in secret and even accuse us of lying over trivialities. Such a thing is truly, in my judgment, the work of a shameless and accursed man, and I cite the well-known proverb as a witness: The thief avoids the sunlight and loves the night. From these things, it is clear that there are two kinds of people: One kind delights in the misfortune and mishap of their fellow humans and especially revels in sowing mutual hatred among friends. This is precisely the work of such people, whom I have always naturally detested and who are treated with disdain by almost everyone, and rightly so. For they are like a wedge: As schemers, they ruin entire cities; they become traitors to their homeland, allow themselves to be bribed, and deny God. The other kind of people, on the other hand, does what is necessary on their own initiative and naturally avoids acting badly. Such people I praise and commend. "Now choose from both those people as a model whose actions are proven to be the most beneficial, and you should be well advised."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] I openly admit to having done many things that are not proper. We all make mistakes, and no one is without fault. But perhaps someone now thinks to themselves that they only use the admonition and example of strangers and then we become hostile to them if they perhaps once interfere in foreign matters. To this, I respond as follows: Never have we harbored such thoughts, and I have not come to that; rather, I want to live together with the others as your laws command. If not, then I will repent. In the end, I would like to emphatically ask you to present us with that informant. You will then find that he has lied about many things and will not dare to speak in our presence. I have much more to say, but I will explain everything to you in detail later. I expect you to examine these things with benevolence. Farewell and stay healthy.</p>
