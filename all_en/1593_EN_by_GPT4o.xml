      <p>Greetings and Peace. Your letter, dated the eighth of November, was delivered to me some time ago by Mr. Hooper. I would now write to you more extensively about the state of public and private affairs here among us, if everything had been observed equally or perhaps more favorably by the one who undertook to deliver this, as it has been by myself; this circumstance causes you to receive a shorter letter from me than you would otherwise have had. However, know this from me, that all the pious here now have the best hopes for the success of religion; those appointed by the royal majesty are now laboring with the utmost zeal to restore it: among them are Thomas of Canterbury, John Hooper, Jan Łaski, Peter Martyr, and many other learned and pious men. And although all those who are numbered 32 cannot always agree among themselves in all things, I nevertheless hope that the sounder in doctrine will prevail, because the king, who entirely desires the promotion of pure religion, will interpose his authority where it is needed. Nor is there any doubt (with the favor of Christ the Lord) if only the aforementioned agree well and wisely among themselves, as we all hope, that the acts and transactions will afterwards be easily approved by the votes of the parliamentarians. Meanwhile, it is our duty and yours there to earnestly and fervently pray to God that He may be present with His spirit at the assembly, which has now convened here: so that all things, especially those pertaining to religion, which are disputed therein, may result in the glory of His name and the increase of the kingdom of His Son. For this I also earnestly and sincerely pray.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding the expedition of the King of France, which he is now preparing into Germany for its liberation, as is reported here, I will write nothing, assuming that you there have more and more certain information about it. Mr. Łaski, variously impeded by the present reformation, as you can imagine, has asked to be excused to you for not writing anything now. Please greet for me Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalter, Wolf, and the other brothers, not omitting Mr. Gessner in the meantime. (Also greet for me Mr. Butler along with his wife.) Mr. Łaski and Mr. Gwalter greet you. Farewell, most distinguished man in the Lord, to whom I commend you and your ministry from the heart. London, March 9, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Jan Utenhove.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
