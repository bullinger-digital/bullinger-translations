      <p>Greetings. Those who deliver this, dearest compater in the Lord, are from Augsburg, one is a minister of the word, the other a schoolmaster. The minister of the word has been recalled by the letters of the Augsburg senate, the other accompanies him to see if he can also regain his former position there. There is no need for me to commend them to your kindness, as you are accustomed to show a benevolent spirit towards brothers. I fear that they may not be able to complete this journey comfortably due to the warlike tumult; prudence and circumspection are needed. Therefore, I ask you, if you know of any way by which they may travel more comfortably and safely, to share it with them. Here we live quite peacefully by the grace of the Lord. My wife is near childbirth; pray to the Lord that she may give birth successfully. Farewell very well, dearest compater in the Lord. Greetings to all yours, also to the lords, brothers, and friends. Bern, May 12, 1552.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, your compater in the Lord. To the most renowned theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest lord and compater. In Zürich.</p>
