    <p xml:id="regest1">The Commander of Tobel [Dietbald Gyß von Gyßenberg] will only allow Hans Wähinger, the chaplain at Bußnang, who is currently overseeing the parish [Märwil], to keep the benefice if he adheres to the foundation letters; Wähinger is coming to Zurich to seek advice. He asks Bullinger to assist the righteous man.</p>

      <p>Worthy, highly learned, especially gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hans Wähinger, the bearer of this letter, who has been a chaplain at Bußnang for a long time and a member of the Order of St. John, and has been enfeoffed by the house of Tobel and recognized by the entire chapter according to his letters of appointment, which undoubtedly will also be presented to you and can be read, has informed me that the current lord of Tobel has demanded that he hand over the chaplaincy or comply with the contents of the endowment and the foundation letters. The good old man is very distressed by this and did not expect it, and he had hoped that he would be allowed to enjoy his old age in peace. He also pointed out to me that he has built a house from the ground up at his own expense on the benefice, without causing any harm to the aforementioned house of God, and has recently provided another parish for the house of Tobel, which the house of Tobel had to bear the costs for, thus saving the house expenses. He did this willingly so that neither the house nor anyone else would be offended by him, and so that no one would say he took a benefice and did nothing for it. He has thus asked me for advice on how he should conduct himself in accordance with the peace of the land, and he has indicated to me that he intends to go to Zurich to seek advice from some of his friends and companions on how he should conduct himself. This has not pleased me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, gracious lord, it is my earnest request to your wisdom that you be helpful and advisory to the good old man, so that he may have a proper course of action; for I do not know how to advise him. The good man is old and has a wife and children, and the woman is very large and heavy, so they cannot easily travel. If he has to bear much, I fear he may not be able to sustain it. Therefore, I do not know how to advise him; for I am too inadequate. And I would like to commend him to your wisdom. For I have known him for a long time and have never heard anything about him other than what befits an honest man, and I myself have never experienced otherwise. If I can earn anything from your wisdom, you should not spare me; with a serviceable and friendly request, you will have me in gracious recommendation.</p>
      <p>Given at Occoly, after the birth of our Savior in the 35th year, etc.</p>
      <p>Heinrich von Ulm at Griesenberg.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my gracious and dear lord.</p>
