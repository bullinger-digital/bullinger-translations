      <p>Greetings. I have sent you, dear brother, my thoughts on the French alliance written down. I ask you to consider this favorably from me.</p>
      <p>I know indeed that the situations of yours and ours are different.</p>
      <p>Among us, it has never been possible until now to join in an alliance. If I could maintain this, I would consider myself to have rendered excellent service; if I could not, I would be forced to adopt other plans, which I would believe to be less harmful.</p>
      <p>But you are among those who have always been allied with the king. It would be difficult and indeed impossible to persuade them otherwise.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I did not send those thoughts of mine to instruct you on what to do among your people, but so that you might understand my judgment on this matter.</p>
      <p>The French delegation, which is expected here tomorrow, is pressing the alliance very strongly.</p>
      <p>My greatest desire is to depart from here and to see the Lord in the heavenly kingdom and to be with all the saints. ZÃ¼rich, September 1, 1564.</p>
