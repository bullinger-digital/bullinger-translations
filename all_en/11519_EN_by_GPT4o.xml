    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not want to be guilty of the same offense as [Haller, Wick, and Wolf], who traveled to Marburg without permission. However, Johannes Draconites, on Gryn√§us' recommendation, has now invited him to accompany him [to the Imperial Diet] in Regensburg, and such a journey promises great benefit. Therefore, he has agreed and hopes to be able to benefit his hometown through written reports; he asks not to interpret his actions as disobedience. He has borrowed money from a Marburg merchant to be prepared for emergencies. He sends his "Monomachia [Davidis et Goliae]," the "Epistolae heroinae," and other poems and asks for them to be forwarded for printing. Rudolf Collin and possibly Theodor [Bibliander] should correct them, and Bullinger should ensure their error-free printing. He has no reliable news but will write from Regensburg. Greetings; he is in a hurry due to his imminent departure.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I am not unaware, most esteemed father, of how much obedience I owe to others and especially to you, nor am I one who wishes to stubbornly resist your laws and authority. For I have long since learned how much you disapproved of the actions of those who traveled to Marburg against your consent. I am not now attempting anything similar by their example, so that what was allowed to them without consequence might also be permitted to me. I had indeed intended to spend the remaining time of my travels entirely according to your wishes, and I believe I have not yet deviated from this intention if you examine the matter more closely.</p>
      <p>For many things often happen unexpectedly, and it happened to me, without my anticipating it, that Dr. Johannes Draconites, a most accomplished theologian and very devoted to me, to whom Grynaeus had recently recommended me, urged and requested me to accompany him to Regensburg. What was I to do? This was requested by a man who had always deserved well of me, and if I served him in this matter, I would also have rendered a service not displeasing to the prince. Other friends advised me not to refuse something so beneficial to me. I also perceived, as far as I could see, that it would not be unfruitful for me. For there gather the most learned men and the princes of Germany, Spain, and Italy, so that whoever sees Regensburg at this time seems to have surveyed a principal part of Europe.</p>
      <p>Add to this that in the company of such a man, no one can be without great praise and benefit. Here, various modes of consultation, the institutions of princes, the methods of writing both in Latin and German, and the customs of living present themselves.</p>
      <p>Therefore, having conceived a good hope from you as well, I undertook this task, not thinking that I was doing it without benefit to my homeland, if by diligently observing everything, I also write to you about what seems to be for or against you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask this one thing, that you do not think I have done this with a perverse mind, out of personal stubbornness and persistent disobedience. I do not have time to write to others due to the shortness of time. You, my father, take up and defend this my cause as well as others; I will take care that you do not seem to have defended a rebellious and wicked person.</p>
      <p>As for the magnitude of the expenses, about which Froschauer will tell you, I ask that you do not take it too harshly; for I had taken some money from a Marburg merchant, which I would have on the journey in case of illness or some other incident. I thought I should remind you of this, so you would not think I had made such expenses over a six-month period.</p>
      <p>I am sending here three books of "Monomachia," nine "Epistolae heroinae," to which I would like you to add that of Sarah, which I sent to you at the previous fair; for I had left no copy for myself. Also, here you have Otto's epithalamium, Eobanus's epicedion and epitaphs, and furthermore, our Lafater's funeral poem. I have inscribed all these to my dearest men, fathers, and friends, to whom, I pray, this my labor may be as pleasing as it is written with great zeal and love for them.</p>
      <p>You, I ask, ensure that they are printed for the autumn fair; for many are expecting these, and there are no lack of printers who would gladly undertake these with their press.</p>
      <p>Above all, I would like to ask Mr. Rudolf Collin to take on the review of my work, to remove blemishes, fill in gaps, and cut out superfluous parts.</p>
      <p>For he is the one in whose hands I want my poem to stand or fall. If Mr. Theodor would not mind inspecting such a work during his leisure, he would do me a great favor. However, I do not want any other poets, whom Zurich brings forth, to be allowed any authority to alter my work, lest it be torn apart by many hands rather than corrected. Furthermore, I ask you to ensure that the diligence of the printer and corrector, which must be applied in printing the poem, is observed.</p>
      <p>For here, often even a single misplaced word can overturn the entire grace of the poem, indeed completely destroy the verse itself, as I experienced with my epicedion printed in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>There are many new things here, but most are uncertain, so they are not worthy of detaining you longer with them. I will take care to transcribe to you from Regensburg both certain and worthy things to read. My companions greet you. You also will greet your mother and wife and the whole assembly of your children most dutifully in my name. Excuse me to the others for not having written; for the sudden departure was the cause that I could barely write these, for which reason I ask you to forgive the frequent erasures.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest father, and do not abandon one who hopes in you alone. Marburg, March 11, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Rod. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father to be uniquely observed. Zurich.</p>
