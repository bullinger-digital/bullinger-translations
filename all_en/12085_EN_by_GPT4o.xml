    <p xml:id="regest1">In the [Basel] council, there was a discussion on this day about the punishment to be awarded to the [Basel] mercenaries; as soon as Gast learns more about it, he will write. The book with the pasquinades [“Pasquillorum tomi duo”] is a collection of texts that were written over many years; this work consists of about 50 printed sheets, 2 parts, and an [appendix], including the “Pasquillus extaticus”; Gast will inquire with Oporin. Bullinger sends Oecolampadius's sermons on the Lamentations of Jeremiah [“Inn die clag Hieremie”], which he had recorded [in 1527]; if these find the approval of the scholars, he will attempt something similar with [Oecolampadius's sermons on] Ezekiel and Daniel. [In Basel] more than a hundred Swiss soldiers have died, and every day plundered, miserable [soldiers] return; in the inn, 54 [of them] are bedridden. Soon Gast will send the new catechism by Myconius, unless Bullinger has already received it from the author; unfortunately, it does not sufficiently elaborate on the teaching of the Gospels in contrast to the scholastics. A preacher from Strasbourg [Konrad Hubert?] reports that a Frenchman [Pierre Brully] was arrested in the southern Netherlands and is destined for the flames; this shows the disposition of the Emperor [Charles V.] against the [evangelical] churches.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Today, the senate deliberated on the punishment to be inflicted on our soldiers; however, I still do not know what was concluded. All were brought in; they have relatives in the senate. If anything is decided about them, I will write soon.</p>
      <p>The book of pasquinades has been divided into two volumes; it has nearly 50 sheets, in which all the pasquinades written over many years are included. The "Pasquillus extaticus" has been expanded, and certain pasquinades have been added. I will consult with Oporin on this matter.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the sermons on the Lamentations of Jeremiah by our Oecolampadius, which I transcribed from his mouth. If I see that my work is pleasing to the learned, I will attempt the same with the prophet Ezekiel and Daniel. More than a hundred Swiss soldiers have breathed their last with us; every day some miserable ones return wretched and poor, 54 of them are bedridden in the hospital, and this is a notable plague from God.</p>
      <p>Soon I will send the new Catechism of our Myconius; but perhaps you have already received it from the author himself; the good father does not sufficiently consider what principal doctrine should be proposed to the scholars in the business of the Gospel.</p>
      <p>Some of the preachers from Strasbourg say that a Frenchman in Lower Germany has been captured by the Emperor's forces because of religion and sentenced to the flames. These are the beginnings of sorrows; hence it appears what disposition the Emperor has towards our churches and what he is planning and contemplating. But the Lord will not forsake His church if we truly repent.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>On the day of Conrad, 1544. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Greet Theodor in my name along with your wife and children. Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
