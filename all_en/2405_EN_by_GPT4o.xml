      <p>S. Today, Löffelperger left here, through whom I sent a bundle of letters to you, although I did not write to you myself; for I was waiting for your response, which was delivered to me just a few hours after his departure. The messenger is in a hurry. Therefore, I cannot respond to the Locarno matter; I do not know what has been decided today. I always strive to ensure that our people do not separate themselves from the others. May your people do the same in a good cause. Our people think it is unfair if they should be punished according to the peace of the land for their faith, and it would certainly be unfair if things were as they believe. Concerning the Genevans, I hear nothing about the disagreement you write about, nor do I know anyone among our people who accuses Calvin of heresy. Indeed, Calvin is quite unpopular with some of our people because he seems to them to be too meddlesome.</p>
      <p>However, as far as we are concerned, we strive to break and mitigate their fierceness and teach them to think more modestly about such great men. That Jerome still lingers in Tonon, but he has no authority. Francis Sampaulinus of Vevay is acting quite peacefully with his class of brothers; may the Lord grant that they continue so! There are several thousand foreigners in Geneva, so it is inevitable that various questions are discussed among them; for they come together from various regions, differently educated and disposed.</p>
      <p>This is for your letters. Otherwise, I have nothing to write at the moment, except that Tremp's wife peacefully passed away to the Lord in recent days. He himself needs consolation, as I recently wrote to your Zwingli and mine. For besides other calamities, now this also adds that he is deprived of the comfort of his spouse. You will have done well, therefore, if you have consoled him by letter.</p>
      <p>Schaller's business, in which he is entangled, is not yet resolved and weighs all the more heavily on him because, besides being forced to suffer a great loss of things, he can see no end or outcome to the matter. Musculus and all of ours send their greetings to you in return; may Gwalther, Pellican, and all your sons-in-law together with your families be well. Bern, September 26, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord, compatriot, most esteemed and dearest.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
