      <p> Most learned sir, this morning I received your two letters dated the 19th and 22nd of this month. I am sending you the king's response here. The Duke of Lorraine and others speak of a future peace according to these conditions. Many believe it will follow, except for the necessities of both parties. There are no lack of old enemies who wish for everything to be broken and finally promise the complete eradication of all Huguenots. Many unworthy acts are committed by both sides, which later exacerbate tempers and increase calamities. Only the mercy of God can heal these, as our demerits are such that they cannot endure His judgment much longer. Regarding the Moors, the Spanish promise themselves a certain victory, which I wish for them. The Turkish fleet is said to threaten Cyprus, although I have no doubt that the Turks will not leave the Moors without assistance. </p>
      <p> Regarding Duke Eric, as you wrote some time ago, I understand and believe his knights will advance into France if necessary. But in the meantime, we must be vigilant so that the republic does not suffer any harm. Duke Wilhelm is said to be expecting money from France for the conduct of his knights. </p>
      <p> The Huguenots have so far seemed to labor in vain for assistance, and indeed it will be difficult for them to sustain the war this summer if they are not equipped with new troops. </p>
      <p> The diet will proceed to the Rhine in the month of May, as I suppose. As for the rest, I ask you to write to me from Frankfurt as well; I will not be ungrateful. And I wish you to fare well happily. </p>
      <p> From Kienzheim, February 24, 1570. </p>
