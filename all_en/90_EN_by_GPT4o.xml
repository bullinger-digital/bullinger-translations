    <p xml:id="regest1">The unfortunate Claude d'Aliod has urgently asked Blarer, his brother Thomas, and cousin Konrad Zwick to intercede with the people of Zurich out of charity, so that he may enter the city and region of Zurich [despite his ban] to collect and settle his debts, sell his goods, and satisfy all parties.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Bullinger should obtain a special permit from the Zurich council and an eight-day extension for debt settlement, so that d'Aliod can personally strive to repay as much as possible. If he were to have someone else conduct his business, he would have to reckon with significant [financial] losses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">D'Aliod is a decent, God-fearing man who has strayed from the right path in his search [for God]. However, he claims to have only spread his heresies when asked by scholars, never among ordinary people. He has always been willing to be corrected. Nevertheless, he was slandered and [arrested in Augsburg in 1547].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Blarer has not yet been able to discuss his views with him but intends to do so thoroughly soon. Hopefully, d'Aliod will be understanding, as he errs in his great [religious] zeal. May God improve him! In Konstanz, nothing is known about d'Aliod trying to convince anyone of his opinion. The people of Konstanz would not have approved. He is still a citizen of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Bullinger should therefore advocate for d'Aliod to be allowed to conduct his business personally in Zurich and Winterthur this one time. Otherwise, he would suffer a great financial loss because the value of his goods would be set too low at the [impending] forced auction. [He can only avert this by] settling his debts with his Zurich creditors [N.N.] within the next ten days. Blarer is trying to raise the money for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">He will [not receive] Bullinger's letter tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother. This poor, miserable man, Claudius, has earnestly and insistently asked my dear brother, also my cousin Konrad Zwick, and me to help him for God's sake and out of love, so that he may have a place with you long enough to settle accounts with his debtors and creditors, and to use his goods to satisfy everyone.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, all three of us earnestly request you to intercede with your lords, since the city and land have otherwise forbidden him, so that he may still enter this time and conduct his affairs as best he can, as he cannot do so through another without great disadvantage, and that his deadline be extended by eight days. He would strive to raise money and make payments to the best of his ability.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>He is a pious man who fears God and seeks Him, and has left good conditions. However, he entertains some fantasies that have no foundation. But take it highly that he has never desired to sow them among simple people. However, perhaps when addressed by the learned, he has been unburdened to express his opinion, but with all submission, that he would gladly be corrected and not insist on his opinion. But such has always been misrepresented and misunderstood.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have not yet spoken with him about his opinion, as I have not had time or opportunity until now. But I intend to soon discuss this with him and thoroughly inquire about his opinion, hoping he will be willing to be guided. He has a great but misguided zeal. May the Lord God improve everything in him! We have never experienced here that he has tried to persuade anyone of his opinion, otherwise, we would not have considered it good. He is still our citizen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>But I ask you on behalf of all of us to do your utmost to allow him to come to you and to Winterthur this time to conduct his affairs, so that his goods and merchandise do not have to go to waste, as it costs a lot. Otherwise, a disgraceful outcome would befall him. He must be with you within 10 days from the date and satisfy everyone. I will see where I can raise the money.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I will respond to your letters tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. April 12, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
