      <p>Before leaving us, Philipp asked me to convey to your humanity, most illustrious man, letters of intercession that would open and facilitate his access to you. I was dissuaded from denying him this duty, partly due to some disturbance of his affairs and himself, and also because I was led to the more certain hope that he would continue in a life of moderation and modesty, as he has begun here in the last two months, and measure himself by his own standard. For he has finally realized, and indeed with no small amount of mental anguish, that obeying those like himself rather than me has been to his great detriment. However, because he seems to have repented and will henceforth always abhor the waste of money, I wish and ask that he be judged worthy of all pardon and impunity by your votes as well.</p>
      <p>For as Cicero says, to err, to make mistakes, and to be deceived is human and almost characteristic of youth; but indeed, to guard oneself against those evils in the future and to embrace virtue is the mark of a wise person and most worthy of pardon and indulgence. Therefore, I earnestly beg that he may be allowed to devote himself to letters and truth among you for a longer time and to prove to you and his parents the correction of his life and manners. For I am fully confident, as he has promised so many times, that he will diligently compensate with the probity of his manners for what he has neglected or failed through laziness and imprudence, as he is convicted by his own testimony. But I am persuaded that there is no need for more words, since you all possess such prudence and humanity that you easily understand how such talents should be handled. Regarding the solution, it is necessary for you to interpose your authority with the parent, so that at the next fair he ensures satisfaction for all those presenting Philipp's son's promissory note. The total of what he owes to creditors here amounts to about 30 florins. Indeed, unless I had intervened and even satisfied some on his behalf, and given certain hope to others that they would certainly expect payment at the next fair, I would be utterly ruined, unless either leaving here dishonorably or appointing and presenting other guarantors or being possibly imprisoned by our creditors who pressed me as the rector. But I have considered the account of the parent and friends, indeed also yours, very much, confident that I would do this without my own interest and for your favor. Farewell to you all.</p>
      <p>Given hastily from Marburg, June 6, 1551. Wigand Happel, entirely...</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and in many respects most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, supreme and most worthy Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, his reverend lord and friend.</p>
