      <p> Greetings. For your kindness, reverend father, which you recently showed me, I give you my greatest thanks. On Sunday, when it was already getting dark, I came home; I found all my family safe and sound. On the way to Wesen, I encountered Rodolph von Salis, a captain, a man of remarkable modesty, who accompanied me for the rest of the journey. He told me on the way, as we rode together on horseback, that he was certain peace had been made. He proved this to me by saying that before he set out on his journey, he had met the Duke of Ferrara and asked him, if anything had been done about peace, to share it with him out of old goodwill towards him. </p>
      <p> The Duke replied that he was already contemplating departure; however, if peace had not been made, he would hardly have been able to obtain leave from the king. Duke Guise, greeted by the same, responded in the same words: the Duke of Savoy should marry the king's sister; the king should restore Savoy, but not Piedmont, and for Piedmont, he should pay eighty thousand francs annually; the Duke of Savoy should be a vassal of the King of France; the king should also restore the County of Bresse to the Duke of Savoy; both kings should mutually restore fortified places to each other, except for Calais; the death of the Queen of England contributed greatly to this peace. Whether there will be a betrothal between Philip's son and the daughter of the King of France is still in doubt; the constable is said to be working hard on it. The King of France offers Philip's son his daughter with the condition that he relinquishes his claim, which he believes to have, to the Duchy of Milan, and Philip should do the same, and thus the Duchy should be assigned to Philip's son; furthermore, Philip should hand over the Kingdom of Naples to his son. However, Philip argues how he might have other children, whom he cannot so completely disinherit, etc. These are the words of the captain, which I write as I heard them, but I affirm nothing for certain; you should consider these things favorably. Farewell, reverend father, and convey my greetings to all good men. </p>
      <p> You will also inform Mr. Collin, my father-in-law, that the journey was quite successful, and that everything is safe with us. Farewell again. </p>
      <p> Chur, December 12, 1558. </p>
      <p> Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his much-respected lord and patron. </p>
