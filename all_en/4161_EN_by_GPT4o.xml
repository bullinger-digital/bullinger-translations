      <p>To the most esteemed Lord Bullinger and his most friendly, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I am very glad, most esteemed lord and patron, that our son Christopher, although not entirely healthy, has returned to us alive; for indeed I was troubled both for your son, whom you wrote was in Venice (as it was reported to you and as was very true, as I have now heard from him) and was ill, and also for your sake, whom I recognized as being so concerned and full of sorrow for the health of your son. Therefore, I say again that I am glad that I now see you relieved of all fear; for your son has returned to you not without a certain hope of regaining his former health; may the best and greatest God grant that this happens soon. Furthermore, the day before yesterday he came to me with a servant, who had accompanied him from the Baths of Bormio to here, from whom he had borrowed some money with the promise of repaying it as soon as they reached me. Therefore, for the loan or for the expenses incurred from Bormio to here or even for the salary of the servant who accompanied your son, I paid eight Rhenish guilders at the rate of fifteen Constance batz per Rhenish guilder.</p>
      <p>And indeed your son, after settling the account, asserted that he owed this sum to his servant and therefore asked, in order to keep his word, that I pay it, which I did most willingly, to provide for your son for your sake and his honor; for it could not have been done otherwise without losing dignity. I therefore ask you to consider this favorably.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I gave Christopher himself four Rhenish guilders as he was leaving here, so that he would have travel money; for he did not bring even a penny with him. Therefore, you owe me eight gold crowns or, if you prefer, 12 Rhenish guilders of Constance currency, which you will send to me whenever you wish or when it is convenient for you; for it will not be inconvenient for me to wait as long as you wish. I also ask again and again, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, that you not be displeased by the expenses incurred by your son; for he can indeed make up for any loss, as he is a noble young man and of excellent promise. But I also earnestly ask that you not blame or be angry with him; for he fears you because of the excessive expenses incurred, for which he has given me such an account that it appears they could not have been avoided. Indeed, you should be very glad that by God's goodness your son has been restored to you, whom you can now reform at home according to your will, and he will become such a man that you will rejoice in him forever, and there is no doubt that he will be most obedient to you. I provided him with a servant as he was leaving, who would accompany him beyond the Septimer Pass, after which he will find travel companions every hour to Chur, and from there it is a one-day journey to Chur.</p>
      <p>But I also wrote to my brother Caspar in Chur to assist your son if he needs any help, etc. Furthermore, our Christopher says that while I am here, he has received only two of my letters combined with yours, with money enclosed. I, however, assure you on my honor that I have sent all your letters given to me to Venice with all diligence, and if, as your son asserts, they have not been delivered to him, it is indeed something I greatly wonder at. I only think that your last letters could not have been delivered to him, since they could not have been sent to Venice before Christopher's departure; for he was on the journey about three weeks before he came to me. But your son also says that he has written to me often; I, however, assert that I have not received even one, as far as I know, since I came here. But all things must be borne with equanimity, since he himself has returned safely.</p>
      <p>Finally, I have nothing new to write. All the Spaniards who were in Piedmont or in the Duchy of Milan have been brought into the Magrera Valley, a place near Lecco. It is unknown what they are planning; I, however (for the valley itself is not very far from here), am not without concern that they may be plotting something against us, although it is commonly heard that preparations are being made against the Venetians, who themselves are not without fear and are therefore fortifying themselves in turn, etc. Otherwise, in this my office, I am not lacking in continuous labors and troubles, but whatever burden my most gracious God has imposed on me must be borne, and therefore I will strive to adorn the Sparta assigned to me with all my strength. May the Lord provide strength and wisdom, so that all things may be arranged according to His will.</p>
      <p>Here we are all well by God's grace; likewise, I wish to hear the same from you and yours. Farewell with all yours, most esteemed lord, and keep me commended to you.</p>
      <p>Given at Chiavenna on the penultimate day of December 1560. The same, as above, most devoted to you, Friedrich von Salis, commissioner of Chiavenna.</p>
