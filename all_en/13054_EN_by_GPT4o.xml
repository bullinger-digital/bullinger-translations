    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller wishes to report more extensively on the events in Augsburg with the present letter, which he entrusts to Andreas [Gessner], and thus at least partially fulfill his recent promise [with letter No. 2999], as it is not possible for him to present every single detail as in a confidential conversation. However, he will consider matters of interest to Zurich. He will soon, God willing, tell everything else orally. He writes the letter in German so that Bullinger can share it with friends. It is not possible for him to write to everyone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Emperor Charles V summoned all the princes and electors to his quarters on September 1, as he still felt too weak to ride out. Through the young King Maximilian, Archduke of Austria, he had the electors and the imperial estates explain his reasons for convening the Imperial Diet. They had not complied with his request to appear at the Imperial Diets in Worms and Regensburg to find a solution to the contentious imperial matters. His goal remains a peaceful agreement on all disputed issues, especially in religious matters. After some rhetorical phrases, which Haller omits for brevity, Maximilian announced that the following points would be debated at the current Imperial Diet:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] 1. Determination of measures leading to agreement in religious matters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] 2. Preservation of the eternal peace of the land [from 1495]. The imperial estates may propose improvements regarding the peace of the land if necessary.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] 3. Reappointment of the Imperial Chamber Court and appointment of ten additional persons to support and represent the judges to avoid long waiting times in handling legal cases.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] 4. Restitution of all [unlawfully] seized goods and lands.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] 5. Postponement of the question of Turkish defense until the arrival of King Ferdinand.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] 6. Accession of all imperial estates to a single alliance to ensure peace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] 7. Establishment of a binding currency unit for the entire empire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] 8. Request for each estate to present its claims and rights to find a solution to the disputes over the seating order of the deputies that arose during the Imperial Diets.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] 9. General prohibition of secret councils to prevent future factionalism and machinations.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Maximilian presented these nine points to the deputies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Accordingly, negotiations on religious matters are now taking place. May Almighty God come to the aid of His own cause. Otherwise, all is lost! It is hard to believe the excessive arrogance with which the bishops conduct themselves. They no longer want to hear about the council [moved to Bologna] or other attempts at reconciliation, but want to judge according to the emperor's discretion and follow the resolutions of the Council of Trent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Haller has seen six electors participating in the imperial assemblies: Sebastian von Heusenstamm, the Archbishop of Mainz; Adolf III von Schaumburg, the Archbishop of Cologne; Johann V von Isenburg, the Archbishop of Trier; Elector Palatine Frederick II the Wise; Duke Maurice of Saxony; the young Elector [John George] of Brandenburg, and some other princes and bishops. It is unbelievable how splendidly the three archbishops appear! The electors do not allow the deputies of the imperial cities to participate in their consultations, although significant envoys, namely the mayors of almost all imperial cities, are present. Only after their consultations do they present their resolutions to the imperial cities. So much for the Imperial Diet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] King Ferdinand has not yet arrived in Augsburg, as he is proceeding against the rebellious estates in Bohemia, and that cruelly. He is said to turn cities into villages by tearing down city gates and walls. The Bohemian nobles he has captured are beheaded or forced to wear neck chains for life. More is told of this misery than Haller can report here. They are deprived of their religion, their freedoms, and other rights they have had since the time of Jan Hus. Moreover, they had to surrender all weapons. It is assumed here that preaching will be prohibited to the preachers in Augsburg upon the king's arrival: Such is his rage against the Gospel!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Duke Ulrich of Württemberg is not coming to Augsburg because he is ill.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] Cardinal Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, Bishop of Augsburg, steadfastly holds mass in the cathedral. He has less attendance than expected. His agents give a taler every week to the poor who want it if they come to mass with their family. Anyone who carries a candle in a funeral procession receives a batzen. This clearly shows that they belong to the Antichrist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] When a landsknecht was to be married in the cathedral and was asked to confess beforehand, he began to curse the priests vehemently and left the church with his bride [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] The pastor at St. Ulrich, Johann Heinrich Held von Tiefenau, had the garden adjacent to his house consecrated as a burial place for foreigners.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">[20] The Bishop of Augsburg is said to have asked the emperor to prohibit preaching during the Imperial Diet; much harm would result from it. The emperor is said to have given no response.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">[21] On August 28, some foreign cavalrymen gathered in the church of St. Ulrich before the sermon began and interrupted the singing of psalms with boisterous songs. One of them dared to shuffle a deck of cards on the pulpit as if he intended to preach from it. The people had to leave without a sermon. When one of the citizens [...] wanted to address the matter, he was stabbed. The emperor was annoyed about it; however, the act went unpunished.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">[22] Bullinger has surely heard of the terrible mutiny of the landsknechts that occurred on August 23 and brought immense disgrace to the emperor. The reason was that the landsknechts, after a troop review, received only one month's overdue pay instead of three months. In the ensuing tumult, the landsknechts marched to the emperor's quarters, loudly demanding their rights. The frightened Spanish soldiers quickly closed all the city gates, rushed armed to the emperor's quarters, while the Augsburgers took up arms without taking sides. For two hours, it was feared that the German landsknechts and the foreign forces would clash. Had it come to that, the city citizens would not have intervened. The captured Elector John Frederick of Saxony was secretly taken to the emperor. Finally, the landsknechts were appeased with fair promises. However, one of the emperor's bodyguards was stabbed in the process. The very next day, the landsknechts were paid, and some of them were dismissed. Soon after, the leaders were arrested. Two were hanged at the fish market and left there for a whole day. Two others were beheaded, and the headless bodies were left there as a deterrent. Some others were drowned outside the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest23">[23] In Günzburg, the Augustinian monk Johannes Hoffmeister died miserably. On the way to Augsburg, he suddenly fell ill. Before his death, he cried out in despair: "Oh woe, I miserable creature! What have I done? I have lied to God in heaven and knowingly fought against the truth I recognized. Therefore, I am damned and surrounded by a multitude of devils!" He screamed like this for a while, so that people came to him out of curiosity. A Palatine secretary [Joachim Rutland?] urged him to ask God for mercy. But no one could persuade him to do so. Thus, he died in despair. Not even the priests deny this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest24">[24] In Naples, terrible things have happened. The Viceroy Pedro Álvarez de Toledo gathered a band of soldiers and defeated the Neapolitans. The latter were disarmed, and nearly 1300 of them were killed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest25">[25] No news has arrived from France and England. Landgrave Philip of Hesse is still in Donauwörth. Duke Maurice is hated by both Germans and foreigners.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest26">[26] The preachers in Wittenberg and Philipp Melanchthon have recently all become "Maurician" in their sentiments. This news is confirmed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest27">[27] The Augsburg councilors had some parishes in the countryside that belonged to the hospital. However, King Ferdinand and the Bishop of Augsburg expelled all the pastors from there, and the Augsburg authorities will not be able to do anything about it until the end of the Imperial Diet. Otherwise, cases of manslaughter and other crimes occur daily, which Haller does not want to report. The preaching activity continues bravely. May God grant this for a long time!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest28">[28] In his own matter, Haller has not yet approached the councilors, for if possible, he wants to endure in Augsburg until the end of his two-year contract. He does not want to cause any offense.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest29">[29] Bullinger may share Haller's letter with whomever he wishes. Haller would send further news through a secure messenger. Greetings, also to all colleagues, especially to Bullinger's family and Rudolf Gwalther. Sebastian Lepusculus, Sixt Birck, and Georg Frölich (who is recovering from a kind of ulcer) send their regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest30">[30] The emperor is said to be recruiting soldiers again. For what purpose is unclear. He still has three regiments of Spaniards and two of German landsknechts, one of which is stationed in Augsburg and the other in Ulm. Haller and many others fear that an attack on Constance and the Confederation is planned (God forbid such a thing!). However, Haller does not know if this is true, otherwise, he would inform the Zurich authorities.</p>

      <p>S. P. I promised in my recent letters to write more extensively about the events happening here through this Andreas, the citizen of Zurich. I will now fulfill this promise in part. However, since it is not possible to write about each detail as intimately as one could explain in a personal conversation, I will present those matters which I know you most desire to know. And what remains, God willing, I will soon explain in person. I will write in German so that you can share it with our other friends, as it is not feasible to write everything to everyone.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>On the first day of September, His Imperial Majesty summoned all the electors and princes to his quarters, as he was still too weak to ride out, and there, through the young King Maximilian, Archduke of Austria, he had the electors and estates of the empire explain why he had convened this Imperial Diet. Namely, he had previously summoned the princes and estates to Worms and Regensburg to resolve the contentious matters of the German nation, but they did not appear. Therefore, he was compelled to bring them here, as is evident. Therefore, as his intention has always been to peacefully resolve all disputes, especially regarding the divided religion, he is still of that mind, with much other talk and pomp, which I omit for brevity. In summary, he proposed these articles to be handled at the present Imperial Diet:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Firstly, the religion, by what means and ways such division may be brought into unity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Secondly, that the old peace of the land, which the common estates of the empire have with one another, should remain in force. However, if the estates know of any improvements, they may propose them. He will graciously assist in this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Thirdly, he has also considered appointing the Imperial Chamber Court and, so that no one is delayed, always having 10 men alongside the appointed chamber judges to assist them, and if they are not able, to be used in their place.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Fourthly, restitution, that everyone should return to another what was taken from them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Fifthly, the Turkish war: He will leave it until his brother arrives.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Sixthly, that the common estates should unite for the sake of peace and tranquility of the German nation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Seventhly, by what means a currency in the empire might be used and maintained.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Eighthly, since there has been much dispute among the estates regarding the seating order, that each should present their rights, so that a reconciliation can be made in this matter as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Ninthly, that no estates should have secret and private councils in the future, but that each should state their opinion in open councils, to prevent factional beginnings and machinations.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>He presented these 9 articles to them for handling.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Negotiations are now taking place on the first of these, the matter of religion. May Almighty God come to the aid of His own cause, for otherwise, all is lost! The bishops, jubilant, exhibit such arrogance that it is hard to believe. They think they have it in their hands now. They do not want to hear about the council or other reconciliation, but want to judge according to the emperor's fortune and follow the Tridentine decree. But we hope that God will provide another means.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>As of today, the 6 electors have all been in council, whom I saw riding from the town hall: Mainz, Cologne, Trier (it is unspeakable what pride they exhibit), likewise Elector Palatine Frederick, Duke Maurice, the pious child, and the young elector of Brandenburg, with other princes and bishops. They do not allow the cities to join them in the councils, although there are many honorable envoys there (the mayors of almost all cities). When they have decided something, it will then be presented to the cities. Thus stands the matter of the Imperial Diet.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Ferdinand is not here yet, as he is said to be acting very cruelly in Bohemia. He breaks gates and walls of several cities; makes villages out of them. He has captured a large number of Bohemian lords, some of whom he beheads, others he punishes otherwise, so that they must wear a rope around their necks for life (of which more is said than can be written). Their religion, freedom, and other rights, which they have had since the time of Hus, have been taken away. They have also had to give up all weapons. It is also thought that as soon as he arrives, at the very least, all preaching will be prohibited to us. Such is his rage against the gospel!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Duke Ulrich of Württemberg is not coming, as he is ill.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Our bishop holds mass bravely in the cathedral. However, by God's grace, he does not have many attendees from our citizens, although some run there, yet fewer than expected. He has some appointed agents who give a taler to all the poor who desire it, every week, if they go to mass with their household. Yes, whoever goes with a funeral procession, carrying a candle, whoever they may be, they give a batzen, so that it is all the more known that they belong to the Antichrist.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>This week, a landsknecht wanted to go to church with his bride. They wanted him to confess beforehand. He did not want to do that and vehemently cursed the priests and ran out of the church with the bride.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>To our sorrow, they have taken a garden from Heldio, the pastor at St. Ulrich, next to his house and consecrated it as a burial place for foreigners.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>It is also said that the bishop has petitioned the emperor to stop the preaching (as it causes much unrest) during the Imperial Diet. But the emperor is said to have given no response.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>On August 28, some foreign cavalrymen gathered before the sermon in the church at St. Ulrich and, as the people began to enter and sing psalms, they began to sing other shameless songs. One went up to the pulpit and shuffled a deck of cards as if he intended to preach from it. They behaved in such a way that everyone had to leave without a sermon, as nothing could be done against them. And when one of the citizens complained, he was stabbed to death by the foreigners, although it is said that the emperor himself was angry about it; but it remains unpunished.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>On August 23, there was an uprising of the landsknechts, of which you have undoubtedly heard, as it was truly a terrible tumult and widely known, for never in all his reign has the emperor suffered greater disgrace. The regiment of soldiers he brought with him was reviewed, and although they were already owed three months' pay, they were only paid for one month; which so displeased them that they caused a tumult, ran to the banners, and marched in formation to the emperor's court, shouting: "Money or blood!" This caused such distress among the Spaniards that all the gates were quickly closed, as foreign troops ran to the emperor's court, everyone in their houses armed themselves and took up weapons. However, none of the citizens joined any party. This lasted for two hours, during which it was feared that the German landsknechts and the foreign troops would fight each other. If that had happened, the citizens would have watched. The captured elector was quickly taken to the emperor. The soldiers were given good words until they were appeased. However, one of the emperor's bodyguards was stabbed. The next morning, they were paid, and some were dismissed, but soon some were arrested, who were guilty, and two were hanged at the fish market in front of everyone and left hanging for a whole day, also two were beheaded, and the bodies were left on the market as a deterrent. Thus, this tumult was quelled. Otherwise, some were taken out of the city and thrown into a river.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div23" corresp="regest23">
      <p>In Günzburg, the Hofmeister, a monk from Colmar, died miserably. For when he was on his way to Augsburg, he suddenly became ill and came to Günzburg and, before his end, fell into such despair that he cried out: "Oh woe to me, damned creature! What have I done? I have lied to God in heaven and knowingly fought against the recognized truth with knowledge and thought. Therefore, the sentence of my condemnation is pronounced! I am surrounded by many myriads of devils!" He continued like this for a good while, so that many people came to him out of curiosity. A Palatine secretary urged him to say: "God, be merciful to me, a sinner!" but no one could bring him to say it. Thus, he went in his despair: Which is certainly true; even the priests themselves do not deny it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div24" corresp="regest24">
      <p>In Naples, things have gone badly. The Viceroy gathered a band of soldiers and defeated the Neapolitans, killing nearly 1300 of them and taking all their weapons, thus putting them under the yoke.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div25" corresp="regest25">
      <p>We hear nothing from France and England. The Landgrave is still in Werd. Duke Maurice is hated by Germans and foreigners alike.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div26" corresp="regest26">
      <p>The preachers in Wittenberg and Philipp Melanchthon himself have all become good supporters of Maurice; of which there is good knowledge.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div27" corresp="regest27">
      <p>My lords have some parishes in the countryside belonging to the hospital. However, the king and the bishop have, without any right, expelled all the pastors from those places. My lords cannot do anything until the conclusion of the Imperial Diet. Otherwise, there are daily cases of manslaughter and other things, of which there is nothing to write. In preaching, we continue bravely. May God grant that it lasts long!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div28" corresp="regest28">
      <p>Regarding my own matters, I have not yet been with the lords. I would like to delay as long as possible until I reach the term of two years. For I do not want to do anything that in any way might be offensive or disadvantageous to me or others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div29" corresp="regest29">
      <p>These are the things I wanted to give at present, which you can share with whomever you wish. If I have anything else, I will inform you through a certain messenger. In the meantime, farewell and keep me in your commendation. I send greetings to all the fathers and brothers who are with you, especially to your family and Mr. Gwalther. Lepusculus, Xystus, and Mr. Laetus, who is recovering again from a kind of abscess, send their regards. September 9, 1547. Yours perpetually devoted, Jo. Hallerus.</p>

    <div xml:id="div30" corresp="regest30">
      <p>It is also said that the emperor is recruiting new troops. But where he intends to use them is unknown. He still has 3 regiments of Spaniards and 2 German ones: one here, the other in Ulm. I fear it might go over Constance and the Confederation. May God avert it! There are great rumors, but I do not know the reason yet. Otherwise, I would not withhold it from my lords.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my lord, to be honored as a father. Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
