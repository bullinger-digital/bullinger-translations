    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for troubling a well-known and pious man like Bullinger, who makes a significant contribution to true theology; praises Bullinger. Presents his view of the Lord's Supper: He has no doubt that spiritual eating is completed solely in faith, and he believes that the Lord's Supper is not only a sign of confession but was left for the increase of faith, with two things to be particularly noted: that it is celebrated in memory of the Lord with thanks for the benefit shown to us and that one trusts in His words; he believes that the body and blood of Christ are truly present in the Lord's Supper and are distributed through the meal, which is inexplicable to human understanding but is considered proven by faith as derived from the Word of God; because nowadays some deviate from this understanding of the [institution] words "This is my body, this is my blood," he asks Bullinger for advisory help.</p>

      <p>Greetings from the author of salvation, Jesus.</p>
      <p>Since today very few people live, a man most eminent in every kind of doctrine and most celebrated among all good people, who can write to you appropriately and without reproach, as you are a man placed beyond all risk of talent, I seemed to myself to be committing no small sin if I, a very insignificant man, were to trouble such a great hero devoted to divine affairs with untimely words and cause you annoyance. However, the many and indeed cedar-worthy monuments, by which you present yourself as a god to mortals (where the word ἄνθρωπος ἀνθρώπου δαιμόνιον has no place), when they depict, portray, and express you, lead me to hope that you will consider these my trifles with fairness and equity, especially since they come from a heart that believes you to be a divine being worthy of worship for the entire span of life. For who, unless the worst of men, does not admire, venerate, and worship Bullinger, who is truly believed and proclaimed by all to have descended from heaven for the benefit of the world, as far as the knowledge of the three languages extends? O thrice and more blessed are those who were born in your age! This day indeed is that golden age, which the most divine poets have allowed themselves to praise. Now that virgin Pallas has been restored, the Saturnian reigns have been restored through Bullinger, that is, the true knowledge of sincere theology and divine doctrine. Let it be said without the bite of envy: "You are that greatest one, who by delaying, indeed by writing, restore the matter to us."</p>
      <p>May the gods preserve the matter for Nestor's years! For you are a man worthy of never growing old or dying. But why do I continue to make you marble, when you have been erected golden in Olympia, indeed on Olympus, and it is better to be silent about Carthage than to say little? Therefore, I will dwell with myself, recognizing how scant my resources are, and having placed a crown on this part, I will hasten to the rest.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Eucharist, most illustrious Bullinger, I have been and am of the opinion that spiritual eating is accomplished solely by faith in Christ, by which we believe that He died for us and satisfied for our sins. However, I believe that the sacrament of the supper is not only a mark and sign of profession but also left for the increase of our faith and indeed for its awakening, in which two main things, unless I am mistaken, must be considered: one, that we do it in memory of the Lord, giving thanks for the ineffable benefit bestowed upon us, and the other, that we have faith in His words. For since He is omnipotent, and can do far greater things than the words promise, why should we doubt? Moreover, since the words are: "This is my body, this is my blood," I am led, indeed compelled (not to mention the unanimous interpretation of these words received for so many centuries), to believe that the body and blood of Christ are truly present and distributed in the supper. How this happens, as it is impervious to human reason, so I affirm it is known to faith from the word of the Lord. Since many today vary somewhat from this opinion, I sometimes hesitate and, to confess frankly, stand between the sacred and the stone. In this, I need your advice; which if I implore without regard to your dignity, you will, with your humanity, consider kindly. This indeed makes me think that nothing is not permissible for me with you. Therefore, I both ask and beseech you by Christ the Savior, that you do not hesitate to remove this scruple from me and share your advice.</p>
      <p>Farewell, the highest honor of all theologians, and live most happily. From Nozeroy in Burgundy, 17th of the calends of July in the Christian year 1544.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted disciple, Gilbert Cousin of Nozeroy.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the honor of true theology, to be respected as lord and teacher. In Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
