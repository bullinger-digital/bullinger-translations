      <p>Most illustrious man, Aurelius brought me your letters, which have almost roused me from lying down. For many things were weighing me down, and you would hardly believe, Bullinger, in how many troubles I am involved, not born from elsewhere than from false brothers, especially from those who have cast off the ill-fated cowl. May the Lord repay them. But your letters, I say, have refreshed me, for which I give you great thanks. Now, regarding England: I am indeed entirely unequal to the man of holy memory, Mr. Bucer, but I would not despair, with God's help, to bear that burden. But since mention has been made of another condition, namely that I should serve in the office of pastor in the Italian church in London, I would more willingly undertake this (if indeed I were to live in England); for in this kind of work I have been engaged longer and could accomplish more.</p>
      <p>I wrote about that orator N., who wanted to take me there with him; thus I await the outcome. I fear that perhaps these wars may be an impediment to him, preventing him from returning at the time he had planned. If that happens, I will indeed go ahead, so that I may finally see what will become of me. And since I do not expect to see you before the month of September (for such are the affairs I am now handling), I would think it advisable if in the meantime you would write back to Mr. Johannes Laski, saying that you have shared his letters with me and that I have responded, preferring the other condition, in which I would be preaching, which I wish to be reserved for me, and that I will be there shortly, either alone or with the orator N.</p>
      <p>Thus, I say, I feel; but you, Heinrich Bullinger, adorn the matter with words and your authority for your charity. For if you promise that in governing that church and in preaching, in which I feel called by God, not a small fruit will come from me (with the help of God himself), perhaps I will make it so that you do not seem to have promised in vain. Now I earnestly commend this cause to you, not indeed mine, but of many brothers and even of Christ, and write what you have done. I expect Lelio shortly; his father wrote that he would not fail him and encourages him to live outside Italy. If these letters had come in time, Lelio would not have left me; but he will return when he sees them.</p>
      <p>Italy is almost at rest from persecutions, and only the Anabaptists are being harassed. But listen to me and remember my word: I fear for this region from that plague; for those who are infected with it reign, those who are immune are oppressed and with great injustice are considered heretics. I cannot be more open; I fear, I say, nor do I write in vain nor without great sorrow. I give thanks for the news you wrote. In return, I have nothing to write.</p>
      <p>I am now entirely engaged in attacking the Pontifical, from which labor I hope some fruit will come to my Italy. I am expecting another copy of that book (I know it has been prepared) for your use. Farewell and be well with the whole family, school, and church.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, July 10, 1552.</p>
      <p>I pray, ensure that the attached letters are sent at the earliest opportunity, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
