      <p>S. A certain necessary friend, whom you know well, wrote to me on the 4th of June, that the Emperor is certainly going to stay in Augsburg until March of the next year, 1549. He also presented a formula for preserving religion to the states, which displeases many so much that there is absolutely no hope for the concord he seeks. Indeed, more conflict will erupt from this incongruous mixture than ever before, not to mention that even in the part where everything is sound and rightly taught, it greatly irritates the Roman idol. He sent me the carefully observed chapters of this book, which I am very eager for you and yours to read and understand. The leader in this whole play, as I hear, was a certain suffragan of Mainz, whose several sermons held in Augsburg are said to be printed and circulated, which I have not yet seen. Our Antronius bought some and allowed his people to read them; they are published in the vernacular language. However, I understand what kind they are from the fact that they please Antronius. Lettuce of this kind is most fitting for asinine lips, etc. He also sent two propositions, one of which the Emperor, the other Ferdinand his brother, presented to the states, I believe as a gift, and ensured they were read at the very end of the assembly. It is not enough that so many resources have been taken from Germany with a huge host of many calamities imported, unless all remaining strength and nerves with the blood of these people are exposed to their greed, demanded indeed with such splendid and honest titles, but soon to be extorted with immense tyranny.</p>
      <p>And I would like to see or at least suspect where these schemes are heading and whether they are not clear indicators of some secret alliance? I would be miserably mistaken if there is not some huge and far more venomous scorpion lying under this stone, especially in the Emperor's proposition, which I wish all the Swiss villages would thoroughly inspect!</p>
      <p>For this reason alone, I did not want you to lack them. My good friend writes to me among other things: "The people from Konstanz are also here; I have not yet learned that they have reconciled with His Majesty."</p>
      <p>Indeed, it seems to me, should the Emperor's Majesty obtain the city to his will, it would be greatly against the Confederates. Even if they are given good words, I still worry that the heart is not good."</p>
      <p>He added: "You will undoubtedly have heard how the Pope and the King of France have made an alliance with each other against the Emperor; however, only for defense, etc. Each is to lay down 7 tons of gold in cash for any incident, and other potentates may also join. What will follow from this, time will reveal." He wrote this to me quite freely and openly, contrary to custom. I did not want to conceal these things from you for many reasons.</p>
      <p>It is also believed that one should keep a good watch on the places that the Bishop of Konstanz holds on the Rhine and Lake Constance, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours and mine.</p>
      <p>I wrote this very hastily, so as not to delay the departing messenger from here [or: from your place].</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 10th of June, 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his own.</p>
