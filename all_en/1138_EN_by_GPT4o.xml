      <p>Greetings. Finally, the eggs of the basilisk have hatched, bringing us the announcement of the council, my lord and most beloved brother in Christ. The announcement of the council was indeed issued in Rome on the 18th of October, and the date is set for the 1st of May. It will be held in Trent, or rather, it will be continued there.</p>
      <p>Everything that was done in the matter of the council by Paul III is confirmed and ratified. A copy of the bull was sent to me by friends. It is carefully ensured in it that no one else is called except those who traditionally have decisive votes. It is carefully indicated that it is the role of the Roman pontiff to announce and govern councils, and that the Emperor, his most beloved son, has requested this very thing.</p>
      <p>What else shall we expect but open force? There will be no place for truth. Indeed, a certain Mutius Italus writes against Vergerius. A book has been printed in Italian, with a brief apostolic preface; the book is approved by the pontiff. In that book, it is explicitly written that the council is not convened to give heretics a chance to present their case and dispute; for in this way, the authority of all councils would be put at risk; the council is convened so that all doctrine contrary to the Roman Church is condemned and the adversaries are recalled. See what kind of council it will be; these things are certain. A good part of Germany submits to this council, which is painted to them as far more splendid, but falsely. The session, which equates traditions with scriptures, is confirmed. This is the fruit of long and laborious preaching. Therefore, the Lord will visit our sins; it will be our duty to resist the Pope and the Emperor with doctrine and prayers, steadfastly unto death. But I am so overwhelmed with writings, labors, and various cares that I can no longer do more. I wrote this very hastily. The church must be admonished and strengthened in due time.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you together with all the brothers. Zurich, January 4, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the Basel church, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
