      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you on July 26, dear compater in the Lord. Meanwhile, I have received no letters from you, which I attribute to your business, with which you are excessively burdened.</p>
      <p>I wrote about Dieterich Marcellus, whom a rumor here has spread to have been expelled by yours for some serious reasons, which I do not know, wishing to learn the truth of this matter from you. Therefore, I still ask that you do not hesitate to indicate in one or two words, through the one who delivers this, what has been done with this man.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, regarding my people in Augsburg, while the emperor came to them, I have not received a word.</p>
      <p>Indeed, there were two citizens of Bern there; however, they reported nothing of any importance except this one thing, that evangelical sermons still thrive in the midst of Babylon and that the people are in the same zeal for the word of God as they were before. If you receive anything certain from Lord Vadianus, please share it.</p>
      <p>At my home, everything is still peaceful by the grace of the Lord. My wife began to suffer from dysentery this month, not without fear of danger; however, by the Lord's kindness, whatever was bad has been beautifully removed. The Lord has had mercy on me and my house; to Him be the glory. I hope you and all yours are living happily. May the Lord preserve you.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all yours, whom mine lovingly bid to be well, likewise to the lords and brothers, Lord Pellicanus, the most pious elder, Lord Bibliander, Lord Gwalther, and the rest, and also to the dearest friend Lord Butler with his. Farewell very well, dearest compater.</p>
      <p>Bern, Switzerland, August 17, 1550.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your compater in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, compater and brother in the Lord, dearest.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
