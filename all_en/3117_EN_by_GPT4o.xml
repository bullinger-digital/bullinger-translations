      <p>S. P. Since I know, esteemed Bullinger, that you there are greatly desirous of learning something about the success of Master [or Magnificent?] Mr. a Lasco in Poland, I would not want to fail to inform you that it is indeed not entirely unfortunate and has thus far proceeded quite satisfactorily according to our wishes, although not without the remarkable resistance of Satan, who fears not a little for himself and his kingdom from him. For the authority of Mr. a Lasco is so great here in many respects that I can by no means express it in words. Therefore, he has so far gathered all his efforts and endeavors through his stipendiaries to destroy him or at least expel him from the kingdom, as you will now hear in part. When about two months ago, more or less, our bishops, who were all with the king in Warsaw at the diet of the kingdom, got wind that Mr. John a Lasco had arrived, they were the first to meet with the Archbishop of Gniezno together with Lipomano, the Bishop of Verona, the papal legate here, with secular arbiters, as they call them, removed. There they consulted the whole day on what needed to be done here to most conveniently expel Mr. Lasco from the entire kingdom; for this was their aim; for if he remains, he will be their executioner (which a certain Nicodemus affirmed the Bishop of Kraków had explicitly said), and therefore a timely remedy would be necessary. And the next day they approached the king, first Lipomano, then all the other bishops in groups: they claimed to have discovered that John a Lasco had arrived and wanted to approach the king to speak with him. Therefore, they begged and pleaded that he not admit him to an audience and turn his face away from him if he came, because he was the greatest heretic who was not tolerated anywhere in the world, and therefore now returned to his homeland... and such he had once been declared, but rather he should be expelled from the kingdom. To which the king, who is otherwise still quite timid, replied that it was indeed true that he had once been declared a heretic by you in your synods, but neither he nor the senate of the kingdom wanted to consider John a Lasco and his followers as heretics, but as Catholics, etc. Therefore, I do not see how I can accommodate you here. Then the bishops said that the king absolutely had to do this if he wanted to properly consult the tranquility of his kingdom; for there was no doubt that many disturbances and seditions would arise here if John a Lasco were tolerated here. But the king ordered them to be quiet, for their demand was unjust. They, however, insisted more and more and neither stopped nor moderated, so much so that the king, somewhat more irritated, ordered them to be silent, to be quiet, and not to bother him further in this matter. When they saw that their efforts had not succeeded with that first battering ram, they thought of another way to shake the king's mind later and attacked the king on another day with a thousand calumnies, which they had most impudently devised, asserting that Mr. a Lasco (among other things) had come to Poland to take up arms against the king, to fill everything with turmoil and seditions, that he was riding around the Bishopric of Kraków always accompanied by a hundred or two hundred horsemen and was already demolishing everything in the churches at his discretion upon his arrival, and many other things of that kind, all of which they reported so consistently and affirmed so firmly that the king began to suspect something sinister about Mr. a Lasco and became more hostile to him until he had expostulated with a certain nobleman related to Mr. a Lasco about the matter. For he told the king that everything was nothing but mere calumnies most impudently fabricated by his adversaries and that the king could persuade himself of this; for he was willing to pledge his faith and even his life as a guarantee here for the establishment of the truth. At these words, the king's mind began to soften, and he said to him: "Behold, you know that such disturbances and seditions have often been the occasion for the downfall of great kingdoms. Therefore, tell Mr. a Lasco to conduct the matter of religion peacefully among you (who are related to him by blood and affinity). He will soon see that I will have greater regard for God than for men." May God grant this by His Spirit, for the increase of His kingdom, I earnestly pray. The rest from the letters to Mr. P. Martyr. I ordered that the testament from our version, as you knew, be sent to you; whether this has been done, I do not know, and therefore I have now ordered the same again if it has not been done. I also ask that if you notice anything unworthy in that version, you inform our Micronius, which I have asked many other most learned men, some of whom I know are not unknown to you, to do. All the brothers here who have placed their efforts are also diligently going to do this; for we, setting aside all human glory, are in this so that divine truth may emerge and the glory of Christ the Lord may remain safe. In this matter, I again ask that you devote an occasional or at least an extraordinary hour or two. Furthermore, we have received letters about that Spanish Inquisition now introduced into our Flanders and also Antwerp. May God finally have mercy on our people in the Belgian region. There is also some sinister rumor about the introduction of Lutheranism in East Frisia; however, we have nothing certain yet. If there is any news there, let us know and greet Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gualter, Mr. Bernardin, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Gesner, and Mr. Zwingli in my name, whose wedding I attended, and your daughter, his wife, and farewell in Christ the Lord, to whom I commend you with your dear wife and children as a minister from the heart.</p>
      <p>Kraków, February 21, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Johannes Utenhovius.</p>
      <p>In these my writings here, you yourself can understand, my Bullinger, how much leisure I have, namely none. Therefore, you will pardon my silence now, otherwise, you will learn everything about us from these letters of our Utenhovius. Farewell and please greet all our brothers there most dutifully in my words, to whose prayers I commend myself. I am eagerly awaiting your letters, in which you will respond to what I wrote to you in Wrocław in November.</p>
      <p>John a Lasco by his own hand.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of Zürich, his perpetually honorable friend and brother. In Zürich.</p>
