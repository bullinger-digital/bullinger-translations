      <p>S. D. P. Dearly beloved lord and brother, I am compelled to inform you in a manner of complaint about what has transpired in these days, particularly concerning our current bishop. Since he has become bishop, I have written to you and my Paul about his election, which has especially delighted me. My Paul, as I suspect, showed this letter to other students in Basel, and thus the letter came into the hands of the bishop's adversaries. They have shown this letter to the Pope and the cardinals in Rome against the bishop, intending to prove him to be Lutheran, and have summoned him to Rome under the penalty of 500 ducats. The letter, as I still remember, read as follows: "Our bishop has exchanged life for death, succeeded by someone whom the bishop and the canons have proclaimed as Lutheran.</p>
      <p>He is a young man not yet anointed with papal oil; we hope he will not meditate anything against God," etc. Now I suspect the bishop and his people will be quite angry; however, I believe I have nothing to do with this. I suspect that if he swears to them according to the custom, they will bind him to many other points in an oath, etc. And hereupon is my friendly request, wishing you to advise me on how I should conduct myself in this matter and respond to this affair, etc. Hastily, Chur, April 29, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Blasius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Bullinger, the most faithful overseer of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
