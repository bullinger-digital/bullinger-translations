    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frölich thanks for the letter from Bullinger [not received], delivered by Lorenz [Meyer] and Rudolf [Schwyzer]. He will gladly be helpful and friendly to them, as well as to the other faithful church servants.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He was pleased to hear that the [Protestant] envoys were united at the [meeting in Zurich].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He had already learned of the response of the Four Cantons to [the Schmalkaldic League] [from Ulm]. Unfortunately, he does not believe that the [Schmalkaldic League] will find it useful, as they lack not soldiers, but money. Moreover, [the Schmalkaldic League] cannot hold out alone against the strong and widely supported [Charles V] in the long run. Therefore, the other Protestants should consider whether they have perhaps been sitting still for too long. In short, the [Schmalkaldic League] expects [financial] help or even an attack on their godless enemy. However, Bullinger and several of his colleagues are not to blame if this does not happen now. This is rather to be attributed to these unjust times. It is certain that the war situation has never been as dangerous as it is now. The Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] is being attacked by the Bohemians and by Duke Maurice [of Saxony], and it is feared that he will lose most of his duchy. Therefore, he is hurrying back from the field camp to his land. But then the remaining army [of the Schmalkaldic League] will be too small and too weak to resist the enemy. Hopefully, the [Schmalkaldic League], abandoned by all their friends, will not also be destroyed or forced into ungodly [peace] negotiations! It comforts Frölich, however, that God has not led him into temptation so far, but has given him steadfastness in his duties.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Frölich has confidentially asked the Elector and [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse to persuade [Francis I] to stop the [persecutions of Protestants] in France. But due to his pharaonic character, no improvement is to be expected in this regard. In any case, Bullinger should not fear an alliance with unbelieving princes [such as Francis I or Henry VIII]! It will never come to that. The previous unsuccessful negotiations only served to deceive [the Emperor].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger should pray for the [Schmalkaldic League]. Greetings, especially to Rudolf Gwalther, to whom Frölich cannot write with this post.</p>

      <p>Most trusted, dearly beloved lord and brother. I have gratefully received your letter delivered by Master Lorenz and Mr. Rudolf. I will conduct myself with the help of God in such a way towards them and all faithful church servants that they will be satisfied in a Christian and friendly manner, for it is a joy for me to do good to them and all brothers.</p>

      <p>I am pleased to hear that the honorable envoys have recently departed united and well-disposed.</p>

      <p>I have understood from afar what the Four Cantons might be inclined to do against us. In my opinion, our estates will not consider the given response particularly comforting, for it is not about the large number of soldiers, but about the maintenance. And it will not be possible for these estates to endure the matter alone against the strong, widely allied enemy in the long run. What may happen to the other confessors of the truth thereafter and whether they have not watched for too long is well worth considering. In short: Our people expected either support or that you would attack the godless enemy; if they obtain neither from you, the blame is not to be placed on you or most others, but on the injustice of the times. The cause of this war has never been as dangerous as it is now. The Elector of Saxony is being attacked by the Bohemians and Duke Maurice, so much so that it is feared he may soon lose most of his duchy. Therefore, he is hurrying home from the camp to assist his people in their afflictions, and rightly so. With the Elector departing, the others are too few and too weak to resist the enemy. May we not be forced to suffer the worst or to negotiate impiously, abandoned by all foreign friends! This alone comforts me: that the Lord has always granted me a pure mind amidst these most atrocious troubles and has never led me into temptations without me always diligently performing my duty, and I will continue to do so with His guidance. However, let there be no boasting except in the Lord.</p>

      <p>I have confidentially written to Saxony and Hesse, urging France to stop the lamentable murder of poor Christians. I hope it will happen, although I expect no improvement from this Pharaoh's race. Nor is there any reason to greatly fear an alliance with some impious princes. What has been done between them and us so far were mere tricks and therefore fell into oblivion.</p>

      <p>At this time, nothing more than praying to God, the Father in heaven, faithfully for us. Indeed, it is necessary. Greet everyone for me and tell my dearly beloved lord and brother Rudolf Gwalther my greetings and service. I could not write to him now. Dated, November 8, 1546. G. Laetus, yours as much as I can be.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc., to be delivered in Zurich.</p>
