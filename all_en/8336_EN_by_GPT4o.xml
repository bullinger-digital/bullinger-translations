      <p>Greetings in Christ. I have received your German homilies, for which I thank you. I still understand writings in German well enough; for I have labored much in learning your language; but I have lost the practice of speaking it.</p>
      <p>I delivered the pension of Julius Santerentianus to Richard Hilles a month ago, so that he might ensure it is paid to Froschauer at the next Frankfurt fair. I hope you have received my letters, which I sent to the spring fair. Meanwhile, it has seemed good to our most serene queen to transfer me from this city to the See of York, where matters are not so well established.</p>
      <p>In the region of York and Durham (as I recently wrote), there arose last winter a rebellion of the nobles and peasants to restore the papacy. Indeed, many there were subjected to the ultimate punishment: nevertheless, I hear that the minds of the common people are very much embittered, and they are eager for new disturbances. What awaits me there, therefore, I do not know. But if new troubles arise there, it cannot be otherwise than that I, along with my dearest brother Lord Pilkington, the Bishop of Durham, will be in the greatest danger. However, these things do not move me: may the will of the Lord be done! I mention these things, however, so that you may commend us and our ministry to the Lord all the more fervently in your prayers.</p>
      <p>When I was writing this, I was almost ready to set out on the journey towards York: I could not, therefore, write to you more extensively at this time. Our affairs, by the grace of God, are quite peaceful. At the beginning of last May, our army entered Scotland under the leadership of the Earl of Sussex, to pursue our rebels and their supporters in Scotland. Within a few days, our forces overthrew 50 castles in Scotland by placing gunpowder, and burned 300 villages without resistance.</p>
      <p>Scotland is now quite pacified; but perhaps this is because our queen maintains an army at the borders of Scotland: for otherwise, those who stand by the Queen of Scots, who is still in our custody, seem to be planning new things. Now the royalists prevail, and they have elected the Earl of Lennox, the grandfather of the boy king, as regent: who has taken upon himself the defense of religion and the king. York is 160 English miles from this city: I will not be able to send letters to you as conveniently as I used to. Nevertheless, I will write from time to time, even if they are delivered to you more slowly, and I will eagerly await yours.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus preserve your piety safe for us and for His church, truly venerable and dearest brother in the Lord! London, the last day of July, 1570.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, Edmund of York.</p>
      <p>I pray that you greet your colleagues in my name, and especially Mr. Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
