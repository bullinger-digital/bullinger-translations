    <p xml:id="regest1">Johannes Stumpf has come to St. Gallen with three [manuscript] books [Books 3-5 of the "Swiss Chronicle"] about the Frankish kings and the [St. Gallen] abbots. Vadian and he have compared the entire [material] with each other and have especially discussed the arrangement, the topics, and the chronological order in detail. Vadian had treated all German-Frankish kings, who occupied the Gallic lands, in their [chronological] order with brief historical notes. Since Stumpf had already done this as well, Vadian will not improve his own work. However, Stumpf took Vadian's work with him to possibly use information from it for his treatise on the [Frankish] kings. Vadian, in turn, was allowed to keep Stumpf's manuscripts to ensure that his work on the St. Gallen abbots and his description of the city of St. Gallen did not present the same as Stumpf. Vadian also lent Stumpf material about the Frankish kings so that Stumpf could improve his presentation for critical readers. - Stumpf is a man of inexhaustible erudition and such a prompt memory that he seems born for this work. This work will be all the more welcome as Stumpf, a foreigner [from Bruchsal], takes on the history of the Helvetians not out of ambition, but solely out of a pursuit of truth. - Vadian wishes Bullinger, his wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], the children, the [Zurich] college [of pastors], and the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab] all the best. - He asks for news about the atrocities committed by Emperor [Charles V] and his advisors. From a letter [not received] from his brother-in-law [Bartholomäus Steck], a merchant, Vadian learned today that all the estates agree that [nothing will be paid by] the [Protestants for the Swabian League] unless [they] are guaranteed peace. They will not finance the war directed against them by their mortal enemies! Some suspect that Pope [Paul III] has promised the Emperor much [to proceed against the Protestants]. However, it will probably be easier to prevent the Emperor from doing so than to bring Germany back under the yoke of the popes. May Germany not be deprived of its old freedom! Meanwhile, Vadian sends with all due confidentiality a recently addressed letter to him from Martin Frecht [Vadian BW VI 425-432, No. 1404]. From this, Bullinger will gather what some [like Melanchthon] write, who not too long ago gave him to understand the opposite. But one must accept all human things as fluctuating and judge them with the commandment of neighborly love.</p>

      <p>Johannes Stumpf, a man of the highest quality, has come to St. Gallen and brought with him three books, in which he accurately mentions both the ancient Frankish kings and our local abbots. We have therefore very pleasantly compared everything, exchanging and mutually sharing the efforts of our work, and we have diligently discussed what seemed best to do regarding the order, the places to be treated, and the sequence of times to be drawn out. I had outlined all the Germanic Frankish kings, who occupied the Gallic lands, in continuous order, adding a history of all times, which seemed suitable to our purpose, and I was about to correct the material I had begun to describe, had he not anticipated me in another manner and order, but with the same accuracy, as I said. It was agreed, therefore, that he would take my kings and read them, and if he found anything observed by me that could be useful, he would transfer it into his own work, while I, in the meantime, would complete the domestic history of the abbots, so to speak, adding at the same time a description of our city, which I believe no one could provide better than I. To ensure I did not repeat anything unnecessarily, he left me his books, so that what he had said once, I would not repeat in vain. In return, he took away a leather bag filled with ancient letters and records, as well as books of deeds by the Franks, which I had lent him, so that he might have the opportunity to read and select, lest anything be desired by the more critical in such a just and arduous work.</p>
      <p>Stumpf is indeed a man of tireless reading and a memory so prompt and clear in his entire work that he seems born for this task. This entire work will be more pleasing to rightly disposed readers, if I am not mistaken, because he, born far from our homeland and as if entering a foreign forum, has undertaken to describe the deeds of the Helvetians and the events of the Middle Ages with no ambitious intent, but with a singular pursuit of truth. I wish you well with your holy wife and beloved children; I also wish your college to be safe in the Lord and your most distinguished mayors.</p>
      <p>If you have any news about the Emperor and the counselors of abomination, please let me know, I pray. From a letter from my brother-in-law, a merchant, I learned today that all the estates are entirely in agreement that nothing will be paid to the brothers unless peace is offered and agreed upon. May they pursue this with the most resolute minds! They are insane who pay a deadly enemy so that he does not cease to be an enemy. Some think that this will of the Emperor, not to say of the Emperor's men, has been obtained from the Pope with the greatest promises, from which, however, it would be easier to lead the Emperor away than to bring Germany to submit to the papal yoke. May Germany, oh may it, dear Bullinger, continue to look upon itself, illustrious with such long and ancestral freedom, with tears, and finally continue to decide that it is better to try the utmost than to submit its noble neck, persuaded by the arts of venal men, to the most disgraceful servitude. Meanwhile, I have decided to send you a letter recently written to me by Martin Frecht, with the most sacred bond of faith, so that nothing may leak from it. You will see what they write to others, who not so long ago signified to you quite the opposite. But we must bear the counsels of men, however they may vary, and measure all things by the rule of charity. Farewell again and return the letters themselves when you have sufficiently used them. St. Gallen, the day after the Nones of July, in the year 1545. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the city of Zurich, most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
