      <p>Finally, your letter, which you sent to me on August 8, has been delivered to me. I am grateful to you and to our esteemed brother Gwalter for the translation of that booklet, which I know will be most pleasing to Amiralio. Whatever expenses have been incurred in this matter, once you inform me, they will be reimbursed. I am glad to hear you are feeling somewhat better, and I pray to the Lord to restore you to us completely. We have already lost that incomparable man, Mr. Martyr. Mr. Musculus followed. May the Lord look upon us in his instruments, which we will only realize how rare they are once they are lost. Our Calvin, freed from the stone for a time, is now struggling with gout for a whole month, so afflicted in body that whenever I see him (and I see him daily), I am in need of consolation. I cannot sufficiently marvel at the impudence of that subscriber you wrote to me about. For is it more disgraceful to have subscribed to that doctrine, which almost no one is unaware he has always secretly favored, or to have advised others to do what he himself does not approve? But what displeases me more is the slowness of our people. For what need is there for long deliberation when the crime is sufficiently evident? And as far as I am concerned, I never think he would have dared to do this unless he had timely provided himself with a remedy. Therefore, I hardly think anything else has happened in these regions that should be less concealed or more urgently pressed: because otherwise, the evil will spread so that soon no remedy will be tolerated. I have written two responses in these tumultuous days, one against the most depraved apostate Balduin, who is now overthrowing churches in Flanders from their foundations, the other to Castellio's accusations. I send both to you, but especially the one most wickedly excused. You will read them when you please. There you will see what a monster the Basel brothers have nourished for so long, to whom I have dedicated my response for this very reason, so that they may finally understand what they are achieving with their softness. For if it is determined to foster these monsters in our midst any longer, no one can fail to see where this will lead. What you warned about the Brentian catechism, you did rightly, my father, and you have testified to your paternal benevolence towards the French churches as is your custom. For which, as is fitting, I am grateful to you on behalf of all. The Lord must be asked above all not to allow access to these satanic furies. We have diligently admonished the brothers. And this I dare to promise you, relying on God's kindness, my father, that he will hardly or not at all find anyone in the French churches, not only among Christians but even among Papists, who will not abhor that Eutychian dogma. The only fear is from some courtiers, who perhaps will seize this opportunity to incite the young king against us as if we were abominable to all, and from some itinerant monks, who, since they are kept away from true pastors, now wander everywhere, so that in such a scarcity of pastors they may invade the Lord's flock. But nevertheless, I fully hope that these efforts of Satan will also be in vain, and we will diligently watch that nothing is sinned through negligence. Furthermore, what is now reported to us from France is this: They say it will certainly be that the edict will be obtained. The king's maturity has been declared at Rouen. Therefore, the king, now using his own right, was setting out for Paris at the end of the month, with ten thousand foot soldiers and about two thousand horsemen: where we hope he will settle everything, and from there he is said to be about to traverse the kingdom with his forces. But he is a boy, you will say. I admit, I see how many things are to be feared. But in summary, although I think even tyranny is more tolerable, the Lord will provide. There is still great confusion in many places. Various rumors are spread about a most pernicious conspiracy. War between the French and the English is already breaking out. What will happen, only God knows. Meanwhile, it is decided for the pastors to proceed and commit everything to God. It is not surprising that a new soldier is being recruited in Lucerne, since neither that war can be managed nor the rebels restrained without external forces, and very few remain from that old Swiss army. Therefore, when I read what you wrote to our Calvin about their arrogance, it came to my mind the proverb of one of our vernaculars, that they are born proud for beatings. Let them win, my father, let them win as much as they want. But to omit pestilence and other scourges, I can affirm to you as an eyewitness, that in that battle of ours they indeed resisted bravely, but they were so broken, cut down, and crushed by our horsemen, that they could have moved even the devil to mercy. Therefore, if they do not want to rest, may they never obtain more successful victories. The Guises are now said to have gone to court to ask the king for the right to speak against Amiralio. This, as I hope, Amiralio will never refuse, and if it is contested by law, the decision of the controversy will be easy. Otherwise, there is no doubt that great tumults will arise, which may the Lord so moderate that they may bring destruction to his enemies and consolation and refreshment to all the servants of God. Certainly, unless that accursed family is utterly overthrown, I hardly hope for peace in France. Whatever we hear, we will immediately write to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, and take care of your health. May the Lord Jesus preserve you and bless your holy labors more and more.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Simler, Mr. Lavater, Mr. Gesner, and all the most esteemed brothers and fellow ministers who are there, I wish to be greeted in my name as courteously as possible.</p>
      <p>Geneva, September 9.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed father, pastor of the church in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
