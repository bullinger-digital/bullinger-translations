      <p>S. D. I do not think you are ill or lacking messengers who could bring your letters, dear brother, to us; therefore, I wonder why it is that you have not written anything for a full three weeks. I also have not sent any to you; for I had nothing to write. But you cannot use this excuse, as you could have written about the business of the three envoys returning from Milan. I hear they have returned, but without Francesco, who has been handed over to the most savage beasts, the inquisitors; hence I am fully convinced that it is already over with him. But the Lord will preserve those who hope in Him, and it is most salutary to be taken from this world.</p>
      <p>If in the meantime you have learned what was done in the legation, please write what it is.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, as I await what I might be able to write to you about matters happening elsewhere, I receive letters from the Strasbourg fair written from England on June 19; they are from the most reverend Bishop of London. He indicates that the affairs of the English are in a good and happy state. Now at last the disturbances in Scotland are settled; for on May 2, the Queen of Scotland escaped from prison to Hamilton Castle. There she gathers leaders to reclaim the kingdom.</p>
      <p>The governor is present and scatters and routs those forces on May 13. The Queen with a few escapes to the city of Carlisle in England; from there she petitions the Queen of England to help her and restore her to the kingdom. But the Queen of Scotland is being held in custody; for she is sought for punishment by the governor of Scotland; she is also sought by the King of France for liberation. The Queen of England has not yet granted her to either. We will hear shortly what will happen. In the Netherlands, after the massacre and defeat suffered by the Spaniards, Duke Alba rages with impatience at the misfortune; for it is said that notable Spaniards and their leaders fell there.</p>
      <p>Therefore, on June 5 in Brussels, he orders the execution of the captured Belgian nobles and heroes, most of them, including Egmond, Horn, the Counts of Battenberg, d. a Wyllers, and about 50 others, among whom he also intercepted some young men, perhaps 15 years old, sons of heroes. With these matters settled, he advances with 17 banners to Antwerp, also intending to slaughter there; but in Antwerp, he received news that is said to have greatly saddened him. Therefore, he killed no one there, but on the fourth day after his arrival, he departed towards Groningen, ordering all garrisons to converge there. It is also said that there was fighting again, namely before he set out from Antwerp, in minor skirmishes, in which about 600 Spaniards fell; 13 banners of Walloons and Groningen surrendered to Prince William of Orange and his brother, Louis of Nassau.</p>
      <p>It is also said that new troops are joining the prince and two thousand German cavalry are joining Duke Alba. Everyone thinks that with the forces and banners gathered, a battle must be fought or has already been fought. If I receive any certain information about this matter, I will write to you again.</p>
      <p>Now I wish you well. Greet the honorable consuls, Mr. Karl, Mr. Pontisella, Ganthner, and all our people. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 23, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your senior Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
