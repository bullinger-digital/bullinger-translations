    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Unfortunately, Gast had to gather from Bullinger's letter [not received] that he did not receive the book with the satires of Persius. The copy came from his own library because it was not available at the booksellers. His letters to Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander, as well as Gilbert Cousin's letters to Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther, were also enclosed! The package was entrusted to Michael Vesalius [Michael Martin Stella], a lecturer at the Froben press. Either he lost the bundle on the way, or he stole it (to read the letters), or he was killed by robbers. He was a devout follower of the Gospel, who therefore had to leave his homeland. What could have happened? </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Gast's letters only conveyed some rumors. However, Gast does not know what Cousin wrote. Certainly, his letters were not insignificant and should not have fallen into the hands of enemies of the truth. But what to do? Stella no longer appears, does not write, and no one knows where he is! He wanted to go to Italy and meet Bullinger on the way. But now it is clear that he never arrived in Zurich! Johannes Fries knows him well, as he was also a lecturer with Johannes Oporin. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Bullinger should inform Cousin of the loss of his letter caused by deceit. Perhaps Cousin has a draft of it. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] Gast would have much to report, but this will probably be done by Myconius based on Bucer's letter to him. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] A report sent to Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard about the Augsburg Diet was also copied. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Emperor Charles V received 800 horses from the Netherlands. Eight Hanseatic cities still remain true to the truth. May the Lord grant them steadfastness! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> [7] Greetings. More soon, also about the events in Basel. Currently, the city is being haunted by the devil. A girl [...] from Lucerne recently danced for five days and nights. Now she is in the hospital and tells what she claims to have seen at night when she was carrying water home. On October 27, a young man [...] was struck by pain. Suddenly he began to dance. Completely astonishing! There are different views on this disease, and people wonder if it is not identical to the St. Vitus' or St. John's disease. There is also disagreement about the remedies. It is probably a test from the Lord, for in all the 20 years [of his work in Basel], Gast has never seen anything like it! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest8"> [8] Today, the venerable and dutiful old Hans Heinrich Winkeli died. Hieronymus Gunz's wife [...] is seriously ill with the plague, and there is hardly any hope for her. God's will be done! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest9"> [9] What does Bullinger think of this dance mania? Gast asked the doctors in Basel, but they found nothing about it. One claimed that Hippocrates mentions it in his writing "De sacro morbo" and qualifies it as incurable. Gast would forbid the people affected by it from jumping and dancing. He would have them locked up, and if they continue to act foolishly, have them brought to the church in chains and encourage the faithful to pray for them. Then surely the devil would immediately disappear into hell! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest10"> [10] Gast will try to track down the Persius edition at a Frankfurt book fair. There is no copy of it in Basel. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest11"> [11] Greetings. Gast and his wife Apollonia [née Glaser] send their regards to Anna [née Adlischwyler]. The persecution is imminent and will be even worse than in the times of Eusebius! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest12"> [12] Bullinger, write again! </p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received and read your letters with sadness, in which I understood that you did not receive the book of Persius, for which I stripped my library, as it was not available at the booksellers, nor the letters written to you and Theodor, nor the letters of our cousin sent both to you and to Gwalther! I sent all these through the Froben lecturer, Michael Vesalius, enclosed in one package. Either he lost the package of letters on the way, or he kept it for himself wanting to explore our plans and writings, or he was killed by robbers. For he was a good man, devoted to the word of the Gospel and an exile for the sake of the Gospel. I do not know how this could have happened.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I wrote in my letters to you and to Theodor about various rumors, and I do not know what is in the letters of our Gilbert. I do not doubt that they are matters not to be despised, which he would not want to be spread and fall into the hands of the enemies of the truth. But what should I do now, since Michael does not appear anywhere, writes nothing, and no one knows where he is. He wanted to go to Italy and greet you, to form a friendship with you, but I understand that he was not in Zurich. Our Frisius knows him well, for he was also a lecturer of Oporinus. Therefore, you should excuse me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You should write to Gilbert that you did not receive the letters sent, but that they were suppressed by someone's deceit. Perhaps he still retains a copy at home, so that he can remind you again about this matter and what he wrote. I wanted to say these few things to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I would have sent some news, but Myconius will perhaps write a few things that he received from Bucer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Some describe the whole matter as it was written to Duke George about those diets.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Emperor received 800 horsemen from the Belgians. Eight maritime cities still remain steadfast in asserting the truth. May the Lord grant them the spirit of perseverance!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell. Soon I will write more extensively about what is happening with us. For Satan tempts us in various ways. Recently, a girl from Lucerne danced for almost five continuous days and nights. Now she is in the hospital, telling various things she saw at night when she was carrying water home. Also, on October 27, a certain young man was afflicted. He began to dance. A strange and astonishing thing! Various opinions are heard about these diseases from the common people, whether it is the disease of St. Vitus or St. John. And they devise various remedies. God tests us with these things, as I have not seen anything like this in 20 years.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Today, the venerable and pious old man Hans Heinrich Winkeli has passed away. The wife of Guntius is gravely ill with the plague. Many despair of her recovery. May the Lord's will be done!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I would like you to write to me about what kind of disease this madness is, which moves people to dance. I consulted our doctors. They have no place in the medical texts about this disease. One said that Hippocrates writes in a certain place about sacred diseases, which are incurable by human aid. I would not allow them to dance, nor permit them to lead dances! I would confine these people, then bring them to the church bound, if they wanted to act insane, and admonish the people to cry out to the Lord with pure prayers for the salvation of this afflicted person, and I think that Satan would immediately depart to the place of the damned, etc. I await your opinion on this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Moreover, I will procure Persius from the Frankfurt book fair so that you may have it, as none is available with us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Farewell. On October 28, 1547. Greet your sweetest wife in my name and my wife's name. The cross is at the door, and persecution is more cruel than in the time of Eusebius, and it has never been, unless all things deceive me. Farewell again and again. Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Write back!</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, etc. Zürich.</p>
