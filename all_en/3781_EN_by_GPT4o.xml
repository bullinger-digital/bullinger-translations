      <p>I did not want to let Lord Fabricius leave without my letter to you, so that you would be informed that I have received the letters you gave him, and that you may be assured that the previous ones and what you wrote will be of great concern to me, and I will not overlook anything in them. The Lord usually restrains the insolence and pride of impious men.</p>
      <p>You will learn about other matters and those that are being spread in Basel from Lord Fabricius, whom I would have gladly gratified in some matter. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, the last day of November.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Laberius.</p>
      <p>I greet Mr. Walter and Martyr and commend my son to them.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
