      <p> Greetings. I have read and re-read all those things of yours, which I am sending back through the bookseller Antronium, and I have explained them to our council with as much diligence as I could. They have instructed me to express gratitude to your Humanity, and I do not doubt that they will reward you with some kind of beneficence, even if you are reluctant. We are now awaiting the outcome of the assembly and the response of the other cantons; we pray diligently to the Lord that it may be favorable. Farewell, and if you have anything that is worth knowing, write back. I have faithfully transmitted your regards to Georg Laetus. Frechtus is still held in chains at Egg with some fellow believers and his brother, the shoemaker, who, because he consoled the captured one a bit too boldly, was also seized and is held in the same prison. May the Lord strengthen them. </p>
      <p> Amen. I would have sent those acts sooner; but there was no one to whom I could safely entrust these things. Therefore, I hope you will attribute the delay not to negligence, but to diligence, as I sent them a little later than you wished. </p>
      <p> It is certainly true that the imperial party in Italy has recently captured the city of Siena with swift cunning and has stationed 1500 Spaniards there for reinforcement. The reason for this, it is said, is that the Emperor wants to preempt the Pope in all matters with the help of the cities of Florence, Pisa, and Lucca, so that he cannot and may not provide any assistance to the French in Piedmont. He also intends to arm a fleet in Naples, so that he dares to move less, etc. </p>
      <p> It is also written that Don Ferdinand Gonzaga is showing himself to be quite defiant regarding Piedmont, which the Emperor knows well how to handle, etc. </p>
      <p> There is no other reason why he is urging the Duke of Savoy to recruit among the Swiss, so that they may allow the Pays de Vaud to be returned. For if he were to bring this region and these dangerous Spanish plans into his clutches at this time, then Switzerland and France would be so divided that no part could send any help to the other without great organized force, much less could they send provisions and other such things. Then we would be in the sack for the sake of a single grain of salt, and people and property would have to perish. </p>
      <p> Furthermore, fresh letters have arrived from Antwerp, indicating a significant betrayal that has arisen in the Kingdom of England and broke out on the 16th of January in a remarkable way. The admiral there has arranged a swift plot to murder the young King Edward along with his protector (who is indeed his own brother) and his eldest stepsister (who is the Emperor's sister's daughter) all at once, and to proclaim himself king by marrying the youngest sister. However, this failed, and he was captured with many others, and much stolen property was found with him. Who initiated the plot will be revealed in time. The Pope is suspected, the French are suspected. But it is believed that the Emperor wanted to throw the sister's daughter into the fray, since the king had previously repudiated the mother, and to remove this young king, so that someone might rise up, against whom one could take revenge on account of the sister and cousin, and perhaps come behind the English crown. </p>
      <p> However, the true instigators will surely be found. I sincerely congratulate the English Gospel on that most fortunate detection of parricide. It is also said that Prince Philip is very ill and the Emperor is not healthy. The diet at Ulm has once again dissolved without resolution. What the reason might be, no one knows. </p>
      <p> Perhaps there is something present that wants to hinder many plans. Nevertheless, it is worth watching and observing. </p>
      <p> Joachim Vadianus. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, president of the noble city of Zurich, always to be honored and respected as a friend. </p>
