      <p>On the day before the calends of December, I wrote to you through Johannes Ulmius, my dearest relative, hoping that soon I would receive letters from both you and him. But neither of you has sent anything in the meantime, while I wait, although, as far as you are concerned, my dear Bullinger, the cause of such a long silence was neither trivial nor implausible, namely your illness, with which you struggled gravely and at great risk to your life, if I hear correctly. I learned this late, that is, only when they first announced that you had beautifully recovered again. Blessed be the Lord, who, in His immense kindness, has given you not to yourself, for whom a far happier fate awaited in heaven, but to us and the churches of Christ. May He ensure that the rest, however much it is, of your life is entirely devoted to His glory and the salvation of the members of Christ, as indeed the past was also destined to bravely extend the boundaries of His kingdom.</p>
      <p>All is silent with us, and they think that the war will incline with greater force towards Italy, that is, the one waged between the Emperor and the French, while the German one will be put to rest, unless perhaps the monstrous ingratitude of this most corrupt age of ours deserves otherwise.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand is attempting a reconciliation between Maurice and Johann Friedrich, the princes of Saxony, and many others are helping his efforts as much as they can; for if this does not proceed, it is certain that the most wretched and imminent calamity threatens all of Saxony. The Bishop of Magdeburg and the recently restored Bishop of Hildesheim are diligently promoting the sincere profession of the gospel among their people; may the Lord strengthen them with the power of His spirit and further encourage them as they run. The French seem to be waging war not so much with the Emperor as with God Himself; we hear of so many fires kindled against the saints in France, and even that the king himself has recently thrown a man of the highest nobility and his most Christian wife into chains, and many are still held in prisons in Lyon, whose unyielding constancy through God's power should be commended daily in the prayers of all churches. Ah, how our affairs have fallen, that those who wish to be greeted with the most Christian title are the most hostile enemies of Christ. These princely bishops are contemplating a new and never-to-be-broken alliance among themselves with the strongest reasons, so that they may not become prey to any ill-disposed enemy, as they have been vexed by every corrupt prince or count, as this and the past year. May Christ, the best preserver of covenants, gather His scattered sheep, that is, the children of God, and avenge the unbearable injuries of the whole world in due time, and may He graciously deem us worthy to be among them, in which I wish you, with your whole household and all friends and brothers, especially the fellow ministers, to fare eternally well, as I earnestly desire to obtain from Him.</p>
      <p>Witenbach, Fuchs, Dr. Jacob, my Funck, and the others, etc., greet you and respectfully commend themselves to you. Farewell again and again, my dearest and best Bullinger, my soul. If Johannes Ulmius is there, greet him lovingly on my behalf. February 28.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable lord and friend.</p>
