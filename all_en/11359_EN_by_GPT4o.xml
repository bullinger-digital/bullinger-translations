    <p xml:id="regest1">Wishes well-being; they are doing well. It is said that as soon as the [Arch-]Bishop of Lund [Johann von Weeze] returns, the Nuremberg Religious Discussion will take place; both sides have high expectations. Ambrosius [Blarer] has not written, but according to Bonifacius [Wolfhart], he is appreciated in Augsburg; when he will return home is still uncertain. Vadian has given a detailed response to the writings of Schwenckfeld sent to him; Zwick will send Bullinger the letter if Vadian agrees to its release. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I hope you and the brothers are well, dearest Bullinger. We also are well, thanks to the Lord's favor.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new at hand, except that it is consistently affirmed that with the return of the Bishop of Lund, the Nuremberg Convention will proceed, and there is great expectation from both sides regarding it. May the Lord bring this plan to a good outcome.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius writes nothing from Augsburg; Bonifacius writes how grateful he is, which everyone attests to. We have nothing certain about his return.</p>
      <p>I recently sent Vadian two booklets by Schwenckfeld, in which he denies Christ as a creature, to which he responded very learnedly with a rather long letter to me, which, if he consents to its publication, I will send to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with my excellent father Pellican and the other brothers. I wish the whole household well.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, 11th October 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my dearest brother.</p>
