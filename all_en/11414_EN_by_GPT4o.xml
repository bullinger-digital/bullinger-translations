    <p xml:id="regest1">He has not written to him since his arrival in Strasbourg one and a half years ago and recently let Erasmus [Schmid] depart without a letter, so he is now making up for what was missed. The cultivation of friendly relations between the churches is a great concern to him. The fact that the harmony between the Zurich and Strasbourg people is imperfect has to do with the mistrust that goes back to the dispute [about the Concord of the Lord's Supper]; the Zurich people should not doubt the sincerity of the Strasbourg people - not only Capito's, but also Bucer's - and should seek communion with them. He does not want to comment on the subject of the dispute, but would like to discuss with him what still stands in the way of agreement, and asks him to avoid anything that could cause discord. He sends greetings to him and his colleagues. He recommends the travelers from France who are delivering the letter.</p>

      <p>Grace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, my esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>I do not know how it happened that for almost a year and a half since I came here, I have not sent you any letters at all: although I often intended to do so, had no lack of subject matter, and opportunities were presented more than once. But since in the first months it did not come to mind, and some time had already passed, as if the opportunity was lost, I became more negligent in the future. Recently, however, when your Erasmus, while he was here with us, offered me his service to carry letters if I wished to write, I eagerly seized what I most desired. Therefore, I promised to write. However, because I returned home late from his inn, and he had decided to leave the next morning, I did not want to delay his departure, although he was ready to wait, if only I had indicated that it pleased me.</p>
      <p>But the more willing he was to oblige, the more I was ashamed to ask him, especially since I could send letters to Basel three days later, from where they could easily be delivered to you. Although that opportunity also slipped away from me, I thought nevertheless that I should at some point do what I had delayed for too long.</p>
      <p>But what else, my Bullinger, should we do at this time by writing, than to preserve and strengthen our brotherly friendship by all means possible? For we see how important it is, not only for us but for the entire Christian name, that all those to whom the Lord has assigned any role in His church, conspire together in true agreement. Satan himself also sees this, who, while plotting the destruction of the kingdom of Christ by all means, focuses on nothing more than sowing dissensions among us, or at least alienating some from others in any way. Therefore, it is our duty to counteract such schemes, and the more our enemy strives to disrupt our union, the more we must strive with steadfast spirit and diligent care to foster it. While we must diligently ensure that we cultivate fellowship and friendship with all ministers of Christ, we must especially strive with all our strength to ensure that the churches to which we administer the word of the Lord faithfully agree among themselves. I am confident that the friendship between us, which was initiated under such auspices and is now sustained by such supports, will remain safe and intact to the end.</p>
      <p>I certainly, as much as it is in me, promise to make every effort to ensure it remains firm. For since I have always held you in the highest regard, I have embraced you with singular affection, as was fitting, and I will never cease to have this disposition towards you. Although I see that there is no discord or enmity between this church and yours, I would wish for more connection, or rather necessity, between us. However, I do not dare to determine why they do not adhere to each other as I desire, except that I notice the remnants of that unfortunate contention cling too much to our minds. Hence many unfavorable suspicions, which, once they have occupied us, no solid friendship can exist or endure long between us. I dare to promise and even pledge on behalf of ours that they desire nothing more than to sincerely cultivate brotherly friendship with you, having laid aside all discord: then they seek no other bond of concord than the pure truth of God. Regarding Capito's sincerity, since I believe it is well known to you, I will not say much. I will answer for Bucer, that there is no reason why he should be suspect to you in any matter. Although he is endowed with singular insight and acumen of judgment, there is no one who more religiously strives to remain in the simplicity of the word of God, and I do not say less seeks but more hates arguments foreign to it.</p>
      <p>Now if you find anything lacking in him, with his modesty and affability, he will not only endure being admonished by you but even reproved, if necessary. Just show that you desire that communication with us which should exist among the servants of Christ. There is nothing for me to discuss with you about the controversy itself. For it is a matter that can hardly be settled by letters. And I might perhaps seem to act rashly and arrogantly if I dared to attempt anything in that kind. Yet I often cannot restrain myself from wishing that I might be given some opportunity to discuss and debate this question with you in person. For you know that I have never discussed it with you in such a way that I could know what prevents full agreement between us. However, because I feel that whatever it is, it is unworthy to be the cause of dissension between us, I ask you, my Bullinger, or rather I implore you again and again, that we be completely free from all hatred and contention, and even from any appearance of offense. You will forgive my anxiety. For I do not say this because I doubt your prudence, or your will, or the firmness and constancy of your mind, but love has this peculiarity, that while it hopes for everything, it is nevertheless not without anxiety.</p>
      <p>Then if you consider how many dangers surround and besiege us from all sides, especially in this unfortunate age of ours, I hope you will grant a place, not to mention pardon, to this simplicity of mine. Farewell, most learned and upright man. Please greet all the brothers for me with reverence, Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Megander, and others whom I sincerely venerate in the Lord. May you not hesitate to admonish me freely as well. Strasbourg, March 12.</p>
      <p>Your Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, my truly esteemed brother.</p>
