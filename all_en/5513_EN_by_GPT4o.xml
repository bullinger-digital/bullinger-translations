      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>A short while ago, both in a public and private capacity, I sent letters to you, venerable brothers in the Lord, in which I informed you about the disturbances caused by the Stancarians here, and I also sent a booklet by Stancarus, from which you can judge for yourselves that he breathes nothing but Sabellius the Jew concerning the Trinity and Nestorius concerning the mediator. There are many who do not recognize his error concerning the Trinity, indeed they agree with him.</p>
      <p>Concerning the mediator, they truly wish to appear to think piously with us, but they do not see this due to their being deceived by his tricks, as they embrace one head with him, they also share the rest in common.</p>
      <p>Moreover, they defend themselves in your name and strive to introduce Stancarus covered with your cloak, and thus they deceive many poor souls. Therefore, it will be your duty to drive Stancarus far from you, to expose his Sabellianism, and to support those who look to you as a guiding anchor, so that they do not fall into his traps and become ensnared. Some even arm themselves against us in your name, to shed our blood; it is entirely your duty, as much as it is in you, to calm these matters and indeed quickly, lest delay be harmful to many good and pious people. I do not say to respond without good deliberation, but let no regard for men or glory or anything of the sort, which often turns us away from good, hold you back. I know that many have erred in the explanation of many places in Scripture, which these disciples of Stancarus draw for themselves; but let us remember that we are men, only the prophets, Christ, and the apostles have heavenly and most true doctrine without any exception, others can err who depart from the foundation.</p>
      <p>Therefore, let it not be troublesome or shameful to retract if anything has been erred; let the truth and glory of God be more important to us than our own reputation, which is also nothing where God does not have his honor. But if some will be ashamed to retract their own and do not want to be recognized by men, let them not doubt that others will retract, just as we have trampled underfoot the trifles of the scholastics and rejected many deliriums of the fathers, with their shame, we have cast down transubstantiations with other fictions to the infernal regions.</p>
      <p>Others will certainly do this in our writings, which we have not expunged or marked. There are certainly many things in the article on the Trinity, which are held and defended by sophists and scholastics. I am surprised that the word of God does not suffice for us in the article of eternal life, when it suffices in all other articles; we say we are content with the word of God alone, that everything is in it, that we need nothing else. Meanwhile, I do not know why we do not seize something from the doctrine of the scholastics, and we obscure the most open light of the word of God: here God is taken essentially, here personally and similar things. Is not one God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is not one the Son of God, that is, true God from true God, as also the Son of Man, that is, true man from true man, is not one the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of both and true God? Who does not understand the Scripture speaking of God the Father, who is always called God without the epithet of Father or sometimes with the epithet of Father? Who does not understand the Scripture speaking of the Son of God, Christ, when always speaking of him with open indications, or when it also speaks of the Holy Spirit? What need is there here for God essential or personal? Stancarus turns the holy Trinity into nothing else and denies the Son of God, God from God, and compels many to this unless by his Scottish trifles, personated essence, personal and essential God. If he spoke in the words of Scripture, he would also embrace the Trinity, which the word of God hands down to us, he could never achieve what he now does.</p>
      <p>One God the Father, one Son of God Christ, one Holy Spirit. He will not be able to pour out these things, which the Scripture so clearly declares; he will not be allowed to abolish the double one, one, so that he may bind these three with a simple one; he will not find it said in Scripture: one is three, but three are one. Indeed, just as he will not confuse God the Father with the Son of God, that is, God begotten from God, then the Holy Spirit proceeding, so that one is who are three, so it will always be easy to find in the true Trinity the mediator, the Son of God, the Word made flesh, to that God, who is the Father, whom he will certainly not find if one is. For the mediator, the Son of God, is another God and another is he to whom he mediates, God the Father, of the same nature or deity, so that they are homoousios, of the same eternity, power, majesty, etc. However, nature does not make it so that three are one; for each of the three is by nature God; but the Father is simply called God or one God, because he is not begotten by anyone, Christ however is God, because he is the Son of God, that is, begotten from God, as also man, because he is begotten from man, the Holy Spirit however proceeding. Therefore, when Stancarus confuses these three and says that the Trinity is one God, where a mediator cannot be, because he is one, but it is necessary to seek a mediator outside the Trinity, a man, who mediates to this one God, the Trinity, we respond that he confuses the Trinity and thus abolishes the Son of God, God from God, and indeed the whole true Trinity.</p>
      <p>However, Scripture always speaks distinctly against his confusion about the Trinity, so that it never says one about two or three, but one God the Father, one Lord Jesus Christ, one Holy Spirit. Where we will easily demonstrate that the mediator, one God Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is to one God the Father, so that the true Trinity will always leave us a mediator, thus one triune God, or however it is called, will lose him, leaving only his vain name to deceive the wretched. But now I do not wish to say more, after I send you my brief writing, in which I refute Stancarus; I submit it to your judgment so that, if you bring forth anything better from the word of God and convict me erring by the word of God, I will gladly yield to you brothers and fathers in the Lord, through whom the Lord has transmitted to us the light of his truth. Meanwhile, I advise and exhort you to look here only at the glory of God, the simplicity and purity of the word of God, not to look here at what some have written and how much they ought to retract; these are human things and serve not the glory of God, but of men.</p>
      <p>Do not look at enemies, disturbances; let the world fall, provided the glory of God and the truth of the Son of God, which we defend, remain. One jot of the word of God should be more precious to us than the peace or destruction of the whole world. By the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, I implore you, do not conceal anything here, do not respond ambiguously; let the truth be naked. But if you refuse to bear witness to the truth or bear it obliquely, the Lord will provide those who will subscribe to his truth.</p>
      <p>But beware, lest you who are now first become last, lest the Lord scatter you and obliterate his holy name among you and set you as a reproach among the nations, as he did before to the Jews, later to the papists and others. This can no longer be hidden or covered in any way; the truth is now sought by all and indeed naked. Now the matter concerns dissensions and blood.</p>
      <p>Beware, lest you be guilty of shedding any blood by confirming the adversaries of the truth; for the blood shed will cry out to the heavens. Farewell, brothers in the Lord, worthy of honor.</p>
      <p>What I write, God is my witness, I do out of zeal and respect for you; for I love you, revere you, admire you, if I could do more, I would. Therefore, I ask you to suspect nothing sinister of me; for I have described everything that is within and now and before and have nothing here before my eyes but the glory of God. May the Lord bless you, keep you for his glory, and make you stronger day by day to defend his truth. Amen. Kraków, November 17, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your brother in the Lord, with all my heart, Gregor Pauli, minister of Kraków.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, Peter Martyr, Heinrich Bullinger, Bernardino Ochino, faithful ministers of Christ in Zürich, brothers to be respected in the Lord.</p>
