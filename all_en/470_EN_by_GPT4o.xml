      <p>To the tireless cultivator of sacred philosophy, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastical leader in Zürich, Johannes Travers the Elder from the Grisons.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Since my son-in-law is currently about to set out for Zürich to see his two nephews there, most vigilant pastor, I decided to burden him with this letter of mine, so that he might have a more convenient opportunity to approach your kindness and inquire about the state of your affairs. It seems to me that I have longed for your letters for half a century, by which I might be informed of new matters, if there are any worth knowing from Germany, and especially those that are now being discussed in the Diet of Baden by our Swiss. I am indeed more curious about these things than is reasonable; if you have any leisure, do not hesitate to depict them briefly and make Travers, who is most devoted to you, a participant. All of Italy is quiet, as if striving to turn swords into plowshares. Our Grisons likewise, with joined hands, humbly pray to the most excellent God for the sincere concord and mutual love of our Swiss; on this truly depends the common safety of our entire republic. Farewell, most desired Bullinger; I pray you greet all the brothers and fellow ministers in my name. March 19, 1549.</p>
      <p>To the fearless and pious preacher of ecclesiastical scripture among the people of Zürich, [Mr. Heinr]ich Bullinger, his most esteemed brother and [friend (lord?)].</p>
