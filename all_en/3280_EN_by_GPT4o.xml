      <p>S. There are three things that I now have to inform you about, dearest compater (godfather) and most esteemed prince. The first is that yesterday our senate was informed by letters from Johannes Jakob von Bonstetten, the governor of Neuchâtel, that the king in the Netherlands suffered a great defeat by the imperial forces; the constable was captured, as well as the younger Duke of Longueville, to whose command the county of Neuchâtel now belongs, and besides these, the Count of Rhinegrave and many other distinguished men. A certain duke (whose name I do not remember) was killed along with a great number of others.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the Swiss are ordered to hasten to those parts. He also writes that the king barely escaped.</p>
      <p>If these things are true, as I do not doubt, and if an Italian massacre also adds to this disaster, the king will see, if he is not insane, what it means to trust the pope and to undertake his defense. The second is that the Prince of Württemberg recently sent letters to our senate in which he informs us of what has been done with Gribaldi, and warns us to beware of him. He writes first how he received him coming from Italy, how he conducted himself well in doctrine and life, but finally suspicion arose about him, that he fosters certain new errors and opinions concerning the matter of the Trinity, and that for this reason, when called to respond, he initially satisfied them. Later, having been warned by the church of Geneva to beware of this man and his errors, he took care again to have him respond in his presence before the senate of the University of Tübingen concerning the errors alleged against him. This was done; but he sought evasions with indirect answers; thus he was ordered to respond simply whether he accepts the Athanasian Creed and the constitution in the code concerning the supreme Trinity and the Catholic faith. When he again evaded, he was given a period of three weeks within which to respond directly to these. In the meantime, he fled on foot and did not respond to what was proposed to him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, as I said, he warns, since he understands that he has some influence among us, to beware of him; he also warns against Caelius Secundus and another certain person who is acting in Basel, whose name I do not hold; for it is not Castellio, but someone else. Our senate, having received these letters, summoned Gribaldi here.</p>
      <p>We are now expecting him, and I greatly fear that he will also cause us disturbances; for he will gain favor with many from that denunciation made by the Genevans to the Prince of Württemberg.</p>
      <p>In my judgment, he should be sent back to Tübingen to respond there. Please also consult what you think should be done.</p>
      <p>The third is that our Englishmen now residing in Aarau with some families are asking for the freedom to use their own rites in their church, especially that they may use common bread in the Lord's Supper; for thus they were accustomed in England. Nothing has yet been answered to them; but I fear they may obtain what I do not wish, and especially this, that they do not want to use common bread; the other rites will be more easily granted. For you are not unaware of how much offense this will cause not only among our churches, which are more moved by that diversity of rites than by those things which are of the substance of faith and religion, but also among the neighboring Lucerners and others. Therefore, I ask you to also write to Lever and be an authority to him, that he may accommodate himself to the churches in whose bosom he dwells; for he seems to have less freedom in these matters, while he most demands freedom for himself. I wanted to write this to you hastily now and ask that you write back to me about these things as soon as you can. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 23, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
