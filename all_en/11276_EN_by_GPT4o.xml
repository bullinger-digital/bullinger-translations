    <p xml:id="regest1">Defends his book against the expected criticism and points out that he has dealt with the entire subject matter in an easily understandable and systematic way, unlike earlier authors, whose works he nevertheless appreciates and occasionally cites; since influential circles are doing everything to present the invocation of saints and the cult of images as Christian, he is publishing his writing right now. He first contrasts the faith of the Early Church with the errors of pagans, Jews, and Christians, and then addresses the teachings of the Church Fathers and the objections of opponents to demonstrate that God alone should be invoked; further, he examines the beginnings of image worship, interprets God's commandment on this matter, reports on the dispute over images, proves that there is no difference between pagan and Christian image worship, and concludes with a warning against all idolatry. The writing, drafted almost 15 years ago following the model of Lactantius, was published by him 10 years ago; since no more thorough treatise on this topic has appeared since then, he has completely revised and expanded the book again, without changing the fundamental message. He dedicates this edition, as he did the first, to the widely respected Blarer.</p>

      <p>In the book "On the Origin of Error Concerning the Invocation and Worship of Gods and Images" a preface to Mr. Ambrosius Blarer of Constance.</p>
      <p>I know that I will not lack opponents who will utterly condemn both the subject I address in this book and the manner in which I present it, but my conscience will comfort me before the Lord. For I know what I have aimed at; the Lord, the searcher of hearts, knows that I have published these things not to the detriment of true faith and the saints, but to the glory of God and the salvation of many people. I have followed a method in presenting that seemed most clear and suitable for this matter. I explain everything simply. I use plain and unadorned language. This indeed seemed to be demanded by the cause of religion, which is sincere and simple, and by the condition of those for whose benefit I was writing. I do not care at all for the sharpness of Chrysippus or for certain admirers and critics of ornate diction. Holy and learned men have indeed treated part of this subject before me, some of whom are still living, others have gone to the Lord; but few or none have discussed the origin of error and the whole matter of superstition in a systematic and orderly manner. For their works exist, in which they have sometimes disputed about the invocation of saints, sometimes about the worship of images; occasionally, while dealing with other matters, they have mentioned these things. But I have condensed the whole matter of superstition, discussed only this, and presented it all at once for the readers to see.</p>
      <p>Wherever the use required or an elegant sentence or clear argument appeared in their books, I have inserted them into these of ours. For I rightly value the labors of pious men highly, as the Lord uses their ministry for the good of His church, and their spirits now live with the Lord; so far from wishing to diminish even a little from the praises of the pious in these of ours. But at this time and age, I publish these things especially for this reason, because I see powerful, learned, and highly esteemed men trying by cunning arts, ingenious disputations and sermons, public edicts, and all means to make the whole church of Christ's faithful acknowledge and confess the intercession and invocation of saints, as well as the use and worship of images in churches, to be apostolic, ancient, orthodox, and right.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in the first part of the work, I show what the prophets, apostles, and the apostolic church thought and believed about God, His invocation, and worship.</p>
      <p>To these, I oppose superstition, where I discuss the first causes and beginnings of error among the Gentiles, Jews, and Christians. Nor do I discuss the superstitions of the Gentiles more copiously there for any other reason than that at the end of the book I make a comparison between the superstition of the Gentiles and Christians, so that it may be clear from the beginning that we do this without any injury to piety. I dwell longer on explaining the superstitions and idolatries of the Jews because it seemed that from these also ours could be better known. Now, in inquiring into the origins of our superstition, I have traced the matter back further. For I examine the opinions of certain holy fathers on this matter, yet I did not wish, as it might seem, to poke out the eyes of crows, as the saying goes, but to support the truth, which indeed is to be preferred to the opinion of all men and fathers.</p>
      <p>With this intention, I have also responded to each of the objections of the opponents, which, although briefly, I have listed in good faith and also discussed in good faith, but how successfully, the readers will judge. And I conclude these discussions so far with the assertion of the invocation of the divine name and the intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ. For this is indeed the other aim of our discussion, that God alone is to be invoked through Christ in all things, not gods, not saints, nor any creature, however excellent. I proceed further and now also discuss the beginnings and progress of idolatry, which followed that doctrine of intercession, invocation, and worship of saints. I explain the reasons why it seemed to some that images should be received into the churches of Christians; to these, I add the arguments by which they defend the received ones. In opposition, having brought forth and explained the law of God, which is read against idols in Exodus 20[1-6], I refute the arguments of the opponents. Where I recount from histories how much fire it has kindled in the church of Christ and how much harm it has brought to the whole Christian world, that unfortunate dispute between the Eastern and Western churches about the use of images of Christ and the saints in Christian temples. Finally, since all opponents flee here as to a sacred anchor, that there was a different reason in the superstition and worship of idols of the Gentiles, and another in the worship of saints and images among Christians, I demonstrate by a certain comparison that the worship is the same, the superstition the same of gods and idols among the Gentiles and of saints and images among Christians. Concluding this discussion, I finally show with just causes brought forth how greatly one must beware of idolatry and all foreign worship, which the Lord so greatly hates and detests. This is certainly the other state of our discussion, namely, that every Christian man must flee from all idolatry with constant faith, for God approves of that worship which consists of spirit, faith, and integrity.</p>
      <p>I had treated this subject almost 15 years ago and had scribbled it on some papers through the exercise and imitation of Lactantius. And when I happened to come across them 10 years ago and shared them with learned and pious brothers, it seemed to them that it would be worthwhile to publish, for it would be useful, if not for anything else, at least for this, that they believed my work could excite more noble minds, which would treat a useful and necessary subject for our times more learnedly and successfully. I did what they commanded, and I published the little work "On the Origin of Error in the Worship of Saints and Images." Meanwhile, I waited to see what others would also bring forth, and in the meantime, I observed many things on this subject in the scriptures, fathers, and histories; finally, since no one comes forward to propose better things, I take up that little work of mine again, review it, and thus regenerate it. However, the work grew, as they say, in our very hands, and it grew so much that, if you compare it with the former, it almost exceeds it threefold, indeed you would not recognize the former at all. The subject is indeed the same, the truth the same, nor will anyone who compares both say that even a little has been changed in the sum of the opinion; I have treated everything more diligently and copiously now, if I am not mistaken. Nor will fair readers blame this in me, who have praised this very thing in others.</p>
      <p>However, I had dedicated the first offspring of our work to your name, most illustrious Ambrosius, which you received very kindly for your admirable humanity, whence I also believed it would be very pleasing to you now if the same book, now however somewhat more opulent, cultivated, and well-dressed, should again come forth into the public under your name. For many good men will read these of ours not so much in my name as in yours. For your virtue has commended you to all good men, even among foreign nations proclaiming it. The famous churches throughout Swabia proclaim it, especially the illustrious and truly constant church of Constance, most renowned for sound doctrine and faith, invincible patience, celebrated for purity and charity. The work itself, I think, contains nothing impure, indeed it is written in assertion of pure and sincere religion; therefore you will not be burdened to take this common defense with me. May the Lord Jesus be with us and direct our hearts and mouths to the glory of His name. Amen.</p>
