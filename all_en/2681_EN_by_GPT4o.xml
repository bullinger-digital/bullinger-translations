      <p>Greetings. Although there is nothing at present for me to write, I did not want these letters of yours to come to you without mine; for through them, I expect more abundant ones from you. What is happening here is explained by them, and in Geneva, we hear that everything is exacerbated. Some have now been punished. Our people are also becoming more and more embittered against them. I fear worse things will follow unless the Lord averts it. Calvin is in very bad repute.</p>
      <p>Some letters written by him to friends, which were carelessly kept by them and stolen, or rather intercepted before they reached them, greatly burden him with envy.</p>
      <p>We achieve nothing by defending and excusing him. There is also a new dispute among some ministers, who accuse each other of injuries, and I fear that more may still be involved. A great scandal arises from this, and the authority of the ministry is all the more depressed the more they try to exalt its dignity by contending. We seem to provide little to Calvin and Farel. But what can we do in this sea of troubles and affairs, except to stand firmly at the helm, if not to calm the waves, at least to strive to keep the ship safe?</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, the prefects will be elected. Hence, they seem to have been called by you at a very inopportune time. For I would like them to be present. You are well informed about the French expedition. From France, we have nothing, except that in Cambrai and elsewhere many are detained in chains for the profession of truth, and every day some are taken away. May the Lord have mercy on His church and keep us from evil! Give greetings to all yours in my name and in the name of mine.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 27, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>I have received the sermons on the salvation of the faithful and thank you greatly. I distributed them as you wished, and all thank you and in turn greet you. Mr. Haller has not yet returned to the city, nor is it yet apparent what hope there is for him.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his honorable lord and compatriot.</p>
