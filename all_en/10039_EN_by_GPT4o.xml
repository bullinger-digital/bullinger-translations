      <p>To the distinguished professor of theology, Johannes Burchard, preacher of the people of Bremgarten, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We wrote, reverend father, a certain letter in previous years, to which we gave the title: "Aetiology, why the Mass is not a sacrifice." Since you have written an apology against it, undoubtedly to lead a wandering brother back to the true path, I ask that you provide me with a copy of that work. For I am prepared to yield to better teachings, or, if it seems appropriate, to respond to yours. It will be beneficial for your cause not only because you gain a brother and show that you wrote with no illness of contention, slander, or boasting, more for others than for me, but especially because your learning will be less at risk. It would undoubtedly seem to falter, even if otherwise quite firm, if I were forced to adhere to corrupted pages due to an incorrect copy obtained through the fault of scribes. Therefore, we beseech you through Christian charity, to be willing to advise both yourself and me, send a corrected copy, and be assured that not a jot will be lost. For I will return it intact, without lacking in gratitude. But if you are unwilling to comply with my request in an honest, excellent, useful matter, and no less easy for you, what can I do but cling to a half-torn and poorly copied version of your work (if I can even obtain what was promised) or even respond to the papers? Therefore, act as befits your profession; for I do not believe that you, as a doctor, would deny me this matter, and as a professor of theology, would continue to offer anything other than a theologian.</p>
      <p>May your fatherhood fare well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>From Kappel, 7th day before the calends of February in the year 1526 from the redemption of the world.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours, if you continue to be mine.</p>
