      <p>With great pain in my right heel, I write; I fear the return of gout. Nevertheless, I had to write, so you wouldn't think anything negative about me. I am grateful, first of all, that you accepted the person from Lindau whom I recommended; I will reciprocate whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>Regarding the people of Magdeburg, the situation is as follows: they are surrounded by wooden walls, which they call blockhouses, so that no one can leave the city for their business, and they remain safe unless a large army comes to liberate the citizens. If the siege is just, they hope that the Danes, Poles, and Muscovites will come armed to repel the enemies, and I think this is what a certain Sarcerius wrote to Gastius from Leipzig about the northern cities, that they are indeed armed. The citizens and those with them desire a just war, so that an end to their miseries may be achieved by any means; thus, the miserable are delayed by the passage of time. This is known by the cunning Spaniard; he fights with his ban, and foolish Germany does not see, nor do others. In the same way, he will harass us someday; for a certain man from Augsburg said at our fair: "The Emperor will not wage war against us except by depriving us of supplies; he will not engage in battle; be certain of this." But I return to the point.</p>
      <p>They seem to fear the Lord rightly, for which reason they wish to die for Him or be freed from these evils.</p>
      <p>The people of Brunswick have peace and do not want the Emperor's Interim. These things are from certain students from Wittenberg and Leipzig, who reported everything at my table these days.</p>
      <p>After them came a certain doctor from Magdeburg, bringing letters from a nobleman to his wife, in which everything is joyful except this: he complains that people are not moved by mercy among themselves, but each looks out for himself as best he can. He seems to speak of the maritime cities. The messenger added that they completely forgot the disaster within eight days. The constancy of many is truly admirable; a hundred men from the tribes have been added to the magistrate, so that they may consult together on all matters. Bremen is still under the ban. So much for these matters.</p>
      <p>You write, not without my great admiration, after the words of Mr. Vadian: "It is certain that Charles is alive and consulting on the greatest matters," etc. What is it then, that we are so often deceived, more blind than moles? God has undoubtedly blinded us in the highest light, and even if a few of us foresee all the Emperor's vanity, yet, when we narrate, no one believes us, and we lack the strength to bring matters to their proper conclusion. I remember Zwingli of blessed memory often used to repeat: "The greatest misfortune that I am vexed with on earth is that the evils, which I know as well as my own nails, no one believes me when I announce them." Well, since the Lord wills it so, let it be so; only grant us that His word may remain and that we may overcome all things through patience.</p>
      <p>If, moreover, the electors and princes have agreed to the Council of Trent, they are foolish, insane, and plainly impious, unless they have added that it must be general, free, and in which only Scripture should be the judge, as was done in the first four councils, which are compared with the evangelical writings. But I hear nothing about this matter. The council will be held according to the Pope's will, who will not allow (if what is reported from Italy is true) any Lutheran to be admitted, as I wrote before.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand, however, has not moved. We have the St. Gallen Kesler, who returned a few days ago from Augsburg; he saw Ferdinand, but not Charles. The Bavarian had left, not without the astonishment of the whole city. They report that Philip and the Bavarian played together; he began to act like a Spaniard while playing, which the Bavarian, understanding, reproached: "Not so," he said, "is it allowed in Germany; we play well, not improperly." The other, therefore, indignantly drew his sword and tried to stab the Bavarian; but he, dodging the sword, grabbed the middle and threw him to the ground, das er jach quetsch. Others rushed in and ensured that neither was harmed. The next day, on occasion, Philip tried to strike the other with a dagger and pressed so hard with his ambush that he was forced to leave, as it were. These things are reported as certain.</p>
      <p>From the commended monk, also from the bath attendant, I received none of your letters; I received them from the bookseller, and they were very welcome. I reproached Otho; for he never mentioned anything about his house being occupied by the plague, which I was surprised by. For I am in this: I should know the good and bad of friends; for this matter is often not trivial, as you yourself know.</p>
      <p>What the nobleman from Pfirt did, I do not so much admire as recognize the contempt of the Swiss. Forty years ago, neither Charles nor Ferdinand would have acted thus. I suppose the cause of the contempt is that we despise each other among ourselves, with them being the authors of it for the most part. There are some nobles here who interpret the matter in some way; but I, who do not understand the business, it is better that I remain silent.</p>
      <p>Finally, I commend to you the one who delivers this. For more or less seven years he was with me, and I thought he would take on the distinguished master's degree after the festival; but having changed his plan, he preferred to see Zurich first and hear its learned men.</p>
      <p>He is of an age to govern himself; nevertheless, he still needs supervision; I would like you to be this until he is sufficient. Farewell in Christ with all yours always. Greet on my behalf your sons-in-law, relatives, godparents, Mr. Pellican, also Mr. Theodor, who wrote and gifted me a large Clarean cheese. I will write back and give thanks through the next messenger. Basel, November 3, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most learned theologian, brother and lord in his Christ.</p>
