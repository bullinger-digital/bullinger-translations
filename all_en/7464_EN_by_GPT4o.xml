      <p>Greetings. I received, reverend father in Christ, the remaining parts on Mark along with your most lovingly written letters, from which I easily recognized that former benevolence of yours towards me, which I have always been accustomed to cherish so much. I indeed confess openly that I cannot be equal to the benefits you have bestowed and accumulated upon me, and especially that I have written to you less frequently until now; however, given your piety, you will not think this was done out of forgetfulness of the respect I owe you, but rather you will attribute it to the rarity and uncertainty of the messengers. We all here, to whom you are known, sincerely rejoice that you and all yours are well.</p>
