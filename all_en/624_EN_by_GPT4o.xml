      <p>We all pray to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, through the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, for grace, peace, and steadfastness in the recognized truth, especially in this most sorrowful time, for you, our teachers and dearest brothers, amen.</p>
      <p>I truly cannot express how delighted we all were upon reading the letters of our reverend father and brother Pellican, which declared your concern for us and simultaneously described the state of your church and republic. We love and honor you uniquely because of the old friendship between the people of Zurich and our Frisians, and now because of the same connection with you in religion. Therefore, we were even more delighted when Gabriel, the tanner from Strasbourg, our common brother, fully and perfectly explained the matters of the Strasbourg and your church to us. First of all, we gave immense thanks to God, our heavenly Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that as afflictions abound, so now also consolations abound, and that He does not entirely deprive His exiles from the great wrath of the serpent of all hospitality, and finally, that He prepares foreign and new hospitality for His own. We also give you immense thanks for your concern and prayers for us, and we do not doubt that your common prayers have benefited us and continue to do so.</p>
      <p>Now, on the contrary, since we do not doubt that it would be most pleasing to you to be informed of what has been done among us in these most sorrowful times, and what is now being done, all the brothers have imposed this burden on me, since I have been familiar with you for some time. I did not want to deny them this, since I had already intended to write to you, even though I could justly excuse myself due to my lack of skill in writing, yet relying on your humanity, I write these things.</p>
      <p>Brothers, I cannot help but be brought to the utmost admiration whenever I think that God here in our Friesland has propagated the doctrine of the Gospel against the will of the magistrate at first, then, when even the magistrate, not only the common people but also the highest, tried to abolish the same, they could achieve nothing, and finally, I do not cease to marvel now especially that under a pious widow princess and an impious common magistrate, in these most dangerous times, He has protected our church against the threats of our adversaries, so that it has not only experienced no external force or damage, but has seen no change in religion at all, even though the enemies are raging. Now, however, since we have been too ungrateful and not turned to the Lord with all our heart, the mind of the pious princess and her counselors is now broken by the threats of the enemies, so that from the new adulterous Interim of the German, they have devised a new reformation, which I wish may not be a deformation of our well-established churches, and they have offered this not under the name of Interim, but under the name of the old reformations, which the deceased prince once established, so that in this way we might be similar to the Saxon churches. For they say that the Emperor reproaches us for our barbarism and dissimilarity from the other churches, and that to escape this mark, they propose this alone, not that they want to introduce or ever accept the Interim. However, although they have proposed these things with the best appearance, our preachers have not wanted to accept any of them, even though they have tried to induce them to this in various ways and arts.</p>
      <p>The reasons, however, why they cannot do this, they have offered to the prince, which I will briefly recount: first, because some things in this ordinance are impious, some obscure and ambiguous, some indeed superstitious, and some indeed indifferent, if observed with a good end and without necessity according to the circumstances of places, persons, and times. Now, however, since all these things are done for the sake of the adversaries, who try to abolish sound doctrine and disturb the churches (no matter how they propose everything), they cannot accept anything, not even the indifferent things (which at another time would be indifferent, but now are works of confession) because of the confession of the true doctrine of the Gospel and the freedom in indifferent things, lest by doing so they show the adversaries that they have hitherto sinned either in doctrine or in the observation of ceremonies. Indeed, it is not necessary, but dangerous, for the same ceremonies to be observed everywhere in the churches. Moreover, we have not barbaric, but Christian and simple ceremonies, suitable for the utility of our church, without any superstition. If now we were to repeat useless and superstitious ceremonies, abolished with great labor, they said, we would make ourselves guilty both before the adversaries and our own, either because we acted inconsiderately in abolishing them or indeed we would sin in restoring them, according to Paul's saying: "If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor." Finally, what would the sects say, of which there is a great number among us, namely that we are animals of the belly and thus by our inconstancy we would lead many into error and be a cause of scandal both here to our own and to foreign Christians, who are intent on us.</p>
      <p>Finally, since Paul wants everything in the church to be instituted for edification, not for destruction, and these ceremonies have no certain utility, but rather bring destruction with them, so that in this way a path would be prepared for the papacy, we cannot approve or accept them, indeed nor administer them, they said. The intermediaries truly tried to explain everything, interpret it in a good part, and show the certain utility of these ceremonies, especially this, that they were instituted for the sake of preserving public peace, so that by these ceremonies they might satisfy the Emperor, lest they be compelled to accept other impious things altogether. Our people responded that this is not the royal way to obtain peace, since it is certain that God is angry with us because of ingratitude and therefore permits the Emperor to do such things to us; that conversion of hearts to God, repentance, and true faith with works worthy of repentance are necessary to obtain peace. Finally, they responded in writing to the prince and his counselors in this sense: either the prince proposes this ordinance in the name of the Interim, which he has accepted or wants to accept, to make a beginning from there; if this is done in this way, they can neither accept nor want to accept anything, lest they sin against the confession and assist impious attempts, by which many could be seduced; then either the prince has instituted this reformation to at least make the Emperor believe that he has accepted the Interim or will gradually accept it (since it is granted for the peace of his people), even if he never intends to accept it, nor then because of this simulation, which Christian confession does not allow, will they accept anything, lest they lose the grace of God and provoke the Emperor's anger more by this institution, God's grace, because they are not allowed to profess Him and the doctrine of the Gospel publicly, the Emperor's just anger, because they do not fulfill what they promised (as he will think), and therefore they should be punished not for the profession of the Gospel, but for deceit or perfidy. If, however, the prince wanted to make a clear and manifest confession of the Gospel before the Emperor and protest that he cannot or will not accept the impious things in the Interim nor accept any of the free ceremonies from the Interim because he understands his own observed so far to be bad, but only for the sake of public peace, lest he seem altogether contumacious in these things, which could be observed as free in some way, and if the Emperor would grant peace for this reason and a reformation of some ceremonies were proposed to them in this name, they would gladly then comply in all things that could be done with the peace of the church for a time, yet so that it would be clear to all in what way they had accepted these things, either by publishing a writing.</p>
      <p>Our governors constantly and with an oath deny that they have accepted or want to accept the Interim; however, they do not want to indicate their plans, which are clearly suspect to our people. Therefore, our people also want to accept nothing of all that is proposed, while the magistrates, on the contrary, want everything to be observed. But since they try every way of the Interim to retain the doctrine hitherto taught with the true use of the sacraments observed here so far, they finally dealt with the preachers, whether they could tolerate having some ceremonialist, if they would also be willing to tolerate him. They answered that they could indeed tolerate, but not approve nor be able or willing to join their ministry with his. Then they asked them to introduce the surplice or linen garment only in the use of the Lord's Supper, for the sermon and in the action of baptism. Our people also refused this.</p>
      <p>Finally, it was agreed between both parties, since two years ago one of the ministers used to wear a surplice in the Supper, that this should be resumed not in the name of the Interim, but for the sake of old custom, not that they had sinned in laying it aside, but that in this part the old ordinance should be observed, provided this could be done with the peace of the church and without tumult. Therefore, the church, so that it could retain its ministers, unanimously agreed, yet with this condition that it could be laid aside again with the same freedom with which it was accepted, when it was convenient, and not be burdened with more ceremonies. When they saw the church easy in this matter, they finally wanted them to use it also for the sermon and in the use of baptism. Our people, since this was not the custom here or elsewhere, lest they seem to concede anything in the name of the Interim or the papists, were not willing to accept it in any way and have not yet used it in the Supper. What more?</p>
      <p>They were forbidden the public office of preaching because they neither wanted to use surplices nor join their ministry with that of another. Our people responded with great courage that the prince gravely sins by resisting the Holy Spirit in his ministry and that they are not bound to obedience by this command; for the ministry is of God and the Holy Spirit, even if they were called to this through the magistrate as an instrument with the consent of the church, and since he commands against it, they will preach until the church wants to hear, they cannot obey men more than God in this matter. Nevertheless, he ordered them to be silent until he had given certain instructions about it after holding a council.</p>
      <p>However, he allowed domestic visitations, and also permitted sermons in the baptism of children and the joining of bride and groom in the temple. Our people would not have remained silent unless it had pleased the best in the church that they should be silent for a time, lest the magistrate be more exacerbated, especially since the ministry was not entirely forbidden to them. They acquiesce for a time to the counsel of the church; however, they now want to consult you, with sound advice and a clear response, which we ask to be sent to our Gabriel in Strasbourg as soon as possible; for he will take care that your writing is brought to us as soon as possible along with the response of the brothers in Strasbourg, as he has solemnly promised.</p>
      <p>First, whether you think anything of those ceremonies, which are proposed to us, should be accepted by us at this time, and also which they are (for which reason we send you a copy of our reformation, which they want to be observed) or whether you advise that nothing at all should be accepted. Then, if nothing of these should be accepted, whether it will be lawful or safe for our people (even if they are not compelled to join their ministry with these ceremonies) to still perform their ministry in the same place or temple where the ceremonialist performs his trifles. In this matter, many are troubled in conscience.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, what should be done if the magistrate orders silence and the church desires to hear the ministers, whether in this matter the command of the magistrate should be immediately obeyed. Finally, if the magistrate orders the ministers to leave the jurisdiction while the church remains, whether you think they should immediately obey him or not, especially since the church (with them departing) is in certain danger from wolves or there is a danger that it may be disbanded. And if you think so, where then will be the Lord's sentence, which commands to lay down one's life for the sheep and not to flee when the wolf comes, but to oppose him. And indeed, if it is allowed to speak the truth, at this time many pastors seem not to satisfy their calling in this part, who immediately at the magistrate's edict either remain silent or flee. These seem to me either not to rightly consider their ministry or to act otherwise than befits the ministers of the Gospel according to the examples of the Lord's flock; for they think the ministry is not of God, into which they have been called, but of the magistrate and man; therefore, they are servants of men, then they do not think that the magistrate, if he does not agree with the church, is not the church, but only a member, or if he acts against the church by force, he has no part in the church, much less is he the lord of the church. But that they were the authors of the election of true ministers, this was done by the instinct of God (if the calling was just) with the consent of the church. However, there is not the same reason in deposing ministers, since they strive against the will of God and the church by the sole authority of themselves with the instinct of the devil. What occasion these pastors also give to adversaries and sects for calumniating and indeed, I experience with the greatest groaning. They say such are animals of the belly, hirelings, and other things which I do not want to say.</p>
      <p>Finally, if the magistrate wanted to retain the ministers, yet prohibited public ministry, whether they could remain with a safe conscience in the church, so as not to perform their ministry in baptizing and administering the Supper and preaching publicly. Or if it were allowed to administer the sacraments privately in houses and exhort the church, only to be barred from public ministry in the temple, whether you think they should rather acquiesce to the magistrate or rather remain in public ministry with danger. What seems good to you and the Holy Spirit in this matter, we desire to be informed and instructed by your writings as soon as possible about these questions. For we greatly value your authority, as is fitting, and we now refer these questions to your judgment more willingly because we lack our superintendent John a Lasco, a learned and pious man, who values your judgment above all other churches because of your divine wisdom and your utmost candor and love towards us. We, in turn, promise you the zeal of our church and our most ardent prayers for all of you and your church and republic, and as much as we can, we will love you mutually in the Lord. And if it happens that members of Christ are exiled from here, many not of the lowest condition with other pious people will migrate to you as to dearest brothers, whom we all pray you will receive in the Lord and help as much as you can. We would certainly receive all of yours with grateful hearts as much as is in us. May God and the Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ have mercy on His church and preserve it under the cross and grant that, having cast aside all contentiousness, it may learn to bear with one another, which I now hope will happen under the cross; for now all domestic contentions cease. Then a Lasco, departing to Poland, wrote back that he was received most kindly everywhere by the Saxon preachers and after mutual conversations gave them his hand and promised not to want to foster discord any longer because of the sacramentarian matter. I have always said that nothing but the cross is lacking to the churches.</p>
      <p>Now also, when the churches of Saxony write against the Interim and new reformations from the Interim, they say that the necessary ceremonies are enough for the church in the pure preaching of the Gospel, in the administration of the Lord's Supper and baptism; all others are not necessary, so that the churches should be burdened with them, nor is it useful for the churches to observe the same ceremonies everywhere. However, our people have hitherto been called enthusiasts by them for this reason; now necessity advises otherwise. The Lord a Lasco, for the utility of the church, departing from us to England, has gone to Prussia, where it is being arranged that, if it is not allowed to remain here because of the Emperor's anger, he may be appointed to the church of Danzig; if not, he will return to England. For he cannot be tolerated here by the Emperor. Meanwhile, the ministers of our church greet you, in whose name I have written these things with such haste that I have not had time to reread, much less to rewrite. If therefore anything is wrong, attribute it to the time. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</p>
      <p>Hastily, Emden, August 8, 1549.</p>
      <p>Gerhard zum Camp, in the name of all the ministers of the church of Emden.</p>
      <p>Our church requests the public prayers of your church and the private and fervent prayers of all of you.</p>
      <p>Thomas Bramius prays through Christ to be helped by the suffrages of your church, lest I offer any offense to the church of Jesus Christ under this sad spectacle of affairs.</p>
      <p>Hermann Brassius requests the same.</p>
      <p>Gellius Pediotecton also earnestly prays this from you.</p>
