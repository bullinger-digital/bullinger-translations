      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt, most learned man, that I am accused by you not only of negligence and laziness, because I have not sent you any letters for a long time, but also of ingratitude. It would indeed be very serious for me to have incurred such suspicion with you, if I were not very well aware of my own innocence and if there were not reasons at hand that could immediately clear me of this unfavorable opinion. These reasons are: for a long time I have suffered from eye pain and, exhausted by severe inflammation, I have not been able to write. To this was also added the fact that no messenger presented himself to whom I could entrust my letters. Because of these things, you ought to consider it kindly, and if these do not satisfy, you should use that [Greek] which you always use in the errors of friends. I ask you again and again to do this, in the manner of the accused. If I were not pressed by the constraints of time, I would have written to you more extensively; but shortly, as I hope, this will happen, and if anything new occurs, I will write diligently.</p>
      <p>Farewell, distinguished no less in holiness of life than in doctrine. In Basel, on the very Nones of June in the Christian year 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gilbert Cousin.</p>
      <p>To the most venerable lord and teacher, Heinrich Bullinger, endowed with uncommon piety and knowledge of sciences and languages. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
