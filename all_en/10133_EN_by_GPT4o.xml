      <p>Grace and peace from God be with us all at all times.</p>
      <p>Especially, dear sir and friend, I am writing to you on behalf of Mr. Berchtold: when my lords of Bern understood that we would be forced to adhere to papal decrees, they foresaw that it would be far from us that more and no one else would want otherwise. Therefore, our lords, councilors, and citizens of Bern decided on the 9th day of June and instructed the envoys to go to Baden on that day, to request that three envoys be appointed to us: one from Zurich or Bern, the other from other lesser lords, the third from the Schiedleuten, to find out how things stand with us, and perhaps once again to increase our numbers, and thereby, according to all necessity and honor, God might be helped. Thus, we have been informed, in case such an opinion would have prevailed, that we would not be surprised or rushed by this matter and that we might hold together and deliberate all the more quickly. For although my lords from other regions intend not to stop and continue with their undertaking, my lords' envoys have been instructed to act rightly. Thus, in his writing, he has suggested sending this envoy to you with the transcript, in case you might also think it good to proceed further in these matters; for you should know that we can do nothing in these matters. And you are always our faithful guardian, as we trust you completely. With that, we commend ourselves to God. We also hear how our lords from other regions have appeared before my lords of Zurich with much loud talk and have offered much good. It may be or not, may God will that mouth and heart be united.</p>
      <p>Dated on Tuesday after Saint Medardus' Day in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Hans Mutschli, your always willing servant and friend.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and friend.</p>
