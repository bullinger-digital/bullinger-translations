      <p>When I had left Friesland and was on my way here, most esteemed brothers in the Lord, by chance I met Jacob in Cologne on my journey, who was coming to me with your letters from Emden. He therefore delivered your letters to me, but he could not deliver the booklets you sent: for they had already been placed on a certain ship with other luggage to be transported to Emden before Jacob met me, from where they could not easily be retrieved later. Therefore, I did not see them, but I ordered them to be delivered to our Micronius and Gerardus Campius. However, I read your letters with great pleasure, except that what you, my Bullinger, wrote about the plans of your confederates, the pope's efforts, and your health disturbed me not a little. I am now compelled to respond to both of you with one and the same letter, or rather not so much to respond as to inform you about my affairs. So, receive the matter briefly.</p>
      <p>Some have long been attempting in my Friesland, before I came there from England, to reintroduce the Saxon doctrine during my absence. They did not openly profess this, but pretended to seek a way to settle the sacramental controversy. Since no occasion was given for this pretext, because the majority of the ministers of the whole country had unanimously subscribed to our doctrine and did not wish to deviate from it even a hair's breadth, a way was sought to call me into suspicion, as if I had changed my kind of doctrine on the sacramental matter in England. And there were found some, indeed my fellow ministers, who gradually instilled this into the ears of many, without even a word of admonition to me, whom they nevertheless recognized as their pastor. Soon there were those who brought forth some sort of moderation of Philipp Melanchthon to be proposed to the churches. Others twisted certain words from Peter Martyr's treatise to their own opinion, and some also from your agreement with Calvin, about which I also wrote to Calvin. And since I use some other words, even if they aim at the same thing, as you also rightly judge, they began to spread that I disagreed with both Peter Martyr and all of you, with whom I had previously professed to agree. And the matter was finally brought, without my knowing or even suspecting anything, to the point that the sacramental doctrine, to which all my fellow ministers had otherwise subscribed, began to be corrected, and lest it alone should seem to be corrected, a revision of the entire Catechism was instituted.</p>
      <p>This was finally indicated to me in England, but no signification of changing the doctrine in any way was made, about which none of the fellow ministers, except one or two, were thinking. Thus, I did not refuse that the Catechism should be revised. After it was revised, the deceit became apparent to most, and thus it was unanimously decided by all the fellow ministers in a public assembly that the revised Catechism should not be published before it was sent to me and my opinion on it was obtained. But the reviser delayed sending it to me, and shortly after accused the delay of being too long if my opinion had to be awaited.</p>
      <p>In short, he wanted the revised Catechism to be published without waiting for my opinion: indeed, he had already arranged for it to be printed. And he had the court here favoring him, which was offended, and I wanted him to respond to me and to defer the publication in the meantime. This pleased the other colleagues.</p>
      <p>The reviser of the Catechism took the defense upon himself, suppressing the Catechism. I refuted the defense so that he would not want to respond further, and it was agreed that all should henceforth confine themselves within the words of your agreement with a just explanation of them.</p>
      <p>Thus the tragedy subsided. I, however, later published my little confession to counter the suspicion spread about me, which I thought should not be adhered to at all, much less approved by my silence. There again, the reviser immediately began to stir up new troubles against me: that my confession was published to his insult, and I don't know what else. I replied that I had not published it for his sake, but to dispel the false suspicion spread about me among all the pious. If he was not the author of that suspicion, my confession did not concern him at all. But if he was the author, then indeed it was written against him and all who acknowledged the same. If it offended either him or anyone else in any part, I would approve it. Finally, he demanded that it be examined in a public assembly of pastors: it was examined and approved.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, however, he brought forth certain articles of his own and wanted me to respond to them. I responded in writing so that he would not contradict anything and would indeed rest completely. This matter greatly offended those courtiers. Soon the Catechism was published with the consent of all, the previous revisions having been rejected, which offended the courtiers even more.</p>
      <p>And when they saw that, with me present there, no change in doctrine could be introduced without great disturbance to the whole country, they devised a plan to expel me from there: namely, that I was so odious to the Burgundian court that I could no longer be tolerated there without danger to the country. Therefore, I yielded to their fury at the urging of the whole church, which meanwhile unanimously still recognizes me as its pastor, and does not want or seek to acknowledge anyone else, and has pursued me with such great services, and still does, that I cannot sufficiently proclaim its love and faith towards me.</p>
      <p>It would have to be a volume if I wanted to recount everything: but neither does time now allow it, nor does my health still permit it. More at another time. I will only add this, that I left there both the ministers of almost all the churches and my entire church, as well as all the nobles of the country, confirmed in our doctrine and plainly consenting, so that never before has such a union of minds been seen there, thanks be to our Lord God, except that the courtly magistrate is plainly impious. And the princess herself seems to have completely cooled in her zeal for religion. I do not respond to the rest of your matters now, for I truly cannot. I bid farewell to our common father, Mr. Pellicanus, and all the fellow ministers. May the Lord be with you in His spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p>Hastily, Frankfurt, June 8, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours as much as I am, Johannes a Lasco, by my own hand.</p>
