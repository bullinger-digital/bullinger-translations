    <p xml:id="regest1">Greets the statements [Vadian's, No. 894] and Bullinger's [HBBib1 I 62?], which are probably directed mainly against [Schwenckfeld]; once heard him speak about the deification of the body of Christ and suspects that the letter [from Hans Konrad Thumb, No. 904], which he recently forwarded to Bullinger, is about the same matter. The comparison [drawn by Vadian] between the presence of Christ and the influence of the sun can probably also be agreed upon by Theodor [Bibliander]; nothing else is taught by both Luther and Bucer in his "Retractation." Warns Bullinger and [Bibliander] against unjust condemnation of Luther's doctrine, assures them of his connection with the Zurich church, and calls for more frequent writing.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have read it, and it pleases me. It also pleases me what you have written on the same matter, and even more so, because it coheres better. I seem to sense who it is to whom you are responding here. For I heard him speak in person on this matter, when he said that the whole human Christ was deified, and that now the body itself and the human Christ are of the same power and nature as God, and that this is the very truth of John 6:56: "My flesh is true food"; for thus it is food, as is the very word of the Father. And recently I sent something to you, which I suspect is about this matter, which Marschalk von WÃ¼rttemberg had given to me to send to you. Whatever it is, it is rightly done, when these thoughts are addressed either privately or publicly.</p>
      <p>I desire that you give the last page of this book to our Theodor to be carefully reread. I think he will more willingly acquiesce to a domestic testimony. Certainly Bucer and even Luther himself seem to want nothing else, but that the sun, running far in the sky, is present and influences our affairs with living and present help. For we can assert without danger that outflow and miraculous power of the body of Christ full of divinity, I think, thus flowing into all things, as those heavenly bodies are accustomed. In his "Retractation," Bucer leans especially on this similarity.</p>
      <p>Let us strive, O most excellent hearts Bullinger, Theodor, that it may completely agree among us who profess Christ, and that we may not rashly fall apart. Luther teaches Christ purely thus far, it cannot be denied, and he is carried by a special zeal. We will embrace the man, as far as the truth safely allows. I am not at all inclined to depart from your church, from you, from the opinion of our fathers, which I believe in my heart to be true. I testify to the Lord that my mind is such, as you hear words from me. But we must also take care that the whole church may unite, as far as it can be done. I earnestly desire that we all write to each other more frequently, especially at this time.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ the Redeemer, my most beloved brothers.</p>
      <p>S. G.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed friend in the Lord. And henceforth to Theodor, Leo, Pellican.</p>
