    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not found a messenger for a long time. [Jakob Meyer] fears the suspicion of the Small Council due to the preliminary exclusion of Constance and Strasbourg from the upcoming meeting; Myconius considers a two-day separate pre-meeting unproblematic. Capito urges a joint determination of the stance on matters of faith and church issues and has sent a letter from Luther with proposals for a reconciliation discussion. Myconius has no understanding for Zurich's request that Basel should advocate for a Zurich mediation attempt with the Solothurn "bandits." Certain statements by the Solothurn bailiff [Hans] Doben also do not bring honor to Zurich. Quotes articles that King Ferdinand has presented to the Saxon prince [Johann Friedrich]. Expects a change in the situation of Geneva. Bucer has recovered. A French delegation is staying in Schmalkalden. The English King [Henry VIII] is inclined towards Protestantism. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have long observed the messenger, through whom I would respond to your letters and also convey other things that seemed necessary to know, but until now, no one has come forward, which I regret. Now, at last, I have found someone, though late, through whom I have decided to send this message.</p>
      <p>First, about the meeting: A few days ago, I asked the lord what Phrigius had reported, whether it agreed with yours. I found it to be in agreement. He added: "Now no one knows anything about these matters except for the main points. We are considering how to present them to the thirteen men, so they are not offended, as the Bernese and Zurichers initially exclude the people of Constance and Strasbourg from the meeting. I know they will suspect those churches to be divided." I added that there is no difficulty here if we at least precede the gathering of the senatorial assessors by two days. It can be done in these days, so we can then sit securely. With these words, we parted. After this, I did not hear a word about the meeting. Meanwhile, matters concerning the people of Geneva and Bern, as well as some peculiarities, have arisen, which easily excuse the delay on my part. Capito sent letters, in which he wrote to me about the meeting in these words: "There is a serious reason for the colloquy, so that we may finally decide on doctrine first, then on the church's economy, what we will concede to the papists, and what we will defend without moderation." This is what he said. I am indeed waiting to see what happens. The same person sent letters written by Luther on December 5th, in which Luther explains how much he desires to achieve concord before he falls asleep, and how much he wishes to be present himself. For this reason, he designates one or two places in Saxony where the meeting could take place. I would have sent a copy if it had been at hand. I will indeed do what I can to ensure we have something certain soon. So much for the meeting.</p>
      <p>About the Zurichers, I will speak with you briefly. I cannot sufficiently marvel at their imprudence in that they recently wrote to our people, asking that through them, they obtain from the exiles of Solothurn that they allow them to act as mediators. What kind of request is this, I ask? Recently, they declared those nine as enemies, and now they want to be mediators. Then those with whom they made such a decision refuse to agree with our assembly because they did not decide equally with them. With what mind, then, do your people make such a request of ours? They suspect them badly, as if they know where those nine are and what plans they are making and what they are deciding for the future, and if there are any similar things. I indeed fear that they are so stupefied by some unknown affection that they do not know what they are doing. For I perceive that in many other matters, they are equally blind. I see such things happen to all who limp on both sides. It is your duty and that of your co-workers to lead them on the royal path and to strengthen them here with all your might.</p>
      <p>Recently, a bad suspicion arose from another matter, so that I hesitated about you, not about all of you, but about some, whom our Utinger calls jackdaws. You have surely heard about the bailiff Tobias of Solothurn. He - so that you may better know what I am about to say - spoke here many years ago in front of many: "I would rather take the devil's side than accept your faith." The same person now, when there was talk about the princes who are joining the gospel, spoke in this manner: "If it goes like this, I can still go to Zurich, where I will be at peace." Then his wife: "I have long told you, you undertake to act against the gospel and fight to hinder it. I have long suggested to you that you should go to Zurich, your fighting here is in vain." Consider, I ask, what that impious man said and where those words might lead. They certainly cannot be to your credit.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, articles proposed by Ferdinand to the Saxon prince have come to us, the first of which is about the new federation, which is now said to be under discussion in Schmalkalden; which I omit. The second is that he requests to exclude the Zwinglians entirely concerning religion. But the prince did not agree, declaring that he would use his freedom here as elsewhere. The third designates Mantua as the place for the council. Here the prince is said to have agreed. The fourth states that whatever the majority in the council accepts should also be valid with the prince. The duke agreed thus: if they are founded on the evangelical writings, otherwise not. Some contention arose from this point, for the king did not want to hear the gospel until William, Count of Nassau, with others, intervened so much that the king relented. You also have something to consider from this.</p>
      <p>There is nothing to say about the people of Geneva, except that they have not been abandoned by the Bernese as unkindly as it seems, if they have been abandoned at all. I hope God will defend them. I saw something in a dream, which is not to be revealed now. Consider what I say. I see a great change in affairs approaching. May the Lord protect his own. Amen.</p>
      <p>Bucer has recovered from the most pestilential plague.</p>
      <p>A French delegation is in Schmalkalden, promising everything, asking for nothing but the goodwill of the princes.</p>
      <p>The Englishman is entirely in the gospel; I write with certainty.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and Utinger, Pellican, Leo, Theodor, everyone.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 4, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
