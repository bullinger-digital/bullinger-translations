      <p> Greetings. For two months and more, we have received almost no letters from you, my son. I attribute this to your studies being so diligent that you do not spare even a little time to write, especially letters that are not necessary. For I do not wish you to write letters about matters that are not serious or necessary; I prefer you to devote all your time to studies and readings. However, if you sometimes send a sample of your exercises, from which I can observe or assess the progress of your studies, or if you discuss with me something about your studies, teachers, and lectures, you will do a pleasing thing. I am now again expecting a list of expenses; starting from where you ended the previous one: for whatever I see serving your necessity, I will freely grant, especially if I understand that you are making excellent progress in piety and learning; for this reason, I am making these expenses for you, so that I may achieve this end, that you may return to us someday better and more learned, which I pray for unceasingly from our God, and I urge and beseech you to do the same. By God's grace, we are all well enough, except that your mother and I are troubled by frequent headaches. The good Lord thus reminds us of our condition and also you, our children, so that you may provide for yourselves in time, while we are still alive and can help you; for when we are dead, not everything will proceed with the same ease. Although I know well enough that God will never fail those who fear Him and call upon Him in truth. I want you to hand this letter to Mr. Garnier, pastor of the French church, and Mr. Peter Martyr his, whom I insist you regard with particular respect again and again. Live mindful of my instruction and farewell, dear son. May the Lord bless you forever. May our students be safe, and may your whole household be well, etc. ZÃ¼rich, March 1, 1554. </p>
      <p> Bullinger, your father. </p>
      <p> To his beloved son Heinrich Bullinger, residing in the house of Mr. John Burcher, the Englishman, in Strasbourg. </p>
