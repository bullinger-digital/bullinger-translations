      <p>Greetings. First of all, I owe you many and great thanks for the remaining part of your Decades; I have gone through it these days with as much diligence as my affairs allowed, and I found everything to be most pious and learned, a vast and most abundant treasure of commonplaces, which will undoubtedly be very beneficial both to me and to other students; may the Lord preserve you for a long time for our churches, so that we, instructed by your holy labors, may faithfully build them up in the Lord!</p>
      <p>Secondly, I also thank you for those letters from Blaurer and Vadianus sent to us, which I am returning here. I beseech you, continue to inform us if you receive any news; for we are here enclosed by the Alps in a corner of Germany, so that news reaches us only from Zürich or Basel. However, the news from Basel is mostly unreliable, so it does not earn much trust from us. We have nothing new from France at present.</p>
      <p>The discord between our people and the Genevans troubles me greatly; for I hear that the Genevans are most indignant about the constitution and exaction of our people.</p>
      <p>The matter is set to be resolved on the 2nd of November. However, as I hear, they will only discuss whether my lords are obliged to be here for the trial; for they believe they are not obliged, since they imposed the tolls only within their own territory. The Genevans believe they are not obliged.</p>
      <p>Thus, Satan continually sows discord among the evangelicals, who not only should agree but also must be most united and harmonious.</p>
      <p>We hear here that the Wedischwil case has been settled. We wish to know under what conditions. If you have any certain information, write to us.</p>
      <p>The people of Lausanne have achieved nothing here. We referred them to the senate, by whose authority the colloquies were changed, not abolished as they say, so that if it pleases them, they may be restored to their former form by the same authority. The senate was most indignant at their insistence and dismissed them with the matter unresolved. Viret, in his letters to me, does not obscurely reveal himself: that church discipline cannot stand unless private inquiries of faith are made. Thus, we will not only have private, priestly, and auricular confession again, but also new inquisitors of heretical depravity.</p>
      <p>See what is to be expected from these men unless they are restrained. Now in Geneva, that inquiry has been instituted. But we will see, which I greatly fear, other fruits than those good men expect. May the Lord grant us the spirit of humility, so that we do not presume more of ourselves and our ministry than is fitting.</p>
      <p>I hear the reason why Theodor Marcellus left the jurisdiction of Zürich; but he himself went to Bruges, who did not dare to receive him without the consent of our lords and sent him back here; he was therefore here, but secretly from me and Musculus, to whom he is nevertheless very well known to the point of familiarity, and he obtained from the senate that he might enjoy the right of hospitality there for a time, undoubtedly fearing that we would resist his endeavors. I hear from trustworthy sources that he blames the preachers of Zürich entirely for not being able to stay there.</p>
      <p>Schertlius and he and the Count of Oettingen are indeed good men, and all those similar to them, yet in the meantime they are bloodthirsty and pensioners, making little of civil peace and public tranquility.</p>
      <p>Finally, I come to Mangold's business, about which you also wrote in your last letters. I helped him as much as I could. The treasurer was not in the city; for he had gone to some baths located in our Alps, and with him also our Eberhard. Therefore, I commended him to Hagio, who at this time was acting in the consul's place in the consul's absence. He performed his duty in such a way that whatever remained of the deceased's goods, whether books, clothes, or even some debts, was all granted to Mangold and Froschauer, on the condition that they provide sureties or guarantors, so that if any other creditors come within a year who can prove they have more right to these remnants than they do, they will be willing to return them. Mangold asked me to be a guarantor for him and Froschauer, which I was indeed ready to do, provided I would not have to contend with anyone legally if perhaps another creditor came; for as I am not involved in these matters, I could not do so without offending my church, which I must consider above all. Since he could not declare me free from this trouble, he began this plan: that he would leave both the books and clothes and the money still outstanding with debtors here under the custody of good men until the end of the year, which will be in eight months according to the statute of our city. So if anyone in the meantime proves they have more right to these things than either he or Froschauer, well; if no one comes or proves this, then he can take everything that remains without delay. He himself did this, and although he could have reported everything to you better and more fully, he nevertheless asked me to write the summary of everything to you, I think for Froschauer's sake, and especially not to omit this, that in the letter written to my gracious lords about him and Froschauer, some cash was mentioned, which is not present, and they were mistaken in writing; for no cash is present, only books, clothes, and debts. For even if there were cash, they could only pay the local debts from it and from the household goods, which amounted to up to 230 pounds. You can also inform Froschauer of this. Farewell in the Lord most happily with all yours, whom you will greet from me and all mine. Musculus writes himself. Bern, 24th August 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
