    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends Myconius some of the items presented at the Baden Diet on April 14, 1534. The people of Basel should continue to remain steadfast. He is pleased with the favorable news from the war to recapture Württemberg and wishes for further reports. However, if King Ferdinand were to win, it would bring much reproach to the Reformed in Switzerland from the Catholic Confederates. Landgrave Philip of Hesse wrote to Bullinger, asking him to obtain permission from the Zurich Council for the passage of mercenaries coming to him. Bullinger did not do so, to avoid rumors of secret collaboration with Hesse, but is himself surprised that not only were the few hundred passing through not wronged, but they were even overwhelmed with kindness. However, the council prohibits the recruitment of its own subjects to both warring parties. In response to Myconius' inquiry, Bullinger recommends Andreas Karlstadt for church service in Basel. He is not as Luther described him, but gentle and humble. Grynaeus knows him. Enclosure: The Zurich Diet envoys Haab and Rahn praise the firm stance of the people of Basel. They had requested in Baden, 1. that no envoys of foreign lords be tolerated in the Confederate places, 2. that the Burgrecht contracts concluded by the five places with Freiburg and Solothurn should be read out. The first request is certainly undisputed in Zurich, given the experiences with Ennio Filonardi and Veit Suter. For the second, Zurich will still consult with the evangelical places. The current weakness of the five places should be exploited. A derogatory remark by Luther about the death of Emser and Oecolampadius.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have noted down some key points, most distinguished sir, from the recent Baden Diet, which I believe you particularly desire, on this attached page. Encourage your people to remain steadfast, as they have begun.</p>
      <p>I am very pleased with what you write about the war. I kindly ask you to continue writing to me as faithfully and precisely as you have done so far, so that I can console and strengthen the good and faithful. May God grant success! For if, contrary to the opinion of many, things turn out differently and Ferdinand prevails, good God, how insolently our impious ones will mock us poor souls! Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to have mercy on us for the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave wrote to me these days (I trust this only to you), asking me to obtain from our magistrate that soldiers passing through the territory of the Zurichers are not prohibited or allowed to be harmed. However, I have not attempted anything with anyone, even verbally, as they might believe some secret plan is being hidden or fostered among us. Yet, I am uniquely amazed that, without anyone asking or obtaining it, no harm was done to the few hundred passing through, but they were overwhelmed with kindness. Meanwhile, our senate does not allow any of its own to join the camps of either Württemberg or Ferdinand, and we encourage this. For we are not unaware of the opportunity the French, favoring the parties, would seize to defend their impostures if we remained silent in this expedition.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding your request for a learned, prudent, and wise man from us, we present to you Dr. Andreas Karlstadt, a most learned, pious, and experienced man in sacred and also secular letters and disputations, about whom we have spoken more with your schoolmaster, your steward. There is no need to fear that he is the kind of man Luther painted him to be; he is most gentle, humble, and in every way complete. Grynaeus knows the man. Show whether he pleases you or what I should do next.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>April 24, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Master Johann Haab and Master Heinrich Rahn, our lords' envoys, send much love, goodness, and friendship, shown by the envoys from Basel, especially that they have been brave and bold, also presenting, [1.] that it would be good to negotiate and handle with the other places, so that they do not hinder the envoys of foreign lords, from which nothing good can grow for the Confederation, etc., [2.] while the Confederates in these difficult times desire to know what they should expect from the cities of the evangelical faith, Basel desires, on the other hand, to hear the alliance made with Freiburg and Solothurn, etc.</p>
      <p>Here I suspect, it will have no opposition with us regarding the first article. For my lords have driven against Ennio a year ago. They have also sent Veit Suter and the imperial ones from Zurich on behalf of the Confederates (because of).</p>
      <p>Regarding the second article, and others, tomorrow Marci will discuss with the council and citizens what appropriate response to give. It is well considered that a unanimous response should be brought to Baden from the council in Bern and Basel. For the good ones hope for that with us. The Immontani are in fear, perhaps doing now what otherwise would not happen. The opportunity should not be neglected, the time should be redeemed. I would like that they speak with them now, so that they do not plague us so much, as they would have their embassy to Innsbruck and Milan, etc. You know what should be advised, etc.</p>
      <p>The German version of Luther has: "I think that Emser and Oecolampadius and the like have died so suddenly through such fiery arrows and spears of the devil." What else is this than to have been killed or strangled by Satan?</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, Basel's antistes, especially to be observed brother.</p>
