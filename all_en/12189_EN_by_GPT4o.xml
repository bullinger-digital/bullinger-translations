    <p xml:id="regest1">Hospinian's letter is motivated by the kindness shown to him by Bullinger. - It pains Hospinian greatly to find himself in such a hopeless situation. His [countrymen] are making efforts to delay his appointment [to Zurich] by means of ever-new obstacles. In his naivety, he sought refuge with them and did not realize that they, having once delivered him to the treadmill, would leave him there to the detriment of his health. Supplications from his mother [Margaretha Züst], his brother [Johannes Hospinian], and other family members to the church and city council of [Zurich] went unanswered, so he feels compelled to seek help elsewhere, even though the Zurich dominion extends so far, there are so many positions in the church, and some [offices] have become vacant in recent years. Yet even if he were now to be appointed, he would have reservations about accepting, as he would constantly fear that the [Zurichers] would continue to distrust him, as they did before when he was in Basel and Marburg; at that time, they accused him of having forgotten God, his homeland, his teachers, and benefactors. If they still hold this opinion, they would be wise to only appoint him to a position after he has proven his usefulness; otherwise, he would soon prove to be an obstacle. - Similar things have happened to others; for example, his relative and teacher Johannes Rhellikan, who had to spend almost his entire life abroad, yet whose connection to his homeland is expressed in his posthumously published [“In C. Iulii Caesaris... et Auli Hirtii... commentaria... annotationes”]. - Hospinian writes candidly, trusting in Bullinger's sense of duty and continued goodwill, but is determined not to trouble him further with this matter. Bullinger bears no blame for this situation. Rather, Hospinian thanks him for all the kindnesses shown to him so far.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although, due to my inexperience, most esteemed patron, I should rightly remain silent in the presence of such a great man's kindness, as only the most eloquent men usually write to you and should do so, nevertheless, because my pain so obstructs the duty of modesty that I cannot help but pour it into your bosom, I would like to ask your kindness not to suspect that this is done with any other intention than with the best thoughts and hopes about you. Indeed, you are dearer to me and have deserved better from me than for me to be able or obliged to be angry with you, and I would rather suspect anything than that you have ceased from your duty.</p>
      <p>But still, I am greatly surprised and grieved that, although my countrymen know that I will be completely suffocated in these hardships unless I am soon freed, they still have some delay that hinders them from my appointment.</p>
      <p>To these people, I have so far considered fleeing in my miseries as to a sacred anchor; for I was not foolish to suspect that, after they had once especially delivered me to the treadmill, they would leave me there for so long not without the greatest risk to my health and safety. For if I could have been led to believe this, I would have endured anything rather than be subjected to this most miserable kind of servitude. Since the petitions and supplications of my dear mother, my brother, and the rest of my family to both the ecclesiastical and political magistrates have not yet had enough weight to elicit even a slight response from either, the situation itself cries out that I am compelled to place all my expectations and hopes elsewhere and to seek and demand help from another source. For it is clear to me from the reports of certain people that it would have been possible, if only it had been in their hearts, to free me from the treadmill. For such is the extent of the Zurich dominion, such is the abundance of ecclesiastical functions to be conferred, that I almost believe that not one or two or even three have become vacant within three years, so that if there had been a mind to recall me, I would have long since returned, having been recalled by a legitimate vocation. Now, however, even if I were finally summoned, I would consider it due to my own fault, and I would not regard that vocation as just or legitimate, and therefore I would not acquiesce to the vocation without a scruple of conscience, although I have desired and still desire to be recalled for serious reasons. For since I have been so often despised, rejected, and neglected above others, and since everything has been done and transacted with me, as the comic youth complained, even if I were to be appointed to some other function by them in the future, I would still fear and anxiously suspect that I would be considered untrustworthy by them, as they have long since entrusted to others of equal standing with me what they have shuddered to entrust to me, more vehemently than to a dog or a snake. For the fact that I am convinced that they expect and hope for little good from me is due to the fact that before, when I was in Basel and Marburg, they were carried away by such a biting and almost intolerable invective against me, although I was innocent, as if I had forgotten all piety towards God, my homeland, my teachers, and patrons. If they still feel the same way about me, they are acting prudently by refusing to employ me in the offices of your illustrious church before I provide clear evidence of better conduct; for otherwise, I would knowingly and willingly become a stumbling block, which I do not know if any other more serious crime could be committed by me, even with the Savior as a witness.</p>
      <p>But why do I complain and lament these things with so many words, as if indeed no one before me has encountered either the same or similar things? For it is a comfort to the wretched to have companions in their misfortunes. Did not the same thing happen to the man of blessed memory, Johannes Rhellikan, my esteemed relative and teacher, who was also well-disposed towards the Zurich church and republic and deserved much from it? This is testified by the booklet published after his death, in which he sought to honor and celebrate Zurich and the Zurichers, already sufficiently renowned in themselves, with honorable encomiums, and thus to exercise his gratitude and piety towards his homeland. Yet he was meanwhile forced to spend almost his entire life outside the borders of his most beloved homeland, and he was never able to enjoy a favorable condition in it, although he always ardently desired it with the most fervent wishes.</p>
      <p>I have written these things to you more freely and copiously, relying partly on the conscience of your duty and the goodwill you will preserve towards me as much as you can, and partly on my decision not to trouble you further about this matter. I fully acknowledge that you are entirely free from blame, as it has often happened that no mention of me is made in the conferring of ecclesiastical offices, especially recently among you. And being agitated by these meditations, I am finally raised to the hope that I will not experience those tyrants of Zurich; so that, because my obligation, by which I am bound to them, promotes nothing among them, it should also delay and harm me among others.</p>
      <p>Therefore, now, most esteemed Bullinger, cease to advocate for me and solicit these (tyrants) with me, to whom we seem to be telling the same story to deaf ears. I, at the same time, cease to be a burden to you, from whom more than enough has been done for me, and I give and hold immortal thanks to you for all the benefits with which you have affected me and mine. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given at Aarau, 12 days before the calends of May in the year of our Lord 1545. Hastily. Most devoted to your kindness,</p>
      <p>Hospinianus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and illustrious master Heinrich Bullinger, uniquely esteemed patron and benefactor, acting as the archbishop of the Zurich church. Zurich.</p>
