      <p>Greetings. It pains us greatly, dear Bullinger, that although we have faithfully reported to you everything we discussed with the pastors, we did not convey to you what seemed to be conducive to bringing about a friendly conversation, and what seemed to placate those who were offended. If much has been done imprudently against you here, I beg you to forgive your most loving and respectful brothers, as all who can complain about us no less than you do forgive. But because they know our intentions and clearly understand, as we can truly testify before God, that nothing else was the cause of not revealing to you and others than mere ignorance, which did not come to mind. I, being older, was carried away by the fact that the Lord had given such success to complete what had been begun for such holy brothers. It added to the culmination that the pious Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg so greatly desired it, and that I saw the way open to what I have always desired above all, namely that the exceedingly necessary concord between the churches would finally be achieved. For I think there is no one who is more distressed by such a stumbling block and hindrance to the gospel, and who more desires it to be removed.</p>
      <p>Beza was no less moved, and while he diligently attends to each thing that they do for the brothers and for the conversation, he did not think of this. Today, before I wrote, I asked our Viret what he thought about what was given, first to the truly good man Diller, and then again to Jacob Andreae. He replied that he found nothing to be offended by, nor does he think anyone should be justly offended. Not content with our Viret's opinion, I wanted to see what Calvin thought.</p>
      <p>I saw letters in which he does not begrudgingly forgive that they were not communicated to him any differently than to others, but he testifies that he is not offended in any way and has nothing that is not sound. But truly, if that arrogant Pollanus, who does not want to perish alone but tries to completely overthrow the church for which he ought to die, seeking to sow disputes and dissensions along with his followers, who have not once apostatized from Christ and the gospel, do not approve? For what would such wicked people approve? I truly wonder that since the writings contain nothing contrary to the truth that should grieve the good, if those who previously seemed somewhat unfair to us approve them, truly there was more reason for all good people to rejoice. You know, my Bullinger, that it was wrongly attributed to us by adversaries that we had only an imaginary Christ in the supper by mere opinion, and that we taught the eating of Christ's flesh and the drinking of his blood not as true but only as fictitious, whereas, on the contrary, faith truly receives them not in a physical and worldly manner but in a truly spiritual and heavenly way.</p>
      <p>Having professed this true presence, this true eating, and because they did not judge us to hold what has been so often inculcated in so many writings, now at last they believe and are more fair to us, nor do they refuse to hear us and converse with us. Truly, if we love the peace and edification of the churches, we ought to give thanks to God and earnestly strive, as far as we can, that progress to better things may be made from these beginnings. And as for me, if I had to die a thousand times, I would not want to cease here, but in every way press on, which I do not doubt you care for no less, if not more, that Christ may grant that we may finally see it completed and perfected. No better reason will be found than for a conversation, and to say what we have experienced, if we had conducted a thousand letters, we would never have reached with those with whom we conversed what was given in a few words in person and as if doing something else, and because it was not allowed to communicate our words to others in person, it seemed right to testify to a few what we felt: which we do not take badly to be accepted by those so alienated from us, indeed we rejoice.</p>
      <p>If that wicked man, with one or two others who narrate the triumph of adversaries to the envy of what is right, had anything of Christ, he would not bite so eagerly at those who are zealous for peace and edification, touching nothing of those things which (as I hear) are spread by his countrymen, and that with the favor of those who act with them, so that the book titled "Theologia Germanica" may prevail, against which all ought to be carried, so that the work with its author and the one who published it and such wickedness may be utterly removed. May the Lord Jesus lend a hand.</p>
      <p>I ask you, most excellent Bullinger, to consider that I uniquely desire to be as closely united as possible with the pious, to think and speak the same as the true servants of Christ, as I recognize you to be no ordinary one. If I observe all the churches, truly this is not the least, and it does not escape you how I have strived that they might agree with these, and I have given thanks to the Lord and do give thanks, that it has come to the point that our pious and holy agreement is testified before God, angels, and men, which I would not hesitate to defend and preserve to the end with my own blood, and I would far prefer this soul to be torn from me than to be alienated from your sacred assembly. Therefore, if anything has been done or said by me that does not agree with such a holy agreement, from which I have even slightly harmed this church, which never came to my mind, just indicate it, and I will immediately come running, to ask for forgiveness, to acknowledge the fault, not only in words but also in writings. I wish to defend nothing but what is right, and as I rightly acknowledge it was a sin that we did not communicate the writings there, so if there is any other sin, here I ask that neither age, nor office, nor any matter be considered, but only truth, piety, and edification. In some French booklet, which was published with my name suppressed so that no one offended by the name, as it was then very odious, would be hindered from reading, because the wicked were finally diverting the writings to another meaning than I understood, I treated everything again as fully as possible, so that no one would be offended nor seize an opportunity for error, and that then with my name assumed. What should I do where I have inscribed my name, if there is anything impious so that the wicked are armed, the pious disturbed, the church offended? I would die first than think to cover and bury the matter, and not rather confess the error and be reconciled with those with whom I wish to be one in Christ. Do me this favor that after I do not know the day of my departure and have been visited at home in my own and in my body, I may not leave here before I pay what I owe to the church, if I have offended it and have done nothing more from the heart. But if it has been done in good faith by us and nothing impious has escaped, please ensure, if you consider me as I consider you, that among colleagues I am regarded as my innocence demands. If I do not please or am not approved by Valerand, nor by Boquin and such, if it were my fault, I would bear it with difficulty. But since I abhor such dispositions, there is no reason for me to grieve, except that they perish and wish others to perish with them. If you and the brothers with Calvin, Viret, and other pious ones who are with us, absolve me with all expenses fully paid, with truth and equity alone effecting it, what thanks will I give to the Lord and how much will I owe to you.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that Beza has written to you more fully about the same matters, so that mine were not necessary, which you will consider kindly. Farewell, most excellent Bullinger, with all yours.</p>
      <p>I wish all colleagues well, whom I wish I could greet in person! I also wish the pious council to be in the best of health. Please greet Habium and the legate.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, the day before the calends of September 1557. Yours sincerely, Farel.</p>
