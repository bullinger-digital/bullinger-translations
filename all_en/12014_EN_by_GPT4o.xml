      <p>Greetings. I give you immense thanks for the booklets you sent. With the German booklet, you will anger Luther; for it seems to me that he does not agree with you in everything, even though you speak in a most Christian manner and support your arguments with scriptures. I will send the Latin booklet to Cousin; for I expect his brother every day, who wrote to me that he will be here this week.</p>
      <p>Platter has been elected as the schoolmaster of the Münster School, not by our academics, because he lacks the pompous title, but he was approved by the deputies and the council. The "little master" is already out of office. Our university representatives are gnashing their teeth, trying to hinder this arrangement, but they will achieve nothing if God wills it. It is now apparent why they sought titles: to more conveniently cover their asinine ignorance. There will be, I have no doubt, a change in these matters never before hoped for; for the council is beginning to smell their tricks.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, my best friend. Zurich.</p>
