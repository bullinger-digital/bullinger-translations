    <p xml:id="regest1">When the letter from the people of Zurich arrived, they had just applied for legal proceedings [against the Anabaptist goldsmith Lorenz Rosenbaum] with the council, as they had not been granted a disputation. Their complaint was directed against the accusations that they taught falsely, expelled pious Christians, interpreted biblical words arbitrarily and selfishly, and were also defeated in the disputation. Rosenbaum has one week to justify his accusations. With Mayor Hans von Waldkirch, who continues to behave biased and hostile, Erasmus [Ritter] had a heated confrontation when the council forbade them to mention the matter from the pulpit.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>Faithful, dear brother, your friendly and comforting letter was delivered to us today, as I was at the town hall. They understood it according to its content. However, we had already appealed for justice; for our lords have denied us the open discussion, because they recognize our teaching as right, and therefore it would be disgraceful to dispute about it. We have otherwise not accepted any discussion with the goldsmith; for he has a most virulent tongue, and it would have been dangerous for us if we had let him notice a slight word in the discussion, as it would have brought us a hindrance in the right, because they would have immediately sought a high ground and said: "They have scolded him just as much as he scolded them; go home and be well-mannered on both sides." Therefore, we have simply appealed for justice for the slander he has spoken against the word of God and our office, leaving our person entirely aside, although we could well complain about many slanderous words. But as long as he alone had it, we would not have sought justice, we could not have done without it out of necessity, and if it became necessary for us, we would have also reserved the same. But for the following articles, we complain, also appeal for justice, that he should prove them sufficiently in court. If that happens, we must wait further to see what our lords will do about it. But if not, we hope that he will turn away from our teaching and our office, for concerning our person, we do not seek any revenge, we cannot do without it.</p>
      <p>The articles: 1. Our teaching is false and unjust. He wants to prove that with God's word. 2. All those who desire to lead a Christian, pious life are expelled and driven away. To this, someone answered him: "If I lived piously, I would have a good place. I went there into the city, also out there to Zurich." He answered: "If someone lived as piously as Saint Peter and Paul, the preachers would not let him stay." 3. We torture the words, and when it comes to the truth, we skip over it for the sake of our books and benefit.</p>
      <p>The goldsmith's answer: He has put aside much stamping, he thought he had already spoken it out against us. He also does not mean that he has scolded my lords or the teaching, but our person, etc. But we should prove that we are the envoys, then one soon leaves the matter; and he does this only for the sake of brevity (he certainly got that from Waldkirch; he reads the Zofingen disputation, carried a sextemam around in the open square last Sunday), and he does not want to deny it. Why we do not also mention the fourth article; for he does not want to deny it to us, we should also mention it to him. The same states, as we disputed with the Anabaptists, they silenced and defeated us.</p>
      <p>Our answer: We have complained as above, hoping he will prove the articles, satisfy the court, and we are not obliged to prove anything. But if the court is completed, and he or others lack our mission, we are willing to give him, our lords, or publicly or before appointed persons an answer; acknowledging that to the court. And since he himself wants to deny the fourth article, we are willing to do the same. It is also recorded in the complaint that he likewise answered.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the judgment states that Master Lorenz, according to the complaint made by the preachers, should prove all articles, satisfy the court, within eight days from today. If it happens or not, further proceedings should take place, as is right. Therefore, friendly, dear brother, we ask you to open your faithful counsel to us by the next good day, if possible. We thank you greatly for all love and loyalty and high requests, and if we find it necessary, we will not leave you unvisited.</p>
      <p>But concerning Waldkirch, all matters are forgiven; for he behaves so biased that it cannot be sufficiently told. He is a greater enemy to us than the goldsmith. For, dear brother, you should know that next Saturday after the good handling therein, we insisted that he also, as we suspect, although we kindly gave in, if he wanted to confess before an assembled council that he had done wrong to the word of God, our teaching, and also our persons in all this speech, and our teaching and office were right and true, and he knew nothing but love, he and good, we would be satisfied. But the appointed ones stood up, as we have well heard, that he did not want to accept that. Therefore, a council has further recognized that we should remain silent from this matter in the pulpit, or they would deal with us, which would be too difficult for us. But Waldkirch's party has also written us manifold lies. The long guild master, who was in Zurich, also stated that Master Heinrich is angry with us for being so vengeful. But we have contradicted it comfortingly, knowing well that it is not true. But as Waldkirch has opened the recognition of my lords to us, Erasmus answered thus: "How does it come, since those who are called papists had the government in their hands and they reproached me that I should not preach about the mass, then those (who perhaps are not a small cause now that our mouths are stopped) came to me and said, if I let my mouth be bound, I would not be a true preacher." Then Waldkirch shamelessly called me a liar in the throat for the third time. And he had also done such a thing before for the sake of the Anabaptists in the open market without any preceding cause. There was an Anabaptist prisoner, Waldkirch said, why did we preachers not lie, so that the good citizen would come out, etc. Among other words, I, Erasmus, said: "The Anabaptists rely as much on the justice of works as the papists." Then he called me a liar in the throat again three or four times in the grossest manner, and there was such a shouting that his brother-in-law Ulrich von Fulach ran down from his house and took him away. And yet there was no preceding cause in between, neither little nor much. We do not want to withhold such from you; for the man behaves so very biased by day and by night, with words and deeds, that it is to be pitied.</p>
      <p>With that, entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>Given in Schaffhausen, 6th of September 1535.</p>
      <p>The servants of the church in Schaffhausen, your brothers.</p>
      <p>To the pious and faithful servants of the church in Zurich, our dear brothers.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
