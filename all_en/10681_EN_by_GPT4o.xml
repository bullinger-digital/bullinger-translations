      <p>Greetings. Your response to Capito is pleasing, most learned brother. For although they seem to act with good zeal, as if they are very eager for the unity of the churches, I can easily believe that both could have been misled by good words, since everyone judges according to their simplicity and piety. Capito wrote to me, but nothing other than that he worked for Grynaeus in Basel, so that he may be allowed to temporarily preside over theological lectures in TÃ¼bingen. He wishes to obtain from you that if anything regarding the Eucharist is ready for the press, it should not interrupt the tender concord, and that he may even temporarily hide with you. He adds much about Schnepf and Brenz, how they have secretly appointed very virulent bishops. Therefore, we who are in Zurich and Basel will wait for you, and we will do nothing without you, which we hope for in return from you.</p>
      <p>I am sorry that the plague has also invaded your family. You have, as I hear, a tender wife, very tender children, and you yourself are sanguine with added phlegm, all of which seem to be receptacles for this disease. But what? We belong to the Lord, whether we live or die. If the Lord calls you back (which, however, he may change in his goodness, so that we may have you as a survivor in the churches for many years), he will certainly find you most diligent in the cultivation of his field, in the work entrusted to you, who will return the talent entrusted with interest. He has deemed you worthy of this grace, which I do not judge to be the least, namely, when someone diligently and assiduously applies themselves to their calling.</p>
      <p>The brothers and churches, who know the gifts of God in you and benefit from them, will pray to the Lord for you.</p>
      <p>The envoys will report on the cause of the people of Solothurn. None of us, who are from the congregations, support it. In the meantime, who of good will consider the lies of the people of Solothurn?</p>
      <p>That Hagius, along with the city's architect, performed a mission to you happened without my knowledge. For that man is of such varied character, so inconstant, that I now find him to be both a primary friend and enemy of the Christian republic, sprinkled all over with Anabaptist flour. For whatever benefit he should distribute to the ministers even in utmost necessity, he takes care to support the swineherds more liberally than them. He does not admit a difference between ecclesiastical goods, so that he may allow them to be turned to his own use, and between the city's taxes, assessments, and revenues. He has many gifts, he can speak and dares to say what he wants. By persuading, he misleads many because of his authority. I tried with him what you once advised, but he remains the same. Francis treated the wolf for some time piously and learnedly in the sermon; he dared to prefer himself to him and openly boast that he would preach far more learnedly. He rashly dares to slander us among his own, claiming that we teach lies, and that he is so discerning that he immediately understands if someone preaches lies from affection or from the spirit of God, and similar nonsense. Thus secretly, yet in such a way that I learn from good and best friends, he slanders us. We have borne everything and still bear this troublesome Momus in the hope that he will someday come to his senses, while he is forced to admit that we do nothing other than what we must for our duty. He does not tolerate even the most modest correction from the magistrate. Why do I trouble you with many things? I write this to you for the sake of our friendship, as if I were speaking to a wall. If I had known the man was going to be sought, I would have recommended him to you for many reasons to be lamented. The greatest thing I abhor and detest in a man, which is also the most dangerous, is not safe to write. We will pray to the Lord that he may provide his people with a magistrate who is as eager to promote his glory as he is his own. The consul from Wattenwil has been absent for a long time, who could prevent many such inconveniences with his advice.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Heinrich, dearest brother of all, and embrace me commended to your bosom, as long as we both live.</p>
      <p>5th of September, year 35.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his gracious lord and trusted friend.</p>
