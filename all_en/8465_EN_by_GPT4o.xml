      <p>S. With the fewest words, I wanted to greet your reverence, most esteemed lord, both because the news from Italy has become known to everyone, and also because I have written at greater length to Mr. Rudolf Gwalther. I give eternal thanks to your most excellent lordship and your common, indeed paternal, concern for our churches, for being the author and advisor to Mr. Gwalther, so that he has explained the cause, which I have hitherto dealt with among the Rhaetians, so faithfully and learnedly. Much instruction will flow from this to our rustic people, who, besides their native freedom, also wish to hunt for a certain academic license from the gospel. That book will humble the crests and insolent spirits and minds of many, and I wonder with what judgment Ganthner, who is raving more and more every day, will accept this medicine. He hides at home and sweats over venomous pamphlets, from which he sews together patchworks of all kinds, with which he intends to overwhelm me at the future synod. I fear that he will behave most disgracefully, since he is sowing tares most abundantly and still insists that they should not be uprooted. If he wants to be an adversary, it will harm not so much me, but more the churches, since he will be the author of recalling those opinions to the anvil, which even the papists themselves leave untouched. From which the greatest scandals and dangers must necessarily arise, especially in such a variety of minds, as happens in Rhaetia. I would prefer that all these things were buried most deeply and erased from the memory of men and that Ganthner were briefly answered: unless he wishes to join us in peace and completely agree with us, let him be excluded and deposed; we do not wish to waste time on such disputations and to open a window for others to err and think badly with these unusual questions. - What Borromeo and our not blessed bishop are attempting, you will easily understand from the enclosed letters. It has already been decreed four times by the lords of the Three Leagues that the ministers of Mesocco must remain. But beyond right and wrong, these most audacious wolves are trying to drive the innocent from the flock by force. Let everything be sent back to me soon, so that they are ready for the assembly.</p>
      <p>I hear that the same argument will be dealt with in Baden, etc. - Mr. Campell has been elected and confirmed, having obtained the same stipend as Ganthner without any trouble. Now they can no longer reject him, although those picky ones do not approve of his sermons, which not even Christ himself could satisfy. - I still retain your book and ask for forgiveness, as you are not unaware of the labor that falls on me alone, since I have long been without a colleague and Campell is not yet present, but will finally arrive within the span of one month. He sends his most cordial greetings to your reverence along with Mr. Consul, Pontisella, etc. Most swiftly from Chur, January 8, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted subject, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, I beg; for I could not do otherwise.</p>
      <p>To the most reverend Mr. Father, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord.</p>
