      <p>Bullinger's notes on the person of Christ.</p>
      <p>If when the Lord says: I am with you all the days of your life, he means both and the whole of himself, not just power, not just life, not just spirit, explain these things to me:</p>
      <p>We will come and make our home with him. I am in the midst of them.</p>
      <p>Christ lives in me.</p>
      <p>Christ dwells in hearts.</p>
      <p>Today you will be with me in paradise. And they placed him in the tomb.</p>
      <p>You insist: μεθ' ὑμῶν (Matthew, last chapter) I insist αξ' ὑμῶν (Acts 1.)</p>
      <p>These works of God do not arrogate to themselves nor do they make instruments, and yet they do something in the business of salvation: for they are not in vain. However, they do what God wanted them to do.</p>
      <p>He did not impart to the apostles the righteousness of faith and exercises or aids of faith equally. For the law is a tutor, but it does not justify for that reason: circumcision, but it does not justify for that reason. However, faith justifies. The sacraments are aids of faith.</p>
      <p>I hope we are already in agreement on these things and hereafter the same about the sacraments. [...] (the rest is cut off.)</p>
