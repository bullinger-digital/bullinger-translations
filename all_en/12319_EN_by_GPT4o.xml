    <p xml:id="regest1">In light of the events, Bullinger is surprised by Blarer's silence and requests news. - At the meeting in Baden on October 20 and in the following week, several difficult matters were resolved. Since the people of Zurich [as the leading canton in the renewal] of the alliances did not want to swear by the saints, but the Five Cantons insisted on it, it was agreed, considering the general situation, to forgo the swearing and to remain faithful to the already eternal alliances. - Although the [Protestant Swiss] cities were urged not to provide any side with mercenaries in a war within the Empire, a rumor arose that they had promised troops to [Philip of Hesse]. However, the cities denied this and asked the [Catholic] Seven Cantons not to send troops against the Germans at the request of Pope [Paul III] or others. The envoys of these cantons will convey the latter. - Four envoys [...] from Zurich, Lucerne, Uri, and Schwyz are to be sent immediately to Milan for negotiations with the [Governor Alfonso d'Avalos] and to clarify the rumors about military preparations there. In Baden, two wagons from Italy with military equipment were also confiscated. - Furthermore, the Council of Augsburg, with the bearer [...] of the present letter, requested the [Zurich] Council to send a preacher for Augsburg or Kaufbeuren, whereupon Bullinger suggested [Jodocus Kilchmeyer and Johannes Haller] to the council. The [Zurich Council] is annoyed that Isny dismissed the requested [Konrad Klauser] over the salary issue, which could negatively affect Augsburg's request; the matter will be decided tomorrow. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am very surprised by the lack of news from you, especially in these extraordinary times, as I can well imagine that you have all sorts of information. I ask you to be mindful of my request and to write to me with some useful news.</p>
      <p>The Swiss Confederates held a meeting in Baden on October 20 and continued until Sunday, October 25. They successfully resolved many difficult issues. Since there was a dispute among them regarding the swearing of the alliance oath, where my lords wanted to swear the oath solely by God and not by the saints, and the Five Cantons insisted on including the saints, the dispute has now been completely resolved as follows: Since the alliances are eternal, whether one swears or not, it was decided not to swear now, thus letting the dispute fall and to faithfully uphold the alliances with all parties, helping each other honestly against everyone, with life and property, especially now to be good Confederates, as such unusual events are beginning.</p>
      <p>And as you know, the cities were urged, in case of war within the Empire, to let the Christian cities in the Confederation send mercenaries to both sides, etc., the lands and some cantons in the Confederation have kept their knowledge and understood that the cities have promised strong support to the Landgrave. Therefore, the cities were questioned. The cities responded that they had promised no one any support and requested the Seven Cantons that if any recruitment was made to them by the Pope, etc., that they should not send mercenaries against the Germans. The envoys have taken their leave, with good hope that it will not be refused.</p>
      <p>Four envoys have been appointed to Milan, two from the cities, Zurich and Lucerne, two from the lands, Uri and Schwyz. They are to negotiate and arrange with the Marquis that he lifts the market and refrains from his previous actions; they are also to investigate what is happening in Milan, as there is talk of a significant armament. And as the meeting was in Baden, two wagons came from Italy and were brought down. And since rifles and military equipment were loaded on them and it was not known against whom they were intended, the Confederates have generally confiscated them until further notice, etc.</p>
      <p>This is all the news we have now, and the Senate of Augsburg, having sent this messenger and written letters, requested from our magistrate a preacher, whom they could either retain in Augsburg or send to a nearby city (I think Kaufbeuren). We have suggested two to the magistrate; what they will do, I do not know. It is certain that the people of Isny greatly offended ours by dismissing the request because of money. I fear that they might still be upset and therefore be less willing to comply with Augsburg's request; for they took the rejection very badly. The matter will be resolved before the Senate tomorrow. May the Lord ensure that everything turns out well!</p>
      <p>Farewell. Zurich, October 28, 1545.</p>
      <p>May all good men and brothers be safe.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his venerable lord and brother. Constance.</p>
