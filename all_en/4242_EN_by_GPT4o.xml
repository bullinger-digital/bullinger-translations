      <p>S. Regarding Naogeorgus, I know him not only from his writings but also personally, and more importantly, I am familiar with his character and manners. I was in close contact with him in Augsburg and later visited him in Kaufbeuren. He also visited us here two or three times and is not unknown to our people; we are also aware of how he conducted himself in Basel and how he left there. I have often wondered how he could live peacefully with Brenz for so long or how Brenz could tolerate him in the same church. Now it has erupted, which I have long feared would happen.</p>
      <p>However, I do not see it as likely that he will be provided for here; for preaching, he will not be suitable due to his barbaric dialect; and I do not know which profession he could be appointed to, as none are vacant. And to confess the truth, we all dread his character; he is very headstrong and has a very irregular mind, as they call it, and if he were not such, he would have had a place with us long ago. I once secured a fairly honorable position for him; but since everything seemed less splendid to him, he left us with some indignation. I see that neither he can bear the customs of our people nor we his.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, he is a very learned man and particularly dear to me for the sincerity of his doctrine, and I could well tolerate him if I saw others could do the same. I wish he could have a place in the Palatinate.</p>
      <p>The people of Heidelberg are trying to draw Musculus away from us; they are calling him to succeed Tilemann and are offering him a splendid position.</p>
      <p>But just as our people do not let him go, among whom he is held in high regard, he himself has also inclined his mind towards peace, so he will not easily take up any other position. Therefore, he politely refuses the call.</p>
      <p>For this reason, Turingus Rustius was sent to us with letters, which he delivers to you, to test his mind. I think he will also use your advice, whom you consider suitable to be appointed there. Therefore, I commend him to you; he is a young man of good hope, who has now been studying in Heidelberg for some time and has an excellent testimony from Dr. Erastus.</p>
      <p>Would that a sincere theologian could be appointed there! This would greatly hinder the Lutheran faction and promote the cause of truth; for that place is situated almost in the middle of Germany, and the authority of that prince is also very great among the other princes of Germany. The same rumors about the conspiracy in France are also flying around here as with you.</p>
      <p>We hear there are about 6000 conspirators; but their plans have been uncovered, and some of their leaders have been captured and are being severely tortured to extract the whole truth from them. It is also reported that the Duke of Guise is roaming throughout France with an armed force, occupying fortified places, roads, and passages, and ensuring that the conspirators, who are scattered, cannot convene, thus breaking a large part of the plans already undertaken. If this is true, France will be more soaked in Christian blood than ever before.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on His church and deliver it from tyranny.</p>
      <p>The affairs of Savoy are now quiet.</p>
      <p>There was hope that everything would be amicably settled with the people of Geneva; but everything is still pending unresolved. May the Lord grant a happy outcome here as well.</p>
      <p>Musculus, Diesbach, Haller, my father-in-law, and my mother also greet you. Convey our greetings to all yours in our name.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 22, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his lord and esteemed compatriot.</p>
      <p>In about eight or ten days, the monastery of St. Maurice in Lower Valais was completely burned down to the ground except for a few houses.</p>
      <p>The fire was so strong that a castle, situated on a rock above the monastery, also caught fire and burned down. It was a close call that the nearby town did not also suffer.</p>
      <p>To Appenzell, young lord Gladi Mey has been ordered to complain and bring a levy; I do not know exactly whether it is 200 guilders or crowns.</p>
      <p>In Provence, not far from Aix (not the Aix in Piedmont, Aquae Sextiae), some of the conspirators are said to have been defeated and killed, 7 leaders captured, and others more, who are said to have been hanged on trees along the highway, though far from each other. May God grant a merciful outcome to this matter. April 2, 1560.</p>
