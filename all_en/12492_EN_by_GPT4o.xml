    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to Bullinger's letter [not received] to the mayor Hans [von] Waldkirch, the Schaffhausen students [Blasius] Öchsli and [Jakob] Rüeger are allowed to continue studying in Zurich and to retain their scholarship, even if they were to marry, as long as the council considers this appropriate. The [Zurichers] should continue to instruct them and encourage them in their studies.</p>

      <p>Our friendly, willing service always beforehand, worthy, highly learned, especially gracious, dear sir and good friend, we have understood your letter, written in recent days to our faithful, dear mayor Hans von Waldkirch, and we are pleased to hear your friendly opinion that we want to have our two students, Öchsli and Rüeger, stay longer with you in Zurich for their studies, and to continue to provide them with the scholarship (not longer - if they marry, or not - as it is convenient for us). Therefore, our request and desire to you is that you will once again look after them, guide and teach them, and for what is reprehensible, punish them, so that they may proceed further in their studies and very soon, when we need them greatly, be of use to us. We will willingly earn this from you, should the occasion arise.</p>
      <p>Given on Wednesday after Misericordia Domini in the year, etc., 46. The mayor and council of the city of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the holy divine scripture in Zurich, our especially gracious, dear sir and good friend.</p>
