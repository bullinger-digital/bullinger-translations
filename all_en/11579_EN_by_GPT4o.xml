      <p>The priests of Regensburg have petitioned Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria to protect and shield them, and he has given them this kind of answer: he can no longer help them; for it seems to him that the matter wants to have Saint Vitus, etc. Oh, if only they also had Saint Anthony's fire, then everything that was to be burned would burn, and nothing would remain! I said this in jest, but sincerely.</p>
