    <p xml:id="regest1">Returns the report on the Worms Religious Discussion [No. 1469] and wishes that the machinations of the opponents would be made as clear to the public after other meetings as well. Is concerned about the fate of [Werner] Steiner and hopes that he has been released from prison. From Regensburg, it is heard that the negotiated compromise is not accepted by either side. In view of the Turkish advance on Buda, Emperor [Charles V] requests help, but [the Protestants] first demand a secure peace. Some theologians are already departing; much effort has been expended in vain, and God's wrath is being provoked. Greetings; Ambrosius [Blarer] will probably write as well.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I am sending back the report on the Worms Religious Discussion. If only the other meetings were also described and published in such a way, so that the whole world would understand with what nonsense and cunning the sincerity of the gospel is being opposed!</p>
      <p>I received with many sighs what you wrote about Steiner. Ah, how uncertain we are about what the Lord intends for us in this valley of misery! However, I hope that the good man has already been freed from his distress and imprisonment.</p>
      <p>From Regensburg, it is written that a formula of concord has indeed been conceived, but it has been rejected by our side, and not even approved by the adversaries. It is such a sharp, clever, and slippery (slippery) thing.</p>
      <p>Now, since the Turk is only 25 miles away from Buda, the Emperor is seeking to negotiate assistance against him, which our people completely refuse unless a secure peace is established.</p>
      <p>Several ministers have already left, namely Frecht, the Nurembergers, the Augsburgers, etc. Calvin is also preparing to leave, as I hear. Thus, we ultimately waste our oil and effort, except that with our foolishness we aggravate the Lord's wrath more and more against us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your whole household and brothers. I believe Ambrosius will also write something.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, June 29, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest and most respected brother in the Lord.</p>
