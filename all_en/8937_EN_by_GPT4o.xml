      <p>God be with us, faithful, beloved father. It has not yet improved with Hans Rudolf, the weaknesses are still present in him; but the blood has clotted again. He expels a lot, thick and slimy blood, which is always more good than harm. As God wills it further, we will wait in hope that it will become good with him again. I will, since he otherwise has no one, stay with him, only neglecting my lectures, which I do not like to miss. But since the great necessity requires it, I must be excused for so much. I have asked brother-in-law Felix Tr√ºben to read my hours, etc. Therefore, we would like, if something comes out, to have a freshly baked simnel cake and two white rolls for Hans Rudolf. But if you have no message, then show it to my wife; because most of the messengers ask at my house, etc. I ask you, dear father, to also excuse me to my brother-in-law, that I am always away from the church; because I hurried away yesterday and could not come to him. Cousin Vrenli, as we hear, has returned home because of the weather, where we expect it will come out today or tomorrow, etc. With this, we commend you all to God Almighty; may He keep us all in His grace.</p>
      <p>Berg, June 22, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your obedient dear son Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father.</p>
