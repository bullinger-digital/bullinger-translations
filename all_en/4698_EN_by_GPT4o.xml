      <p>Greetings. The bundle of letters that you entrusted to me to send to Lord Redonensem, I have still retained with me and will not send until I believe that no further danger threatens you from there, as you requested in your recent letters to me. We have received from the court of Duke Christoph what the electors and princes responded to the papal legate at the recent Nuremberg assembly, who had gone there for the council's sake; our countrymen have shared this with yours, from whom you can easily obtain a reading; for I did not have time to write back about those matters again.</p>
      <p>You can hardly believe how much pleasure I derived from understanding that those princes used the same arguments so openly against those papal councils, which you used in your little book about councils, so that it is greatly to be hoped that many will derive not a little benefit from it, since the consensus of minds, as in other matters, but especially in the business of religion, takes deep root and spreads. Give my regards to Lord Rudolf, an old friend, in my words.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, March 8, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Martin Peyer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, doctor of sacred letters in the church of the people of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and much esteemed friend.</p>
