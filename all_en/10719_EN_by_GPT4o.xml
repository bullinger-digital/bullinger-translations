      <p>Grace and peace from God, the Father, through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, I have been reliably informed that, not only before you, but also before other gracious, dear gentlemen, such as an honorable council with you, certain false teachings and opinions have been spread, of which I am not only not a supporter, but indeed a particular and prominent defender against them. This troubles me not a little (as it should rightly trouble every Christian); for I consider it the greatest and most grievous disgrace when something that is contrary to God, the truth, and His holy word, as well as to true Christian faith, is attributed to someone, and that with falsehood. Therefore, due to my pressing necessity, I do not wish to respond otherwise or further at this time (hoping that it may be arranged that I can do so personally before you with more words), than to say that I am as little inclined to those articles and accusations as I am to their sentiments, indeed as little as those who speak of me strongly and much. But in conclusion, I refer and appeal to God and Christ (who must be my witness, if I did not hold otherwise, then I might perhaps be suspected), regarding what I believe from God and hold as truth, namely nothing distorted or divided from the common and orderly Christian church, which is built solely on Christ and His holy word, but everything according to the guidance of God's word and the measure of the holy, true, Christian faith. Amen. Therefore, dearest Master Heinrich, my friendly, earnest, diligent, and urgent request to your honor is that you allow me to be excused with this my unavoidable, simple, and unskilled response before you, and also kindly justify and excuse me before all pious and Christian believers (before whom such unfounded fabrications have been shown and spoken in your presence), until perhaps God grants that I may personally and in all matters, pieces, and articles make a defense, which I then hope and intend to do from the heart with steadfast truth. May Almighty God grant you His grace and strength to proclaim His eternal word with steadfastness in the freedom (which the holy Paul desires). Wishing to show you my special trust in this; the city is entirely friendly and willing to be indebted to you.</p>
      <p>I also thank you for your goodwill regarding the report to the Duke of Württemberg.</p>
      <p>Dated Tuesday, St. Otmar's Day, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Johannes Waldkirch, mayor of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, residing in Zurich, my special, gracious, dear lord.</p>
