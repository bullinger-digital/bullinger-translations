      <p>Greetings. Our synod has finally been dissolved, having lasted for three whole days.</p>
      <p>The brothers indicated that the matter in the Upper League is leading to great unrest, unless God intervenes against the very wicked efforts of some; such is the power of that diabolical angel. But I hope their madness will soon be revealed.</p>
      <p>Several thousand people have flocked to the chapel, where the angel is said to have appeared, no one teaching; they bring money, sheep, hens, etc. Thus, this rustic will soon be enriched.</p>
      <p>It is a corrupt affair; yet I hope that this, like other things, will ultimately serve the advancement of the gospel, once their deception is uncovered. The situation is so dangerous in the Upper League that if two men were to come to arms over this matter, it is believed that a great bloodshed would follow. As I was progressing in writing this, behold, your letters, and indeed another, are delivered to me; for the other was delivered the day before by Balthasar Heer of Glarus, who affirms at length that the Five Cantons have again considered oppressing their own by force, and I do not doubt that the angel has stirred up this tragedy, so that our people may be kept at home, as they do not get along well with each other. My dear father, you do not know how many are lukewarm, although, to tell the truth, many are fervent. But I can promise nothing certain, as such practices are conducted at the discretion of a few, and especially those who have learned to receive. But you will see, the Five Cantons will act more leniently because of the Turk now threatening the Pope and Philip. What you heard about the captured fleet is true, and yesterday the envoy announced it as most certain; it is said there were 62 galleys, of which 14 remain, which are so reduced to straits that there is no hope left for them, and God's providence shines wonderfully in this case; for it is said that Philip's forces, upon the arrival of the Turkish fleet, occupied an island called Zerbe and had almost fortified it completely, when suddenly a storm arose, driving the unwilling and unexpected Turkish fleet, which is said to have been 300 Italian miles away, onto the same island by force. Many thousands of people are said to have been captured.</p>
      <p>We hear from France what you also write.</p>
      <p>A certain supplication has come into the hands of the envoy, said to be clearly written, which the authors of the French movement are said to have presented to the king, in which they give the reasons for the tumult and clearly exclude religion, for which they claim it is not right for subjects to take up arms against their kings; but they attribute the entire cause to civil matters. They direct all blame to the Guises, whom they affirm wanted to seize tyranny, usurp provinces and some counties, double taxes, and meanwhile not pay wages and debts, trace their origin to Charlemagne, and indeed remember that their father Heinrich, if he had survived, had thought once to expel the Guises from the kingdom. These and other things, etc.</p>
      <p>Please write to us, dear father, who has been elected consul, and if there is anything else about Swiss affairs; for it is especially important to know these things, so that we may gradually instill in the good what is beneficial for the church. What you fatherly advise about the angel, everything has been extensively discussed in our synod; no one in Chur believes it; everyone calls for the rustic to be subjected to torture. And certainly, the matter is fabricated and false, because the rustic is said to be a particularly greedy man and not of such a proven life that he should boast of angelic visions. And what is more: the one said to be the author of this tragedy is entirely dependent on pensions. And when we consulted with notable men from the Leagues, they all advised that the faithful should be diligently admonished in sermons, the certainty of the scriptures should be emphasized, and nothing further should be attempted at present until this unrest subsides on its own. Everything is vain and foul, and it never occurred to me to think that people could be so extremely desperate and stupid as to believe such delirious nonsense. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, whom both I and my wife wish well. All of ours wish you well.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 16, in the year of our Lord 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
