    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's apology for the delayed response is unnecessary. Zwick advises against publishing anything if Luther should react negatively to the Swiss letter, and returns the letter from the Bernese [No. 919?]. In light of Bullinger's letter to Thomas Blarer, he laments the wickedness of the godless; he does not know how Blarer will respond. He is satisfied with Bullinger's response [No. 948] to his questions. He shares Bullinger's concerns regarding the Diet of Schmalkalden, especially because of the division among the theologians, but finds comfort in the resolute stance of Ambrosius [Blarer]. The people of Nuremberg and others are said to have sent troops against the Turks to Vienna; it seems serious danger is looming. More details about Augsburg's exemplary measures are evident from the enclosed writings mediated by Wilhelm von Zell. He has not yet read the new explanations about the sacraments that Bullinger has added to his commentaries on Paul's letters [HBBibl I 84]; he will comment on them later. He fears the exclusion of all who do not sign the [Wittenberg] Concord Articles and is concerned about Bucer's zeal. He cannot write to Pellikan and Leo [Jud] now; sends greetings. [Gregor] Mangolt is picking up books and can also take something for Zwick. Further greetings. Thanks for the epistle commentary.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>That you consider yourself slow or infrequent in writing letters, dearest Bullinger, is not something you need to apologize for to me. I know the burdens that fall upon you, and you do not write so rarely that I could justly accuse you. Indeed, I must ask your pardon for overwhelming you so often with my letters, although I do not do this without reason, as ecclesiastical matters seem to me to be wonderfully entangled. I ask nothing from anyone in bad faith or with bad intentions.</p>
      <p>From your previous letters, I have heard what you intend to do if Luther rejects your letter, although I would not think anything should be published unless you perhaps understand that you are being accused of discord. I am returning the letters from the Bernese here.</p>
      <p>The letters you added to mine, addressed to Thomas Blarer, our consul, I have delivered, to which I can say nothing other than Christ's words: "'O Father in heaven, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil' [Mt 6, 13], from evil, from evil, that is, from the wicked men. Amen." I believe the consul will respond to your letters, but what he will say, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Your responses to my questions are pleasing. For all things that have a simple meaning and can be understood by simple people are very much approved by me. Otherwise, I have nothing to say about your responses.</p>
      <p>What is happening at Schmalkalden is not entirely known to me. Among other things, however, the matters you recently wrote to me about the council are to be discussed. Yet it is possible that this assembly may bring forth something new for us. If no one from the ministers were present, I would hope for less danger. For what you fear, I sense more certainly. May the Lord be with us, that we may walk simply! Ambrosius is a consolation to me, whom I know to be zealous in handling the matters of Christ and His kingdom. It almost kills me when the day ends; for surely, we will have something good or bad, or something of which we do not know what it is. Much prayer and earnestness before God are needed. It was a joke, whatever we suffered from the antichrist, but to be divided among ourselves and to bite each other will eventually prepare an epitaph for the kingdom of Christ and the gospel, and you know that no persecutions have ever harmed the gospel as much as the divisions among ministers.</p>
      <p>You ask about the Turks, what is certain with us. But indeed, nothing is certain. The people of Nuremberg and some others are said to have sent soldiers to Vienna for support; how sworn this is, I do not know. However, the common rumor and fear is that the mighty Turk is threatening us.</p>
      <p>What has been done about the people of Augsburg, or rather what they have attempted, you will hear from the published booklet, which I send to you along with another writing. I received both from Wilhelm Zell, and there is no need to return them. If only many others would imitate the example of the people of Augsburg!</p>
      <p>I am returning your letter written to Myconius and thank you very much for your kindness; your opinions are very pleasing. I have not yet seen what you have added about the sacraments in the Pauline commentaries, being hindered by many affairs. However, when I have read it, I will not hide what I think. Your writings have always pleased me as being clear and lucid. And if only all learned men would finally learn to abstain from darkness! But this will not happen until they cease to call darkness light.</p>
      <p>Oh, my brother, with how much fear do I await the end of the attempted concord in this matter! It is certain that different responses are being given to Luther by some. He will not bear this. Then he will bear even less that we say we taught the same thing before. How little he will bear to be said to have yielded in one letter concerning the doctrine of the sacrament. Therefore, I foresee, unless my judgment deceives me, that some of ours will reconcile with Luther and his followers through the subscription of articles. Those who do not agree with this mode of concord will be considered false brothers and will be treated by them as Judas by Christ. If only this were my dream! This fear is increased by the fact that I see other causes arising, I do not know whether to call them concord or discord. I once had hope that Bucer's fervor could be mitigated by our admonitions; but the good man seems to run in such a way that he can by no means be stopped or restrained. May Christ temper his efforts!</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother of all, and read what pleases you also to Pellican and Leo. For there is no leisure to write to them as well. May Christ keep you all with your families.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, February 19, 1537.</p>
      <p>Mangold will bring some books. If the sand, for which I wrote to you, were at hand, it could be sent to me through him.</p>
      <p>Brother Conrad sends you his most earnest greetings; all the brothers in the ministry do the same.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>For the Pauline codex given to us, a thousand thanks are to be returned to you in my name and that of Brother Conrad. We cannot return equal gifts, as equal gifts are not available. However, when the opportunity to reciprocate arises, you will understand that we will not forget this kindness.</p>
