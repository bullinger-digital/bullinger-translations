    <p xml:id="regest1">News from Augsburg: The Emperor [Charles V] has assured the estates of his willingness to negotiate regarding the religious matter, the reform of the [Imperial] Chamber Court, the Turkish campaign, the coinage system, the Brunswick affair, and the peace of the land, but emphasized that he cannot accomplish anything as long as he is occupied with the French [King Francis I]; he has requested assistance, granted 14 days for consideration, and in the meantime, has gone hunting near Heidelberg. The Emperor ordered the church [of the Dominican monastery] in Speyer to be closed, where the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] had [Dionysius Melander] preach. [At the opening of the Imperial Diet on February 20] the Landgrave did not want to sit next to Duke [Henry] of Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel], so finally Duke [John II of Palatinate-Simmern] in the Hunsrück sat between them. Not much is to be expected from the Imperial Diet this time either, except that the estates, especially the cities, will again be asked for money.</p>

      <p> From Augsburg: The Emperor (His Imperial Majesty) has informed the estates that he is inclined to help negotiate in the matter of religion, in the reform of the Chamber Court, in the Turkish campaign, in the coinage system, as well as in the Brunswick affair and the peace of the land. However, since the French (King Francis I) has so far been in the way, His Majesty has not been able to accomplish any of these matters properly, nor can anything fruitful be undertaken against the Turks and otherwise, until this enemy is dealt with. His Majesty has given this to the estates to consider, with a long explanation and defamation of the French before all the estates. Thus, His Majesty has given the estates 14 days to deliberate on this, and in the meantime, His Majesty has gone hunting to Heidelberg. His Majesty has also ordered a church in Speyer, where the Landgrave had someone preach, to be closed, so that no one can enter it anymore. The Landgrave, along with the Duke of Brunswick, did not want to sit, and His Imperial Majesty placed the Duke from the Hunsrück between them. Everything seems the same; nothing was accomplished at the previous Imperial Diet, and even less will be accomplished at this one, except that a lot of money will be demanded from the estates, especially the cities, to be cut. Hęc ille. </p>
