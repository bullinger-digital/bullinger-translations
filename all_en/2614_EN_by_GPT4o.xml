      <p>Greetings. Who, upon hearing and understanding what was done with the people of Lucerne, would not give thanks to God and the Father of mercies? When Satan attempted his utmost, he could do nothing in the hearts of the pious, as divine providence prevented it, arming the elect with faith so that they might powerfully resist the adversary. And when the enemy, defeated by faith, sought to attack the bodies through his own, who were stirred up in this matter to glorify the name of the Lord by destroying the pious, he could only take one from here, through whom the enemy was led around in a double triumph, and the faithful witness reigning with Christ provided ample material for joy to the pious. The defeat of others surpasses the magnificent encounters of all kings and emperors in cities and kingdoms, and whatever they approach with the greatest splendor, enter, and begin to possess, and all glory, so much so that I do not doubt it is dearer, more illustrious, and what not to both the expelled and the pious who hear. O happy ones, to whom the present gospel has come, all that is here. If the narrative is so pleasing to the lovers of Christ, because they see the father abandoning his children for the word, the son valuing Christ much more than parents, girls unable to be torn away from the gospel by parents, brothers, however dear, and sisters uniquely beloved. What Pharaoh, however hardened, would not be moved by such a pious spectacle? It is a wonder if those stony and fierce ones, who wished to drink such pious blood, were not changed. I, my dear Bullinger, if you had been the fiercest enemy of all to me, I could not help but embrace you for your most full devotion to piety, with which you have proceeded and continue in such a pious cause of the holy brothers. What then has not been added to such holy love and true charity, with which I have always uniquely regarded you in Christ, having promised myself nothing from you. Here the Lord wanted you unbroken, and although I know well that you will enter into the worst grace with those who prefer, as someone not entirely bad once told me, to follow safe counsels rather than bold ones, where now everything is full of far worse, who value counsels with arms much more than the word of the Lord alone, considering what reason judges, so that not only those who preside over public affairs are affected, which is indeed very bad, but also the pastors of the church, which is the worst of all, as you well know, yet you have valued the Lord and the word of salvation more than all, and gave this holy senate a better mind, so that it judged that only what is commanded by the Lord should be admitted and did not want to act against duty.</p>
      <p>Increase, O Christ, grace to your people and illuminate your name, so that it may be evident how good it is to depend on you. I hear that many expelled, to whom this pious senate has so kindly brought aid, are living among you, so that they may act more freely in all things. The holy purpose of relieving the poor, who are among the expelled, has reached us, and, as I hear, in this part it proceeds far differently than in defending the cause of Christ. May Christ grant that such a reason in bringing aid to the poor may have a place not only among the people of Lucerne but also among all who are truly poor for Christ's sake, since such collections would not a little contribute to the glory of Christ, while a pious account would be taken of the poor expelled for Christ.</p>
      <p>Since I sent your letters to Viret and again carried them to Calvin in Bern through the brothers, it happened that I responded later. What was done in Bern, I do not fully know, nor, what I know, do I like to indicate; I did not speak with the enemies of the truth nor was I present while Calvin was handling the cause of Christ. The pastors did their duty to defend the doctrine of piety and testified that they felt as one with the pious. May the Lord Jesus preserve them and fully fill them with his spirit, so that they may satisfy such a grave province; for it is indeed very grave.</p>
      <p>You greatly refresh me, as you find the defense of the consensus pleasing and offer to defend it. I think that good men elsewhere also desire that the consensus be fully accepted by all, which may Christ grant. I have understood from Blaurer, a man notably pious, that some obscurely criticize something, but old hatred agitates them. We await when they will judge more rightly, having set aside their affections. Tossanus, with some he has in Basel, although a few years ago he came under suspicion of not having a right heart and not purely following Christ, has finally begun to be more open to more people since the capture of Servetus, and recently in the persecution and expulsion of the best brothers, whom he had pronounced to be expelled without a cause by the prince. And when Tossanus sought to replace legitimate pastors who were ordered to migrate with wolves, the condemned brothers demanded to be heard, with only one German pastor daring to present a petition to the prince in the name of the brothers, the prince kindly agreed, and after hearing the brothers, everyone pronounced them innocent and to be restored to ministry. However, lest Tossanus had labored in vain, and the wolves gaping would not be sent back, he made it so with his tears that the evil condemnation was rather confirmed. Finally, when the wicked were to be imposed, Tossanus asked whether immersion was necessary for salvation, the wolves, having been forewarned, responded that it was. When asked to prove it with scripture, they brought forth the passage: Unless one is born of water, etc. And because the German had favored the expelled and had taken the last sentence, more unjust than the former, very hard, from which Tossanus suffered great envy, so that the greater part would fall on the German, he arranged for the wolves to be asked, since there are so many different opinions about the scriptures, as many as there are heads, as he said, so many are the same opinions: do you freely renounce the heretics and their errors, of the Anabaptists, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Osiander, and Calvin? They respond: We renounce. Here, what do you say, my Bullinger, what kind and how great a monster the wickedness of Tossanus brings forth. He favored Zwingli to the point of death, and the last letters, which that most prudent man of God wrote to me in September, so piously admonishing me not to rashly expose myself to any dangers, but to preserve myself for the work of the Lord, and the pious man was taken away by war before he could receive mine, in which I asked him to beware for himself, to whom far more dangerous things were threatening - those letters, I say, he gave to Tossanus, not without commendation of Tossanus, from which I could never understand that he did not think rightly of Zwingli, and as far as I can remember, he acted in the church there, both while Zwingli was alive and after his death, confessing both the pastor and the church to hold the piety of Christ, otherwise he would have been most wicked, even willingly communicating with heretics. What shall I say of Oecolampadius? What has he not said and seemed to think of him? He listened to the teacher for so long, acted in that church for so many years, that even today he carries it before him.</p>
      <p>What has he not said Calvin to be? What has he not often approved in him? Did he not exhort the people to recognize the grace of the Lord in the doctrine which Calvin and others delivered? He was in our assemblies and colloquies, and intimate with all. Calvin would never have allowed anything to be said against Tossanus nor against the church.</p>
      <p>And now Satan has so occupied the heart of Tossanus, who sets himself up as a pontiff in the churches of Montbéliard, expels the pious, institutes the wicked, in this his most diabolical crime, he contemptuously condemns the church of Zürich and the most pious pastor of Basel with the pastor whose piety can never be buried or perish. Before God, it will convict not just one Tossanus or another German, but all as many as there are liars and impious and blasphemous. Calvin does not need advocacy against such insane heads.</p>
      <p>I know Luther's attack. For what could be more absurdly written to the ruin of our churches than what was written by him to the cantons? I am silent about the forms of speaking he uses in the matter of the Eucharist, which are most monstrous.</p>
      <p>And what he wrote about never changing his opinion. Which indeed should move everyone to judge the man to err entirely from heaven. Yet I would not have him considered a heretic, nor the churches he formed heretical, since I know the man acknowledged himself to have been too much, nor did he reject the Basel Confession, nor the churches that held it: and that he was thus moved I see arose from the fact that, as he discovered in Carlstadt certain things that were far from a man zealous for the glory of Christ and who truly strove for edification and peace, he felt the same about others, and thought that words were being given to him, when the man, prone of his own accord, was being incited by wicked scourges: so that he could endure to hear or see nothing unless from where he could be more inflamed. Calvin, one of ours, he not only tolerated but also esteemed greatly, nor did he attack the man with word or writing. When I read in Luther, that if Christ present were to hand the bread with his own hands, and with his own mouth spoke that he was giving his body, if the recipient did not believe, he would nonetheless receive, I see a far different opinion of the man than elsewhere his words sound, and outside of contention, where he writes more peacefully what he believes, I think it should be attended to more than where he only fights.</p>
      <p>But I ought not to bring these things before you, since you are most loving of peace and edification, and who loves the prudent and truthful, and cannot but abhor the manners of such utterly lost hypocrites and such frivolous men, who will indeed feel what they do and whom they persecute. He who did not long endure the traitor openly leading the wicked to seize Christ will not more endure the insane subverter of churches, and willingly rising against the pious and gratuitously...</p>
      <p>When I had written these things, a young man from Neuchâtel returned to me your letters written on March 25, which I read with great emotion.</p>
      <p>I am very grateful to you, for you so lovingly commend the cause of the man whose salvation I desire, and, as is most just, you ask on his behalf. Would that he so desired what you command, as we are all prepared here for Christ's sake to comply with you; we will not delay the trifling of that antichrist about the bed and table with the bond remaining, only let him wish to live piously, which we greatly desire, and we hope, if he turns to the Lord from the heart, he will be useful to the church of Christ. It ought to move more that the pastors across the Rhine are so insane, to whom the heavenly Father may fully open their eyes, that they may learn to conduct themselves in the church of the Lord as is fitting. They have felt the heavy hand of the Lord, which indeed made us groan for their sake, and they have not been rendered any milder, but rather provoke the Lord more, they do not care for peace and edification nor see the evils that threaten them. May Christ, the supreme physician, heal such a harmful madness, since he, acting here, has already healed many who were driven mad by an evil spirit.</p>
      <p>Let us bring them to Christ and offer them with holy prayers and the sound word of God, as is fitting, let us counter the madness. If the Duke of Württemberg or any other prince would take pains, as the Landgrave once did, now they would do, the principal ones would meet, I would hope that everything could be better composed than has been done so far, since I understand the teachers approve the Consensus, as anyone rightly thinking ought to approve it. You, who know who are prudent and what the princes can do, do not need me as a monitor. You see rightly what is to be done here with prayers and a sound affection for the truth and defense; I rejoice that you are prepared for both. May Christ so compose those who have the truth, that they may do, say, and write nothing but sanely and holily in this pious cause, and as we are superior in truth, so may we conquer in all things and thus gain the healable for the Lord.</p>
      <p>I considered it a remarkable miracle, what I had heard, that although the wife did not believe the gospel, when the pious man went into exile to Locarno for the gospel, she followed her husband, and again, when the evangelical wife emigrated, the husband, although a papist, went with his wife. But as you see from what has been written to you, it has fully come to pass what Christ predicted, to whom be glory and honor, and may he be with you, so that you may accomplish what you do, console, exhort, and strengthen the brothers, that they may proceed vigorously, which the Lord grants. The most wicked horned ones with the idol born to their own and others' destruction, through which Hungary, Bohemia, to say nothing of others, endure the most unjust things, while they strive with evil arts to overthrow salvation, to utterly remove the gospel, will soon feel what it is to stumble against the stone.</p>
      <p>May Christ grant, while the reprobates utterly destroy themselves and provoke severe wrath upon themselves, that we may all seriously turn to the Lord and fully feel the paternal mercy and grace, and serve him purely and holily with all our heart. The creators of new gods will not easily forge him; it is indeed a wonder that any poor little vessel can make innumerable wafers of God, as they say, with five words anywhere, and that he can give, include, and exclude that God to anyone, and that so many cardinals, unless they all meet in Rome and spend a long time in conclave, cannot make a demigod or at most a god on earth from a man, although he must be a priest, to make a creator of the creator.</p>
      <p>May God visit that horrendous Babylon and fully confound all who, with help, counsel, vote, and in any way, strive for it to rise, stand, and endure, and may he quickly fulfill the wishes of those who desire it to be utterly exterminated and only wish Christ to reign. Farewell well; may Christ preserve you longer for his church unharmed. I lovingly and reverently wish your colleagues to be greeted; your colleague greets you.</p>
      <p>Neuchâtel, April 16, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Farellus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, brother and fellow minister to be greatly respected. In Zürich.</p>
