      <p>S. For the fact that, reverend father in Christ, you so kindly share your labors with us, we owe you the greatest thanks. If only my relative had taken care of it properly; certainly nothing has reached us yet; we expect them every day, but we are very afraid that they have been handled poorly. I could not reply to what you wrote to me about the brothers in Lausanne; but, God willing, I will send it back next week. I am amazed that they were so rash as to dare to prescribe these things to the senate.</p>
      <p>Indeed, our people in Valtellina are almost giving birth to the same thing and have sought our advice and judgment on the same articles (with one or two exceptions); however, they act more modestly, which is not surprising, for they are not yet in agreement among themselves; there are those who protest and say that in this way a new path to papism is being paved. We replied in this sense: that they, according to the apostle's doctrine, should pursue those things that pertain to edification, not those that pertain to destruction, lest they seem to know more than what pertains to sobriety; meanwhile, efforts should also be made not to stray too far from the institutions of those churches whose leaders' authority is held in the highest regard when it comes to making decisions at assemblies, lest the enemies of religion seize the opportunity to call them into disrepute among our people, etc. These and more, as modestly as possible.</p>
      <p>They want to push forward and once and for all force the matter through with their heads, imagining for themselves a perfect form of the church, but they cannot recognize that it requires a lot of effort, and it has been difficult to maintain that they are given shelter in the land.</p>
      <p>The adversaries are solely focused on ensuring that Italian exiles are not received or, if received, are expelled, and if they could persuade our people that those intend to bring about a renewal against the reformation of our church, they could better maintain their cause; for the papists do not lead. A good part in the Grisons is still not of our religion.</p>
      <p>There are those who oppose with all their might, not without hope of their own benefit and reward. The brothers from Valtellina wrote here a few days ago and believe they have so much influence with us that we would urge the consuls to bring up at the next assembly how the mass might be abolished in the whole Valtellina, etc. You see how great their ambitions are.</p>
      <p>Hardly a hundredth part in Valtellina agrees with us, and if our people were to attempt this so suddenly, it would lead to a significant disturbance and sedition.</p>
      <p>It has never been possible to maintain that in those places where the gospel is also preached, something from the common church goods and benefices is left to the ministers according to the number of people who hear the gospel and are otherwise church members (ministers live from the contributions of the pious). In Clavenna, half (almost entirely) is evangelical; yet Hercules a Salice and others support the minister Augustinus Maynardus from their own resources.</p>
      <p>All this will come up at the next assembly. If we can maintain that the benefices are divided according to the number of people, we will have great luck; for as the consul told me in private, the papists are working day and night to prevent this plan. And what is worst, one must first announce it to the communities.</p>
      <p>But the bishop is the one who, in the God's House League, announces the day to the communities along with the articles that are to be presented at each time; for the envoys in such serious matters have no authority to act beyond what they have received in their instructions from the communities. The bishop will strongly oppose it; but he must do it, because previously this matter was also brought up in Ilanz years ago, and at that time it was referred back to the communities for further consideration. This is the way, about which I have already written once and again, by which I would judge the papists to be undermined. Thus, the mass priests will be driven out of the land; for they will not want to serve with half benefices.</p>
      <p>Thus, many who do not have to contribute anything from their own will join our side, which is not entirely serious. But deceit or poison, who would ask for it in an enemy? If this succeeds, the bishop's heart will begin to tremble. Recently, the bishop's gate on one side fell in at night, and on the other side, the canons' cellar the next night; I take it as a happy omen, etc. If you write to the legate in the future, there is no need to give the letters to the hosts; for they are more negligent in handling them.</p>
      <p>However, this negligence of the host regarding your latest letters to the legate happened very opportunely; for listen to what happened. Not long after your letters were delivered to me, I ran into our citizen in the market, who was pulling letters from his pocket and said he did not know to whom they belonged. I recognized your handwriting upon inspecting the letters and took them to myself, and at the same time, I took care of them along with the instructions I had from you for the orator. The orator affirmed that nothing more desirable had happened to him for a long time than this very negligence of the couriers; for he added that if he had received your letters in time, he would have felt great pain and torment, as he had not had any certainty from the king's court for a long time, and therefore he would have trusted your letters, especially since they were supported by such reliable testimonies. And indeed, the rumor about the battle in the Netherlands, not far from Saint-Quentin, is so consistent that it has spread to Venice and all of Italy at the same time. For the king's legate, who is in Venice, wrote so anxiously the day before and wants to know the truth from our side.</p>
      <p>Our man had nothing certain to write back; not that these things were so consistently reported to him from both Basel and Strasbourg by friends, he was in great distress, from which your letters written to me somewhat freed him. He expects couriers every day, from whom he hopes to learn something certain, etc.</p>
      <p>The one who gave me your letter, which was written to the orator, reported how he had heard a letter read at the Engel in Baden, the sum and content of which was this: The Confederates in Piedmont had suffered badly, and the commander a Pro from Uri and Caspar Schryber had been captured and taken to Milan, etc. When I told this to the legate, he neither confirmed nor denied it; however, he said that nothing had been written to him about it yet, and as far as I understood, he had already heard the same thing from others, etc. But listen to what moves me to believe that this rumor is not entirely unfounded... Pro, who was in charge of the Swiss troops in Piedmont, is in the power of the enemy... that is indeed certain; for Mr. de Sax is therefore traveling to Milan to intercede for the captive with the Milanese. This was reported by the young lord of Sax at the castle in Maienfeld to the mayor Tscharner and others; but how he came into the hands of the enemies, he did not say; for he is just coming from France, and the father rode to Milan before he arrived in the country. I am sending you the letters of the orator; before he sealed them, he sent them to me to read.</p>
      <p>There can hardly be a worse one; he would have to be (as someone said) the devil himself. I wish to know something certain from your son Mr. Heinrich, in what state his affairs are; he promised me when he left here that he would write to me sometime. I wish him well.</p>
      <p>I am returning the acts of the Bernese senate in the matter of the people of Lausanne; I owe you the greatest thanks for having deemed it worthy to share these with me. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all your family, as happily as possible.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to Mr. Gwalter and all the good and pious men, the ministers of your church, my fathers and patrons to be respected. Also, give my regards to my father-in-law if you meet him; he is expecting our arrival; but the reasons why we cannot tear ourselves away from home are serious. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Chur, September 5, 1558.</p>
      <p>Mr. Philippus, Mr. Pontisella, and both consuls have asked me to send you their regards; if you have any certain news from the Piedmont region, please do not keep it from us. Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>I hear nothing at all about Mr. Fridericus a Salice, and for a long time, no one from those parts has been with us, and what I am ashamed to write, I still retain your letters to Fridericus a Salice with me. Not a day goes by without me sending a maid here and there to inquire; I also diligently inquire about messengers, of which Mr. Philippus Gallicius is my witness.</p>
      <p>Recently there were minor assemblies here, a meeting, and, surprisingly, no one from Engadin was present. According to Mr. Philippus and the consul, I am very anxious; they have come for bread at other times for eight days; but I believe they are buying the fruit elsewhere now.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and patron to be greatly respected. Zurich.</p>
