      <p>Greetings. I received, dearest brother, your letter along with the catechism book, which was very pleasing to me, for which I thank you, having nothing to repay you with, except that I pray to the Lord to keep you safe for us and the church for a long time. The letters you sent addressed to Erbio, I forwarded to him through a citizen of Kaisersberg on the same days. Regarding our Davidic matters and the entire action against them and the arch-heretic, I was expecting your opinion. But the matter was so odious that I am not surprised that not only the heresies themselves but also the absolution of the guilty hypocrites are condemned by all the pious who know more closely what monsters perverse men have harbored until now. If only they would sincerely repent, so that while sparing the persons, the sect would be extinguished at the same time. I have nothing new to write about; for you know better what wonders the Lord is designating everywhere. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 17, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and God-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful leader of the church of God in Zurich, my kind lord and much-beloved brother.</p>
