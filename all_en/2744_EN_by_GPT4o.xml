      <p>I am sending you a letter to Vergerius, which I would like you to hand over to the jurist Gribaldo, who will soon be with you, unless he is already there. It was very pleasing to me that you immediately revealed your judgment about Clemens; I completely agree with you.</p>
      <p>But, whoever the author is, whether it is another Clemens or someone else, it is entirely written in the name of that old Clemens.</p>
      <p>If at any time your studies allow you to write something to me, you will do me a most pleasing and delightful favor. Farewell. October 4th.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sanlaurentius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dearest friend.</p>
