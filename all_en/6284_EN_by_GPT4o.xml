      <p>Reverend lords, the same most illustrious and distinguished men, dearest and most honorable friends, we offer to your excellencies our friendly efforts and services and all kinds of love and brotherly charity in Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>As we promised earlier to send you certain booklets about the controversies of the present times in our Kingdom of Poland and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania concerning the primary foundation of our faith, the knowledge of the true God or the Holy Trinity, which have recently arisen, behold, we now send you these booklets bound together.</p>
      <p>In one of them, Gregorius Paulus, a minister from Krakau (Cracow), explains the subject of these controversies, and in the other, Cazanovius, a Polish knight, formerly responds to Mr. Calvin's admonitions written to the Poles.</p>
      <p>We send them, however, with no other intention, God is our witness, than the best, candid, and sincere one, so that you may be more fully informed about the merits of the present case than from my letters previously sent to you, and so that you may be able to judge more certainly and faithfully about the whole matter, according to what the Spirit of the Lord suggests to you through the sincere word of God, and so that you may perceive our concern, which we bear for the concord and peace of the churches.</p>
      <p>For we do not wish to conceal from your excellencies that now in our Kingdom of Poland, due to this cause, serious dangers and perils are arising, for by public royal edict, all foreigners and foreign churches, supporters of this opinion, have been proscribed from the kingdom and other dominions of our serene King Sigismund August, among whom are many most learned men, your brothers, exiles from other provinces for the gospel of Jesus Christ. The cause of this matter seems to have been provided by nothing other than ignorance of the cause itself.</p>
      <p>For there are very many people in this kingdom who abhor the knowledge of this cause as if it were some poison, and therefore, through anger, wrath, and extreme mental impotence, they speak about this cause with prejudice, whatever comes to mind. And Mr. Calvin himself, with all due respect, seems to have provided the cause for this with his admonitions written to the Poles. For there are those who cling so tenaciously to his judgment and attribute as much to it as is permissible to attribute to the Delphic oracle or a voice sounding from heaven. So much so that a wonderful fervor seizes them, leading them to think badly of the cause, to accuse all the pious, and to consider them as the greatest heresiarchs, and this is what greatly defames and burdens this cause, although our opinion itself is not so difficult or perplexing and is not even far from reconciliation if people would speak about it with calm minds. A simple and expedient method of reconciliation for this whole controversy has been proposed by some, based on the ancient and sincere writer of the church of God, Hilary, especially in the part where the contention is about the unity of the divine nature or essence between the parties. For when they agree that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one, which the scripture most clearly speaks of, that there are three who bear witness in heaven and these three are one, not one by will, mode, and consent, but one by nature, divinity, substance, or essence, one also in eternity, omnipotence, honor, glory, dominion, kingdom, empire, and power, the controversy is only about this, that the bond, coupling, or medium of this unity, the moderns indeed begin with the Father as the source, while the opposing party begins the bond of unity from the essence, when they say that God is one in essence and three in persons, which according to Hilary is erroneous and heretical.</p>
      <p>For he says that this word essence has in itself both the consciousness of faith and is prepared for deceit, and he collects there (a. R. in the book) three neighboring related errors about this doctrine, from the synod against the Arians fol 326!, which almost all fall into the papistic doctrine, and having mentioned them, he concludes in this sense and with these words. When a Catholic is about to say one substance of the Father and the Son, let him not begin from there nor hold this as the greatest thing, as if without this no true faith exists, a Catholic will safely say one substance. When he has previously said, the Father is unbegotten, the Son is begotten, subsists from the Father, is similar to the Father in power, honor, nature, and a little below he explains what he understands by the unity of substance and in what way it is one in the Father and the Son, namely from similarity not solitude, and a little above in the same place, that what the Father and the Son are one, does not signify singular but equal.</p>
      <p>Thus also in book 7 on the Trinity: He says it is sacrilege to proclaim the Father and the Son as a singular God, while he teaches that it is blasphemy to deny that God from God, which in the similarity of kind are one.</p>
      <p>By admitting and embracing this reconciliation of the celebrated and sincere writer in the church, it seems that an end and desired catastrophe would be imposed on the whole controversy of their opinion. For many curious questions and unusual phrases will fall away with the admission of this one reconciliation, about the indefinite God, about the God of essence, about the Trinity of God by Stancarus, about the personal God, about the essential God, and the question about the Son of God, whether he is God from himself, the same question about the plurality of gods from multiple principles. Also, the imagination of quaternity, when all are referred to one initiable principle of all, namely to the Father, from whom all things are, and especially the generation of the Son of God and the procession of the Holy Spirit as to their source. For the Polish pastors and ministers do not think they have descended into this arena for any other reason or rather been thrust by the Lord, than that due honor may be established for the Father, and equally for the Son and the Holy Spirit, and that certain consolation of consciences may be established from the certainty of doctrine and that unusual phrases not derived from the word of God, but sought from philosophy, may be purged from the sincerity of the gospel, the chaff may be burned, and the very simplicity and sincerity of the word of God may remain. For as from the article of justification the merits of men, works performed, indulgences, graces from congruity and condignity, from the doctrine of penance satisfactions, works of supererogation, from the Lord's Supper transubstantiations and the like seem to have been cut off and utterly extirpated by the sickle of the word of God, they say it is fair, consistent, and necessary that also from this primary foundation of faith those things which have been introduced and imposed on the churches from scholastic theology by the Thomists and Scotists beyond the authority of the word of God should be purged.</p>
      <p>For they also consider this to be scholastic, not drawn from the school of Christ but from the Scotists, that Mr. Calvin in his admonitions states that one should speak differently about God comparatively and differently indefinitely, and that it seems to him a harsh expression that God begot God, that is, that God as God does not beget but the person.</p>
      <p>However, that ancient antiquity, while asserting the true divinity of the Son against the Arians, seems to urge nothing more, to teach nothing more clearly in its writings, than that the Son of God was truly and properly, not relatively, begotten from the Father in an ineffable manner before all ages and has his subsistence from the Father, not from the person, that is, not from the mere relation of the paternal name nor according to relation, but according to essence begotten from the substance of the Father and therefore called consubstantial by the Nicene Synod, not conpersonal. For the true genesis of the Son of God from the eternal Father is utterly abolished and nullified if the generation of the Son of God will reside in mere relations, attributes, and properties, as they speak, that is, as they speak more clearly, this generation will be relative, imaginary, figurative, and tropic, not true.</p>
      <p>However, the scripture speaks most clearly that the fullness of the paternal divinity, as the author of all things and the fountain of divinity, dwells in the Son bodily, not just a mere and empty relation, as the Son himself testifies: "As the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son to have life in himself." And elsewhere the Son speaks of himself: "I truly know him, that is, the Father, because I am from him and he sent me." "I am from him" they refer to the eternal generation, and "he sent me" to the incarnation and that one is he who has life in himself, that is, subsists from no one and has no progenitor, but another to whom it is given to have life in himself, that is, subsists from the Father, from the substance of the Father, not from a mere or empty relation. About the essence of divinity, they say they do not wish to dispute curiously with anyone, whether it is common to the three, although they do not deny it is common, but not from elsewhere, but from the very fountain of divinity, namely from the Father, and they cannot establish any other essence or property of the Father than the very agenesis, unbegottenness, that he alone is unbegotten, God from himself and of himself, with which phrases Hilary uses, but the Son subsists from the Father, therefore his essence is no other than the very genesis and eternal generation from the eternal Father.</p>
      <p>Thus they also acknowledge no other essence of the Holy Spirit than the very procession from the same Father and thus they say that ancient antiquity commented on God soberly within the bounds and limits of scripture, among whom they cite writers Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Ignatius, and Hilary, until a later age in a philosophical manner from the school of Aristotle, as if the pure word of God was not sufficient for this matter and was lacking, began to speak and comment about God through essences, relations, persons, attributes, properties, communications of idioms. This they reprehend and say they show that many gross errors and abuses lie hidden in these scholastic doctrines, not to be tolerated in the school of Christ. Therefore, again and again, we not only pray but also beseech and implore in Christ the Lord that your excellencies seriously and with diligent effort examine the merits of this cause and refer everything both to the scale of the word of God and to that ancient and sincere antiquity and send us your conceived judgment at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p>For by this one thing you will free our republic from great fear, you will help the proscribed, and you will gain perpetual glory and praise for yourselves among the Polish name, you will extinguish the growing evil.</p>
      <p>For almost the entire equestrian order, which adheres to this opinion, protests against this proscription of foreigners, not because it is determined to stubbornly adhere to that error if it were pointed out, but because the cause is unknown, without legitimate judgment, without even legitimate inspection of the cause or a legitimately convened provincial synod, such a proscription, although of foreigners, has been made of those domestic to their faith. This matter derogates and contravenes their immunities, especially since they offer themselves most ready for all colloquies, for all even synodal assemblies to be legitimately convened. We finally wish your excellencies to be in the best of health and to enjoy all happiness. Given from Wolpa on the 10th of October in the year of our Lord 1564.</p>
      <p>Your excellencies' good friend Nikolaus Radziwill, by the grace of God Duke in Olyka and Nieswiez, Lord in Kleczko and Grodno, Palatine of Wilna (Vilnius), Grand Marshal and Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, General Captain of Brest, Kaunas, Borisov, and Schaulen, signed with his own hand.</p>
      <p>To the same reverend and most illustrious and distinguished men, the superintendents, pastors, doctors, elders, and ministers of the word of God faithfully teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ in the church and school of Zürich, our dear and honorable friends and brothers in the same Christ the Lord.</p>
