      <p>Grace and peace in Christ. Although you truly write, my dearest Bullinger in Christ, that I am often distracted by many great affairs, both private and public, of the republic and the church, I always make time to read and respond to your letters, no matter how busy I am. Just as your conversation was always delightful to me when you were present, so now your letters are sweet and very pleasant: through them alone, while I am here, I seem to hear you, to my great and incredible comfort, whom, when I was there, I beheld not without the greatest and certain singular pleasure. But to come to that part of your letters which is of the greatest importance, and which you earnestly request from me in explicit terms, that you may understand what the state of religion and the republic is now in these our parts and neighboring areas.</p>
      <p>Concerning France first, how miserable and calamitous the churches are in those places, how that unfortunate region, as if still wet with horrible and bloody slaughter, stained with the blood of the saints, is desolate, you have no doubt long since received with your utmost sorrow. In which we have this only, and yet certain, consolation, that as the blood of Christians is the seed of the gospel, so the more abundantly they have sown the seed, the fuller harvest we expect.</p>
      <p>Regarding the affairs of the Netherlands, there is almost nothing to write. The Prince, resting in Holland throughout this winter, has done nothing memorable that we know of.</p>
      <p>What he will do at the beginning of spring is not yet certain. But now, having lost support in France, we fear that everything may deteriorate.</p>
      <p>Scotland, as things are now, is indeed tranquil and cultivates peace: for most have gone over to the king's side, who rules with the consent of almost all. What outcome that peace will have, in such an uncertain condition of all things, we cannot affirm: we indeed hope, as we also wish, for the best.</p>
      <p>Our England, having achieved tranquility at home and peace abroad, sails as if with full sails and a favorable wind. The church, however, is not so much troubled by the obstacles of the papists, who are restrained by severe laws daily, as by the stumbling blocks of false brethren, who seem to be falling into Anabaptism, and it fluctuates vehemently and dangerously. May the Lord Jesus at last extinguish all the flames of the tumultuous world with his coming from heaven, and take away the pains of the militant church, so that all tears may be wiped from our eyes, and we may all together triumph forever with him in that heavenly and new Jerusalem!</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>From my castle in Farnham, January 10, 1573.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely in Christ, Robert of Winchester. To the dearest brother in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>"Letters of Robert Horne, Bishop of Winchester, February 1573."</p>
