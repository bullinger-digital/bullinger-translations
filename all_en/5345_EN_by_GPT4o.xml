      <p>Greetings. After I sent you a letter yesterday via a messenger who was hurrying to Bern, today two of your letters are sent through Coignet. They somewhat alarmed me, especially because they were recent, the first dated May 19, the latter May 23. I have always feared that this persistent delay would be harmful to us.</p>
      <p>I have seen and experienced what greatly harmed us in our war 30 years ago and what betrayed the Protestants in the German war. But I constantly pray to the Lord to be present with His church and to overthrow those cruel and bloodthirsty robbers.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it is unfortunate that, although our forces are so prepared, they allow Estampes to be snatched away or occupied in their sight and the troops to advance towards Rouen. Why do our forces, when the enemies divide their army, not intervene in the middle and attack one part? I wish we would soon hear that our forces have fought successfully. Today I hear that Bollwyler is recruiting troops in the name of the Spaniards in Germany.</p>
      <p>Our neighboring allies are also entirely focused on making an incursion into France. Our forces could have prevented all this if they had advanced against the enemy in time.</p>
      <p>But quickly enough if well enough.</p>
      <p>What you write, that we and the evangelical cities are lukewarm, you speak the truth.</p>
      <p>I also anxiously complain about this and press as much as I can. But I wish for greater success.</p>
      <p>Today, a rumor has brought news that some from the 5 Cantons are considering oppressing the people of Claron, because they are convinced that they cannot freely advance into France unless these are oppressed and we are also overthrown. Spies have been sent to learn about their attempts.</p>
      <p>It is certain that they are almost insane.</p>
      <p>And since we are divided in Switzerland, I doubt, if some were to warn the Burgundians, as you suggest, whether they would obey. I have discussed more with our brother this July, who will report everything to you.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, in whom alone our hope is fixed, that He does not abandon us and open the mouths of the enemies to boast that our faith is in vain. I do not know if I mentioned in my last letters that some usurers from Basel are being asked for money that could be distributed to the soldiers, at least to lead them out of Switzerland. And that the Muscovites have invaded Russia and burned over 200 villages.</p>
      <p>Farewell, honorable man and dearest brother, and write as soon as possible about the affairs of our people in France. For we are very anxious and in deep sorrow.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 30, 1562.</p>
      <p>Greet Budaeus, Ionvillaeus, and others.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially Martyr, etc. Yours sincerely, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful minister of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
