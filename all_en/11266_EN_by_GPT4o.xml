    <p xml:id="regest1">Would like not to bother Bullinger, whom he is still unknown to, but also writes on behalf of his church. In search of a pastor for Volgelsheim, [Jakob] Bedrot mentioned to him an unblemished, learned man in Frauenfeld, who will hardly be able to stay because of the tyrannical bailiff [Hans Faßbind]; if Bullinger knows him, he should consult with Erasmus Schmid. Heard [the following] news and rumors: Duke [Wilhelm IV.] of Bavaria, King [Francis I.] of France, and Emperor [Charles V.] are recruiting cavalry and infantry in Alsace; the Protestant estates will meet in Frankfurt am Main, while the others recently gathered in Esslingen; the people of Strasbourg, Sélestat, and Colmar are consulting; from the return of the envoys from Spain, a decision on war or peace is expected; the dispute between Bishop [Wilhelm] of Strasbourg and Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg is temporarily settled; Bucer returned to Strasbourg after the Anabaptist conversation, the visit to Luther and [Melanchthon], and a disputation with [Georg] Witzel in Leipzig from Hesse; Barbarossa lost forty [ships]. Greetings to [Kaspar] Megander and to Leo [Jud]; hopes that his sister [Clara Schmid], who will soon send Jud the son [Johannes Fabricius Montanus], will move with hers [to the evangelical Riquewihr].</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>I know you will not take it badly, most excellent Bullinger, due to your unique kindness, that I, a man of obscure name and completely unknown to you, disturb you with my nonsense, a man not only a most renowned leader of the Christian religion but also very busy with more serious duties. Relying on this hope, I write not in my own name, but more in the name of our church, which would grow daily in Christ, if only pious schools and church ministers were established.</p>
      <p>And so you understand what I mean: For many days now, we have sought almost everywhere for a minister who combines piety with learning, to be placed over the church in Volgelsheim, not far from the Breisach mountain. But we are frustrated.</p>
      <p>To this end, we have appointed schoolmasters in certain villages, but they are men of the most vain life, whom the officials of our prince have now dismissed and sent away (so that they no longer offend the church), and there are none to replace them. I also wrote to the brothers in Strasbourg, but they did not alleviate our need. Bedrot informed me by letter of an unblemished and learned man, whose name he did not mention, in Frauenfeld in Thurgau, who will not be able to stay there long due to the impious tyranny of the bailiff. If he is known to you, confer with Erasmus Schmid, who is the leader of our church, whether he is suitable for the Christian republic or not; for he knows the state of the churches in our region, and also about the stipends and the location of places.</p>
      <p>Various rumors and strange practices are being reported: The Duke of Bavaria is secretly recruiting cavalry among us, and at a very high salary; for whom, we do not know. Infantry soldiers are being contracted by the King of France and the Emperor. Germany is in a state of alarm. The Protestant cities will hold a meeting in Frankfurt am Main in a fortnight; the others, who do not confess Christ, were recently in Esslingen, where they sent a courier to the Emperor; for what reason, is unknown. The people of Strasbourg recently called the neighbors of Sélestat and Colmar to a council. Everything is hidden. Many think that the couriers returned from Spain will announce either peace or war. The dispute between the Bishop of Strasbourg and Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg has been settled, I do not know for how long. Bucer returned from Hesse, honorably dismissed by the Prince of Hesse. He had a conversation with the Anabaptists, to which the Lord was present, so that many repented. Then he was with Luther and Philipp Melanchthon; in Leipzig, he dealt with Georg Witzel. Barbarossa lost no less than forty ships at sea. There are those who fear the Turk, etc. You pray to the Lord with your brothers and church, that He may direct all these things to the glory of His name, and not hand us over to a reprobate mind because of our impious deeds. Which we will also do for you with ours.</p>
      <p>Greet my, my I say, Megander and Leo, at whose sister's I recently was in Bergheim, who will soon send him a son. I hope she will move with her husband and all her family to us, to be rescued from Babylon, etc. May the Lord be with you by His Spirit and strengthen you for the confession of His name for a long time. Consider these things kindly; otherwise, better ones.</p>
      <p>Hastily, from Riquewihr, on the 5th day of February 1539. Yours truly,</p>
      <p>Matthias Erb, minister of the church of Riquewihr.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, both in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant leader of the church of Zurich, his brother.</p>
