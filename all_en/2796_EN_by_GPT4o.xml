      <p>Greetings. I wanted to write to you last week, most illustrious and highly esteemed man, but I have been delayed until now by various occupations. I had received a letter from the distinguished man, Lord à Lasco, who is (alas!) gravely ill in Frankfurt, and he was asking for my judgment on a matrimonial question, and he instructed me to consult you on the same matter in his name. I received the letter late; for it was not delivered to me until eight or ten days later. Therefore, instead of explaining the whole story or case (as the jurists say), I want you to learn everything from the same letters of Lord à Lasco, and for that reason, I am attaching them to this letter of mine. As for me, I believe he has responded correctly and in order: however, since it is a matter concerning the evangelical republic, in which the man whose cause is being discussed is involved, I would like the consent and authority of the magistrate to be interposed; for marriage is not only a divine institution, but it also has something of a civil contract: therefore, I would like the judgment of the civil authority to be applied as to whether such a union is considered fornication in the republic, or whether the children born from it are to be counted as illegitimate.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it happened in recent days that a certain pastor from Rhetia, who has a church in the Valtellina valley, informed me that a certain man of some nobility, who wants to appear favorable to our religion, boasted at a certain banquet that I now think differently about the sacrament of the Eucharist than I have written, and that it was affirmed to him that this is entirely the case in Zürich. This matter, most illustrious and highly esteemed in Christ, greatly troubles my mind, and indeed for two reasons; first, because in those places where my name and authority, although I do not deserve it, hold some place, the course of purer doctrine could be somewhat hindered if such a rumor spreads more widely; secondly, because I would be gravely distressed if (God forbid) I were to suffer such suspicion in your church. Indeed, I am most wronged by those who either speak or think in this way: I have taken the utmost care that neither cold nor hot words come from my mouth, and that in any matter; how much more should I have taken care not to commit such a thing in so great a mystery! You have, most holy man, a copy of my handwriting, which I gave to our magistrate when I again took on the duty of teaching; you have my other letters, and you will have these: reveal everything if you judge it necessary; for it does not matter to me wherever they are read: I would rather suffer anything than be considered less constant in religion. By God's grace, and with His favor, I remain and will remain in the opinion I have committed to writing, and which I have defended so many times in disputations, however sharp and dangerous: therefore, since I have spoken nothing against those things either publicly or privately, they certainly do me a great disservice who affirm what they do not know. No one should think that someone has either changed faith or recanted, who has not written, or taught publicly or privately, otherwise than he has written before. I have written these things to you at length, man of God, both because I am most closely joined to you in spirit and in Christ, and so that, in whatever way you believe it can be done, you may protect me from slanders; nor do I doubt that you will do so, since you have always been a lover of truth and justice. As for other matters, I have nothing else to write, except that the Emperor has now (as it is said) abandoned the plan of going to Spain. The English have dismissed their parliament; nor has the inauguration of the kingdom been decreed for Philip; the church is gravely afflicted in papacy. I, however, live, teach, and am well as usual. I have a certain English friend there, whose name is Percusto, a good man, devoted to piety, and not unlearned: if you can do him any favor, you would do me a most pleasing service. Farewell, and love me in the Lord, as you do, and do not forget me in your prayers. Please greet all my fellow ministers in my name.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, the last day of December 1556 (1555?) Yours most devotedly, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the church of Zürich, and most esteemed by me. In Zürich.</p>
