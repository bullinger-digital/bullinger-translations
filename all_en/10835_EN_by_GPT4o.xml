    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger will hear from Basel how soon a convention is to be held in Saxony; since participation [of the Swiss] will hardly be possible at such short notice, Capito advises to request him and Bucer by letter to recommend the [Swiss] churches to Luther and his followers and to express the desire for concord, but to leave them free hand for the negotiations. Is very busy writing letters. Greetings. Currently, there is no pharmacist to be found to whom the young [Klauser] could be apprenticed.</p>

      <p>Greetings. From Basel, you will hear on what occasion the Saxon convention has been hastily arranged, so that I fear you will not be able to attend. Therefore, I ask you, for Christ's sake, to write friendly letters to me and Bucer, in which you instruct us to recommend your churches to Luther and his followers, with an expression of the spirit of concord, yet without touching upon the cause, so that we may have full freedom to present everything in its proper place; for there will be some rather turbulent minds present.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more. For at this hour, I am extremely busy writing letters from all sides.</p>
      <p>I send many greetings to the brothers. Commend me to the lords senators, especially your envoy, with whom you were present in Basel, and to your consul.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, April 18, 1536.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Capito.</p>
      <p>I have written several times about the pharmacist. At this time, we have none here to whom we could entrust the young man. Bucer has spoken to some with me.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, to be respected in the Lord.</p>
