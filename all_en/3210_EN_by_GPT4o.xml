      <p>Greetings. I send the sheets that have been printed so far from h to o, and I rejoice that the Antichrist has not yet been able to prevent your exposition of the Apocalypse from becoming known to the whole world. Recently, Vergerius was with us, a remarkable apostle, one of those whom Christ says are clothed in soft garments and indulge in luxuries and (to put it in one word) frequent the courts of kings. He tried to stir up trouble and disturb the peace of good people; but thanks to the Lord, his attempt did not succeed. If he continues in this way, I greatly fear, or rather hope, that his mask will eventually be uncovered, to avoid saying anything more severe. I again lay this in your bosom, my dear Bullinger, after having once dared to open my heart to you. May the Lord, the best and greatest, grant that all who claim to serve the glory of Christ do so sincerely and from the heart. I was pleased to see Bernardin, an excellent and most learned man; he seemed younger to me than two years ago when he came up to you. I am glad that your air suits him so well and I pray to the Lord that he may enjoy that organ of his in good health for a long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet Frisius and the other friends on occasion and forgive me for rambling on at length beyond the matter at hand.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 12, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed friend. In Zürich.</p>
