  <input>Michaeli suo gratiam et pacem.

Mittimus tibi, Michael dilecte, epistolam nostram, quae de eucharistia ante aliquot dies excidit venus quam scripta sit, si fortassis per eam tribuat tibi oculos deus, ut cognita missandi impietate cogites, quo pacto possis propediem immutare mores, studia, questum et vitam tuam, esseque adhuc in tam spatioso terrarum orbe reliquum, unde vivere possis, meliore nimirum conscientia, quam in impiissimo questu et eidololatria. Est enim etiamdum sana mens tibi in corpore sano. Nihil habes post infidelitatem, quo te tueri possis; satis superque satis offendisti dominum. Revertere ergo ad eum, qui non vult «mortem peccatoris, sed magis ut convertatur et vivat» [Ez 33,11], ac nostram pro te sollicitudinem boni consule. Nam ferre non potui, ut a te separarer religione, qui non modo sanguine, verum a cunis tibi per omnem vitam arctissime hesi. Quod ad litterarum figuras spectat, noli esse Aristarchus; sic enim unus ex adulescentulis meis me dictante quam celerrime istaec excepit, at mihi otium vix fuit relegendi, taceo vel innumeras expungendi mendas

Vale et ita age, ut intelligam te malle esse pauperem christianum, quam divitem impium, incredulum, mactatorem.

Ex coenobio nostro, 16. decembris 1525.

  <output>Greetings and peace to Michael.

We are sending you this letter, Michael our dear one, which was omitted a few days ago concerning the Eucharist, if perhaps God grants you eyes to understand, that you might consider how you might soon amend your ways, interests, occupation and life, and still remain in this large world, where you can live with a better conscience than in such an impious occupation and idolatry. For even now you have a sound mind in a sound body. You have nothing to protect you after your infidelity; you have sufficiently and more than sufficiently offended the Lord. Therefore return to him who does not wish "the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn and live" [Ez 33,11], and consult our solicitude for your good. For I could not bear to be separated from you in religion, who have been bound to me in the closest union through all my life, not only by blood, but even from the cradle. As for the figures of the letters, do not be an Aristarchus; for thus one of my young men wrote these very quickly as I was dictating them, but I had scarcely time to reread them, I pass over the countless blots.

Farewell and act so that I may understand that you would rather be a poor Christian than a wealthy impious unbeliever and slaughterer.

From our monastery, 16 December 1525.

Your Heimrych.</output>
