      <p>Brothers, who proclaim the Gospel of Christ in Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>Although our dearest brother Martin Bucer is well aware of our opinion on the most holy Lord's Supper and does not ignore it as we have proposed to our church, nevertheless - lest we seem to have ever thought or taught anything that was not revealed in the Holy Scriptures - we confess first that Christ is present at this holy institution, as he promised in Matthew 18:20: "Where two or three are gathered," etc. Then, he is the supreme priest and pontiff, who truly feeds and refreshes those who trust in him with his true given body and true shed blood unto eternal life in a manner that our souls can eat and drink. For this most holy work, all external things are ordained as organs and instruments, by which the external senses are captured and the otherwise resistant body is made obedient to the spirit, elevated beyond the sensible. For hearing is struck in the proclamation of the Lord's death, sight in the breaking of bread, taste in the reception of the most holy symbols, etc. All of which have been most diligently considered by our dearest brothers in Zurich, to whose confession we fully subscribe in all respects with our own hands.</p>
