      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Reverend and most illustrious man, I received your letter written to Erastus rather late and sent it to Heidelberg around the beginning of June. Not long after, when I was informed about the poor health that our Erastus suffered from in the months of May and June, I myself set out for Heidelberg to visit him. Meanwhile, as I endeavored to cheer him up while he was somewhat recovering and conversing, a letter from Mr. Simler arrived, in which he stated that your excellency was suffering a relapse and was gravely ill. This news grieved that most upright man so much that, among other expressions of singular sympathy, he also said: "If I could restore good health to Mr. Bullinger by giving up either half or more of my blood, I would not hesitate to do so." He also instructed me to convey in his name that he would respond to your letter as soon as his health permitted. I hope that the Lord, in His immense goodness, will restore this excellent man to us. The preachers of Heidelberg visited him while he was bedridden, and when they affirmed that they were satisfied regarding the suspicion of heterodoxy and had perceived the sincerity of his faith (which had begun to be doubted due to his association with those two obscure Arians), they brought back this response: they should have concluded from his association and fraternal friendship with the most orthodox and illustrious men that he himself was also orthodox. Tussanus admitted the injustice done to Mr. Erastus both by that suspicion and by the accusation before the prince; however, he advised him not to hesitate to request permission in the synod to use and enjoy the Lord's Supper, once his sincerity of faith was established. Because this clever scheme seemed to contain a tacit confession of some error and an endorsement and approval of the actions by the adversaries, it displeased our Mr. Erastus.</p>
      <p>For the book sent at the last fair and for the letter written to me a month ago, I am most grateful. I commend your excellency to the grace of God.</p>
      <p>I pray for the health of your reverend and illustrious colleagues, especially Mr. Gwalther, whose relative, Dr. Blarer, treated me with singular acts of kindness both last year and during these days when I was in Heidelberg. My relocation to Basel will need to be arranged in one or two months, unless something intervenes.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Written in Rötteln, July 10, 1575.</p>
      <p>Your observant Johann Jakob Grynäus. To the most venerable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most esteemed leader of the Church of Zürich, my esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
