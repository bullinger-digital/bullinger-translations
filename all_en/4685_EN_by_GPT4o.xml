      <p>I am truly very grateful to you for sending me Calvin's booklet, part of which I have read and greatly approve of the man's serious and truth-mixed defense. I will return it at the time you have set for me and will not delay any longer.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Saxon diet, I have not received any news from anywhere except this: on the same day I sent Huber's conclusions via the Constanz couriers, I wrote, which I doubt you have received, and now I wish to be informed about this by Mangold; for I had arranged for it to be delivered to him. Indeed, a trustworthy, distinguished man wrote to me that he had it from a Nuremberger, that the Pope's envoy also requested an audience with the princes, but they refused: they have nothing to do with him or his master, as he should well know; who sent him? To which the legate let slip some rather improper words, so that the princes ordered him to be seized and taken into custody, and as he resisted and did not want to be captured, he was shot in the tumult with a firearm.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, they found very strange things on him, regarding the plans and practices concerning the council and who all those are who have allied themselves with the Pope, and how many servants, under the pretense of preserving the council, are making preparations everywhere with the intention of unexpectedly attacking and harassing our people in many places, so that they cannot resist or come together, etc. But there is no counsel against the Lord, etc., and He will laugh at them with His most severe mockery, He who dwells in the heavens, to whom we entrust ourselves entirely. For the copied letter of Beza, I am very grateful to you, and I had given this task to our Mangold, so that he would ensure it was copied from you, with a fair payment to the scribe, which I still want him to give to my boy in my name, whatever you order; for it is not my intention that anyone should be burdened on my account. Please pray diligently for us.</p>
      <p>As soon as there is something worth writing to you about, I will perform my duty in my usual manner. Farewell again. March 3, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed friend and brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
