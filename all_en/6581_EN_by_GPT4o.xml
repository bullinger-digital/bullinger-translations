      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, I have read your letters, but as it was already getting dark and our bookseller said he would leave before dawn tomorrow, please forgive the brevity. My reverend father, what do you want me to write? Are not those well off who, in such deplorable circumstances, migrate to the Lord? You surpass me by far in piety and learning; therefore, I should not console you, nor could I if I wanted to, as I myself am in many troubles. Let us therefore bear our cross patiently.</p>
      <p>I often repeat: I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</p>
      <p>I wrote to you extensively about our affairs. I have given the letters to Fluri N端len, your citizen; I fully hope they have been taken care of.</p>
      <p>Henceforth, as it is not very safe to write, I will be cautious in writing, which you will do likewise. The situation is as follows: modesty has not helped much; I have had to speak more bluntly, which many take to heart.</p>
      <p>The senate here has promised me protection and shelter; I have had to answer my adversaries and do so in such a way that they gain nothing from me.</p>
      <p>A judgment has been set against the two by the common city and a great seriousness has been brought upon them, each fined 12 thalers and seriously bound not to burden the bishops any more. The one from Marmors has requested a friendly leave and wants to move away, which has been willingly granted to him.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the whole faction, including Consul Scharnerus, hates me mortally - but he dissimulates - and I will be safe nowhere henceforth.</p>
      <p>But I do not care.</p>
      <p>I will not yield to them this time, especially since there are still so many pious people who plead with me not to part from them.</p>
      <p>A time will come when Chur will think of my loyal advice. Chur stands by the Godshouse and will now swear to the bishop on Tuesday with the agreement that he must go idle of the pope in this case and that the Godshouse alone should be recognized as their protector and guardian, which he has agreed to. The old man is old and has often begged me through his people, especially since the fire, for God's sake to come to him; for he desires to speak with me; which I have not been able to do because of adversity.</p>
      <p>I think if the alliances are sworn again, it will not be necessary for the sake of the two alliances. If he could once come into possession (although he is now in it), I would be on it and about it that he resigns; then one would be rid of the curse. The old man is tired himself.</p>
      <p>The other, a most hostile enemy of religion, will not cease.</p>
      <p>Do well and show Mr. M端ller what is necessary; for the other consul, as I think, can hardly be met.</p>
      <p>If a sedition arises, I am the first to be attacked; but sedition is no longer to be feared so much. Now we will hear what the Palestinians will say about it.</p>
      <p>Chur could not have done otherwise nor should have; otherwise, we would not have been safe day or night if a Godshouse had attacked us.</p>
      <p>Now it is somewhat more secretive that a Godshouse is one etc. The other rides to the emperor for the regalia.</p>
      <p>Chur has its special regalia, the rest Godshouse through the bishop.</p>
      <p>So think whether we have something to do, or whether I am safe in such turmoil, as I am exposed to the snares of many. I have indeed broken the adversaries openly; but secretly they rage etc.</p>
      <p>Tell Dr. Collin that I wrote with N端li; now I do not write, I cannot due to occupations. Give this to Dr. Gesner.</p>
      <p>Excuse me; now I cannot write.</p>
      <p>Today I did not preach twice and I am completely broken. I will take care of the rest that you have ordered.</p>
      <p>Tell him the money has been returned to me; he owes nothing more etc.</p>
      <p>I sincerely pray to God that He preserves you, likewise Dr. Gwalter and Dr. Simler.</p>
      <p>I foresee a great devastation of the church to follow.</p>
      <p>I should not anymore, I am not the old Fabricius; for the unrest makes it so that I no longer study, can hardly gather myself for the sermons. What would happen if those salutary and useful organs of the church were removed, what if you? My dear lord and father, forgive me for causing you more unrest to your suffering. I know you can bear all things with a strong mind, and I have no one with whom to deposit these things.</p>
      <p>You will console Dr. Gwalter, Dr. Simler, and Dr. Zwingli with my words.</p>
      <p>May God strengthen you/us!</p>
      <p>Your business with S端ler is in the harbor; it is to be done with a little patience. My lords want to let you have the whole sum.</p>
      <p>Therefore, order the typesetter to stop, and it should be silent so that no confusion arises.</p>
      <p>This is recognized here as advice; nothing is known of the typesetter etc. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Chur, the 25th of November at night, in the year 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
