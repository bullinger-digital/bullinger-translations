      <p>Greetings in the Lord. The letters you sent to me, either to be sent to Mr. Christoph Mont or John Burcher the Englishman, I have very diligently taken care of sending to Strasbourg through reliable and known people, and I do not doubt that they have been delivered. However, what our Myconius has done with your letters or to whom he has given them, I do not know. Have I not often reminded you that if you want anything taken care of in Strasbourg, you should send it to me? For no one can send it more conveniently than I, who know our sailors and travelers. Myconius is ill, and there was no opportunity to ask.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I do not want to keep from you that I have very diligently taken care of the letters you sent to Mr. Maurilius; for I gave them to the best and most intimate citizen of Mr. Maurilius, who takes care of his affairs in Basel, indeed of all the French; therefore, cast aside all doubt. He received the letters, I know, and sent them to the king; but do not be surprised that he does not write back; perhaps you will receive letters from him from these assemblies, or your envoy will be a living letter.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, at this time I have nothing worthy of your studies to write. On November 27th, a soldier named Gutsch√ºck was captured, who was a leader of the Spanish army at Constance; he was once a citizen of Constance, but had barely escaped because of a murder. He stayed with us for a year and a half; but he was expelled from our city; I still do not know the exact reason. He left indignantly and uttered some words, namely that he wanted to lead our people into a bath, just as he had led the people of Constance. Upon learning of these threats, he was captured at night in the episcopal village and taken to prison.</p>
      <p>Treasonous letters were found, which the captains of the Emperor had sent to him. More on this matter shortly. He plotted against Lord Schertlin, and this was also understood by the excellent and pious man. Thus it appears that the Lord brings the wicked to punishment at the due time, when they expect no evil to be imminent.</p>
      <p>Many learned men from Paris and all over France come to us daily, returning to their homeland; for the Frenchman has ordered all to leave who live under the Emperor and King Ferdinand. A very serious war is imminent. We are burdened by the plague, and we are oppressed by the scarcity of almost all things. What do you think should be done? We must be vigilant and pray, so that we may escape all these things that are about to come upon the whole earth; for our redemption is near. Farewell. On St. Andrew's Day, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the faithful minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his dearest teacher.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
