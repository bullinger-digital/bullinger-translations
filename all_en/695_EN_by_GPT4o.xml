      <p>Greetings. Since I am not unaware that you very much wish to know the state of Mr. Hooper and his entire family, and seeing that not only does Hooper not have enough leisure to write, but also the courier cannot delay longer due to the pressing sailors, I thought it my duty to briefly explain to you the condition of our life.</p>
      <p>First of all, Hooper undertakes the greatest and constant labors in teaching the people, whom he has in great numbers and very attentive. Every day he reads at least once, often twice or thrice. The Bishop of Canterbury has become somewhat more favorable to him. The Bishop of London preached on the first of September at St. Paul's Cathedral in a very crowded assembly of people and to the best of his ability insisted on the bodily presence in the supper, against which Hooper strongly opposed himself in the reading of the same day. The same bishop was ordered to propose in the sermon that our king should be obeyed no less as a boy than as an old man and that his statutes are of the same authority. The bishop omitted this; therefore, he was summoned to the tribunal and behaved so shamelessly and obstinately (for I saw everything present) that you would call him a buffoon rather than a bishop; he was thrown into prison for this obstinate rebellion, until the case is brought to an end, which what kind it will be, we do not know, especially since he has many supporters. The riots of the English peasants have been quelled by divine grace with some traitors punished; many captives are still held. Nothing certain is heard about the Scots. Hooper's wife, Mrs. Anna, is not in very good health. The rest of us are well. Mr. Paul Fagius is in danger of his life; Bucer has not yet recovered from the illness, which he has suffered for one month or more. Their wives have arrived.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most vigilant pastor. May God grant that you have a perpetually obedient people! We are very sorry and amazed that the evangelicals could have been drawn into that bloody alliance of the French. May God strengthen you, amen.</p>
      <p>Written very quickly in London, September 30, 1549. You will commend us to our teacher Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, and Mr. Gesner.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient servant, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the people of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
