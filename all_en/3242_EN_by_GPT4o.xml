      <p>Greetings. I am sending again 2 gatherings, x and y. What you sent to us, I gave to Bale (Basel), who certainly received your letters and the gift of the book sent to him with great joy, and because he himself was not free to write back due to the burden of occupations, with which he is almost overwhelmed in completing his work for the press, he begged me to both thank you on his behalf and to excuse him for not writing back at present. He also desires to obtain through your efforts from Dr. Peter Martyr or Dr. Bernardino or preferably both, if they have any certain and verified information about the last few popes, such as Marcellus II, Paul III, and the one who now acts in the place of the antichrist, so that he can insert it into his catalog of popes, which he has otherwise already brought to completion. Vergerius communicated some things to him, but only about Marcellus II. Therefore, you will do a worthy deed if you assist the excellent old man in this matter as well, and I will gladly spend both effort and oil, as they say, in painting those monsters with their own colors. I still have the letters to Naogeorgus and I do not see (as you wish them to be sent by a certain courier) how they can be sent quickly; for we have few couriers going directly to Stuttgart. Otherwise, they could have already been arranged through the Strasbourg market. The same issue prevents me from having sent the letters to Cognatus yet, from whom, however, I expect a certain courier shortly; then I will also take care of those. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>All your friends send their regards.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 16, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
