      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church in Geneva, honorable lord, and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I truly owe you much, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, for you have diligently and extensively described the entire history of the tumult that arose, despite your many and great affairs, at my request. I give you the greatest thanks for your labors. I saw in that description things that partly vex and distress, but partly also affect well and console.</p>
      <p>What disturbs and distresses me most is seeing that you have many enemies, whom I fear will spend all their efforts day and night to justify and embellish their wickedness and worst cause with the most unworthy slanders and insults against you, from which unspeakable dangers and evils may arise. However, divine goodness and wisdom, and finally the very present help of the Lord in such great danger, console me not a little. From this, I gather that the same grace will always be with you. I thank Him for the great benefit wonderfully provided to you in time, and I pray that He continues to protect you. But there is almost no talk of those disturbances anymore. Many new complaints are brought about the cruelty of some, who extort from the bound through torture what they soon retract in punishments. Also, about Calvin's implacable hatred against the most ample Bernese republic, which now tries to separate it from the most illustrious Genevan republic with unjust terms of extending the treaty, so that he may rule the city with his Frenchmen at his own discretion. But you understand that I speak not from my own opinion but rather from that of others.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I know with what hatreds of old the blessed memory of Zwingli and, a few centuries before, Chrysostom and Ambrose were burdened, even judged by the more upright to be too severe. Indeed, moderation in any matter is to be approved, as the wise man said, by squeezing too much, blood is drawn. But you undoubtedly do not involve yourself in those matters, in which they make you a leader and author. If ever good men among the princes, familiar to you, ask your opinion, I know you suggest to them what is of piety and peace. For you understand that our Lord God used the works of the Bernese in asserting and liberating the most illustrious Genevan republic from the tyranny of both the pope and the prince of the Allobroges and the nobles: nor is there any doubt that they would have long since renewed the war unless they feared the power of the Bernese. For thus it pleased the Lord (to whom alone the benefit of assertion is to be attributed) to deter your enemies with the authority of the Bernese and to protect your city.</p>
      <p>Wherever indeed the Bernese seemed to some to have demanded or acted more imperiously at times, the more sensible never forget that benefit received: moreover, they consider that they are dealing with men, and human affairs are never so purified that we cannot complain about many things and desire many things. Never do allies adhere so happily that not frequently do not slight injuries seem to be inflicted on both sides. Nor do the wise dissolve alliances for this reason, but sometimes by dissembling, sometimes by modestly interceding, they either compose or prevent dissensions that have arisen or are about to arise. They consider that in change or abrogation there would be far greater danger than if they extend the treaty, however it may be. That confederation of yours with the Bernese has not been unhappy so far. The Genevan church has grown to a miracle. And it has been, and still remains, a refuge for exiles for the sake of Christ. From there, the proclamation of Jesus Christ is spread throughout all of France, not to mention other nations. Indeed, divine goodness and power can preserve your city without a confederation, and indeed it would be shameful, even impious, to bind the safety of your city to human consideration. Cursed, says the prophet, is he who puts his trust in man. Since, however, God does not always act miraculously but through legitimate means, nor does He condemn human aid altogether, nor has that confederation turned out badly for you so far: the more prudent do not rashly judge that that confederation should be dissolved, and if it is dissolved, it cannot indeed be done without clear detriment to the pious.</p>
      <p>This matter certainly keeps me very anxious, whenever I think that Geneva provides hospitality to so many exiles for Christ, who, however, I fear would be scattered if either the Allobrogian war were to rekindle, or the roads were to be besieged, or if anything more calamitous were to happen, or even if you were to collide in a social war. Indeed, God can gather His own and prepare hospitality for His own: but if they are already prepared, I do not think they should be rashly changed or disturbed. But you undoubtedly think about these things yourself; so that I may appear foolish to you here, who, while you are otherwise occupied, impress these things upon you with so many words. But you will grant this to anxious love. I certainly think that in things that are indifferent, some concession should be made to the Bernese, and again they should not be too hard, so that the treaty agreed upon so far may be extended further, until we experience better times. Although I believe, for your prudence, you do not involve yourself in these civil matters, because I do not doubt that you are sometimes asked by the pious to give them your opinion and confer about present matters, I advise and exhort you, my brother, to be an author and advisor to your people to accommodate themselves to the society of the Bernese, lest these two republics separate from each other to the great sorrow of many good people, to the offense and detriment of the weak, and finally to the great exultation of all scoundrels. Watch, I beseech you, think of the things that are of peace and edification, knowing that the times are evil.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus grant you to think rightly in these and in all other matters, and to pursue, achieve, and retain what is salutary, and also to maintain moderation in all things. Above all, let us pray to the Lord that He may shine before you and always keep you in His ways.</p>
      <p>Concerning Mr. Philip, I do not dare to hope as much as you seem to promise in your letters. He is indeed pious and learned but abhors too much even necessary disputes. Hence, I cannot persuade myself that he will ever defend our opinion either openly or in writing against anyone published. He is old and wishes, if possible, to depart to the Lord in peace.</p>
      <p>He understands among whom he dwells and with what danger he would begin that task. Therefore, it will seem enough to him if he does not join our enemies, but restrains their madness, etc. Otherwise, I do not doubt that he favors us and agrees with us, indeed I know this from not slight arguments (and indeed from his letters given to me). I have already sent one of my sons to him so that he may hear him and learn good letters in Wittenberg. For this to happen successfully, I pray to the Lord.</p>
      <p>A very sharp and odious contention exercised among the Swiss for almost seven years, but meanwhile quieted several times, was renewed again this summer. Our confederates require confirmation according to the old custom of the Swiss confederations by a solemn oath, which, since it is prescribed in the treaty documents, by God and His saints, they insist be performed in the same form. However, the companions of the true religion, especially the Zurichers and Bernese, confessing their religion, abhor that commonly accepted form.</p>
      <p>The mediators who intercede thought it would be advisable for all if that formula were freely permitted in the evangelical cities, so that if any wish to swear by God and His saints, they may, and if any do not wish, they will not be compelled. But the cities were not willing to grant even this. Now I hear that at the next assembly in Baden, the mediators proposed a reconciliation of this kind, that everywhere, both in the cities and in the countryside, the same formula of the oath be observed according to the letter, by God and His saints. But the evangelicals do not render that formula, but only swear by God, while the other republics swear in their manner by God and His saints, with the religion and confession of both parties preserved. Also, that the Bernese envoy should lead with that common form in Zurich, the Zurich envoy in Bern: yet, so that neither the Zurichers nor the Bernese are compelled to follow and render the same form, but only swear by the name of God. If the Zurich or Bernese envoy does not wish to lead in dictating the oath, let the Lucerne envoy lead. Nothing has yet been decided on this matter, but it will still be consulted.</p>
      <p>A new assembly, in which this matter will be defined, is scheduled for October 28 in Baden. Most think that since our people are freed from the common form, and they are allowed to swear by the name of God alone according to their religion, excluding other gods, nothing should hinder if the Lucerne envoy leads with the common form. Others also hesitate in this. What will happen, I do not know. I hope our people and the Bernese will not accept or do anything that conflicts with the complete confession of the true religion. You pray to the Lord that this matter may turn out well. For we are continually involved in many dangers, and no end appears. Hence, we stand perpetually in the readiness of Mars, fighting with spiritual arms. May the Lord keep us in His holy will and deliver us from evils. Farewell, most esteemed lord and dearest brother in Christ, together with your fellow ministers and all brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you and your fellow ministers. I would commend to you this excellent brother, Mr. Thomas Lever, if I did not know that he is otherwise most commendable to you. For he is integrity itself, an innocent and most holy man. May the Lord have mercy on most afflicted England. Zurich, September 28, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
