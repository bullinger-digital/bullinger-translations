      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I am responding to your two letters.</p>
      <p>It is not surprising that Sultzer and your Beatus have been removed from office; I know their temperaments. Sultzer is staying with us, considering various plans to secure some position; he will certainly take on the title of doctor if he can obtain it, which I do not believe he will, since he has not yet completed the theological lectures according to the regulations of our academy. And there are some candidates of theology among us who are denied the title, even if they have completed (as they call it). Beatus has gone down to Strasbourg with his wife and children, perhaps to take up his former care of the church; thus these men do not leave churches unless they have certain positions, if they must flee. Such apostles we have in our time.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am sending the books you have so often requested from me. But hey, how sluggish we have become in defending our true and ancient religion. The Lutherans are more silent than fish, the Papists bolder than they ever were. You have read the book of the preacher of Augsburg about the Mass service, in which he tries to persuade everyone that we are insane, having written false things about the sacrifice of the Mass. Where now are the defenders of the truth?</p>
      <p>The Lutherans dare nothing because they fear the power of the Emperor, and shall we in Switzerland also remain silent, we who have testified with our blood that we have the truth? Oh, the times, oh, the customs! What are you doing, what are you writing, why do you cease in such a holy task? You have the talent, you have the learning, you have the knowledge of all things, and will you allow such people to triumph against the truth of Christ? What is our Theodore doing? Is he sleeping? Do not say: it will not be without danger to respond to these men, or: What is it to us, what they write? Are we appointed pastors only to the Swiss churches? The truth has always had enemies and will always have them.</p>
      <p>Therefore, deliberate with the brothers, lest the enemies of the gospel continually deceive the simple. The people of Augsburg do not dare to write, even if they cry out against the oppressors of the truth. We now see what that Interim has brought forth: it will bring all evil into the Catholic Church, recall errors, open a window to all superstitions, and arouse greater ones than ever before.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing certain about Strasbourg. Bucer writes nothing, nor do the other brothers. Sevenus has been thrown into prison because of the King of France; the rest mutter and do not dare to say anything freely. The barons of BÃ¼tsch and Henneberg and others who adhere to the gospel are forced to bear soldiers consuming everything.</p>
      <p>May the Lord avert this plague from us. Amen. Basel, June 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Gast, in haste.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his sincere friend. Zurich.</p>
