      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters, reverend father in Christ, and I thank you for your kindness. I will certainly inform our people to be grateful.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I have heard from Carlino, as you are on the move, as he gathers from the words he heard from the people of the Five Cantons. May God avert this evil. But we must pray to the Lord and be vigilant.</p>
      <p>I hear that everything is settled with the Bernese, and that the same Five Cantons are quite terrified; for now, no war is to be feared from the Savoyard. These people are working hard to expel Becaria, with the same intention as before, to disturb everything among us; but I hope they will be deceived. The people of the Five Cantons have written quite harshly to the Superior League about this matter, and Carlino affirms that the Landammann Dieterich of Schwyz has pressed the matter with them in words. Yesterday, a messenger came with letters from the Upper League; the Fifteen (as they call the leaders of the Superior League) write that they have heard that the Five Cantons and the Glarner are not well aligned against each other and are holding a strong force against each other, and therefore war is to be feared; they ask our senate to inform them further and also to send messengers to help handle the matter. Our consul Ambrosius, Tschudi's brother-in-law, is being sent.</p>
      <p>I know that we have deserved even the worst due to our ingratitude, but I hope that God will remember His mercy even while angry. While I was writing this, the servant of Hercules Salix, not the one from Clavenna, your godfather Heinrich, came and said that it was written to his captain that the two companies of soldiers were going to Rapperswil as reinforcements. But Hertli has his wife from Rapperswil, from Marmels, so he has good connections. But whether this is true, you know; if it is true, I see well enough where things are heading.</p>
      <p>Our people are beginning to be very upset about the recent departure of our bishop and his alliance with the people of Como, because they understand that the people of Como are the instigators of these movements. We have no news from Italy now; I ask you, reverend father in Christ, to inform us promptly about your situation and that of the Glarner. I do not cease to approach each person and instruct them; but it seems that Tschudi also has his supporters here. But as every nation has its measure, which, when filled to the brim, begins to overflow, so I do not doubt that these arrogant ones will fall into their own ruin. May God deign to help us and have mercy on us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Regarding that Darius, neither I nor Mr. Philippus, my colleague, have any certain information; we must be informed by the people of Clavenna; but I know well enough that a certain Ludovicus, an Italian, has lingered with us for a long time (who recently, when he was not received in Clavenna, returned to Italy again) and that he was entirely a Servetian. I am returning your writing with the Landgrave's, which pleases both of us greatly, and we hope it will not be without its fruit. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, and Mr. Philippus and the consuls wish you well.</p>
      <p>Chur, the day before the calends of October, in the year 1560. Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
