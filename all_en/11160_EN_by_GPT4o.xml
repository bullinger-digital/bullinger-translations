    <p xml:id="regest1">A job was found for Beat [Gering] at the printer Herwagen. After envious people ensured that Hospinian lost his new position [as head of the PÃ¤dagogium], he now prefers to work for the printers rather than remain [as a teacher] at the college.</p>

      <p>Greetings. What I believe will be most pleasing to you, most distinguished Bullinger, is that we have found here for our mutual friend and brother, Beat, a sufficiently ample position, considering the current state of affairs, and that with the printer Herwagen, a man of great kindness.</p>
      <p>As for the state of my own affairs, about which you wish to know something due to your singular benevolence towards me - as that noble Englishman, whom you know, has informed me - accept this in three words: I would have been abundantly happy here for a time, if it had been allowed by certain malevolent people. The people of Basel appointed me not long ago to instruct the boys who are supported here by public stipend, by which position my financial affairs would have been splendidly provided for. However, certain people, envying me this fortune, have managed through slanders and I know not what other wicked arts, to have me excluded from that position once again. Nevertheless, it is well; for it is altogether better to suffer wrong than to do wrong, and it is not the one who suffers but the one who commits injustice who is unfortunate, and nothing evil can happen as long as innocence remains intact. Yet, to confess frankly, this matter has moved my spirit, so that I have agreed to work for the printers, thinking it better to try this position than to remain longer in the college and there lose both my livelihood and my duty, which I have been forced to do until now, relying at the same time on the example of illustrious men, who, even while undertaking the most humble tasks, have advanced to fame in letters. Meanwhile, most excellent man, I ask that you do not abandon me, as I struggle with adverse fortune, with your usual favor. I, in turn, will strive with all my might and will ensure that you will someday understand that you have placed your benefits in a grateful person. I write this to you briefly, lest I spoil the favor, which I believe I have not deserved by remaining silent until now and by not interrupting you, occupied with more serious concerns, with my importunate and odious chatter.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family and keep me, as you have long done, commended to you.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 28, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your L. Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
