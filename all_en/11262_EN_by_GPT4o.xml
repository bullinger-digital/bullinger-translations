    <p xml:id="regest1">The news from Matthias [Hirschgartner] that two young men from the [Winterthur] Latin School performed well in the exam in Zurich pleases him greatly; he now hopes that the critics will fall silent. He thanks for the greetings and praises Bullinger's kindness and scholarship. He is glad that Bullinger has taken in Leodegar [Hirschgartner].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ.</p>
      <p>Although it may be rash, most learned Bullinger, to detain you, who are so busy and occupied with countless matters, with my trifles, I could not refrain (relying on your kindness) from pouring out the joy of my heart into your lap and testifying in a few words how joyful and auspicious the recent return of Matthias, my most necessary friend, from Zurich has been. Good gods, how much joy suddenly arose when he reported that two young men, who have so far benefited from our discipline, responded not entirely without culture to the questions in the renowned assembly of scholars, when their knowledge was tested. Added to this, from a letter of Rhellicanus, which he very recently wrote to me, I understood that a certain pious man has been entrusted by the public minister of our town to present the matter to my praetor and senate. Hence, I am led to good hope that those who, I do not say did not approve of my efforts, but never ceased to slander (as ingratitude is), will henceforth think less ill, if not better, of me and of those entrusted to my faith.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the fact that you included greetings to me in the letter sent to the pastor, and soon after, through the same departing from there, also ordered me to be greeted in words, was as pleasing as it was most pleasing; for now it clearly appears to me that your much-praised kindness is open to both the learned and the unlearned. Therefore, since others are more esteemed by you in the name of learning, allow me to earn your favor because I love letters, respect, and admire the learned.</p>
      <p>As for the fact that you are taking in our Matthias's son Leodegar into your household, you are doing well; for he is a pious and studious young man.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Winterthur, on the seventh day before the calends of February in the year 39.</p>
      <p>Leonhard Biberli (Castor).</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in both learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord.</p>
