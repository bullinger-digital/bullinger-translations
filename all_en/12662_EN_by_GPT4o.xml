    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Even though the Zurich preachers [Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer] will report everything orally, Frölich writes out of friendship nonetheless. It is expected that the preachers will return to Augsburg with their wives and children before the onset of winter. The travel expenses were advanced to them. If it is not enough, they will be reimbursed for the additional expenses. [Johannes] Haller, Michael Keller, Bernardino Ochino, and Frölich himself will take care of them. [Wolfgang] Musculus would like to remove the most learned of them, Meyer, [to the countryside]. However, Frölich and others would like to keep him in the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The people of Basel have sent Sebastian Lepusculus and Hieronymus Gunz. Gunz is well-liked by the people of Augsburg. He also seems to be more learned and of better conduct than Lepusculus, even though the latter was more warmly recommended by Myconius' letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] There is no new news. Both armies are close to each other. Both are seeking advantageous positions, especially Emperor [Charles V], who does not want to engage in a battle. Due to the approaching winter, the camps cannot be maintained for much longer. Whoever retreats first will be exposed to greater danger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Frölich warned about the [situation concerning the Swiss] confederations. He hopes that action will be taken accordingly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The imperial estates have written to Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen. A copy of their letter is enclosed. Currently, nothing better can be advised. For if the war drags on and the enemy is not attacked on other fronts, it will certainly be costly for the [Schmalkaldic League]. Already 2 million guilders have been spent! It is hoped that new funds will be obtained soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] One should be of good cheer, for the cause is the Lord's! So far, it has been no different. However, this is not due to the [main] leaders, who are probably the best in all of Germany. Everything is entrusted to them and to God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings to the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], to Rudolf [Gwalther], [Konrad] Gessner, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Johannes] Fries, [Konrad] Pellikan, [Johannes] Wolf, and to all [scholars].</p>

      <p>S. Even though the excellent preachers from Zurich can convey everything that happens here better in words than I can write, and they are like living letters, charity does not allow me to remain silent to you. These men will be most welcome to us here, but they have been dismissed with the condition that they return with their wives and children before the onset of winter. They received travel expenses here, which are indeed quite modest, but whatever they lack will be supplemented here. Our dearest brother Haller, Michael Cellarius, Bernardino Ochino, and I will support them fraternally. Musculus would gladly send Master Laurentius, the most learned of the three, away from here. However, we feel differently and will strive to keep him in the city, even against the hatred of some, if possible.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The people of Basel have sent us Sebastian Lepusculus and Hieronymus Guntius, men sufficiently learned. Guntius is closer to our disposition. He seems to surpass the other in both conduct and learning, although the other was more warmly recommended to me by a letter from Myconius.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Our military matters remain in the same state. Both camps are close together, vying for advantageous positions, into which the enemy continually places himself, and does not want to engage in battle, although it is not possible for the cold to allow the field encampment to last long. Whichever side retreats first will have to face danger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have faithfully warned about the confederation, also concerning the five places. I hope that action will be taken accordingly.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Your lordships, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen have been written to by the imperial estates, as the enclosed copy shows. Everything depends on this, and there is no better advice at this time. For if the matter drags on and the enemy is not attacked in other places, he will cause us more trouble due to the excessive costs (for over 2 million guilders have already been spent!), although we are now raising money again.</p>

      <p>Well, the matter is the Lord's! He should rightly be the master and leader in it. So far, it has not been otherwise. We truly have people! If one were to select them from the entire German nation, I would not know how to improve it. To them and to God Almighty, I rightly entrust this difficult matter.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Greet for me the mayors, the city clerk, Rudolf, Gessner, Bibliander, Fries, Pellican, Wolf, and the entire heaven of the Muses. October 8, 1546.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed leader of the Christian community in Zurich.</p>
