      <p>I live, I am well, I am coming and I bring the gospel to you all, but especially to Lord Manrich, with great joy. Pray to God that He may quickly deliver me from Italy, and believe that very few know the state of affairs in Sarmatia. Perhaps Utenhove, if he passes through there, can tell many things that no one else can.</p>
      <p>Maximilian left the city today, so as not to participate in the idolatrous procession. He himself told me this and also some other things, which you will gladly hear and with me give thanks to God, who protects me on this most dangerous remaining journey.</p>
      <p>I can say nothing more now.</p>
      <p>The rest Burcher, our friend, who dared to engage with the Jews and Jesuits at the same time, a remarkable debater and most loving of the people of Zurich, who nevertheless would gladly yield to this Lelio. May God grant that they in turn do not cease to embrace me with benevolence, and that is enough.</p>
      <p>Vienna. May 24, 1559. Your son Lelio Sozzini.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, as to a most revered father. Zurich.</p>
