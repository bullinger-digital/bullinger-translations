    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to his request for an explanation of 1 Peter 3:19f, he can only reply with a summary of Zwingli's opinion: That Christ preached in the underworld is expressed in figurative language, meaning that his work of salvation has become known to the deceased, for the salvation of the believers and the damnation of the unbelievers.</p>

      <p>You ask me, a plainly unlearned man, dearest brother, for an explanation of that difficult passage, which the great Martin Luther admits he does not understand; if I give you an answer, there is nothing for you to take offense at. But what the admirable Huldrych Zwingli, a man in divine letters, thinks here, you may briefly receive: After his resurrection, Christ appeared to his disciples and, having opened their minds, spoke to them thus: "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all nations" [Lk 24, 46f]. He explains the same sentiment in John thus: "Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you forgive" etc. [Joh 20, 22f]. In Mark: "He who believes and is baptized will be saved" [Mk 16, 16]. "Believes," namely, in the preaching of the gospel. From these passages, we gather that absolution from sins occurs when salvation is made known to believers through the preaching of the gospel, and conversely, those who do not obey the preaching are not absolved. Therefore, preaching is here taken metaphorically for absolution from Adam's transgression or for the manifestation of salvation. Christ preached to the underworld, that is, Christ absolved those who were bound by Adam's guilt and who had departed hence in faith, for the gates of death were broken, death was swallowed up in victory, the sting of death removed, the kingdom of the prince of darkness taken away. Again: Christ preached to the unbelievers, that is, damnation became known to them, and those who had not believed the divine oracle then would now learn to their own harm and loss that they were false and deservedly consigned to eternal torments. Therefore, when Peter says: "Christ preached to the spirits in prison" [1Petr 3, 19], he means to say: Salvation and liberation brought about by Christ became known to the underworld; to some indeed for absolution, namely, the believers, and to others also for vengeance, namely, the unbelievers.</p>
      <p>But you, dearest brother, receive with a benevolent mind the opinion of the most learned Zwingli, depicted for you in our indeed unpolished and unadorned words, and farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Leo Jud.</p>
