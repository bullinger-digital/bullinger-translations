      <p>Jesus Christ, the true son of God and Mary, grant you His divine spirit, that you may recognize Him alone as the only highest good, so that you may live a wholly blessed and happy year. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your last truly wise, friendly, and entirely pleasant letter has greatly delighted me, dear and virtuous noble lady, and even more so, the more I find you always inclined towards me. I also hear from your faithful brothers that they think well of you and that it goes exceedingly well with you. This truly cannot please me enough and endlessly, especially that you have left the convent. You should have no regret about this, is my earnest request, but rather thank God that He has delivered you. Here, remember now the comforting words of Christ our Savior and His apostles. Christ says in Matthew 15:9: "In vain do they worship me with human commandments." Now it is certain that your convent life and your order are a human commandment. For Dominicus existed well over 400 years ago, and before that, for a thousand years since Christ's birth, no such order was known, indeed your city of Bern is somewhat older than your order. Therefore, you should not regret the state that is so new, arranged by humans, outside of God's word, and in which you have not served God, according to His words. In the Gospel of Luke 17:20f, the Lord says again, the kingdom of God does not stand in external things. So Paul to the Romans in 14:17: the kingdom of God is "peace, joy, and righteousness in the Holy Spirit." So it is not cowls, orders, fasting, or such monastic things. But he says in John 8:12: "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness." Likewise, the Father testifies from heaven in Matthew 17:5: "This is my beloved Son, listen to Him"; and Paul in Colossians 2:3: "In Him are all the treasures of wisdom"; and 1 Corinthians 1:30: "Christ is given to us by God as wisdom"; likewise Matthew 23:10: Christ is our only master. So if it is thus and Christ is the only wisdom, the only light, the true master, who alone gives and shows salvation, why would He not have thought of the orders if they were necessary for salvation? But He did not think of them, as the holy scripture testifies, which contains everything necessary for salvation: John 20:31; 2 Timothy 3:14ff. So the convent life is also not necessary for salvation, especially since it, as mentioned above, was only established a thousand years after Christ's birth. Therefore, have no regret about it, rejoice in your Christian freedom, and that Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3:21: "All things are yours," meaning external things, human ordinances. Likewise 1 Corinthians 7:23: "You were bought with a price, do not become slaves of men." Dear, also read the second chapter to the Colossians [2:8ff] and the 4th chapter of the First Epistle of Paul to Timothy [1 Tim 4:1 ff]. In the 5th chapter, he simply does not want young women to be taken into a vow of chastity; they should be pious, raise children, keep house, and not be idle under a false appearance of the spirit. Read these things carefully with judgment, and you will find that this is truly not a service to God, with which one has dealt so far, but that which has been little regarded: faith, love, innocence, virtue, diligence, housekeeping, mercy, patience, peace, raising children, abstaining from sins, accepting the right, purity, truth. But how these things are handled in convents is evident, that now the whole sum has been bound to idolatry, masses, shouting or singing incomprehensible things, vigils, mumbling, food, clothing, etc., all external things, which do not particularly delight the soul, nor honor God, for it was not His command, nor improve the neighbor, for he is more burdened with gifts and taxes, etc., so that you should not regret the abandoned state. Think much more now, how you now want to live in God's grace, set all your comfort, heart, courage, and mind in the one God, who has created everything, who has given His Son, our Lord Jesus, for us, who has also created you with soul and body; that you indeed call upon Him alone, surrender yourself to Him alone and pray with the prophet David in Psalm 5:9: "O God, lead me in your righteousness, make your way straight and light for me." Strive that you offend no one, that you do good to everyone, as much as it depends on you, that the poor enjoy your goodness, that you subject your body to the spirit and follow your Lord Jesus in humility, goodness, love, patience, forgiveness, purity, discipline, and honor: so all pride, anger, hatred, revenge, and what is unjust will not remain with you. If you have the high gift from God, then remain steadfast and constant with heartfelt devotion: 1 Corinthians 7:7f; if you do not have it, then do what God commands you along with His apostles in Matthew 19:4ff, 1 Corinthians 7:1ff, 9:5, 1 Timothy 3:1ff, 4:3ff, 5:9ff, Titus 2:4, Hebrews 13:4. So if you live in the fear of God, you will please God much better than if you had stayed in the convent for thirty years! Accept my comfort and instruction in the best way, for I have done it out of a faithful friendly heart.</p>
      <p>Now answer yourself what you want to do; whether you want to buy the Wyger house and become a Bernese. Consider and answer wisely.</p>
      <p>Regarding the powerful expedition and honorable people sent into the field, we have also been informed otherwise, but not as thoroughly as you have done. Praise the almighty God that He does not abandon His own. Also believe that He will continue to build an honorable, highly renowned city of Bern (if it remains with Him, as I do not doubt) as before, and endow it with great honors and goods, etc. I send you here a song, made in honor of the city of Bern by a Zurich resident, and ask that you help me with what Venner Walter has made of it.</p>
      <p>I am also deeply sorry for your brother's case. To him and all of you happens what the prophet Solomon says in Proverbs 3:12: "Whom God loves, He visits at times." So joy is also rarely without sorrow; it happens from God, so that we do not forget Him, etc. His greetings are extraordinarily pleasant to me, and I offer him herewith my willing service, my friendly greetings, and whatever I can do for him in love, honor, and goodness. Likewise, it is also my request that you greet Lady Catherine, your sister, friendly for me, etc.</p>
      <p>I also thank you for your effort and work, especially dear lady, that you have been able to exert yourself so much and write to me into the long night. I can well understand that you can endure much for my sake, also bearing such a true favor towards me; therefore you will always find me as a good friend, also that I will not easily let myself be surpassed by favor, love, and goodness, etc.</p>
      <p>That you write to me, the advice given to you by me is comforting and honorable, pleases me not a little, for I would gladly advise you what is to your benefit, propriety, and honor. As for further writing, I am only surprised; for if you do as I do, you will strike much in absence, which in presence you would not come to mind for joy and many of the matters, besides, the writing is well-considered, eager, and wise. That you also say you want to reflect on it, you do wisely, for it is said: "Well-considered reflection never spoils any matter." But to do first, and then seek advice or reflect is foolishness. Therefore, Sallust [!] said: "Every matter should be considered with mature advice beforehand and, once decided, should be taken up promptly and courageously." Also consider the world well now; it lets itself be looked at and yet not quickly endured. The whole world is full of falsehood, therefore you do right and most wisely, that you surrender yourself in the end to God's will. For whoever trusts in God will not be put to shame, says His holy prophet Isaiah [49:23].</p>
      <p>Finally, it is my urgent friendly request that you receive my writing with good intention, for if it is laid to your advantage, it is quite insignificant. Remember that it is said, people who cannot speak well are not suited to deceive, but are the most friendly, as they are much more intense in heart and deed than the words sound.</p>
      <p>With this, I thank you for all honor and all goodness, offer myself to repay it as I can and as is possible for me. God be with you.</p>
