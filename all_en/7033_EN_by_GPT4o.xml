      <p>Greetings in Christ. My last letter, most honorable man, arrived in London somewhat late, and since it could not proceed to the Frankfurt fair, it returned to me unfinished: I somewhat fear that the same may happen to this one as well.</p>
      <p>For your lengthy and very learned recent letter to me, I thank you profusely. Now, regarding that synod at Frankfurt, as it is an obscure and controversial matter, I both acknowledge and rejoice that I have been excellently satisfied. Our ecclesiastical affairs, both public and private, are now in the same state as they were. Our people from Leuven shout and disturb as much as they can: and they have supporters, though not many, yet more than I would like. And although there are many, and they write against everyone in general, yet, by some fate of mine, they all focus on me alone. So, while I respond to them, do not think that I am idle.</p>
      <p>We had a parliament of the whole kingdom in these recent months: I could not attend due to health reasons. Laws were written concerning religion, by which the obstinate malice and insolence of the papists are kept in check. There was also discussion about succession; that is, to which family the right of the kingdom should belong, if anything humanly happens to Queen Elizabeth, which we do not wish.</p>
      <p>This contention occupied everyone's minds for one or two months; while the queen did not want the matter to be discussed, everyone else strongly desired it, and there was a great struggle on both sides with great forces and zeal. What can I say? In the end, nothing could be accomplished: for the queen, as she is a woman of great prudence and foresight, suspects that some danger might be created for her once an heir is designated. You know the saying, More people worship the rising sun than the setting one.</p>
      <p>Regarding religion, the matter of vestments has stirred great commotion at this time. The queen is determined not to be swayed: however, some of our brothers fight over this matter as if our entire religion depended on it. Therefore, they prefer to abandon their duties and leave the churches empty rather than yield even a little from their opinion. Neither your most learned writings nor those of Mr. Gwalter, nor the advice of other pious men, can move them. Yet we give thanks to God, who does not allow us to be troubled among ourselves with more serious questions at this time. However, one of our number, the Bishop of Gloucester, openly and confidently stated in parliament that he approves of Luther's opinion on the Eucharist; but I hope that this crop will not last long.</p>
      <p>In Ireland, there is some disturbance at this time. That island, as you know, is subject to our kings. A certain John O'Neill, a bastard, recently raised an army and insolently challenged our forces. But there is more delay than danger in this matter: for he hides himself far away in marshes and wildernesses; where our soldiers cannot easily follow.</p>
      <p>From Scotland, however (what should I say? or what should you believe?), horrendous and atrocious news is reported. Although these things are of such a nature that they can hardly be believed, yet they are written to me from the court, are spread everywhere, and are believed by everyone. They say that the young king, in these very recent days, along with one servant whom he had from his chamber, was killed in his own home, carried outside, and left under the open sky. Believe me, my mind shudders to recount these things. If these things are true, may they not be! Yet if they are, whatever the cause was, or by what plots he was attacked, I will inform you of all matters once I have learned everything. At present, I could neither remain silent about things that are so consistently reported, nor affirm too confidently things that I have not verified.</p>
      <p>I hear that our Julius is dead in Zurich: nevertheless, I send him twenty French crowns, if he lives, so that they may benefit him; but if, which I do not wish, he is dead, that they may be used for a scholarly feast. If I had the leisure, I would write to Mr. Lavater, Mr. Simler, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Haller, and others; especially to Mr. Gwalter; to whom, ungrateful man that I am, I have never written. I ask that you bid all these, and especially Mr. Rudolf and Mr. Heinrich, your sons, to be very well in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father and most revered lord in Christ. Salisbury in England, February 24, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, John Jewel, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the church of Zurich, a man far learned and his most revered lord. Zurich.</p>
