      <p>Greetings. Your letter was delivered to us, to Mr. Iungius and myself, a few days ago, most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, in which you commend to us your (or rather our) young men who have been recalled from the University of Marburg, so that they may continue their course of studies with us, and for whom we should provide frugal sustenance and good discipline and supervision. As far as I am concerned, I promise you and your entire school and church not only in this matter but also in others, in which I can be of service and assistance to you, my efforts without any exception of labors and occupations.</p>
      <p>Mr. Iungius, our brother, has done or will soon do the same.</p>
      <p>We have conferred among ourselves on how it would seem best to provide for the young men, and we both had the same opinion; for we have certain reasons why we think it would hardly be in their interest to live in the college at this time. Therefore, we have decided, since you give us the freedom, to procure lodging for them elsewhere when they arrive with us, and we would perhaps already have it if we knew how much they could pay for board.</p>
      <p>Since this is unknown to us, we could not conclude anything certain; however, we will make an effort (with God's help) to deal with them in such a way that you will understand that your recommendation holds the highest weight with us and that we have depended on your word. If the young men, as we do not doubt, obey us, we are hopeful that they will make progress with us in the studies of humanity and piety. May God, the best and greatest, grant that this hope does not deceive us.</p>
      <p>To whom be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily in the Lord together with all yours, whom I wish to be safe. Basel, November 14, in the year of human salvation 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinianus. To the most learned man in sacred and secular letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother in Christ. Zürich.</p>
