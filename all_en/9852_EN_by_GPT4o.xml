      <p>S. D. I sincerely congratulate you and the Church of Christ, most illustrious man and most revered father in Christ, and I give thanks to God with all my heart, for in His immense kindness, He has restored you to us, having rescued you from a deadly illness. I also give the highest thanks in my name and that of my brothers, for you have generously shared with us, through the letters of the brothers, the things you thought were in our interest to know. You are doing a necessary thing by opposing the impudence of Schmidelin and acting as a vigorous defender of the truth.</p>
      <p>This response befits your age, and I do not doubt it will be beneficial to the Church. And since I see you desire an example of our Theodoret, behold, I send you the only copy I received from the printer, so that from it I could compile an index of what has already been done; you will keep it as long as you wish, until I receive what the printer has promised. Only the first page is missing, which contains the book's title and the beginning of the dedicatory letter, besides the double index, which will be added at the end of the work. The printer fears that if he prints the first page, the copy might be stolen and printed by someone else, thus depriving him of the small profit he hopes to gain from this work. You will sense the printer's diligence if you inspect the letter and the text itself. For this reason, I am less ashamed and regretful of this work, undoubtedly well-placed among the pious. This little book alone, by which the spirit of that Vulcan is driven, can prove, without mentioning the most shameless impudence, that Theodoret was falsely claimed to be a Nestorian in a devilish manner. I recently heard from a trustworthy source that he inserted these words among others in a letter to a follower: "O deed worthy of iron punishment." From this phrase, all the pious can recognize him as a murderer as well as a liar. I have summarized the contents of what the Wittenberg messenger brought in a note handed over the previous day to our bookseller. Cracovius is imprisoned in Leipzig, Peucer is detained in a certain fortress near the mountains of Anne; others, to our sorrow, have subscribed to the excellent articles of obscure men. Esromus fled, leaving letters in the museum to the academy's consistory and the elector. We have the theologians' writings printed here; we are ashamed of so many pastors and pity those who undoubtedly subscribed with tears rather than with a pen. We must pray to the Lord to open the eyes of the pious and the elect, who, like Peter, deny the truth under the threats of women, and who may kindly show them the way to deplore their fall and turn to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I believe you are well aware of the tricks and impostures by which the Solothurn envoy and the 7 Orders are hindering our delegation to France. It will be your duty, for the sake of Christian zeal, to promote what has been decreed by us against the gates of hell, lest we soon perish with the adversaries.</p>
      <p>I am returning the letters you shared with me. All the colleagues, the honorable councilors, fellow ministers, and friends send their regards along with me.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ. December 23, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>The teacher of our school has given a significant scandal to the church and school, which torments me beyond words. If he comes to you, we ask that you, in your wisdom, lend him only one ear, keeping the other free for us, if the situation requires, leaving his complaint unheeded. For we are already overwhelmed by a multitude of scandals, so that those which arise from our own midst cannot be excused. And this indeed is for your most chaste ear, my father.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his lord and most revered father in Christ.</p>
