      <p>S. D. I am ashamed, dearest relative, of the very long delay.</p>
      <p>It seems almost a year has passed since I promised to send these prayers to your piety, which I am now finally sending; but I beg you to forgive me for this tardiness and kindly accept what your most loving relative sends, and also keep me in your prayers. I am not entirely well; for I have been miserably troubled by a cough for a month now; but this is the condition of old men, whom such incidents bid to pack their bags. Truly happy are those who migrate from this most calamitous age to blessed abodes, where there will be perpetual joy. However, letters and rumors spread various things about the French civil war, so that it is not safe to write anything about them, much less to assert anything. For now, it is written that peace is almost concluded; soon it is said for certain that no peace is to be hoped for; now it is written that there was fighting on both sides with great slaughter of royal troops, yet the prince did not achieve a bloodless victory, and furthermore, the Duke of Guise and the king's brother were captured; immediately others affirm that all these things are most false. It is also said that Johann Wilhelm of Saxony was captured with his horsemen by the admiral and the Palatine; this is again denied by others and it is affirmed that the admiral has fallen and the prince is hastening with his troops to Normandy. Finally, others announce that the prince is besieging Paris. Whom, I ask, do you believe? What do you write? It seems very true that common saying: "When one begins to wage war, one also begins to lie." The Lord must be prayed to, that He may happily settle these most bloody disturbances and have mercy on us all.</p>
      <p>Greet most kindly the Blaurer and Ulm families, and may the gracious and merciful Lord take paternal care of all yours. Farewell in this. May the Lord bless you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 28, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your elder Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man, Mr. Augustin Blarer, faithful pastor of the church in Leutmerken, my honorable lord, most beloved brother and relative. Leutmerken.</p>
      <p>Delivered on April 7 by the two sons of Balthasar HÃ¼lling.</p>
