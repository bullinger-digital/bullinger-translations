    <p xml:id="regest1">Kilchmeyer feels compelled to briefly set aside his insignificant, everyday tasks in order to relieve Bullinger of some worldly duties. This way, Bullinger can devote himself even more to ecclesiastical matters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Firstly: In his previous letter [not received], Bullinger requested a receipt for the repayment [of debts] from Kaspar Seidensticker to Ambrosius Blarer and especially to the [Jakob Funcklin] mentioned by Bullinger. However, Kilchmeyer has not received any such receipt. When Kilchmeyer met with Seidensticker, he asked him to comply with Bullinger's request. Seidensticker, however, stated that such a receipt was not necessary if he received proof from the creditor. And that Bullinger had already received such a receipt is evident from his last letter [not received], in which he mistakenly enclosed another document [for forwarding to Seidensticker]. Kilchmeyer will, at the next opportunity, write to Seidensticker, who now lives far away in the Bern region [in Thunstetten], to immediately send him this [erroneously delivered] document. Therefore, there is no reason to doubt Kilchmeyer's reliability!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Lastly: Bullinger should not worry about the money sent by the citizen of Maienfeld [N.N.] intended for Benedikt Bähler, which Kilchmeyer received from Bullinger through the transmission of Felix von Egg. Kilchmeyer has already taken care of everything. Moreover, he has already received a receipt, sealed and intended for the debtor, which simultaneously relieves Bullinger and himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">If Kilchmeyer is indeed able to accomplish something with the Bern council, the Bern city messenger [N.N.] should set off for Zurich at any moment to deliver the money for both the current Bern scholars at the Zurich Grossmünster [Johann Knechtenhofer, Abel Mühlhofer, Jonas Danmatter, Ismael Buchser, and Samuel Schnewli] and the new ones [N.N.]. Kilchmeyer will also ensure that the messenger brings the receipt [Bähler's] in the name of all involved.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">On January 17 of this year, the well-known Johannes Ulrich Göppel and Benedikt Schürmeister were dismissed from the Zofingen church by a decision of the Bern council. Why? Because those Lutheran-oriented preachers taught unclear and confusing views about the office of the pastor and the Lord's Supper, which are neither appropriate nor beneficial to the church! Kilchmeyer likely offended some during the exhausting negotiation [before the Bern council]. If that was a mistake, it should be forgivable alongside his other transgressions, especially since he has done nothing for which he should fear before God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[Schürmeister and Göppel] had long deserved this punishment! As far as Kilchmeyer knows, Schürmeister was seduced by the Swabian cunning of Göppel! As soon as Schürmeister, in his Swiss simplicity and piety, realizes that he not only acted wrongly but also that the punishment is appropriate, Kilchmeyer will make every effort to find him a suitable position elsewhere. May God ensure that Bullinger neither sends nor recommends any more Swabians to him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Only a blind person could not notice what has been triggered in Bern by the two after they were [dismissed]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">What Kilchmeyer plans for his own future, he will present in due course and with determination to the Zurich council, in whose service he wishes to spend his twilight years. If only they would at least take his age into consideration!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Greetings from Eberhard von Rümlang, Johannes Wäber, and Nikolaus Pfister, who remain vigilant. Greetings to [Johannes] Fries, [Johann Jakob] Ammann, and the other colleagues.</p>

      <p>You compel me, most learned man, to briefly set aside the tasks that overwhelm me daily, so that I may take an hour to write to you, primarily to relieve you of secular duties, allowing you to serve ecclesiastical matters more readily.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The main point is: I have not seen the receipt (if it pleases the learned) concerning Kaspar Seidensticker and Ambrosius Blarer, or rather the other one you mentioned. However, your letters written to me indicated that you were requesting a receipt from Kaspar. When I met with the man to fulfill your wishes and show gratitude towards you, he replied that it was unnecessary, but rather that he should receive such letters from the creditor, which would suffice for him. Your latest letters clearly testify that you have these and mistakenly sent others to us. However, since Kaspar now resides far from us and the city (though still within the city's territory), I will write to him as soon as I can, so that if he has received such letters from you, either attached or enclosed, he will send them to me immediately. Once this is done, you need not doubt my reliability.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding the last sums of money intended for Benedikt Bähler and sent by a certain citizen of Maienfeld, which you returned to me through Felix von Egg, I do not wish you to be concerned. Everything has been executed with the utmost fidelity by me. I also have a sealed receipt concerning this matter, satisfying the debtor, you, and me, and absolving us all from this business.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I hope that at any moment the public messenger will come to you, bringing money for our stipendiaries studying at your literary school, and if my diligence and influence prevail, he will bring new ones. I will also ensure that he delivers that receipt to you in the name of all involved.</p>

      <p>On the seventeenth day of January of this present year 1548, our Göppel and Benedikt Schürmeister were removed and dismissed from the Zofingen church by the decree of our magnificent council. Why was this done? Because, infected with the Lutheran spirit, they have been teaching about the ministry and the Lord's Supper in a manner more obscure and convoluted than is appropriate and beneficial for the church. In this matter, besides the efforts endured, I believe I have offended some. But let this error pass, if it was an error, along with my other sins. In this matter, I have done nothing for which I should fear the Lord of heaven and earth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>For they have long been deserving! But I once knew Mr. Benedikt, seduced by that Swabian Göppel and ensnared by Swabian cunning. As soon as he realizes, in his Swiss simplicity and piety, that he has suffered harm before understanding the cause, I will make every effort to find him a position elsewhere befitting his dignity. I beg you not to send or recommend any Swabians to me, and may the Lord take care of everything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>But what has been accomplished by them among us, after they have been enriched, no one but a blind person could fail to see.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>What I have firmly resolved to do, our most holy Zurich council will understand in due time and hour, under whose obedience I have decided to render my spirit. If only they would consider my old age, which I do not doubt they will.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Greetings and farewell to you from Mr. Eberhard von Rümlang, Johannes Wäber, and Nikolaus Pfister, who all remain vigilant in Bern. Please convey my greetings to my dearest Fries, Mr. Ammann, my godfather, and all the other brothers. Given in Bern by the light, January 31, 1548.</p>
      <p>I. K., always yours.</p>
      <p>To the pious and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, Zurich, preacher at the Grossmünster, my dear patron and brother.</p>
