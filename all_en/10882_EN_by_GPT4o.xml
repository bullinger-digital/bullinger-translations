    <p xml:id="regest1">[Hans Rudolf] Lavater has been elected to the council to the delight of all righteous people. Bern finds itself disappointed by the Wallisers in its expectations; through the alliance with those of different faiths, it has partly caused its increasing endangerment by [King Francis I]. Bullinger has not yet received any news from the [Wittenberg] convent; he trusts that the truth will not perish, yet the dispute will not come to an end. Vadian writes of a Turkish attack on Hungary and Austria; behind it is King [Francis I]. Recommendation for [Johannes] Fries to Myconius and Gryn√§us.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Lavater, an excellent man, has been elected to the council. He greatly supports religion and public justice. Furthermore, he is a magnanimous, wealthy, strong, steadfast, and eloquent man; hence, good men are not moderately delighted by his calling. You will inform the council of this and pray to the Lord to increase and confirm His gifts in this man.</p>
      <p>I was astonished by what you wrote about the Wallisers, although from the beginning I feared treachery and deception. Thus, the people of Bern are now deserted by those in whom they, as I hear, placed much trust. Soon they will suffer great harm from the French. For the association of the impious never turned out well for the good. We also experience daily what harm impious alliances cause us.</p>
      <p>I have not a word about the convent. I do not know what to hope for. However, I am certain that the truth will always prevail. Nor will I value their decrees highly if they decide against the truth. Therefore, I am at peace concerning this matter. Meanwhile, I grieve over the impudence of some and the poorly managed affairs. The struggle will last until the end. We will be sifted, the Lord will test us through fire. Blessed are those who persevere to the end.</p>
      <p>If you have any news about the war, write to me. Vadian writes from St. Gallen that the Turk has certainly entered Hungary with a large cavalry and is directing his forces towards Austria. These are evidently the plans of the Christian king. But what need is there for many words? The Lord's sword hangs over our necks. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Our dear Frisius, who is very dear to us, is coming to you. We commend this son to you and Grynaeus as to the most faithful fathers. We beseech you to embrace him as our own flesh. He is a learned, pious, and upright man. Whatever service you render to him, you will render to a most worthy man, and we, as much as is in us, will respond to your kindness. Therefore, you will introduce him to Grynaeus and commend him with your own words and with these our letters. I will acknowledge this as long as I live.</p>
      <p>Farewell, Myconius, dearest of friends, and write more frequently.</p>
      <p>June 12, 1536.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, bishop of the most renowned city of Basel, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
