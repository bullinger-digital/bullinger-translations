      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>More often than not, I trouble you, most learned Calvin and my dearest and most esteemed brother, with a matter of little importance. But because I receive no response from you, even though I have written so many times, I am compelled to do what I am doing. For I suspect that my letters have not been delivered to you.</p>
      <p>The young man you recommended to me, a Frenchman, is staying with our city clerk, a man of great authority and very skilled in his art. He pays the clerk 16 gold crowns annually. I have pledged myself as debtor for 8 crowns. He also owes some money for several books to Froschauer, for which I have likewise pledged my credit. It is customary with us to pay half of the total sum due for the year at the beginning of the year and to clearly state what they have decided about the remaining part of the year. Therefore, I beg you, my Calvin, to inform the merchant of this and to respond with the money via this public messenger of our city. I have sent some details about the young man in my last letter to you. I do not repeat them because I am certain they have been delivered to you. I am sending you a booklet on the antiquity of the Christian faith, which I once wrote in German and has now been translated by a certain scholar, although not entirely successfully. I hope you will consider this small gift kindly.</p>
      <p>I love you sincerely. Farewell. Zürich, 23rd year 1544.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, preacher in Geneva, his dearest brother.</p>
