      <p>Greetings. What Mr. Grynaeus writes on command, for the common cause and the Lord, I pray, may move you. It seems to me that this matter will result in great benefit for the Gospel and our homeland. I am not unaware of how much you dislike assemblies.</p>
      <p>But who would not yield to necessity? Indeed, the benefit, which will undoubtedly come from the presence of the Swiss name, will be indescribable. And how much will it mean in the future that you were not only spectators of the matter but also of the brothers? Your absence would not be well interpreted by princes, cities, and scholars. The opposing party would indeed swell with pride from the same. I implore you, by Christ, do not be called in vain, since this counsel is not only of the people of Strasbourg but also of the Elector and Hesse. May the Lord be in your counsels. Amen. Farewell in Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, May 28, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and the other brothers, ministers of Christ, his in the Lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
