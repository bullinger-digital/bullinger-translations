      <p>Greetings and blessings. I am both ashamed and regretful, venerable father in Christ and lord to be honored with the utmost reverence, that I write less frequently than I should. However, knowing that your kindness is always extremely busy with countless affairs, and that nothing worthy of your greatness has been offered to me so far, I believe I have a sufficient excuse for my delay in writing to you.</p>
      <p>I give my utmost thanks for the Scottish writing and the booklets sent and gifted to me. I quickly read through both booklets, and I am very pleased with each. I judge the name of the most learned and sharp-witted man who wrote about the supper to be fictitious; I wish to know the author's real name, if it is permissible. He touches on many things obscurely, as distinguished men often do, which I would prefer to be explained more simply and plainly; for we must not only fight against the obstinate, but much more instruct and guide those who are still teachable, and extricate from errors those who, due to ignorance and simplicity, still wander like sheep.</p>
      <p>I received your opinion on the translation of the dialect in our confession, which I had undertaken. But the plague, which at this time besieged all the walls of my house, prevented me from completing the task. However, the Lord most graciously preserved the entire family, which has so far relied solely on the protection of Psalm 91.</p>
      <p>To give you another task, I am sending you passages and opinions of the fathers on the truth of the flesh of Christ. As I learned from you in Zurich, you have seen the preface attached to the booklet.</p>
      <p>I had entrusted it to Mr. Oporinus to be published in the year the booklet contains, if it pleased him. But our Basel friends, which I find very surprising, although they publish countless trifles otherwise, did not want to grant this to Mr. Oporinus, as I suspect from his very friendly letters to me. Therefore, I recently retrieved the booklet from him. A certain pious zeal moved my mind to this undertaking, and that in the midst of the fiercest enemies of the house of God, since I had collected such opinions for the use of myself and a few colleagues and did not hesitate to face dangers in Eastern France because of the opinion of this booklet. Westphalus, Amsterodamus, Rulandus, and others had published opinions from the fathers on the immensity of the body of Christ and the eating of the unworthy, and Doctor Unicornius twisted Melanchthon's writing to the Elector Palatine about the Eucharist in astonishing ways into their insane opinion, all of which wounded my mind so much that I could not remain silent. In reality, I experienced with many pious doctors how much power the consensus of so many doctors of the Church of Christ had, and in many meetings, I often clearly recognized that even the most learned, by their own judgment, disgracefully gave in, who opposed these testimonies. You, however, know far better than I that once this most execrable opinion of the ubiquity or multilocality of the body of Christ is removed, all the foundations of those who defend that gross and idolatrous presence of the flesh of Christ in the supper are simultaneously undermined and overthrown. Indeed, I had translated well over half of this booklet into the German language with the utmost faithfulness and diligence I could, so that it might also be shared with the Germans. I now send it to you, so that you may judge what is best regarding my undertaking, and if the book seems worthy of light to you, that you may wish to do the same with it as you profess to have done with the writing of the Reverend Erbius, your friend. I transformed my name into Greek words for the sake of the simple, for whose benefit I wish my name to be obliterated altogether. But enough and more than enough about these things.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Belgians, the Spaniard, the emperor, and the siege of the fortress of Gotha, which you mention, I also receive reports from Franconia.</p>
      <p>Everywhere, princes are raising armies, and it is written to us that a diet has been summoned to Regensburg for the month of March. The inevitable ruin of the entire empire is before everyone's eyes. Germany is exhausted everywhere, religion is almost universally mocked, truth suffers from the immense hatred of those who wish to be regarded as the highest patrons of the church, such great license of the people, such rapacity, blasphemies, injuries, luxury, pride, lusts, and wantonness reign everywhere, that there is no place left for paternal correction, and everything must be expiated and overthrown by the extreme wrath of God. May the Lord have mercy on us and deliver those who are His, and that rather by His glorious coming than by any other means. Amen.</p>
      <p>Those whom you ordered to be greeted, greet you reverently. You will greet all the brothers individually with the utmost reverence in my name and in the name of my fellow ministers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on the 25th of February in the year 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most esteemed in humanity, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and most reverend father in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, his friend and lord to be honored with the utmost reverence.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
