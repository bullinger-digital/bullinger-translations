      <p>In the Lord, peace and health.</p>
      <p>I had expected, most illustrious and dearest man, to receive your letters, in which I would have learned about your well-being and that of other brethren, as well as what is happening with you. However, I have not seen any so far, perhaps due to the constant turmoil of affairs that keep you busy. Therefore, I easily forgave this.</p>
      <p>Moreover, dearest brother, I earnestly ask that you, along with your brethren, be present with me with your counsel and help. There is a man called Master Johannes Carion, who has recently, in his plausible chronicle now published, disgracefully and falsely slandered me to the credulous populace. The following words are inserted there: "A man named Schappeler made twelve articles, called of Christian freedom, that one should not pay tithes to the authorities, etc. Through these articles, it is believed, the common people were incited in large part." These words were sent to me by my candid friends, the preachers of Memmingen, in a certain note. For I most certainly know that I have never composed any articles, nor do I know anything about Christian freedom, as I call God to witness. Finally, it is as true that I have not advised the magistrates or superiors not to pay or grant tithes as it is true that the most foolish Pharisees falsely accused the innocent Lord Christ of not giving tribute to Caesar. My innocence in this matter is testified by a document still retained by the council of Memmingen, which I had voluntarily handed over to them at their request along with my comrades. The same is testified by all my good listeners there. But that envious man, falsely informed by some unknown author and incited by fury against me, so that he might render not so much me but the evangelical truth hateful to mortals, has wrongly and unhappily thrust this as a game for all the triflers, like painters and poets. Therefore, what should I do there, or by what means should that atrocious injury be justly avenged, I implore and expect your collective wisdom in the name of God. It seemed to some brethren that an apology, as would be fitting and expedient, was necessary, the form of which, if it pleases you, I ask you not to disdain to prescribe to me.</p>
      <p>Whatever new things there were with us, I believe you are not unaware, indeed I think that Mr. Joachim Vadian, who is knowledgeable about many things, has written many things to your humanity. That abbot, driven by a satanic and fanatical spirit, is agitating his poor people with his most delicate supporters. He has now expelled almost all the preachers from their places with Thrasonical fury. He renders our city hateful to our most restless adversaries by slandering it in countless ways and schemes. Iniquity lies to itself everywhere, so that it may someday feel deserved punishment. The rest, which I had faithfully entrusted to you and my other brethren to be observed in my matter, I do not forget. Meanwhile, I still remain hidden at home in idleness. You, excellent Heinrich, I earnestly pray that you inform your Christophorus about your affairs when you have a little leisure.</p>
      <p>Farewell with these and live happily in the Lord Jesus with yours, whom I ask you to greet in my name, along with the brethren, Mr. Leo, Pellican, Erasmus, Binder, Theodor, most learned men, my most delightful friends.</p>
      <p>From St. Gallen, February 17, 1533.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for poor me.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Chris. Sertorius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his friend to be respected in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
