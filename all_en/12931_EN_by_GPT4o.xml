      <p>News, which perhaps you know better than I do: There has been an uprising in Frankfurt, with six citizens arrested. It is said that they wanted to abduct Maximilian von Egmont, the Count of Buren, with a Hessian nobleman. Some believe it is merely a fabrication by them.</p>

      <p>The Elector of Saxony, Johann Friedrich, has much support from the Bohemians and Poles; he is said to have captured Maximilian, the son of Ferdinand, and shot Duke Maurice. Ferdinand is crying for help, surrounded in a small town. It is said that the Landgrave is preparing strongly to relieve Bremen, which is besieged by Martin von Rossem, who has a Dutch army. However, he is said to have no artillery with him. It is certain that the Bohemians have defected from Ferdinand.</p>

      <p>In Strasbourg, they fear an uprising due to the disgraceful submission. Oh, miserable and twice miserable, indeed greedy merchants! Farewell. Basel, April 18, 1547. Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, parish priest in Zurich, my dear, kind lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
