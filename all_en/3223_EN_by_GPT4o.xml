      <p>S. P. To give you some understanding of our situation here, most illustrious men, know that on the 23rd of February we departed from Krakau (Cracow) to Wilna (Vilnius, the capital of Greater Lithuania) to the king, where we arrived safely, by the grace of God, on the 17th of March. Two days later, we approached the king, who received the illustrious man, Mr. Johann von Laski, with great affection (not without the admiration of many), even extending his right hand to both of us. He listened attentively and with clear benevolence to Mr. von Laski as he congratulated the king on the happiness of his kingdom, the light of evangelical doctrine, and the entire homeland under his governance, while also explaining the occasion and calling of his return to the homeland without dissimulation. The king himself soon responded with his own words, expressing that Mr. von Laski's return was most welcome to him. The vice-chancellor, however, an ecclesiastical man burdened with countless benefices, coadjutor of the Archbishop of Gnesen (Gniezno), and eagerly awaiting the first vacant bishopric, to satisfy his faith and observance towards the pope, responded on the 22nd day, in the king's name, with the king present, among other things: the king recognizes no other light of the gospel than that which his ancestors recognized, and which Poland has recognized for more or less six hundred years; and that doctrine is correct, and his majesty, following the example of his ancestors, wishes to persist in it. Furthermore, it is solely the king's prerogative to call anyone to reform the churches here, and therefore Mr. von Laski should not have been called by the Polish nobility. The king, however, had already indicated to Mr. von Laski through Mr. Palatinus of Vilnius that the vice-chancellor was pressing and preparing a response to his greeting; there would be two things (namely those I have now mentioned) in the entire response that would rightfully offend him: advising him to respond as briefly as possible, so that the vice-chancellor would not begin a new thread of reply in the name of his majesty; for from mutual disputes, no benefit would accrue to the progress of religion. If Mr. von Laski wished to say anything further to the king, he should do so privately, with no witnesses present; for the king would grant him a private conversation, in which he could freely discuss anything. Mr. von Laski, as soon as the vice-chancellor finished his speech, responded briefly (to satisfy the king's request in this part, otherwise relying on the hope of a private conversation with the king), saying that he had not rashly congratulated the king and his kingdom on this light of evangelical doctrine. Meanwhile (he said), let his majesty see to it that he and his faith are approved by God the Father and Christ the Lord, before whose tribunal he will one day stand, and to whom he will have to give an account of his royal administration: nevertheless, as he has always hoped, he will not cease to hope that God will one day grant his majesty the grace to sincerely embrace the pure religion of God and publicly profess it; and that he has hitherto contended with the most ardent vows and prayers to God the Almighty for this to happen, and will continue to do so. As for the calling to be made by the king to reform the churches here, he has always frankly acknowledged the royal majesty's authority here, and still reverently acknowledges it, especially if a general reformation of the entire kingdom is to be instituted. However, this does not prevent his relatives, kinsmen, and other nobles from calling him or anyone else (due to the unique freedom of the nobility here) to assist them in promoting religion in their domains; which was the sole aim of those who called him, and also his own in obeying this divine calling, whatever the adversaries may slander.</p>
      <p>Two days later, the king admitted Mr. von Laski to a private conversation (as he had promised), with many present but none listening: in which he admonished the king of his sin, namely his denial of Christ the Lord, which he had made two days earlier, and of some other serious matters, handing him a certain excellent writing, which he had recently composed in Vilnius; concerning the duty of the king in abolishing idolatry and promoting true religion; and concerning the deceit of papal bishops, and the dangers that await the king and his kingdom from them unless timely precautions are taken, and concerning the necessary preparation before the diet. The king, however, bore his admonition with equanimity: he said he could not do otherwise now, especially in the face of the adversaries' importunity; but once this Livonian war (which is now in great preparation) is concluded, he will seriously attend to the reformation of the churches, as he promised the entire order of nobles at the last diet of the kingdom. And he acknowledged Mr. von Laski not only as a subject but also as his servant, namely secretary, in the same position he once held with the late Sigismund, the king's father: and he promised to defend him against all his slanderous adversaries; and he allowed him to hold meetings of noblemen and ministers at his home, and also to meet with the brethren in other houses as often as it seemed fit, provided it was for the propagation of religion, and not for inciting any sedition. He gave many other signs of his benevolence towards Mr. von Laski; which is not the place to narrate now. And finally, having given his right hand to both of us, he departed from us.</p>
      <p>The Palatine of Vilnius, a most gracious prince adorned with various gifts of nature and spirit, who last year published a most splendid confession of his faith in a public writing, treated us at his home for a whole month with great humanity, and assigned Mr. von Laski an honorable annual pension, and promised a thousand Polish florins as a dowry to his eldest daughter, whom he had not yet seen, whom he requested to be given into his family, and promised her a husband from his own kin; and he honored him with many other gifts, and also me with some. This prince, being very devoted to you there, would seem to me to be doing a wise thing if you were to dedicate a book to him to stimulate his spirit in the cause of religion. For you know that such princes, especially men who are so variously entangled, need certain spurs and goads to run more eagerly in the path they have undertaken.</p>
      <p>He, however, knows Latin, and is of such authority above others in Lithuania, that some say, he who has seen him has seen everything in Lithuania. Nor is there anyone with the king himself who is endowed with greater authority. Therefore, it would be of great benefit to have confirmed such a man more and more for the church of Christ the Lord. Moreover, Mr. von Laski has preached in Vilnius with great edification, with many royal courtiers present, and with the king's knowledge and permission. Also, on our return from Lithuania, whenever the opportunity presented itself, he preached to confirm the brethren both in other articles and in the sacramental matter.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while we were in Vilnius, seven monks of the Order of St. Basil came there from Moscow (which is of the Greek faith), who were fleeing there in the name of true religion. For such is the persecution among them now, that if they had not withdrawn in time, it would have been over for them long ago. The chief among them, who was great among the Muscovites, and seemed to excel the others here in authority, age, and knowledge of the sacred scriptures, was examined by Mr. von Laski through an interpreter; but he responded so skillfully in the principal articles of religion, and even in the matter of the Eucharist, that he could hardly have done so more skillfully, so that we recognized them as entirely ours and truly acknowledged them as our brethren. They said, however, that upon their departure, about 70 noblemen had been imprisoned for the cause of religion, and that they knew more than five hundred brethren in Moscow who cared about religion. Hence we see the marvelous power of the divine Spirit in God's elect: for they did not derive that knowledge from our people, whose writings they do not understand, but from those whom God himself has stirred up with his Spirit in Moscow. Furthermore, the Ruthenians, also people of the Greek faith, who live in Vilnius and have their own churches, cannot bear the sight of these brethren; and at the beginning of their arrival, they severely beat them for their defection from their faith, nor would they have been able to live there safely among the Ruthenians, had not Mr. Palatinus of Vilnius taken them under his protection. Moreover, the king has now written to the bishops of this kingdom, who were recently gathered in a certain synod, ordering them to seriously consider reforming the churches here without further delay, and not only in morals but also in the very worship of God; for he (as he has long since indicated to the Roman bishop) cannot delay the reformation of his churches any longer without certain danger to his kingdom. May the Lord God, by his Holy Spirit, make it progress successfully to the glory of his name being worshiped.</p>
      <p>To ensure the reformation, which the king intends to undertake with God's favor next winter, succeeds more happily, it will be necessary (in my judgment) to have a faithful leader of the entire action, who will lead the others, forming the reformation itself from God's word, and finally executing it once formed. For if everyone wishes to bring their thoughts indiscriminately and impose them as they please, the business of reformation will undoubtedly not succeed well. And again, even if everything were instituted in the best way, it would be of little use for the good governance of this church of God unless there is a faithful, prudent man, experienced in the exercise of ecclesiastical discipline, to execute it. Therefore, you would seem to be doing a worthwhile work, most dear men, especially in this infancy of the church here, if you (given your authority here and with the king himself) were to commend Mr. von Laski, whose faith and prudence (not to mention his other divine gifts) are not unknown to you there, to the king himself and to the Palatine of Vilnius by letters sent to them, as Mr. Philipp Melanchthon recently did. Otherwise, there is a fear that the reformation may not succeed very happily, or at least the execution of the reformation, however good it may otherwise be. For it is certain that almost all here are neophytes, to whom this province cannot be entrusted without the most certain danger to the church.</p>
      <p>You will easily learn the rest from Dr. Lismanninus, our honorable father and brother: whose fate (so to speak) is such, with God thus providing, that he is compelled to wander for a while longer from this kingdom (which was like a homeland to him); certainly through no fault of his own, as he has deserved very well from both the king himself and this kingdom; but due to the excessive rage of Satan and the adversaries of Christ the Lord, which the king cannot withstand in every respect (due to his weakness). Meanwhile, he has always declared and still declares his utmost benevolence towards Mr. Lismanninus, whom he wishes to divert to your church there above all the churches of Germany. There is no doubt that this cross is a sign of a certain special goodness of God towards Mr. Lismanninus, who is accustomed to declare his benevolence towards his elect with such tokens and as it were certain symbols. And since all things work together for good to those who love God, I am persuaded in the Lord that this exile (otherwise very troublesome to us here) will be for his edification and consolation. If he had to live in Mesech or Kedar, among a barbarous people devoid of all knowledge or fear of God, the way of living abroad would undoubtedly be hard. But that sweet fellowship among the foremost brethren and the most holy assemblies and gatherings of the most learned and pious men cannot fail to delight and console him greatly, and to make him more and more equipped and useful for the church of God and our Lord Jesus Christ. This matter, otherwise deprived of all other supports, should abundantly console us and our brethren here in this visitation of our brother.</p>
      <p>Not long ago, there was someone here not entirely unknown to you there, who attempted to secretly disturb these churches; who also still spreads not very honorable things about Mr. von Laski, who otherwise deserved well of him, as he recently did in Greater Poland, whenever a little window was opened to him, namely among those whom he knew did not entirely agree with us in the sacramental matter, to prepare the minds of some nobles here to accept the Augsburg Confession: although, while he was here with us, he conformed to us, and said he agreed with us entirely and dissimulated; so much so that he led Mr. Dr. Lismanninus, among many others, to that persuasion about him, who is said to have given you there not an unhonorable testimony about the man on that occasion.</p>
      <p>I have thought it my duty, for the sake of my faith in the church of Christ, to inform you of these things, lest you be deceived by such reports, but rather counter his slanders and hypocrisy to the glory of God: about which you will learn more through Mr. Lismanninus.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished men, most esteemed teachers and brothers in Christ the Lord, to whom I commend you and your ministry with the greatest zeal, that you may bring abundant fruit to him for eternal life. Amen. Please greet Mr. Bernardino Ochino and Mr. Conrad Gesner in the Lord for me, and commend me to the Lord God in your prayers. I will render every return in kind.</p>
      <p>In Wlodislaw (Wodzisław), in the year 1557, on the 23rd of June.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to the piety of you all, Jo. Utenhovius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and Mr. Peter Martyr, and the other pastors and professors of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed teachers and brothers. In Zürich.</p>
