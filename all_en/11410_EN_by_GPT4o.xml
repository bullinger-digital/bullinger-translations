    <p xml:id="regest1">Richard Hilles and William Peterson reported from London [through John Butler, No. 1361], that the situation in England has improved since the marriage [of Henry VIII] with the pious [Anne of Cleves], and the persecutions are now directed against opponents of the Reformation like [William] Watts, while [Robert] Barnes and others are actively working for the Gospel and German, especially Zurich books, are being sold again; the King has ordered the dissolution of all monasteries, and the abbots [Richard Whiting] of Glastonbury and [Hugh Cooke, known as Farringdon] of Reading have been quartered for high treason and hanged at the entrance of their monastery. [Oswald] Myconius wrote [No. 1363], Emperor [Charles V] has taken away the freedom of Maastricht, and Ghent has submitted to him. May God grant that the imperial motto "Plus ultra" turns into "Plus minus"; the Germans should be warned. Some speak of a truce and plans for a campaign to Poland, others expect that violence will follow the colloquies and disputations.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Richard Hilles and William Peterson write from London, England, in this manner: «The state of the kingdom is healthier and more intact since the queen's marriage than it has been until now. The queen is pious, fearing God, and is believed to greatly promote the doctrine of the Gospel. Persecution has turned against those who have so far sounded the trumpet against the evangelicals. The leader of these, William Watts, who preached everywhere in the kingdom against the evangelicals, is now meditating on his epilogue in the prison of Canterbury. Meanwhile, Barnes and his colleagues are vigorously preaching the Gospel. Furthermore, the books of all Germans, especially those from Zurich, are publicly sold again. The prince himself has ordered that before Lent, all monasteries throughout the kingdom be demolished. The most opulent were Glastonbury and Reading. The abbots of these, accused of high treason, have been executed; for they were quartered and hanged near the gate where they have reigned until now, etc. Letters were given on the Ides of January.» This is what I have from England.</p>
      <p>Myconius writes that the Emperor has taken away all freedom from the city of Maastricht and has added it to the house of Burgundy. He adds that Ghent has surrendered to the Emperor with great loss to the public treasury. If these things are true, it is easy to conjecture where that most ambitious saying of the man, PLUS ULTRA, finally tends: certainly to establish a monarchy. Therefore, I pray to the Lord that, with a changed sentiment, he may achieve PLUS MINUS. If the Germans are wise, they will open their eyes. Some say that a truce has been agreed upon and that soon there will be a need to consult about leading an army into Poland. Others believe that the game of Mars (war) will be initiated with colloquies and disputations, and will be ended with cannons and warlike arms. May the Lord do what seems best to Him. Farewell. March 5, 1540. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord.</p>
