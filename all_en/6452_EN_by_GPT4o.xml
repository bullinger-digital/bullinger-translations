      <p>Honorable Lord and Father, I have no doubt that you are quite surprised that I have not responded to your last letter concerning the matter of Arnold. Now, you should know that your letter reached me only the day after I had written mine, so I regret that I could not answer you. But you should believe me that I have done my best and have approached both my gracious lords, the mayors, and dealt with them earnestly. They have promised all good things and have assured me repeatedly that they will give me a final answer tomorrow or on Monday, so that I can write to you about it.</p>
      <p>And since, in the meantime, this good friend has come into my hands and I am concerned that I might find a messenger on Tuesday or not, I wanted to inform you of what I have found in council with both lords, whom I trust: Firstly, they promise me so much that I believe them; if there is no more faith in the world, then I can do nothing about it. And since the typesetter has been here and has made it known to some how satisfied they are with him, and some have objected, I have answered them as to why they might come. However, as I can speak confidentially with both lords, they have said, among other things, that if everything fails, they would still bring the 24 florins, so that the typesetter would also have something of his own and would be fully paid; otherwise, the typesetter would not receive a penny here. And they have advised that you should let the typesetter stand for his part; but they cannot advise you to stand for him in Zurich; for they say there is a right down there, and up here it is different, and it stands that the citizens are paid in advance; moreover, the peasants give nothing. So I also advise you to wait for a final decision here; it will come to me tomorrow or on Monday at the latest, maybe even today, as I said before. One must endure each other even if one fails each other every day; yet, for greater assurance, let the typesetter stand for his part. If he gets something, then that is his gain.</p>
      <p>If I were in your place and the matter were mine, I would now remain with this promise. But nonetheless, you as the wiser may act according to your pleasure; I advise only as a humble servant, yet faithfully, etc. And it is not necessary for you to tell the typesetter or others much about these things, etc.</p>
      <p>I write this in great haste on Saturday; therefore, my request to you is that you will understand it in the best way and not spare my services; for I am obliged and also inclined to serve you. Your servant always, Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Zurich, Mr. Bullinger.</p>
