      <p>S. D. I send back, most illustrious man and father in the Lord, highly esteemed, as I hope, safely, namely through your fellow citizens, and intact and without blemish, all that you have communicated.</p>
      <p>I have the greatest thanks for each and all, especially for those things that your Nicodemus wrote to you about the Wittenbergers. I am particularly pleased with the judgment and opinion of that learned theologian and others about your criticism and oppositions. If only many pious people, bewitched by I don't know what charms, were given the opportunity to read and consider the same criticism attentively and thoughtfully. For I would not doubt that it would clear their eyes and they would think better of our doctrine than most do. About the speech given in Wittenberg, I think it can truly be said, as in the proverb: "Where one feels pain, there also the louse bites." For in temptations, everything is fervent, and vexation gives understanding. Then with all my heart, I pray that he himself may support the most holy and orthodox truth and rescue the pious and truth-loving from the sycophants. Amen. As for Bygelio, I am uncertain what to think, for I have not received a word about him, what he is doing or where he is. However, I encouraged him upon departure to write back about everything as soon as possible; most students care little for patrons, indeed rather for their fathers, which is indeed greatly to be lamented.</p>
      <p>It cannot be unknown to you, my father, the unfortunate dispute about Paradysio, to which the godless Quinquepagici aspire in wondrous ways, to bring back there, honor be to the ears, a spiritual and secular brothel. Therefore, because of the scandal, this controversy greatly torments me. I do not involve myself in political matters, striving above all to adorn the Sparta I have obtained, nor am I troubled about resources, but I fear for the glory of God, neither by divine nor human civil law do these Centaurs and godless monks belong to the monastery, neither this nor similar things are certain. But our more atrocious sins are to be lamented. What indeed would they not dare, who have professed in the Council of Trent to wage an implacable war with us before the whole world more than piratical? I write this only so that in your prayers you may wish to deal with not only our political cause but especially the heavenly cause of the Lord with us, and to promote what makes for holy peace. The devil is thinking of weaving a long web on this occasion, the outcome of which no one can foresee with any pious and Christian reason, although I have no doubt about the faith and constancy of the Zurichers and our Bernese. As for our Schaffhousians, they are indeed not intractable, and in such a scarcity of grain, how liberally they have acted not only towards their own but also towards yours and even towards the most hostile adversaries in this cause, is well known to me. But I cease to write more, as I am not ignorant of whom I am writing to.</p>
      <p>I add one more thing to this: we have hitherto used the form of public supplication to the Lord, which we received composed by your humanity. Now, because the Lord blesses us, undoubtedly moved kindly by the prayers of the pious, the brothers pray with me to your humanity, that you may deign to signify what we should do in the future, so that we may follow your example in this part also with unanimous concord. Otherwise, I believe we address the Lord with the usual words: Sin no more, lest something worse happen to you. Those who have implored the Lord's mercy will do this; the rest are to be commended to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell eternally, and in my name and that of the brothers, greet the brothers and fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Those brothers whom you ordered to be greeted, the consuls, Burgoverus, Martinus Peyerus, and Beatus Leo, reverently greet your humanity.</p>
      <p>Especially greet from me your son Heinrich, my lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Given hastily on July 19, 1572.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your humanity, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful overseer of the church of Zurich, his friend and father in Christ, highly esteemed.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, servant of the word in Zurich.</p>
