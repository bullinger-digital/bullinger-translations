      <p>S. D. I can offer nothing else to you, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, for your effort and diligence, with which you write to us in detail about French affairs, than my gratitude.</p>
      <p>Therefore, on behalf of the brothers and myself, I give the greatest thanks to your kindness; for we have received and read what you wrote on March 15th and 19th.</p>
      <p>We were very glad and gave thanks to God, who does not abandon us and comforts us in our sorrows.</p>
      <p>We diligently pray to the Lord to continue to bless us, to either convert or overthrow our enemies, and to grant a happy end to this most bloody war through a pious and stable peace, so that the good men do not suffer in vain.</p>
      <p>Our neighbors sent soldiers or reinforcements on March 20th, indeed a collected and poorly equipped force of 1500; others say it is 2000. May the faithful be vigilant, so that the enemies do not again prepare new forces under the pretext of peace and oppress us! For we hear, though I do not know how certainly, that the younger BÃ¼ran is bringing 2000 cavalry from Belgium to the Guise.</p>
      <p>We also hear that two hundred thousand gold coins are being collected in Germany for Guise.</p>
      <p>I hope all these things will vanish into thin air as soon as they hear of Guise's demise.</p>
      <p>Regarding the captivity of the Cardinal of Lorraine, nothing of the sort has ever been reported to us as it was to Albrecht of Lyon.</p>
      <p>We heard that he was with the Emperor in Innsbruck and was negotiating the marriage between the Queen of Scotland and Ferdinand, the Emperor's son.</p>
      <p>I have handled the Pellizari matter with as much faith and diligence as I could before the council.</p>
      <p>I obtained letters, a copy of which I have enclosed here; I have just received them; it was not allowed to translate them.</p>
      <p>I held back the courier for two days: he came yesterday; today I obtained the letters; tomorrow he will depart.</p>
      <p>I write this in the evening.</p>
      <p>I gave the scribe 15 asses or 7 and a half batz as usual; I took care not to incur any greater expenses.</p>
      <p>You will ask Pellizari to kindly consider this my service, which I rendered to him on account of your recommendation.</p>
      <p>I will faithfully send the letters of the magistrate to the councilors of Chur and will recommend this case to them as diligently as possible.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I wrote to Mr. Fabricius, to whom I also recommended it with as much faith as I could, and I know he will be diligent.</p>
      <p>Farewell very well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 27th, in the evening, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>It is said that an army is being gathered in Germany to recover Metz.</p>
      <p>The widow of the blessed memory of Martyr has a brother; he is with Mr. Admiral in his court; but since he has not written for a long time, she is anxious that he may have perished.</p>
      <p>We therefore pray that, if you can, you inquire through your friends whether he is alive or dead.</p>
      <p>Merende is the family name.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
