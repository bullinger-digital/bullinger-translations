      <p>Greetings. I repeatedly ask you, dearest brother, for that printed supplication of the Genevans which was recently sent to you; but you neither return it nor respond. I truly cannot do without it, nor is there another copy here; I therefore urge you to hasten. I would have sent it to Bern these days; but since I did not have it, I could not send it.</p>
      <p>A young man here is setting out for Augsburg and will return directly to us; if you wish to entrust him with letters either to Mr. Matthias Schenck or to your other friends, he will take good care of them, and I have instructed him to go to you for this sole reason, so that I may serve you in this matter.</p>
      <p>Friends from England write that peace has been concluded between the Scots, English, and French, with letters dated July 22 from London. The affairs of the Scots are going well; for they have obtained what they wanted; the French are defeated.</p>
      <p>It is said that new disturbances are arising in France.</p>
      <p>May the Lord, having crushed his enemies, cause the truth to triumph, etc.</p>
      <p>They say that a diet is being held by the emperor in Linz, Austria, in which there is discussion about a council and the suppression of the gospel. It is said that the papal legate Stanislaus Hosius, the Bishop of Warmia, three electoral bishops, the Archbishop of Salzburg, the Duke of Bavaria, and the legate of the King of France, San-Laurentianus, have gathered there. If you have any certain information about these matters, let me know.</p>
      <p>But what are our princes doing? Certainly, their learned men are renewing an unnecessary war against us; but the time will come when they will see what they are doing. Farewell together with your family, with Mr. Matthias, and all good people. August 18, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, now residing in Winterthur, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Winterthur.</p>
