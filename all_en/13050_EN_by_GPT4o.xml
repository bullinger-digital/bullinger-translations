    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger will probably wonder how the church in Memmingen is faring in these turbulent times. Everything is still on the brink. Should God fulfill the wishes of the Papists, the Memmingen [pastors] face the death penalty! Currently, there is an attempt to impose a Spanish garrison on the city. Some councilors have been dispatched to the Imperial Diet in Augsburg to dissuade Emperor Charles V from this. If they fail, it will be the end of religion, the children, and the wealth of Memmingen!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The [stationed soldiers] in Biberach are behaving completely inhumanely. In Ulm, both the occupiers and the plague are causing damage. In Augsburg, the Antichrist reigns. The Spaniard rages and the mercenary bares his teeth, while the cardinals and bishops are concerned with their purses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] If only Christ would herald the Last Day with the sound of trumpets, for Schuler sees no other way for the godly to be helped!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Various signs point to an imperial campaign against Constance. Gradually, troops are being prepared, moving ever closer to Memmingen, Kempten, and Isny, from where a surprise attack could be launched. Since it is unlikely that these troops were commissioned to impose the ancestral heresy on [the already fallen cities], it is likely intended to suppress the Swiss freedoms or to destroy Constance. Allegedly, the Emperor has made a treaty with the French King Henry II; perhaps precisely to give his endeavor better chances.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Recently, a Swiss messenger traveling from Augsburg passed through Memmingen [...], who publicly claimed with great eloquence that the Emperor was planning a massive war against Constance, and that the Five Places siding with the Emperor would advocate for allowing the Emperor's army to pass through their territory against Constance. If true, then the Confederation would also be in a bad state! The Zurichers should beware of treachery and learn from the misfortune of the Germans! The Swiss freedom, bought with the blood of ancestors, is envied; it must be defended at all costs! Wagons loaded with firearms are reportedly on their way from the Netherlands towards Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The pastors in Memmingen are still allowed to serve the Church of Christ unhindered; however, the mass priests are trying to prevent this by all means. Bullinger should pray for the church in Memmingen, and the Zurichers should be prepared for attacks from the devil and the world! Bullinger should comfort Schuler whenever possible, as many worries burden him. Otherwise, he and his family are well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, also to Anna [n√©e Adlischwyler], to Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Pellikan, and Theodor Bibliander.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ, our Savior. You may wonder, as charity demands, venerable brother, what the state of the Memmingen church is in such a tumult of all things. We are still in doubt about what the Lord will do with us. The Papists threaten the worst, should the Lord grant them their wish. As I write this, Spanish soldiers are attempting to inhabit our city, to act according to their desires against any pious person, as is the custom of this people. Our people have gone to Augsburg, if it pleases God, to mitigate this proposal with the Emperor; if this does not happen, it is the end for us, our religion, our children, and our goods.</p>

      <p>In Biberach, they are behaving inhumanely; in Ulm, both the soldiers and the plague are rampant; in Augsburg, the Antichrist almost reigns. The Spaniard rages. The German soldier grinds his teeth. Meanwhile, cardinals and bishops are laboring excellently, if it pleases the gods, for filling their purses.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Would that the last day of the Lord were here, when Christ will sound the trumpet through his glorious advent! I do not see how the godly can be helped in such utterly deplorable circumstances.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>From various conjectures, it can be divined that a future war against the people of Constance is coming; for the Emperor seems to be gradually preparing soldiers, who daily approach Memmingen, Kempten, and Isny. For he will station soldiers there, so that he may finally attack more swiftly and as if by surprise. For what need would he have for any military apparatus against us (unless he wishes to force us back to the old error by some force), than to strive to undermine Swiss freedom or to utterly destroy the holy church of Constance? They also say that the French King has made a treaty with the Emperor, perhaps for this purpose, so that the Emperor may proceed more successfully in his endeavor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Recently, a Swiss messenger from Augsburg was with us in Memmingen, who openly uttered these words in the public square: "The Emperor will wage a fierce war against the people of Constance. The Five Cantons will support the Emperor and will prepare the way for him and allow him to lead his army freely into their land, to conquer the people of Constance" and similar things; which certainly, if true, your affairs (I speak with sorrow) are in a precarious state. Beware, excellent men, of treachery, if possible, made wiser by our indescribable misfortune! There are those who envy your freedom, won by the blood of your ancestors, which, however, every good man will be allowed to defend to the death. There is a rumor that firearms are being transported from Lower Germany towards Strasbourg, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We are still laboring among our own in the vineyard of the Lord unhindered. The mass priests, however, are moving every stone to harass us. Pray to the Lord for me and our church, that the Lord may not allow us to be torn from the truth in any way. I do not have time to write more. I only want to remind you to prepare your hearts for the assaults of both Satan and the world. May the Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on us and avert his wrath from us, which we do not bear undeservedly. Comfort me, if possible, afflicted in many ways. Otherwise, I am well in body along with my whole family.</p>

      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, and greet your wife very much in my name, Lord Gwalther, Pellican, and Theodor, etc. Given on August 28, 1547. Your old friend.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zurich, dearest lord and brother, old friend, etc. Zurich.</p>
