    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius briefly responds to [No. 2107]. He is not surprised that Bullinger writes only rarely, as he now corresponds with others. Myconius thanks for the [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”]. He will read the document and comment on it as much as possible. - He has only skimmed through Bibliander's [letter] to him and Markus [Bertschi]. He and Bertschi have received [Bibliander's “Relatio fidelis”] from [Johannes] Oporin. Myconius has not been able to read the document due to the busy [Easter] period. However, [Johannes] Gast has explained its content to him based on a letter from Bibliander. Myconius expects good things from both documents. May [the authors] make good use of the wisdom that God has bestowed upon them! [In A:... received from Oporin and are asked to give their opinion on it after the holidays, as the world now has access to it! This is just for fun. Bibliander and Bullinger know that he likes their writings or appreciates them. But they should be careful that the gifts bestowed upon them by God do not become their downfall! Myconius thanks God that he has no reason to boast due to his insignificance, especially since he has observed how outstanding people have fallen deeply. The one who, like Paul, knows that he is insignificant, will hardly go astray as long as Christ means everything to him and he fulfills his duties.] - Bullinger's humorous remark that Myconius has published a catechism is taken well by the latter [In A: Myconius had to laugh at Bullinger's humorous remark that he had published a catechism and not sent it]. He has only translated a few sentences of Oekolampad into Latin. Why should he share so little and especially something foreign with others? So that people can say that Myconius also writes books? Nonsense! [In A instead of “Nonsense!”: The Zurich book forge can no longer be content with the toys of the Holy Scripture. They want to produce something more serious!] Bullinger is influenced by [the mocking spirit of] Momus; Myconius does not take it amiss and rather amuses himself over this joke. - Bullinger should forward the enclosed letter to Constance [A adds: to the Englishman [John] Butler]. - Greetings, also to [Bibliander].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I respond briefly to your brief letter. I am not surprised that you write rarely, since you now have others to whom you always write. I thank you for the gift you sent. I will read it and respond, unless the matter is beyond my understanding. I have only glanced at what Bibliander wrote, as Markus still has the letters. We have received what Oporin ordered to be given. Indeed, I have not yet read it due to the business of this time. There is no doubt that he has worked magnificently. Gast has narrated to me the summary of the entire Commentary from Bibliander's letters. It seems to be something great that he has given. I judge both of you as worthy. The Lord has given you wisdom. Make sure to use it well.</p>
      <p>Your jest about me having published a catechism, I take in good part. I translated three words of Oecolampadius into Latin to the best of my ability. Why do you say that? Do you reproach me for not sending it to you? Why should I send something so small and foreign? To give something new, or to delight you, or to bring you joy that Myconius also writes books? Ridiculous! But some Momus has taught you to jest like this, even if he did not teach you, he has led you by his example. It is far from me to take what you did badly! I am more glad that you jest so nicely with me.</p>
      <p>I ask you, by the Lord, to kindly send the letters attached to yours to Constance, as soon as you can.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and Theodor always. From Basel, hastily, March 19, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned minister of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, to be respected in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
