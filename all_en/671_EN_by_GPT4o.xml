      <p>S. Indeed, it would have been fitting, most learned man, that the more learned leaders of our church would respond to your letters of kindness and at the same time offer some judgment on the mutual agreement of the most learned ministers of your church and the most distinguished man, D. Johannes Calvin, so that they would not return this booklet without any letters at all, especially since they themselves have something to request from you. But everyone offers some excuse as to why they cannot write now. Therefore, so that you do not accuse us of silence and ingratitude, or rather laziness, I will write what I can. First, the reason they retained the booklet longer, which you wished to be returned as soon as possible, is that they finally received it on the 7th of September, although your letters were written eight days earlier. Hence, overwhelmed by the shortness of time, they could not read it more diligently, but only took care to have it copied as quickly as possible, so that they could return it to you with a certain message.</p>
      <p>And they will also share the copy with the other brothers from the countryside, and perhaps later they will subscribe to your subscription, though I doubt it, because I still do not know what their opinions are. I indeed give the greatest thanks to the best and greatest God for the mutual agreement in God and truth, from which I also hope no small benefit will return to our churches and others, and as far as I understand the matter, I am pleased, indeed very pleased (for I have only briefly tasted this writing) with the opinion of this man, who discusses the sacramental matter briefly but most clearly. Would that the ministers of other nations could also agree with you, which would undoubtedly happen if ambition and self-love were not an impediment, indeed if envy itself did not hinder, and if these had not stood in the way until now, concord in religion could have been hoped for long ago, from which the gospel would have certainly obtained the most successful progress, nor would the matter have fallen to the point where the sacred doctrine of the gospel is trampled underfoot. But why do I delay you with many words about these things, which are very well known to you, and who hear more learned things from more learned men? I proceed. D. Zimpertus especially requests, if it could be done, that you send to him the notes you have on the prophet Zechariah; for he promises to copy them as soon as possible and send them to you, who would have written himself, if he were not hindered by other business, and I also ask that my letters in this matter may have as much weight as his, if they were sent to you. Finally, what should I write to you, most kind man, about the state of our republic and church? There was hope that our people would not defect from the magistracy of Zürich and Bern in the matter of the alliance with the French, nor would they do anything different from these, which indeed was the opinion of many good men; but the majority and those who are the worst decided otherwise, as the number of the wicked is always greater than that of the good. But what happened? I am ashamed and embarrassed to write: the pensioners and bloodthirsty men incessantly pressed our magistracy, indeed by the instigation of some of our own people and with the flattery, as such people are accustomed, persuaded them to unanimously enter into an alliance with the French; for this would do much for the preservation of the fatherland and mutual concord. Therefore, our people, alas, after setting aside the best and greatest God, neglecting and despising the faithful admonitions of the ministers of the word, forgetting the benefits bestowed by God on our ancestors, especially in military matters, also unmindful of the injuries and greatest calamities they suffered in alliances with the Pope, the Duke of Milan, the King of France, not considering what will happen further, how long the evil will last, enter into an alliance with the impious, with the most impious, impious and persecutor of Christians, which the Lord himself prohibited to his people in the law, and thus they multiply the penalties of sins and involve themselves in those of others, they invite enemies from elsewhere of their own accord, they annihilate the omnipotence of God, attributing more to French valor, this will be avenged by divine vengeance, if it pleases the gods, indeed it aggravates. In summary, therefore, they have perpetrated such a deed, from which nothing else can be gathered than that the most present wrath of God is pressing upon our shoulders, since he has allowed them to fall into such a grave sin, and this case threatens the deprivation of the word of the gospel. For if in one thing they acted against the manifest word of the Lord knowingly and willingly, for the reason that they might obtain the favor and glory of the world, there is danger, if they were further urged to the denial of Christ, that they would also concede much and too much in that.</p>
      <p>Now sins were to be acknowledged, repentance to be considered, forgiveness of sins to be sought. But what? They rejoice that matters have been brought to such a place, believing that we are now in safety; I fear, therefore, lest that saying of Christ befall us: Woe to those who rejoice, etc., and: When they say peace, etc. Added to this, they do not think they have sinned and defend the most shameful deed and thus finally hardened in sins they will perish. Moreover, few know what this alliance is like and yet they approve it; all take care that the ministers of the word are not made more certain about it; for they know that in some way more can still be deterred from offering themselves as soldiers, so that the alliance may be of no moment, to be persuaded, and perhaps it is so shameful that they did not dare to publish it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, most excellent man, so that it may be possible to act with greater fruit and so much more cautiously in this matter, I ask you, as vehemently as I can, indeed and the others, since the matter of this evil is always accustomed to be communicated to you, to send to us the articles of this alliance and communicate them to us, just as you have never failed us in any matter with your help and advice. Meanwhile, I also ask that you have us all commended to your faith. We will earnestly pray to the Lord, which we trust you will also do, that out of pure mercy he may preserve his word and church, lead sinners to the acknowledgment of sins and save them through faith for Christ's sake, amen. Farewell and kindly consider my writing; for the reason I have used more words about matters otherwise well known to you is because I plainly see the gospel almost preached to stones, since we sin against such manifest truth, and this affects me with the greatest sorrow.</p>
      <p>Given on the 9th of September in the year 1549 in Schaffhausen hastily. Jakob Rüeger, always most devoted to your kindness.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in learning and virtue, D. M. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
