    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer wanted to send the enclosed [not received] letter with the butchers the day before; however, he was too late. After receiving Bullinger's [not received] letter, Blarer decided to inform the people of Zurich with his own messenger that there is no rush in drafting a federal letter for the city assembly. He shares this to avoid unnecessary costs due to a premature convocation of the Confederates. - The messenger's wage [to Zurich and back] amounts to 24 Batzen.</p>

      <p>I wanted to send you the enclosed letter yesterday with our butchers; they were at the gate, but I was only informed of the matter after 9 o'clock. Now that your letter has reached me today, I have long deliberated whether I should send you my own messenger again; because I was concerned, since I wrote to you, that the city assembly would not last long, and I thought they would write to them, that perhaps a cost might be incurred in haste, that perhaps some Confederates would be written to, etc., which was not necessary. For even if one wanted to write immediately, it could still happen over several weeks, so that the Confederates could be gathered with good states. And finally, I considered it most useful, since I otherwise have no unnecessary message, to send you my own messenger, so that perhaps unnecessary costs would not be incurred. Therefore, for God's sake, please take it in good part. I would like to avoid all unnecessary costs; in such doubtful matters, however, I consider it more useful to incur a certain small cost, where one must fear a greater, albeit uncertain, one.</p>
      <p>Dated in haste, on New Year's Day at two o'clock in the afternoon. Each messenger's wage is 12 Batzen, totaling 24 Batzen.</p>
      <p>To my especially beloved lord and brother, Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, to his own hands.</p>
