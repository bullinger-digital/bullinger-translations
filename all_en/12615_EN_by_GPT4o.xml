    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to the war turmoil, Lening could not respond in time. It is also uncertain when this letter will be delivered. He has no news that would be unknown to Bullinger anyway.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Now it concerns all Evangelicals! Therefore, one must stand together against the raging wolves! Bullinger's letter [not received], in which the sympathy of the [Swiss Protestants for the German Protestants] was expressed, pleased Lening's influential friends.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The writing "De sacramentis," which Bullinger sent to Dionysius [Melander], is very much liked by Lening. It should be published! Why hesitate when the Zurichers have already rekindled the dormant fire [of the Lord's Supper dispute] with the new edition of Zwingli's works? Lening hereby sends his "Aphorisms" [on the Lord's Supper] compiled about 14 years ago. From this, it becomes clear that his view is close to that of the Zurichers. If Bullinger considers it useful, he may print this collection of quotes as an appendix to his writing "De sacramentis." Otherwise, it is a testimony of Lening's faith and can serve as an index to his previously sent [“Thorough Report”], which he has since lost.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Many people who were once completely devoted to Luther are less enthusiastic about him. But the people of Meissen, Saxony, and Thuringia still cling to their "Pythagoras" [Luther], even though there are many Nicodemites among them. Nothing harms the truth more than the prohibition to read and freely discuss the Zurich writings. However, Lening thinks like [Martin] Bucer in the dialogue "Arbogast and Sebold" and in the "Apology against the Bishop of Avranches," namely that both camps think the same about the essentials. But with the Zurichers and with Augustine, he believes that Judas did not eat the body of Christ, and with Athanasius, Augustine, and Fulgentius, he recognizes [since the resurrection] only a spiritual presence of Christ on earth. When [Wolfgang] Capito, Bucer, and Bonifacius [Wolfhart] returned from [the negotiations at] Luther [from Wittenberg] and brought the deceptive [Wittenberg] Concord to Melander and Lening in Homberg on behalf of the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse], Lening said in front of everyone that he would not recognize any Concord that does not agree with Oecolampadius' dialogue ["Quid de eucharistia veteres senserint"]. Based on the Holy Scripture, the Lutherans will never be able to refute this dialogue, although it is clearly directed against Philipp [Melanchthon]'s ["Epistola ad Oecolampadium de coena domini"]. If the Lutherans wanted to justify their view in the judgment of posterity, they would have to write such a refutation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- If Bullinger publishes his writing ["De sacramentis"], he should append [Oecolampadius'] "Dialogue" to his booklet, as its [reprint] would be welcome to many.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The Latin Zurich Bible should also [again] be printed in a small format.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings to Gwalther and the colleagues. Greetings from Melander.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, our Savior. The war turmoil, dearest Bullinger, prevents me from responding to you in time; moreover, I am uncertain when this letter will finally be delivered to you. Therefore, I cannot write anything certain about the war that I do not think has already been conveyed to you by other messengers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The matter concerns all Evangelicals. Therefore, you, Swiss preachers, will do as much as you can to unite our forces with God against the raging wolves. We will not fail to encourage and urge our people to do the same. I have shared your letters with many friends, and they were all pleased with your inclination towards us. We still hope for better outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Meanwhile, as I carefully reread and consider the chapters and marginal notes of your book "De sacramentis" sent to Dionysius, I am so pleased with them that I strongly wish for the book to be published. Why hesitate to release it after Zwingli's works have already been published, reigniting the dormant fire? To show how closely Lening has aligned with you, here you have his Aphorisms, which he compiled for this purpose almost 14 years ago. If you think they will be useful to your brothers, I have no objection to them being published alongside your book. If you think otherwise, you will still have a testimony of my faith and an index of my booklet previously sent to you, which I have since lost.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Many among us, who were once very devoted to Luther, are now becoming more moderate and returning to the right path. But the people of Meissen, Saxony, and Thuringia still cling diligently to their "Pythagoras," although many Nicodemites can be found among them. In summary: Nothing has so far hindered the knowledge of the truth as much as the lack of free judgment and the inability to read your writings as freely as others. I believe, like Bucer in his Dialogue of Arbogast and Sebold, in the Apology against the Bishop of Avranches, that both sides think the same about the essentials. Otherwise, with you and Augustine, I deny that Judas ate the body of Christ orally; I do not recognize any other presence of Christ on earth than a spiritual one with Athanasius, Augustine, Fulgentius, and others. Certainly, when Capito, Bucer, and Bonifacius returned from Luther to Dionysius and me in Homberg, Hesse, by order of our prince, bringing that deceptive concord (which has always avoided the light), I freely said in front of everyone that I would not recognize or accept any concord that does not agree with Oecolampadius' Dialogue. I would be damned if a thousand and a thousand Lutherans reading it twice or thrice could truly understand it. And I am amazed that, although this dialogue explicitly opposes Philipp's opinion and booklet, no one among all the Lutherans has yet been found who dared to refute it with solid scriptures and just reasons. However, they will have to do so if they want their opinion to be preserved for posterity (which always tends to have a better judgment).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>If you are going to publish your book, ensure that this Dialogue is appended to it again; it is desired by many.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I wish for your Latin Bible to be printed in a handbook format with the smallest letters available there, so it can be carried around.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell in Christ, dearest brother. Greet Gwalther and all the brothers in my name. Dionysius sends his greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Given in Melsungen, September 5, 1546. Johannes Lening, minister of the word in Melsungen, Hesse.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church in Zurich, his dearest brother in Christ. To [his own] hands.</p>
