      <p>It often happens that those who rarely write letters to friends make them more valuable and pleasant because they usually write about very necessary matters. This can indeed be said of us in these times, most illustrious and pious men. We know that we have neglected the custom of writing to you about our affairs because in recent years we have been so agitated and troubled by storms of disturbances that we were entirely occupied with considering where the judgments of the Lord were directed and turning. However, we ceased from the duty of writing in such a way that we never forgot you and the calamities of the churches of Christ in our private and public prayers. For with just and pious sorrow, we look upon the affliction and oppression of the kingdom of God, whose perpetual fate and condition is to be under the cross, but meanwhile, piety flourishes and takes such deep roots that it grows immensely. Therefore, as it is fitting for us to be participants in your afflictions, so we fully believe that you, being informed of our dangers and future calamities, wish to sympathize with us and be present with every duty of piety. King Sigismund Augustus died two years ago, during whose life the door was opened to punishments and calamities for the contempt of the word of God and heinous crimes by God, the best and greatest, the most just avenger. An interregnum followed, during which we expected the scourge of divine wrath and the most miserable chaos of this kingdom. But the heavenly Father delayed and postponed the execution of his dreadful judgment and spared a little, if only our people would return to a right mind. Since all these things have been done by the inscrutable judgment of God, He is to be adored and revered, who in this way wished to reveal the hearts of many. And without a doubt, since the heap of vices and crimes has grown strong, it is now to be believed that a certain and sad calamity is impending at our doors. For are we better than the other peoples of Europe? Indeed, we are worse. For while we enjoyed the utmost peace and quiet, there was no one who sincerely repented, so all began to give themselves over to vanities and all pomp and luxury and to indulge most shamefully, so that nothing could be more arrogant and luxurious than the people of our nation, of whatever sex and condition they may be. We then add countless corruptions, justice is silent, laws are mute, everything is done by favors and grace, everything is feigned and nothing is sincere. Thus the tares have grown so that they expect nothing else than the final harvest, when they can be uprooted and burned by the Lord...</p>
      <p>As it had been indicated to you, a public distribution and collection could not be made due to the countless Corycaeans who observe each of our actions, and since these things should be done in some public synod, it is hardly safe to convene such public assemblies. We can promise nothing certain about private individuals, so it is not permissible to think about either remedy, as everything seems to be rushing to worse. Therefore, we pray that you may be so persuaded of our will, as it is fitting for your fraternal benevolent spirit towards us, so that if it could be done through the iniquity of the times and the impiety of men, we would by no means wish to fail the brothers in healing their wounds and alleviating their poverty. And lest you think we complain in vain about the most sorrowful aspect of the times, we also wish to inform you that in recent days the church of God, militant here on earth, has been bereaved of an upright senator and a most loving supporter and constant patron of piety, namely the illustrious and most noble man Lord Johann Firlej, Palatine of Kraków and supreme marshal of the kingdom, than whom there was no stronger man in defending the truth in these times, so that the republic itself has lost its greatest ornament and its most ardent defender of its liberties. What and how great this grief is and how much damage and wound has been inflicted on the church and the republic by the death of such a man, you can judge for yourselves according to your piety and prudence. Therefore, you can perceive, when such most excellent men depart from life, what these things portend. But may God, in His gentleness, wish to avert all such unfortunate things from us and at least raise up from these remnants that still remain, that is, from their posterity, who may respond to their ancestors and those most valiant men in piety and zeal.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we earnestly ask that you take care to imbue the noble youths born of the illustrious Myszkowski family in true piety and good arts, so that they may someday fill the place of so many most illustrious men and best senators and not degenerate from their piety and virtue.</p>
      <p>For our Polish youth is so flexible and slippery that it easily allows itself to be carried away by the sight of human wealth and splendor. Nor do we say this in vain, for we know that their uncle, the Bishop of Płock, abounding in riches, will lay snares for them when they return from the academies, and will set these nets for them, in which he had already entangled and ensnared the elder, unless he had been drawn and torn away by his father, a good man and the best cultivator of piety. We believe that you, with your singular prudence, industry, and care, which you have for the youth, will take care of these things, and we pray that God may bless you in this.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, since our most beloved brother, Mr. Christophorus Tretius, a man of exceptional piety and learning and well-deserving of our Sarmatian churches, most dear to us for his faith and industry and most beloved to you for the same virtues, was about to set out to you, it was the reason that we did not commit many things to our letters, which it is expedient to be known both publicly and privately. We preferred to entrust all these things to his faith and integrity as our most faithful messenger, rather than include them in these letters. From him, therefore, you will receive many and various things most worthy of your knowledge, to whom you owe faith as to the best brother, and in return, we hope for knowledge of various things from you, which will bring, and then certain instructions, which we can use in our future dangers and calamities. We will receive these as the most present antidotes against the raging madness of this world and the stratagems of the devil. Farewell, dearest brothers in Christ, and let us with one mind implore with pure hearts the help of the supreme deity, that He may heal the most deplorable diseases of this age and be present or rather hasten His day for the redemption of the church. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given at Kraków, the first of June, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted brother in the Lord and most observant of you, Paul Gilowski, superintendent of the Reformed churches in the Duchy of Zator and Oświęcim in his own name and in the name of other ministers and senior brothers.</p>
      <p>Andreas Praszmovius, minister of the word of God and superintendent in his own name and in the name of other ministers and senior brothers.</p>
