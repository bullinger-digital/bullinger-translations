      <p>S. I write hastily, because at the same time, given the opportunity, I must write to several people. Regarding the Diet of Augsburg, I read the proposals by King Ferdinand, in which he first laments the torn unity of Germany, especially in numerous articles of religion; unless this is restored, the state cannot be safe in any way, etc. And indeed, the remedy often considered by the Imperial Majesty and the ancient orders, even with their support, has come to the decision of holding a legitimate council, etc. But what delays have intervened is quite clear to everyone, and because the same effort to establish a consenting form of religion is still as necessary as ever, if they indeed wish for common safety to be restored and promoted, it must be deliberated whether the controversies should be referred again to a general council, and if this is approved, by what means it should be ensured that the undertaking is not interrupted, or whether a formula of concord should be sought again through discussions among learned men, as before, throughout Germany; for nothing can be done about a national council. Then indeed, it must be discussed about preserving the peace of Germany against certain disturbers (by which he alluded to Albert and the like) and about the authority of the imperial chamber over such matters. These proposals were made on February 5th, and because neither the princes nor the envoys of the princes had come prepared with counsel for the unforeseen article of deliberation on religion. Those sent by the sons of the late Elector John Frederick said they had no instructions from their princes on these matters and the like, except to openly profess that their princes would stand by the confession and the Passau agreement and would let happen what may. Duke Christoph of WÃ¼rttemberg responded the same, who departed from Augsburg homeward on the 8th day, soon followed by the Bavarian, who also returned to his own.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, however, the King urges the Palatine and others to be present; but whether the Diet will reconvene by the first of May (as rumor has it) is not yet certain, and perhaps the plans will proceed less due to the warlike movements in Saxony, where an army is being assembled on one side by the Margraves, the Duke of Mecklenburg, the King of Denmark, and several cities on the Baltic Sea, and on the other side by Heinrich of Brunswick, to whom two wagons loaded with money have been brought from somewhere. It is said that he is already gathering 3,000 cavalry to fight against the enemies over the Bishopric of Hildesheim, into which he had thrust his son after ousting the brother of the Duke of Holstein. The Emperor has brought 10 banners of soldiers into Antwerp to keep the citizens under control, who had begun to bear the too burdensome exactions with more indignation, and also against the nascent religion of ours; the condition of that city seems likely to be the same as that of Ghent. The King of England is said to be coming to Brussels to succeed his father in the governance of Lower Germany; for many affirm that Charles will return to Spain through England, because he cannot endure the cold and intemperance of the German air. The Queen of England and Spain is said to have been greeted by Reginald Pole with the words of Elizabeth: "Hail, Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with you, blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb." Behold, flattery more than Gnatonic.</p>
      <p>However, regarding what you ask about Calvin's writing, I only respond that it seems to me he has briefly recalled what was previously brought forward in the midst of the controversy about the sacraments from this side, and that somewhat harshly due to the vehemence of his nature, perhaps also incited by the harshness of some writer I do not know. Certainly of Westphalia, whose writing I have not seen and would scarcely have read even if offered; so much do I abhor from pugnacious pamphlets in this kind of argument, having long been sated to the point of nausea by these contentions. However, I fear that a fire may break out on both sides not without grave scandal, unless the Lord tempers it with His mighty hand. I pray with mine (which is all I can do) that, until we can feel and speak the same and be one in Him, who we profess to be crucified, all of us.</p>
      <p>I understand that another controversy is being stirred up in the name of predestination by Cavin, and that the fire of contention is also flaring up among the brothers of the Bernese dominion in Savoy, incited by a certain Zebedee from Gelderland, who was also not the least author of that storm in the church concerning ministry and symbols, which drove me and others from our homeland. So much does Satan not rest. I will deal with friends in Bern by urging, as much as I can, that they timely meet the impending evil; for I understand from some that these conflicts will be more odious and perhaps more dangerous than the previous ones. You, my Bullinger, if you can do anything in this matter, I know you will be vigilant. Farewell. Basel, March 7, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
