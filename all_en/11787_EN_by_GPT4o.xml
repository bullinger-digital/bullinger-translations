    <p xml:id="regest1">The attempt by his opponent Adam [Heinricher] to ruin his reputation with the help of biased witnesses has failed; after an initial judgment on March 8th was in favor of Ritter, the council also dismissed the slanderer's appeal on April 6th. Since Ritter insisted on legal proceedings despite pleas on April 11th, his opponent was sentenced to retract the accusations under oath and to bear the costs; however, the 40 guilders awarded to Ritter only just cover his expenses. Subsequently, the slanderer managed to be admitted to the ministry without Ritter's knowledge, unjustly comparing his case to that of Nikolaus [...] in Aarberg; in view of such opposition, Ritter seeks advice on whether he should resign from his office, fearing, however, that the church will suffer damage, regardless of his decision. Greetings. Kaspar [Megander] has repeatedly urged for annual synods, but this seems dangerous to Ritter, as most pastors in the countryside tend to a Lutheran-influenced use of the sacraments; furthermore, the French-speaking Bernese and Aargau pastors are pushing for the introduction of excommunication, which could affect opponents of Lutheran doctrine; Ritter suspects, based on the report of a scribe [Eberhard von RÃ¼mlang?], machinations within the council.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>My case, full of grave offenses and dangers, has finally come to an end, dearest brothers. I call it grave because the opponents were powerful and diligent, leaving nothing untried in their administration of advice and assistance to bring me to infamy. The dangers were no less due to the witnesses' long-standing envy against me, stemming from the rejection of the mass, idols, and the entirety of papism, as they are still papists. Therefore, anyone can judge how much danger I was in. As for the offense, there is nothing to say, as the scoundrel has almost filled all of Germany. However, on the eighth of March, the first sentence was pronounced (after the testimonies were heard) with these words: "the so-called Mr. Adam" (thus the opponent is called) "with the heard acquaintances of his undertaking, according to the content of the first abandoned document, has shown nothing"; from which the opponent appealed to the council, and thus it was postponed until the 6th of April. The council gave this sentence: "After my lords have heard acquaintances, speech, and counter-speech, they have recognized that those of the outer court (the city court) have judged well and you" (turning to the slanderer) "have appealed badly."</p>
      <p>Finally, on the eleventh of April, when the miserable man had lost all hope and feared more that if the matter came to the sixty and the diakosios, he would receive a more severe sentence, he made the power to judge, but first, with knees bent, he begged that I would not compel him to an oath; this too the judges requested in the name of the council, since he had first appealed to the council; but I, for many reasons, steadfastly refused, wanting the law to be spoken, which was done with such a sentence, "that the respondent (defendant) should stand there and with a raised oath (under oath) should absolve me and say that everything he has spoken against Mr. Erasmus, he has invented and lied and knows nothing else of him than of an honorable man." He satisfied this sentence and confirmed it to be true by oath. Then he was also ordered by law to pay all expenses. But I, not wanting to seem harsh, who have allowed nothing to be decided that pertains to honor, called some of the judges and presented the account in their presence, entrusting to them from the ready money and their judgment whatever they would decide; they determined that he should return 40 guilders, although I have almost spent that much more.</p>
      <p>But what can I say? While all these things were thus transacted, he, without my knowledge, in the absence of Negelin, Graffenried, and Sepin, and some others, obtained admission to the ministry after such an infamous recantation. This is a most certain sign of what kind of opponents I have had, although they disguise this act with the deed of Nikolaus in Aarberg, who are very different among themselves, neither is the reason for the case the same nor the similarity in recantation. Therefore, seeing such incredible hatred, that they have no regard for the word, the ministry, or even public honor, I seek your advice on whether it is permissible to leave this church and depart, if perhaps another (but he must be faithful and steadfast) is substituted in my place. I am almost crushed under this burden.</p>
      <p>I beg you, do not conceal your advice from me, for I stand between the sacred and the stone. There is danger on both sides: If I leave, the church is left to those who are not safe, as they have openly revealed the serpent they have nurtured; if I stay, I fear, since they are so obstinate, that it may eventually lead to a most dangerous outcome.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brothers, and pray to God for me unceasingly. From Bern, April 23, 1543.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>My dearest brother Gaspar has now reminded me several times that a synod should be held annually; but I fear many inconveniences that may arise from this.</p>
      <p>First, the brothers in the countryside are so infected that few have not been drawn into the Lutheran opinion, wanting the sacraments to be administered to the dying, baptism to infants if they are even slightly in danger of life, and the Lord's Supper to adults. Furthermore, the French-speaking brothers along with our Aargau pastors aspire to excommunication, to which I cannot yet give my vote in such a great doctrinal crisis; for it is certain that all who would oppose the Lutheran opinion would be excommunicated by our Germans - I do not speak here of the Aargau - and I, who am alone in the city, have few in the countryside, can sustain nothing. Meanwhile, I sense a trick, as if the council is considering this against the will of the synod, although I have learned nothing certain from any of the senators, but I suspect it to be the machination of someone whose scribe's writing you, Gaspar, were offended by; for I have likewise understood from that scribe that it was done so that the greater part by multitude would overcome the better. Therefore, consult and write back, but with a faithful messenger.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men Heinrich Bullinger and Gaspar Megander, most vigilant pastors of the renowned church of Zurich, dearest brothers.</p>
