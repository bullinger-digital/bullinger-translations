      <p>Greetings. I have been waiting for a long time for your response regarding the university matter, about which I had written; but in vain. I still ask, do not deprive me of the joy that will come from it.</p>
      <p>We are still fighting with death; from the passing of boys and young men, I receive an incredible amount of comfort. Those who can barely speak invoke the name of Christ and say they will joyfully dwell with Him henceforth. Those who are older speak in such a way that those standing around are amazed and give thanks to the Lord.</p>
      <p>From this, I know that the gospel of Christ has been mercifully given to us at this time. Believe me, I am not ordinarily strengthened by it against the temptations of the world and Satan. How many they are, you can clearly understand from your neighbors, as I have understood. Good men write from France that the Emperor will cross into Lower Germany in the coming spring; the Duke of Orléans will marry the Emperor's daughter and will be the future lord of Milan; the Archbishop of Rouen has recently been made a cardinal, so that there are now 12 cardinals in France. Similarly, in Spain, the Pope acts to bind all to himself. He gave his son in marriage to a Florentine widow and sought to join the children of France to his own. Those whom he holds bound by religion, he also unites to himself through alliances and the benefits of dignities. Yet these things do not frighten me.</p>
      <p>The clerics of Minden recently asked the Speyer Chamber to give them executors of the ban: the bishops of Cologne, Trier, Münster, Minden, the Dukes of Brunswick, Georg Schenck, the Emperor's vicar in Friesland. There is a rumor that Ferdinand, the Pole, and the Voivode will meet in Vienna, elsewhere the Emperor, the Frenchman, and the Pope, to seriously discuss oppressing the Lutherans. Our people should indeed be vigilant and see that we join plans in the Lord to the doctrines of faith and pious works; otherwise, I do not know what will eventually become of us.</p>
      <p>However, I am somehow moved by the fact that Ferdinand is said to have renounced the tithes of the Abbey of Stein. Suspicions trouble me against our cohabitants; but I mitigate them, as I have understood the matter only from vague rumor.</p>
      <p>You, if there is anything, can inform me more certainly. The Anabaptists have raised a new king in Lower Germany; but he is said to have been captured and beheaded. The news about the expelled Bishop of Münster is false.</p>
      <p>Make sure, my venerable Heinrich, that we meet in the Lord, so that together and unanimously we may be able to pray to the Lord for the defense of His church and also, if necessary, to fight successfully with word and arms. Amen.</p>
      <p>Hastily, Basel, December 26, 1538. Your entirely, Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy minister of the word, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich, very venerable in his Lord.</p>
