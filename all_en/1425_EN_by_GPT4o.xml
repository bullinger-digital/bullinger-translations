      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received your letter along with the enclosed booklet belonging to the one from Kassel, and we have understood its contents. It has been sent off; as soon as we have a messenger to him, the mentioned booklet will be sent to him. The booklet that you intend to send to the royal majesty of France, since you understand that the persecutions there have been renewed, regarding your writing, we kindly inform you that we have written from France, but there is no mention of any persecution. It might not be unhelpful for your improvement of the matter if you had more specific and better information beforehand, and then decided what the Lord would give and admonish through His spirit, not to let this booklet go out, in case the Almighty might send something in this matter.</p>
      <p>Regarding Magdeburg, we know and hope nothing else than that it is still well and right.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg has been admonished by us and others before, that they should open their eyes as we think is appropriate; but to them (we know nothing else) as to those from Augsburg, nothing else has been imposed. And we understand that if those from Augsburg were not themselves the instigators and cause, it should still be left aside for the time being.</p>
      <p>The council in Trent has been postponed until the coming May; may the Lord advance it to His praise.</p>
      <p>Parma is still besieged; but France is said to have taken almost all the places belonging to that upper region, and to have considerable progress there for the time being.</p>
      <p>Regarding our lord cousins, their Graces have been returned the two fortresses of Schorndorf and Kirchheim unter Teck, and the Italian troops are to leave the land; so nothing has been imposed on their Graces concerning the preachers. May the Lord grant further grace to preserve and advance His church.</p>
      <p>We did not want to withhold our gracious opinion from you. Given in Basel on the 7th of October in the year etc. 51.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
