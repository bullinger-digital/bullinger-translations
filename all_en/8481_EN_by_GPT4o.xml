      <p>S. Your letter was delightful to me for two reasons, honorable man. First, because you so kindly mention peace and concord, which has been the sole pursuit of my entire life. I want not myself, but you, who have been familiar to me since childhood, to be witnesses of how truly I say this, from whose number perhaps... some may be.</p>
      <p>The second reason is that you openly share your judgment about my examination, and believe me, speaking seriously, nothing could have happened to me at this time that I would have wished for more. I greatly value that what is contained therein pleases you, and I do not refuse to render it more abundantly, in which purpose I would seem to have almost accomplished everything, if not for the request of some brothers.</p>
      <p>For some from Savoy request that I add topics on predestination, providence, church discipline, excommunication, etc. If I follow them, the booklet, which I wished not to exceed the size of a handbook, would become too... large.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am stuck on what I should do. Some request that I add non-controversial topics, which, while I search for them, I hardly find any; so much has the Christian matter gone into controversy and contention. I have treated the topic of the Lord's Supper more extensively, which I also wished to publish separately if necessary; however, it will not harm if the topic, controversial today, is added in a brief order.</p>
      <p>But what about adoration, images, and others? In summary: the intention is not to touch on everything in this brevity of the poem, so that it remains a booklet and does not become a book, etc. But I would gladly use your judgment in all other matters, whom I have always esteemed greatly and still respect due to your age and learning.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, 1571.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Benedikt Marti.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful servant of Christ in the church of ZÃ¼rich and his piously esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Benedikt Marti of Bern, February 1571.</p>
