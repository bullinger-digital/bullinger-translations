    <p xml:id="regest1">Since there was previously no reliable courier available, Calvin is only writing now. For the envoy from Zurich [Andreas Schmid] is supposed to be in Geneva, and he does not want to let him leave again without a letter for Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">He does not address Bullinger's long and careful response to his opinion [on the writing "De sacramentis"]. There is indeed no reason to argue! In his opinion, at Bullinger's request (as a service to a friend!), he noted everything that he did not like, that might displease others, and that could meet with disapproval from pious scholars. Bullinger is welcome to have a different opinion on this. It will certainly not be the last time that Calvin wishes for greater harmony between the two of them... For him, the view that Christ is conveyed through the sacraments is more important than for Bullinger. But that does not change the fact that they believe in the same Christ and are united in him! Perhaps one day there will be greater agreement.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Calvin always valued clear words more than sophistry and was praised for this clarity of expression even by those who accuse others of ambiguity. He never pretends anything just to please people. Therefore, he cannot be accused of deceit! His understandable teaching method allows neither suspicion nor the accusation of ambiguity. After all, Calvin strives to teach orthodoxly and sincerely. Although he does not meet with approval from everyone equally, one should be lenient with him for that reason. It was therefore surprising for him when he recently learned in Basel through a friend [Oswald Myconius?] about the complaint from Zurich that he represented a different doctrine in his commentary [on the First Epistle to the Corinthians] than he had assured them. To this, only this: He does not express himself differently in Geneva than in Zurich. Wherever this accusation may come from: He prefers to assume a misunderstanding on the part of the friend. Until now, despite all dangers, he has never deviated from expressing his opinion clearly, so that through his explanations, which are in harmony with his deepest conviction, he might induce even the most stubborn to some leniency. Why should he now abandon this attitude without compelling reason? However, if he cannot win people over to his view, it is enough for him to know that God [someday] will testify to the correctness of his confession.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The envoy [Schmid] will be able to report more extensively and better on the situation in France than is possible in a letter. If only it were more pleasing! In fact, one hears only bad news day after day. Undoubtedly, [Schmid] (although he presumably had instructions to avoid all the papist filth) had no choice but to watch the disgraceful desecration of baptism.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings, especially to Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and the other pastoral colleagues and schoolteachers. Blessings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[P.S.:] Calvin's colleagues send their regards. Many greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, n√©e Adlischwyler] and family.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I scarcely know what has prevented me from responding to you sooner, except that no reliable messenger had yet presented himself to prompt my diligence. But now, having heard that the envoy from your city is here, I did not wish to let him depart without my letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I pass over in silence that lengthy response in which you attempt to refute everything I had advised you on with great care. For what is the point of disputing between us? In your book, I had noted things that either did not please me, might displease others, or that I doubted would be approved by pious and learned men. I did this at your request, fulfilling the duty of a friend. If you think otherwise, you are free to do so. Indeed, it would not be the least of my wishes for us to be in complete agreement. However, although I hold that the communication of Christ in the sacraments is greater than you express in your words, we will not cease to have the same Christ and be one in Him. Perhaps one day we will be able to come to a fuller agreement.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have always loved candor. I do not delight in sophistry. And those who accuse others of obscurity praise me for my clarity. Therefore, no cunning can be imputed to me, as I do not feign anything astutely to gain favor. My method of teaching is simpler than to admit any sinister suspicion, and more explicit than to offend under the name of obscurity. If I do not satisfy others equally, leniency should be granted, because I strive to profess with good faith and sincere candor what has been given to me. Therefore, I was recently surprised, when I was in Basel, by your complaint, reported by a friend, that I taught differently in my commentaries than I had promised you. I replied in one word, which was true, that I do not speak differently in Zurich than in Geneva. Although I preferred to attribute this whole matter, whatever it was, to the error of the one who narrated it. Since it was dangerous for me to profess clearly what I felt, I have not deviated from the straight line, so that by speaking freely and consistently from the innermost sense of my mind, I might lead even the most rigid to some moderation. Why would I now change both my counsel and mind without any necessity? But if I cannot persuade people, I will be content with God as the witness of my confession.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Your envoy will report more extensively and better on the affairs of France than I can encompass in letters. Would that they were such as you would gladly hear! But nothing is brought daily except sad news. Although he was ordered to abstain from all the filth of the papacy, he certainly could not avoid witnessing the disgraceful profanation of holy baptism.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell, distinguished man and brother in the Lord, much esteemed. Please diligently greet in my name Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and the other pastoral colleagues and schoolteachers. May the Lord Jesus guide you with His Spirit, bless your pious labors, and keep you safe! Geneva, the first of March, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>

      <p>My colleagues also send their respectful greetings. Many greetings to your wife and family.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, beloved brother and colleague.</p>
