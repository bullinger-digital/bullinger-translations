      <p>Greetings. The messenger did not find me at home when he brought your letters. As a result, I have not replied. I was delighted by what you shared, and shortly after, I received similar news from the assemblies and elsewhere. The Italian or Roman war will bring great evil to the Christian world unless God averts it. It is said that a very well-equipped Turkish fleet is about to set sail from Constantinople to aid the Pope, a worthy patron and defender of the Antichrist. Therefore, we are joining forces with this very expedition, which is a scandal to all the wise, and I fear it will lead to the certain ruin of our common homeland.</p>
      <p>This is indeed the arm on which the French rely, disregarding the powerful and fortified cities of Tuscany, as they doubt nothing about securing free navigation by sea with the help of the Turkish fleet, once they have settled their affairs in Rome or the Kingdom of Naples. Meanwhile, those who are handed over to the tyrant and devastator will lament, their fields will be ravaged, and they will be taken captive as usual. Thus, we declare ourselves the most Christian, the defenders of the church, and even some of us as evangelicals. The people of Augsburg, as you may not know, are convinced that they and the other cities of Germany will have free religion. They recently presented a supplicatory booklet to the legates at the assemblies, with the advice and instigation to the imperial orders. There are those among the Austrians who claim that things are going well, despite Ferdinand's procrastination. If they stand firm, it is certain that some other lords not far from us will seriously attempt the same endeavor.</p>
      <p>This is all I have to write to you at present, my dear Bullinger. The bearer of this letter is a man not unlearned in languages and arts; he has worked as a corrector and now offers himself to the ecclesiastical ministry. Since he cannot be employed with us due to the foreign language, he has decided to approach the Rhaetians, as he professes to be proficient in the Italian language, and he will seek your most pious assistance and patronage for his purpose. I do not recommend him to you more verbosely, knowing that you are already most willing. I will not fail the young man commended by you; if anything can be done by my efforts, he will feel that your authority has had weight with me, as it rightly should. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 28, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
