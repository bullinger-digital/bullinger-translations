      <p>Greetings. There was nothing at this time, most illustrious man and father in Christ, most highly esteemed, about which I could write a letter specifically. However, since the noble Schorzius was about to make a journey to you for the sake of visiting the city and inspecting your church and school, with Mr. Ietzler as his companion, so that both might have the opportunity to address your humanity, I wanted to send at least this note along with them. Mr. Ietzler, who is not unknown to you, does not need much introduction from me; indeed, I uniquely love him and hold him in high regard as a man adorned with singular learning, piety, modesty, judgment, and briefly, all virtues. I hope with the greatest joy in the Lord that he alone among the students of the Schaffhausen church will be a special light to our homeland. One thing is lacking for him, namely that he is not yet recognized by the unlearned and due to the inconvenience of the times, he has not yet been advanced to the place where he would be most worthy above others. But the Lord, who regards the humble, will exalt him at His appointed and predetermined time. As for Mr. Schorzius, if he uses Ietzler as a teacher, there is no doubt that he will strive to follow him in the praise of learning and virtues. Since both are such, I earnestly ask you to kindly look upon them in person and allow them to hear your most pleasant and salutary advice.</p>
      <p>This favor will be as pleasing to me as it will be to them.</p>
      <p>Farewell. In my name and in the name of my brothers, you will respectfully greet all the fellow ministers and brothers who are with you. Our consuls and fellow ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>Given on the 2nd of June in the year 1571.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant leader of the ZÃ¼rich church, his friend and father in Christ, most highly esteemed.</p>
