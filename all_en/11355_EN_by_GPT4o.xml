    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not received a letter from him for several months. Two English refugees are waiting in Zurich for better times, while a former boarder of Bullinger's from England, who accompanied them, has returned for business reasons. King [Henry VIII], likely instigated by the bishops [John Stokesley] of London, [Stephen Gardiner] of Winchester, and others, has issued godless articles of faith; Bishop Hugh Latimer of Worcester and [Nicholas Shaxton] of Salisbury were deposed because they refused to accept them, [Thomas Cranmer] of Canterbury is probably a hypocrite, others comply out of fear, and many flee to Denmark and the Hanseatic cities. Johannes Caesarius wrote from Cologne [No. 1306] that the books of the Evangelicals had been banned there, but were still being read secretly. Dionysius Melander, pastor to Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse, reports that the Landgrave is steadily continuing the Reformation; he has given Melander 2000 guilders to establish a library. From the Silesian Zittau, town clerk [Oswald] Pergener wrote that the Reformation is making good progress in Bohemia, Prussia, and Poland. How things stand in East Frisia can be gathered by Vadian from the enclosed letter [from Aquilomontanus, No. 1294].</p>

      <p>I have never been without your letters for as long as I have been these past few months; therefore, it is certain that you are either gravely offended or affected by poor health. If I have offended you in any way, I am unaware, as I always wish to serve you; if you are ill, I am saddened and wish you good health from the Lord. From England, I do not hear very joyful news. Two learned and pious men, refugees and exiles from England, have come to Zürich. One of them, who had been in my company in previous years, came with them; but he has now returned for business reasons. These two are diligently studying sacred literature in Zürich and are hoping for better fortune. The King, driven by hope and struck by fear, indeed seduced by the bishops of London, Winchester, and others, imposes impious articles to be believed and observed... a little note; which, when you have read it, please return. Hugh Latimer, Bishop of Worcester, and the Bishop of Salisbury refused to accept the impious decrees; therefore, they were stripped of their dignity and office. I fear the Archbishop of Canterbury is a hypocrite. Some other bishops, struck by fear, bear the yoke; others, who have always disliked the Gospel, rejoice, reign, and oppress. Many good men flee to Denmark and those cities by the lakes they call. Such are the affairs in England; they hope, however, that things will improve someday. The common people have opened their eyes and can now distinguish between true and false. May God have mercy on them! - Johannes Caesarius from Cologne writes that our books are publicly banned, but secretly and nonetheless eagerly read even by the chief priests. Dionysius Melander, preacher to the Landgrave of Hesse, indicates that the Landgrave is uniquely steadfast in daily advancing the learned and religion; he adds that he has now been given 2000 guilders to prepare a library. From Zittau in Silesia, Pargemerus, the city scribe, writes that the Gospel is being received by many throughout Bohemia, Prussia, Poland, etc. However, you will learn how things stand in East Frisia from the enclosed letters.</p>
