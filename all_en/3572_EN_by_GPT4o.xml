      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter, my father, is a pious and learned man, whom I ask you to assist with your advice and help, as much as possible, in the small matter he has undertaken to manage there. Regarding our affairs, I believe you have been informed about the third journey I undertook last month to Germany, not only at the request of the French churches but also compelled by necessity itself, although both my own will and the need to care for my health strongly deterred me from undertaking this journey.</p>
      <p>For besides being in poor health, having suffered almost the entire month of February from diarrhea, I also realized what fruit had returned to me from my previous labors, namely this one (which I do not hesitate to unload into your bosom as a friend), that while I strive with more zeal than prudence to remedy the public ills of the church, a concern I have always considered to pertain to me, however weak a member I may be, I have achieved only this: to incur the offenses of those whom I least wished to offend.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my sole intention was to remain at home and manage my private affairs in such a way that it would be apparent to all from the outcome itself that I sought nothing less than the material and argument for either some small glory or sowing discord among brothers (from which thought may the Lord avert me). Yet the prayers of afflicted brothers weighed more with me than my private reasons. For since the Cardinal of Lorraine had persuaded the German princes through his emissaries that there was no reason to send envoys to the king, who had already ceased all persecution of his own accord, while at the same time the most cruel edict of the Spanish Inquisition was being promulgated in France, my brothers thought it was entirely their duty, since I had obtained the promise of sending an embassy from the German princes on the previous journey, to remind them of their promise and to refute the lies of the adversaries before them. So I went to Frankfurt with our Budaeus, where the Lord granted us such favor in the eyes of the Christian princes that we hope our journey will not be useless to the wretched brothers. For we obtained this, that they finally recognized they had been most shamefully deceived by the adversaries and seriously, if ever before, wrote to the king. May the Lord therefore open the king's eyes and grant relief to the wretched brothers! Regarding the election of Ferdinand and other such matters, of which I was indeed an unwilling and sad spectator, I write nothing, since I do not doubt that you have already learned all these things abundantly from others.</p>
      <p>I met with no theologians at all except Diller, who is with the Palatine, and Merpachius. In Diller's hands, I saw a booklet written by Philippus, in which he explicitly criticizes Westphalus and others of his faction for placing the body of Christ in the bread and openly attacks ubiquity. I can testify to this, which I saw and read, albeit through an interpreter, whose fidelity I do not doubt; for it was written in German and addressed to the German princes.</p>
      <p>What will happen, I do not know; but I know the princes are now entirely focused on settling the disputes stirred up among themselves, hopefully in such a way that truth alone prevails! I spoke freely with Merpachius about that unfortunate writing in which Zwingli's doctrine, as they say, is not approved. They respond that they could not have done otherwise to avoid greater disturbances, and that not approving is not the same as condemning. Furthermore, the doctrine that is called Zwinglian seems to be of such a nature that even we would not approve it, as it is perhaps unjustly attributed to Zwingli himself.</p>
      <p>I replied what I know you would have approved if you had been present at our conversation. In summary: I wish that opportunities for offense on both sides would be seized less eagerly and not be increased, but rather that these injuries be overlooked with holy connivance, as far as possible, rather than spread. For as far as I am concerned, I do not even now despair of laying the foundations of concord, if the Lord grants that a colloquy be held. I know you see it differently and that there are strong reasons for your opinion; but I hope you will grant me the freedom of judgment here. Meanwhile, what I promised you in person, I will faithfully and willingly fulfill, to remember the place I hold in the church of God and leave these matters to others to manage. The princes we approached were: the Palatine, the Saxon, the Brandenburgian, the W端rttembergian, the Zweibr端cken, and the Baden, all of whom were in Frankfurt; we only saw and greeted the ministers of the Saxon and Brandenburgian, but they did not give us letters. Regarding our churches.</p>
      <p>Nothing was closer to happening than for our Viretus to leave us, although he certainly would not have left us, as we would have followed him to the ends of the earth. From this, you can infer how close our churches were to the ultimate crisis. But the Lord willed otherwise; for the princes heard him much more kindly than some factious and wicked people imagined, and they solemnly promised to make efforts to establish some order of discipline in our churches at last.</p>
      <p>We now await what will come of these promises; for we all depend on this outcome. Therefore, pray to the Lord on our behalf, my father, if ever before, that He may suggest to the princes those things on which not so much our own safety and well-being as that of our churches depends; for it is impossible for us to remain here much longer unless the unbridled wickedness of most is restrained by some stricter discipline. But about these things, perhaps more copiously another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father.</p>
      <p>I wish D. Martyr and the other brothers to be greatly greeted, with whom I also hope you will share what pertains to our embassy. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe and sound and bless your holy labors more and more! Lausanne, April 19.</p>
      <p>Theodorus Beza, truly yours.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of God, D. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful minister of the church of Z端rich and my most esteemed father. In Z端rich.</p>
