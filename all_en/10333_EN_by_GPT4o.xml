      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Christian Hochholzer sends greetings to his most esteemed lord and father.</p>
      <p>Although the magnitude of your benefits towards me is so great, venerable father - for you alone are in the place of a father to me - that I can achieve no part of your merits towards me, not only in returning but even in contemplating gratitude, nevertheless, because I have always felt you to be a supporter and patron of all scholars and especially of myself, I have not disdained to ask greater things from you - through letters, the better - not because I attribute so much authority to myself with you, but because I have found you so benevolent that you desire to do good to all. The reason I speak with you through letters is twofold: First, so that I might speak with you better and more thoughtfully, and secondly, to exercise my style. Since now almost a year has completed its full course, from which by your mere grace and benevolence I began to be counted among your household, and since the year now approaches its end, it seemed best to approach you with the highest prayers and ask that if it can be done in any way, you might again allow me to be counted among your household members. For I see what great fortune and learning will be added to me if I am allowed to converse with you longer. Therefore, I come to you as a suppliant as much as anyone, although I am not unaware that I may have perhaps sinned against you in some matters and obeyed your will less. However, if that happened, it was out of ignorance. For I have been as intent as possible, placed all my effort there, and tried with all my strength to obey your will and avoid your offense, which I am certainly promising myself to do henceforth. The payment, which is very small, that you received from me this year through your beneficence, for which I have and will have immense thanks to you as long as I live - for I will not be able to repay it - I will not refuse to pay double, provided I am allowed to be counted among your household. For if I am rejected by you, where shall I turn, where shall I go, what house will receive me? Certainly none as pleasing as yours, though at a greater price, I know well. Therefore, I would like to ask you most earnestly - for I will not use many words - to grant and concede this to me, if it can be done in any way. You will certainly have me compliant in all things. For now, I owe everything to you, and you have me bound by your grace and benevolence, so that I will do anything for your sake, if I can.</p>
      <p>Farewell, venerable father, and I wish you to love your Christian as you have hitherto and to have him commended to you.</p>
