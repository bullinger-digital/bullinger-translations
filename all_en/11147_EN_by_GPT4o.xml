    <p xml:id="regest1">The reason for his silence is solely the overload of work. [The people of Zurich] are saddened by the conflict in Bern, but encouraged by the timely response from Luther, in which they are recognized as brothers, even if reservations may still exist. In Baden, the envoys [of the reformed places] were presented with a statement that was unanimously accepted by the council and the pastors; they want to write to Luther that they are ready for mutual recognition without further mediation and are united in the confession that the body of Christ sits at the right hand of God, despite differing interpretations. Bucer's explanation is less clear than Luther's letter. Zurich does not want to engage in any further meetings, but wants to adhere to the concord and write to Luther in a friendly manner. The best way to serve the cause is for Bucer to remain calm; as shown in Bern, his mediation only brings discord. Megander has been appointed as Bullinger's colleague in the preaching office. Myconius and Grynaeus should work to ensure that Bucer limits his activities to Strasbourg.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>No one can turn my heart away, most learned Myconius. I love and honor you; you are and will forever be a brother. Believe me, the reason I write less frequently is due to the many tasks that almost miserably exhaust and overwhelm me. However, I will soon ensure that you understand there was a just cause for my infrequent and brief writing; for I will send an entire volume instead of a few notes. In the meantime, do not doubt my feelings towards you.</p>
      <p>The tragedy in Bern has greatly afflicted us, but we have been consoled again by the very friendly response of the excellent man, Doctor Luther. He wishes us to consider it good that he wrote later; indeed, for this reason, the response was much more welcome, as it was given now and in that turmoil. You wish to hear my opinion on this writing. I will say it briefly: Luther gave a candid, simple, unfeigned, and plainly Christian response. As for the cause of the Eucharist, he does not attack anything in our writing, condemns nothing; again, he prescribes nothing to us, simply declares what he feels; finally, he acknowledges us as brothers and seeks friendship, even if some residue remains that prevents one from inclining to the other's opinion.</p>
      <p>What our people have decided has been delivered to your envoys in Baden, which you have seen, I suppose. This writing contains the opinion of the council and all the ministers.</p>
      <p>There is indeed the highest consensus among all. We thank Luther, pledge concord, say that no further mediators are needed, understand what Luther wants and feels, and what he asks of us, we will simply teach about this matter, acting in good faith, acknowledging him as our brother and closest friend; in that is concord, that we confess with common confession that the body of Christ sits at the right hand of the Father, and just as it does not offend us that he entrusts the manner of presence to God, so we hope he will not be offended if we continue to explain as we have in the previous response to him, etc.</p>
      <p>As for Bucer's explanation, Luther's opinion is clearer, which is plain. It has gone well; do not spoil it now. We will not go further, but will faithfully adhere to the concord as stated above with writing, speaking, and preaching. We are all united in this. We will write to Luther and reveal to him that our minds are plainly placated and friendly.</p>
      <p>In my opinion and that of all of us, Bucer should rest in this matter. For he will cause more harm than good to the matter. I will not add more. If they remain calm, we will also remain calm, and there is not much need for justification; it is not necessary against us. We do not desire or need unrest; our church is at peace, and we intend to maintain peace with everyone. He wanted to go to Bern and make peace, and the greatest discord resulted from it. So it could go here and elsewhere. The example of other people must make us wise. We do not want to go further and intend to keep our churches in peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Megander has been called by the council to the ministry of the word and has been given to me as a colleague, thanks be to God. Pray to the Lord that truth and love may always triumph in all of us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest Myconius, together with the most beloved man of mortals, Dr. Grynaeus. I beg you for God's sake, ensure that we do not always have to meet like this and that Bucer confines his church to Strasbourg and remains calm, so we will remain at peace and love, good brothers. Otherwise, I do not know what will come of it with time. Farewell again and love me. February 22, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Oswald Myconius, head of the Basel church, esteemed brother.</p>
