      <p>[...] I will thank the most honorable council for the support... and will visit him shortly. I am not surprised if they offer nothing since we are dealing with stubborn and almost furious people. Schultheiss Pfyffer passed by here and neither wanted to visit me nor dine with me; he will achieve nothing at all if we adhere to the words of the treaty and if there is any fairness here. Because I despise him and his kind and do not fill them with money, they would gladly disparage me and blame me for the fact that their pensions and debts are not paid and that with the changes of kingdoms, also businesses and words change.</p>
      <p>But here is a bronze wall, etc. The king and those who are his advisors and many good people know me, and God is also there, who protects his own from slander. There was a dispute between King of Navarre and Duke of Guise, and he could no longer bear that the other intervened or commanded, and he wanted to leave with many princes and the constable; but everything was settled, so that Navarre has much more power than before. The Duke of Guise accompanies the widow of King Francis to Reims, where the cardinal and other Guises are, and he will not return before May. There is more hope for peace in France than before, and a greater opinion of a national council than a universal one. Master Martyr will see what has been written to me in Italian; you will send it back afterwards.</p>
      <p>My son will thank you for the German booklet, otherwise I will say more when I have more leisure. Greet all friends and love us and take care of your health.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, March 16.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the word of God. Zurich.</p>
