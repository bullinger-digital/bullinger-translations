      <p>Greetings. I have written to you a detailed letter, dearest Bullinger, and sent it to you through a certain student from ZÃ¼rich; I also attached a certain writing of the excellent man Matthias Schenck, in which he defends himself from the slanders and insults of our ubiquists, who persist in planting, inculcating, and stubbornly holding onto the error of Eutyches. These are clearly unlearned men, gluttonous revelers, and the most rapacious harpies, who stir up great disturbances in our church,... and open the door to the entire pestilential rabble, nor do they dare to speak against the enemies of Christ, who openly thunder blasphemies against Christ in our city and have advanced the cause of the Posowichtes to such an extent that they lead captive the foremost and wealthiest individuals, who were previously most inclined to the gospel, and have compelled them to ensnare other women connected by neighborhood, kinship, and blood with great anxiety. They confess sins and pour them into the lap of the most wicked dog every week, and they communicate twice every month. To these... belong our people; but they cruelly rage against their brothers, mixing heaven and earth for their ubiquity. When you have received this letter along with Schenck's apology, which I wish to be returned, I ask you to inform me. Bavaria has instituted a visitation into books and parishes. A dialogue has been published, in which Philipp is thrust into hell; the interlocutors are Ottheinrich, Maurice the electors, Albert the margrave, and many others, who contend in the underworld that they have been miserably deceived. The Pope is anxious about obtaining a council. I would write more if it were safe; as soon as I learn that you have received my letters, I will write more freely and abundantly. Greet Mr. Gesner, Wolff, and Gwalther for me. Farewell, my Bullinger, most swiftly, October 18, in the year etc. 54.</p>
      <p>Your Geryon.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most pious theologian and most vigilant pastor, my lord and dearest friend.</p>
