    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks for Myconius’ letter [No. 2308], which the young [Jakob Röist?] delivered. No righteous person can stand on the side of the Emperor [Charles V], as he is plunging Germany, indeed all of Christian Europe, into ruin. Because he is entirely dependent on the Antichrist [Pope Paul III], he is intent on eradicating the still young evangelical doctrine, sowing war, suppressing the French [King Francis I], provoking the Turks, inciting [Francis I] and the English [King Henry VIII] against each other, and setting the Germans against one another. He fights like Pharaoh against Moses. Time will reveal what will soon come! The conflict between [Francis I] and [Charles V] demands many sacrifices. However, experience has taught Bullinger that the rest of the church must be afflicted in this way. [Wilhelm] Frölich should bravely march against the Spaniard [Charles V] until this game ends sadly! The [evangelical Confederates] must warn against the bloody mercenary service, even if they cannot prevent everyone from participating. - Myconius’ news about the Schmalkaldic League is pleasing. Hopefully, [the Protestants] will trust in God and His word! If the rumor of [Duke Henry of Brunswick's] conversion to Protestantism is true, [the Protestants] will meet a fate similar to Saul and Ahab when they spared Agag and Ben-Hadad. [The Duke] will return to his old nature. Only the peasant Confederates resist the nobles, who deceive each other only to flatter each other again. - The Ammann of Zug, [Melchior Heinrich], one of the envoys, is responsible for the fact that the Five Places were in Valais and achieved almost nothing. [The people of Valais] said they needed no one to pass judgment; they were in agreement, and the [envoys] could return home. So [Melchior Heinrich] had to leave without accomplishing anything. - The people of Schwyz are divided because of Captain [Ulrich] Känel, who is accused by some soldiers of withholding money. Allegedly, Gilg Reichmuth [the younger], the son of the Ammann [Gilg Reichmuth], had two fingers cut off in a fight (about the father, [Matthäus Schiner, Bishop of] Sion said that King [Francis I] had made an "arrogance" out of him). - The letter bearer, Thomas Grunder, a citizen of Wil, had to emigrate because of the actions of the St. Gallen Abbot [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee] and was taken in by [the people of Zurich]. Since he is poor and wants to let his sons [Andres and...] study, Myconius should help him as much as possible. - Best wishes for the new year to the whole family.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Your letter was delivered to me, brother and always esteemed lord, by the distinguished young man Fuligineus, and for this I give you great thanks. I read with pleasure what you wrote. No righteous person can favor the Emperor, as he is not only not a good man, but a plague and destruction, a ruin not only to Germany but to all of Europe, which still bears the title of Christian. For as he is entirely dependent on the Antichrist, he thinks day and night about how to suppress the flourishing doctrine of the Gospel while it is still in its infancy, not to mention how he sows wars, attempting to suppress the French, provoking the Turks, now mixing and setting the French and English against each other, and also secretly inciting the Germans to take up arms against each other, being a nuisance to both God and men, especially his own. But the righteous Lord is vigilant, who hears the groans of His people. He now contends with Pharaoh as Moses did. What will happen next, time will reveal! The conflict between the French and the Emperor is bloody and disastrous for many.</p>
      <p>But I see, taught by much experience, that it is necessary for the remnants of the church to be afflicted in this way. Let [Wilhelm] Frölich go forth bravely and move against the Spaniard until this sad game becomes a judgment of God for both! I commit the matter to the Lord.</p>
      <p>It will be our duty to warn in time, so that not many give themselves to the bloody military service. If we cannot retain all, at least God's counsel will prevail among those who are curable.</p>
      <p>The news you bring about the Schmalkaldic League is pleasing. May they trust in God and dedicate themselves to the word of God in all things! I would wish, however, that the rumor of the robber being counted among the Protestants is false. Why, I pray, does Saul dance among the prophets? Why does the wolf play in the flock of sheep? If it is true, you will see that they will meet a fate similar to Saul and Ahab, who spared Agag and Ben-Hadad. The incendiary will return to his nature. For he will not change this more than a leopard its spots or an Ethiopian his skin.</p>
      <p>No one does anything for the young nobles except the peasant Confederates; deceiving each other and then flattering each other again.</p>
      <p>But perhaps I am judging before the time.</p>
      <p>The Ammann of Zug, [Melchior Heinrich], who was one of the envoys, is the authority that the Five Places were in Valais and achieved almost nothing. They said they needed no one to mediate. They were in agreement or wanted to be in agreement, and wondered who had sent them. They could well return home and be thanked. So [Melchior Heinrich] had to return home empty-handed. We know nothing else beyond this; otherwise, you would not be ignorant.</p>
      <p>The people of Schwyz are greatly divided because of Captain [Ulrich] Känel, who is accused by the soldiers of withholding some reserved money. Some private individuals, however, involved in factions, occasionally clash. They say that Gilg Reichmuth [the younger], the son of the Ammann [Gilg Reichmuth], had two fingers cut off in a conflict. And there are various rumors about this, which I find to be mostly false.</p>
      <p>The one who offers this to you, Thomas Grunder, is a citizen of Wil, but driven by the wickedness of the Abbot of St. Gallen, [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee], he left and changed his place. He was received by our people, but since he is poor and has sons whom he wishes to dedicate to studies, I ask you to assist him as much as you can. He requested that I write this to you.</p>
      <p>I pray for you and your entire family, that this year may dawn happy for you and end most happily.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Zurich, the day after the Lord's Nativity 1546. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant overseer of the renowned church of Basel, his always esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
