      <p>My friendly, willing service with the offering of all honor and goods before, well-educated, pious, prudent and wise, especially kind, dear sir. If I had not intended to ride to Zurich myself this time, I would not have failed to thank you long ago by writing for the great effort and work you have taken on my behalf and for letting me have a summary of the council, for which I would gladly pay you for your good pleasure. However, since I do not know if it is of service to you, I will nevertheless show myself to you shortly as a grateful person, etc. I have shown it to some of my gracious lords; but they all find, as you do, nothing but your old song in it. I hope nothing will come of it.</p>
      <p>How the dealings with our confederates have gone on this day, you will learn in detail from your lords.</p>
      <p>May God will that the works in time prove to be consistent with the words; for our confederates from the Three Leagues have presented it very well, which our confederates from Glarus now have to consider, etc. If I can show you love and service now or later, you will find me at all times entirely inclined and willing with the help of Almighty God. May He keep you in His grace and long-lasting health.</p>
      <p>Dated at Baden, the 18th of April in the year 64. Your entirely willing Batt Ludwig von MÃ¼linen.</p>
      <p>To the well-educated, pious, also prudent and wise master Heinrich Bullinger, head of the church in Zurich, my kind lord, etc.</p>
