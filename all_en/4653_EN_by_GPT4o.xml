      <p>I have been running around all day today, I have not had so much time that I can eat, let alone study. There is a large crowd of people with us.</p>
      <p>Our city is very diligent and careful, maintaining strong guards; alone on my street, there are 36 men day and night in armor. When the bishop's men initially came, most of them put on armor. Yesterday, the League divided according to old custom, and each League went separately to council. There, the God's House, which is the greater part, although a thousandfold practices ran between, has newly allied, in short, to drive the priest's servants out of the Rhaetians. And when the common 3 Leagues came together again on the same day, Bishop Thomas appeared there with great pomp; it is estimated that there were over a hundred who followed him on foot (I saw it myself and was present). First after the bishop came the old Travers. This Travers also brought a great complaint against our city before the other two Leagues, then against the others who were inclined to them.</p>
      <p>Thereupon, firstly, the city judge answered in the name of the common city (for the consuls and the prefect of the city are the envoys); he rudely turned away from the bishop and among other things said, he had secretly approached the 3 Leagues and had issued 3 articles to the communities, the first of which was that the school, which had been maintained by the common God's House in Chur until now, should be abolished (you will hear about the school elsewhere; it is not a matter of great importance; I would prefer the people of Chur to have a school for themselves, which they will do, etc.); then, that the city of Chur should be deprived of its freedoms and the letters of the common God's House and the God's House seal should be taken from them, et alia; he would never live to see that day, et alia multa. The consul responded in the name of those who had allied against the bishop according to the articles they have at hand, whereupon the bishop called the 2 Leagues (to which he had previously written at length) to justice, whereupon the 2 Leagues asked ours if they would settle the matter justly.</p>
      <p>Ours answered: before they give any answer hereabout, they want to know from them, the two Leagues, what they have to say about the first article, which was issued to all communities. Thereupon the 2 Leagues separated again; those in the courts answered unanimously: their communities are willing to remain by the articles, with the clarification that the bishop's officials do not sit, those in the Upper League likewise (though we in the Upper League had no more than a hand's breadth). That happened yesterday.</p>
      <p>Today the old Travers has returned, intending with many words to overturn it again, and when he was once answered to remain by the previous, he cried out for justice. Ours believe the matter was settled at that time when the articles were established, and if now the will of the community is to uphold them, as this bishop also swore to it, one cannot take the right from foreign lords.</p>
      <p>Thereupon the two Leagues urged ours with goodwill, whether they would grant the bishop the right concerning the other articles. Ours indicated that without right they would deprive no one of their freedoms; they consider, however, that they have had the right to do so; yet they would now gladly stand still and bring it back to their communities, if the two Leagues would agree that now and henceforth the bishop and his lawyers do not sit; whereupon the two Leagues agreed to this.</p>
      <p>Thus the priest's servants, who had already divided all offices in the castle among themselves, were dismissed. The rest remains pending until the end of the League day; for the bishop would now gladly have a right concerning the other articles from the two Leagues; but ours do not want the two Leagues to make an intrusion into their freedoms. They write, they know well how deep the people set their foot: now they know that he has set his foot so deep that they had to lift him out with beams.</p>
      <p>Now I hope that we too will win the case against the Jesuits, although the envoys of Ferdinand and the pope are present and the curse of all together. All your things have been returned to me; I will send them back with the next faithful one.</p>
      <p>This barely.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, ours are vigilant, and if the matter had not been conducted so seriously, we would have achieved nothing. But I say truly and freely that you are too slow; for if you do not know how your consul behaved in Baden, you can learn the whole story from me. Oh God, oh God, will you listen until etc.? - If only Hylerus would come to us, to whom I indeed wish better provision; but nevertheless, he could greatly help the cause of the gospel. Worship your 5 Cantons, as long as you want.</p>
      <p>You see from this one deed how the Lord does not forsake those who labor diligently. Farewell, reverend father, and forgive the haste.</p>
      <p>Chur, February 5, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>I have not reread.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant head of the church of Zurich, his lord and patron to be uniquely observed.</p>
