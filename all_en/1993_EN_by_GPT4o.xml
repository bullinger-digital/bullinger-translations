      <p>Greetings in the Lord Jesus, most illustrious man. The reason I have not written to you for several months is due to certain circumstances, which I will explain to you at another time. However, now, as I am pressed for time and must write succinctly and as briefly as possible, I want you to know this at present: namely, Vergerius, as we hear, is arranging for a certain catechism to be printed in Zürich and wishes to dedicate it to the churches of the Valtellina without the knowledge of the ministers of those churches. This catechism is the one he received from Johannes Brenz. But you, man of God, by the compassion of Christ Jesus, if you love the peace of our churches, do not consent to anything being printed in the name of our churches unless our churches agree. Vergerius says he does not want to act as or be a minister of the gospel from among us; if he does not want to be one of us, why does he want to impose his catechisms on the churches in our name? We have never had peace since this man has been in these regions. Nevertheless, let this word be with you, even though it is very true and perhaps it would be useful for many to know; I write to you alone now and I write the truth before God.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the earlier catechism titled: "The Foundation of the Christian Religion for the Use of the Valtellina." However, look at the part where it deals with the Lord's Supper, and there you will find these words written in the common Italian language: "The Lord's Supper is a sacrament or divine sign, in which Christ offers and gives to his elect his body and his blood in bread and wine and assures them that their sins are forgiven and that the kingdom of eternal life belongs to them." Furthermore, in the confession of the most illustrious Duke of Württemberg, near the end in the peroration, he says he is pleased with the summary of that confession, as if the opinion on the Lord's Supper is not part of the summary of Christian doctrine, and there he adds: "Although some of ours do not like one article," and he speaks of the Lord's Supper. I only hint and show the place; see for yourself where he speaks of himself, who translated that confession from Latin into the common Italian.</p>
      <p>When he was reproached by us for disturbing the churches, which are at peace and hold the true opinion about the Lord's Supper, with that catechism and his other books, which he spreads among the people, indeed for publishing books that hold the opposite of the doctrine he preached in our federations, he said he was an interpreter, not an assertor.</p>
      <p>We replied to him that he is an assertor in that catechism, because he wants it to be accepted by the churches. Finally, he promised to correct that part about the Lord's Supper and is again arranging for it to be printed in Zürich. Let him print what he wants, as long as there is no mention of our churches, so that we do not seem to consent to his catechisms. We have our catechisms conforming to yours; we do not want others inscribed in our name. Therefore, we ask you, man of God, not to allow any mention of us in his catechisms. Let him go in the name of the Lord and no longer be a nuisance to us. Remember also Celio, who is here and has seen everything, wrote the truth to you, and do not be surprised that I speak so freely about the man. If I wanted to write everything, it would require a large volume, and know for certain that I say this unwillingly; but the care for our churches, which this man has always disturbed, compels me to speak of this man's character to you alone. Nothing more. Farewell in the Lord Jesus and pray to God for us. I will write to you with a calm mind at another time. Chiavenna, September 3, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Agostino Mainardi.</p>
