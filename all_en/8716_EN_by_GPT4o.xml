      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, my willing service to you at all times, etc. Furthermore, dear sir, I sent my recent letter to you with Anton Gesner. Since then, these letters have come to me from Nuremberg on the 22nd of this month. Mr. Schl√ºsselberger writes to me that he has paid our factor in Nuremberg 40 florins, which I would gladly send to you with this messenger; they are bulky; I will wait for a certain dispatch. Then I will send you both copies, for which I am most grateful; if there are any costs, I will pay them with thanks. I sent you the new newspaper with the young Bachoffer, which you gave me; I hope it has reached you. I am writing this letter to my brother-in-law Gallinger in Winterthur, so if he does not have a messenger, he can send this order from Glattbrugg to the city. I hope you will be satisfied. I am sending you the 40 florins in French currency, 4 for 23 batzen. I think it is better for you than crowns or other coins, etc. I have little news; the victory over the Turks is confirmed. Before this date, I wrote from Lyon, mentioning that the admiral has been summoned back to court and that the marriage with the king's sister and the prince of Navarre is to proceed. On the 8th of this month, the first sermon was given before the city of Lyon. Our confederates from Freiburg must help protect ours, praise be to God Almighty forever. With that, I commend you to God's grace.</p>
      <p>Our beloved preachers, along with myself, send you, Mr. Walther, our respectful greetings, with a request to convey my humble service to my lord mayor Camlin and treasurer Thoma, etc. In all.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, faithful servant of the Christian church, my honorable and beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
