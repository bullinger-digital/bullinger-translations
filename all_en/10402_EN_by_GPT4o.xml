    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to four recently received letters from Bullinger. Regarding the first letter: Delighted about the success of Bullinger's works at the Frankfurt Book Fair and wishes the same for Pellikan's commentaries. Bernese delegation at the Duke of Savoy concerning an evangelical nobleman, Anton Bonjour?, whose properties have been confiscated. Threat of war. Regarding the second letter: Megander did not complain to Haller that his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians could not be printed in Zurich. Haller is mentioned in it with Simon Sulzer, which he does not feel he deserves. Johannes Rhellikan has more involvement in the work than Megander. It was sent to Basel for printing. Haller is pleased with everything that builds the church: Bullinger should continue with his widely appreciated work. The Swiss Diet responded to Bern in a similar manner as Zurich. Johannes Lening, the envoy of Philip of Hesse, was told by the Bernese council that they could not currently allow the passage of foreign troops through their territory. Nothing was known in Bern about the insolence of a Zurich country pastor. At the spring synod in Bern, city and country pastors questioned each other about their teachings. The whole event went as desired, only Megander caused a useless and for many offensive discussion with his surprisingly presented thesis that there is no difference in the way Adam was created by God and we are born from parents. Appearance of the Frenchman Claude d'Aliod after the synod: due to his anti-Trinitarian views (he is a student of Michael Servetus), a dispute is to take place with him on May 5th. Sebastian von Diesbach has emigrated to Freiburg. Haller requests the sending of Bullinger's commentary on the Corinthians as soon as they appear; he is currently using Bullinger's commentary on the Acts of the Apostles for his sermon, and Christian Danmatter first read the one on the Epistles of Peter with admiration. Haller delivered two sermons at the synod on the prophetic office in the sense of Bullinger's speech "De prophetae officio," 1532; he regrets not being able to report on it in more detail. When could Bullinger come to Lenzburg? All Bernese messengers are in Freiburg; upon their return, this letter will be ready to send. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. A few days ago, I received four letters from you, dearest Heinrich, which are the most eloquent witnesses of your love for me. I will respond to them in order with what I have. First, I am not surprised that your works were sold in Frankfurt; rather, I would consider it a looming disaster if the present age did not embrace what the Lord, through you, His instrument, has deemed worthy, although I also greatly desire that Pellikan's commentaries be sold. Secondly, I understand nothing else from our people than that they greatly desire peace. The Duke of Savoy is approached by a questor, Formosus, and the city's architect in the case of a certain nobleman, otherwise a pious and good man, whose castles and goods are held by some because he adheres to the Word. In summary: We abhor war, even though all the villages resound with nothing but warlike tones. And thus I have responded to the first letter.</p>
      <p>I received the second letter, sent by you on April 22, on May 3, albeit late, in which you mention Megander's commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians. Although I have heard nothing from him, which he might regret not being printed with you, he never offered it to me to read. The assistant teacher, who transcribed it, sometimes showed me a few things where he mentioned Sulzer and me, which I would rather have obliterated, as I am not worthy of being exposed by name among booksellers. It is certain that Megander annotated a few things, but Rhellikan arranged everything in order, so I would rather say it belongs to Rhellikan than to Megander. He sent the booklet to Basel to be printed there. Whether they will do it or not, he awaits a response. I depend on the Lord in all these matters. I do not disdain prophecies. I embrace with gratitude what serves the good and edification of the church, recognizing greater gifts in one, lesser in another. Simplicity, sincerity, and piety please me in those who write now. However, what arises from vain glory is recognized by me at first sight. You continue happily as you have begun. For as many brothers as I have heard in our synod praise God in you, commend His gifts in you highly, and are held in perpetual desire for you, who daily are to be provided with other and other happier successes. Our parish priests begin to be wise and recognize the learned of our time with discernment.</p>
      <p>The response given to the Swiss pleases everyone, and if only we had had it before the envoys were sent! Our response would have been similar, although it does not differ from yours, except that yours is more explicit, ours more general. The envoy of the Prince of Hesse, Johannes Lening, was kindly received by the council and sent away with a sufficiently liberal response, namely that our condition is now such that we cannot allow soldiers to anyone, but will promote the effort of both princes in any way, and their enemies will not have free passage through us. Therefore, I am not surprised by the importunity of that pastor from your region, but no mention of him has yet been made with us. If such incidents occur, I am glad to have learned the truth from you.</p>
      <p>About our synod, this is what happened: First, we all gathered, as many as there are ministers and deacons in the Bernese region, excluding all others, namely the exiles of Solothurn and others, and proposed the manner of celebrating the synod to the brothers. It was that before lunch for three days, we who teach in Bern would be examined by the other brothers, observing order, on how each one teaches the law of the gospel, the abolition of the law, justification, works, predestination, sacraments, and whatever else is such, on the condition that they would use similar freedom towards us, so that we too, when questioned, would respond. Everything went most happily and, as we hope, with progress, so that those who have been diligent and faithful enough so far may advance, the lazy may be spurred on, so that they may be more prepared and prompt to give an account of their province in the future. However, in all these matters, Megander offered his opinion to the synod, which I had not heard before. Namely, when he was first asked by me how he taught the law, he began from Adam, how he was created by God no differently than we are born from our parents today, and with such pomp of words that many took it as an oracle. Francis refused. While the judgments of the other brothers were varied, most agreed with Megander, I remained silent, waiting to see what they understood by the "likeness and image" of God [Gen 1, 26], according to which the first man was created. When they were asked individually, one understood this image to be the law of nature, another a certain inclination to good common even to the impious, another understood it as justice, holiness, and truth, and when Megander was asked, he asserted the latter, and another, Schlupfindhegg, known to you, with him. I inferred that Adam's condition is not the same as ours, because Adam was created according to the image of God, just, holy, truthful, yet peccable, indeed preordained to fall, who, however, as far as he was concerned, could not have sinned, indeed had the uncreated power of doing good, while we, deprived of this freedom, born from sinners, have received nothing but the power, fuel, inclination, and origin to sin from them, so that sin is innate to us, but the uncreated image of God, that is, justice, holiness, and truth, was to Adam, although according to God's ordination the fall was foreseen. Hence, Adam is not created by God in the same way as we are born from parents. Here we remained with the matter unresolved, many offended by this novelty and rashness of speech, many also admiring Megander's sharp mind. Thus we go around with foolishness, wanting to be learned alone, caring little about what builds and improves the church. I let it go, to avoid contentions among us and others. Otherwise, we have come to agreement in all things and are of one mind, having also discussed vocation, examination, permutation, chapters, and recognized two deficiencies in our ban, which are yet to be improved. One, that no one is excluded or bound or separated by our church, the other, that no one is released or reconciled by the church and therefore does not yet have its authority, as also discussed in your presence in the comitia with Megander, and as it has not been able to be raised with us. Now you have everything that has been done with us.</p>
      <p>Soon after the synod was concluded and dissolved, a certain small Frenchman, otherwise of corrupt mind, came to our colloquium, proscribed from Basel because of Myconius. He proposed to us that he thinks differently about God than we do. He asserted that there is one God, that the Trinity and persons in the divine are no less an abomination than the mass, that Christ is not God nor the natural Son of God nor consubstantial and coeternal with the Father, similarly that the Holy Spirit is not God nor coessential with the Father. A day was appointed for him on the fifth of May. In our colloquium, we will hear the man. If he does not cease to disturb the churches and brothers, we will ensure he is proscribed. He is indeed a disciple of Servetus the Spaniard, but he will not be able to defend his views. He is a small man and is called Claudius, so that when he comes to you, you may know him. And how he behaves, I will report to you.</p>
      <p>Consul von Diesbach has given up his citizenship with us and has moved to Freiburg.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, what you write about the Epistle to the Corinthians, now to be illuminated by you, Simon also reported. I beseech you, always have the excused quaternions sent to me. The latter epistle is such that I can accomplish little with it; I would like to hear your spirit, for it is still the most pleasant to me, and as I desire, so I find it with you. I am treating the Acts of the Apostles for the sermon, so that in leisure and with judgment I may read your commentaries, which I had previously seen tumultuously. What you noted on Peter, Christian from Gerzensee, as the first, and indeed most diligently, read, so he admires your progress, although he is now detained by a very severe fever. I had two sermons on the prophetic office in our synod, aided by your speech. If only there were enough time left to indicate their scope to you! For otherwise, unless flatteringly, even the best have all advised well. I have nothing else.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for all of us! Continue in the Lord's work and have me, as you are accustomed, not only as a brother, which you have always shown yourself to be, but as your footstool commended to you. Dear, let me know when it would be most convenient for you to come to Lenzburg; I will consider if it might somehow be possible for me as well. We will then wait until the end of the wars.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>All the messengers have gone to Freiburg. In the meantime, I wrote so that when they return, the letters would be ready.</p>
      <p>May 3, in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Greetings to Leo, Pellikan, Carolstadt, Theodor, and all others.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. H. or H. B.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his always most loving brother.</p>
