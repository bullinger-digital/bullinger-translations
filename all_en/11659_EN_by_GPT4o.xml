    <p xml:id="regest1">Eagerly awaits what Bucer will achieve with the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied], although he does not trust him to carry out a proper Reformation; he possesses sufficient scholarship and zeal, but lacks strength and steadfastness. Schwenckfeld, who teaches similarly to Valentinus, Apelles, and others, displeases him more and more, which is why he also endeavored to refute such teachings in his commentaries. He likes Vadian's writing [„Pro veritate carnis triumphantis Christi“] very much; may God preserve him for a long time! Asks for Blarer's and [Johannes] Zwick's opinion on his [Matthew] commentary. He has read the concerns sent by the [Electoral] Saxon theologians and is extremely satisfied with them. He has also read the speech of the French envoy [François Olivier] and noticed the ambivalent character of [Francis I.]; it is suspected by many that he will lead an army against the Emperor and attack Milan; he has recruited 1600 Swiss to protect Turin; this action hardly shows [Francis I.'s] love for Germany; [Josue von] Beroldingen, the Ammann of Uri, has recruited soldiers for the Pope, who, according to rumors, have set out for the province of Ancona; the devil is at play. Blarer will learn of the stance of the people of Zurich from the confidential enclosure; thanks for his loyalty. Asks for further news from Augsburg and Speyer. Inquires which section of the Matthew [commentary] Blarer last received, so he can send him the remaining sections.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I eagerly and ardently await what Bucer will achieve with the Archbishop of Cologne. To be honest with you, my most intimate friend and beloved brother, I must confess what I feel: I do not believe Bucer will properly reform any church. You ask why: He is sufficiently learned and indeed a marvel of varied scholarship and most diligent genius; but he lacks the helm, the right strength, and firm constancy. He also seems to be too much of an admirer of people; his mind leans too much towards some kind of compromise.</p>
      <p>He has shown many examples; but you know these better yourself. Therefore, you rightly think that we should pray and beseech the Lord to fulfill all the qualities of a good catechist, which the Lord may grant him, etc.</p>
      <p>The most foul error of Schwenckfeld displeases me more and more each day; for I clearly perceive that with only the words changed, the entire doctrine of Valentinus, Apelles, and other monsters is spewed into the church as if from the very jaws of the devil. Therefore, I strive, whenever the occasion arises in our commentaries, to respond to certain arguments with the author's name and person omitted, to defend the orthodox truth and to expose the deadly deceit.</p>
      <p>I am exceedingly pleased with the disputation of our Vadian and rejoice that the Lord has given us such a defender of the truth. May the Lord keep him safe with us for a long time.</p>
      <p>I sent a part of our commentaries in this miserable state, so that you and our Zwick, with your fortunate intellect and piety, might freely indicate what displeases you; but now perhaps you are too kind judges, considering all my work favorably. Therefore, I urge you again and again to freely advise if anything seems to need admonition, etc.</p>
      <p>I received and gladly read the document of deliberation from the Saxon theologians; for I am very pleased that they have finally extricated themselves from that most entangled compromise, seeing that more disputes than solid concord would arise from it. Praise and glory to God!</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I saw a fragment of the speech given by the envoy of the King of France at the diet and I see that this king is a shameless and enigmatic man; I do not now dispute the matter he proposed in his consultation, whether it will be useful or useless for Germany; I speak of the counsel and the end to which this king aims. Many suspect, who perhaps have a clearer view of the king's plans than I do, that after the Easter festival and at the beginning of May, the king will lead armies against the Emperor and invade Milan by force.</p>
      <p>Indeed, he is recruiting 1600 Swiss, whom he will place as a garrison in Turin. Against whom? I ask. What need is there for these garrisons? If he so favors Germany, why does he stir this hornet's nest? Beroldingen, the Ammann of Uri, has recruited some soldiers to serve the Pope. What will happen, I do not know. They say these are setting out for the March of Ancona. The devil is good at play. I fear that many things will be introduced among the princes through arts, tricks, and treachery.</p>
      <p>You will understand what our people are doing or what they have decided to do in these troubles from the copy I send you; but see to it that it comes into the hands of only the most faithful. I thank you very much for your loyalty and diligence; for I see how much you value me, who have copied so much with your own hand for my sake. I also ask that you continue to share with me what you have received from faithful friends either from Augsburg or Speyer and believe to be true. If you in turn ask of me what my small abilities can provide, I will be entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell. March 29, 1542.</p>
      <p>Indicate to me which was the last section in Matthew you received, so I can send you the others afterwards.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his lord Ambrosius Blarer, his far dearest brother.</p>
