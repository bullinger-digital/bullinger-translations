    <p xml:id="regest1">Hopes that Bullinger has received the latest news from Vadian. There is a rumor that King Ferdinand has reached an agreement with Duke Ulrich of Württemberg. The Duke is now near Ravensburg, which, along with the monasteries of Weingarten, Weißenau, and Baindt, is supplying him with provisions. The Duke intends to spare the cities, but not the monasteries, Truchsess Dietrich Spät, and Count Hugo of Montfort in Tettnang. The abbots of Reichenau, Salem, and the Bishop of Constance are in Überlingen with many possessions; they have refused provisions to the Duke and are siding with the Emperor. It is said that a Margrave has traveled through Thurgau with a large entourage; he has been with Ulrich von Hohensax, in Blidegg, in Rorschach, and with Abbot Diethelm Blarer of St. Gallen. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, I hope my especially gracious lord Vadian has sent you the latest news, as much as is available, etc. However, not knowing yet, I just read a letter yesterday evening, written to a citizen here, and the messenger also said orally that the rumor is as follows: namely, the report that Ferdinand has personally agreed with the Duke, but not on behalf of the imperial majesty, they are concerned, not breaking, but the rumor is that he has set out with three troops. As I hear, he had not gone more than 3 miles or less to Ravensburg. It is believed he is the provost at Weingarten in the monastery. Not that he is inside, but he has demanded provisions. Thus, in Ravensburg, they have sent 4 wagons, Weingarten 4 wagons, the Abbot in Weißenau near Ravensburg 3 wagons, Baindt 3 wagons with grain, wine, oats as gifts. Also, these named three abbots have retreated with possessions into the city of Ravensburg. It is believed he will demand their possessions from those of Ravensburg, as from his enemies who fled behind them. Also, the report: he will (perhaps) do nothing to any city, but to the monasteries and the Truchsess, the Count of Tettnang; he has also fled. It is said that the Duke has sent word to the same Count, he has now given 15 years each year a thousand guilders from the Duke of Württemberg; he would like to take it also. Also, in Überlingen lies with great possessions Abbot Reichenau, Salem, and Meersburg have fled. They have refused provisions to the Duke in the city. They want to remain with the imperial majesty, although he is far from them. Also, the report here: that one with 40 horses - believed to be a Margrave - has come riding into Thurgau with a lady's carriage, in which are 5 beautiful mares. It is said he has stayed with the one from Sax, then dined at Blidegg; has come to Rorschach; he was received by Abbot St. Gallen. What great work of God; may He grant us to recognize it, and a greater good end, as I hope. Amen, amen.</p>
      <p>In haste. Greet your dear wife, mother, Leony, Tumysen, and others for me.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, Wednesday after Peter and Paul, in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Your willing</p>
      <p>Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my dear M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, to hand.</p>
