      <p>Greetings. I received your much-anticipated letter, dearest Myconius, through Heinrich Wirt, whom you recommended. I will gladly assist him as much as I can with a clear conscience, and that because of your recommendation. I asked him for letters, which they call testimonials, written by the ministers of the church in Doggenburg; I am expecting them. Otherwise, he has lived quite licentiously up to now and has engaged in usury; for he was a merchant, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the people of Constance, I have this: "Our envoys are in Augsburg, and as it is said, if we submit and ask for grace, nothing more will be required of us; it is now different, and they want to negotiate with the envoys beforehand.</p>
      <p>So it goes," etc.</p>
      <p>I received the Interim articles from Augsburg, about which you have received better information than the matter itself truly holds. Certainly, what is disputed from the beginning about the state of man before and after the fall, about servitude and captivity, about the freedom and redemption of man through Christ, about justification, etc., is not said to be entirely impious. But the rest about the 7 sacraments, about the incarnation and intercession of saints, about feasts, ceremonies, masses, prayers for the dead, etc., are plainly papistic and subvert the sound doctrine of Christ. Therefore, someone played with the Interim: Emperor Charles Interim, shameful, deceitful, full of lies and tricks, created. If you ask what it is, listen: It is a form by which piety and true faith and whatever remains holy in the world miserably perish as if by dire poison.</p>
      <p>Certainly, we will need to be tested. He who perseveres to the end will be saved. The article on the Eucharist retains transubstantiation and adoration stubbornly, etc.</p>
      <p>You know that Haller was sent to Bern by our people. I hear that Battus and Sulcerus will go to Basel. It will be your duty to diligently ensure that your church remains in tranquility.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me as you always do. I have many more news, but they are uncertain to me; I did not want to burden you with them. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 14, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Oswald Myconius, always to be honored as a lord and brother. Basel.</p>
