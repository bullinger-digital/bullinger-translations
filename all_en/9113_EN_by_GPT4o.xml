      <p>Greetings. I wrote my last letter to your venerable kindness, most illustrious man and father in Christ, on October 23.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I have received no letters from your kindness. However, since I have often learned from friends that you are safe and sound, and since nothing has been presented to me that would require serious writing, I did not want to trouble your kindness with my writing. Now, since the bookseller, my godfather, informed me of his journey to you, I wanted to write something at least for the sake of greeting. With great sorrow, we have received the news these days of the death of the most illustrious man and dearest brother in Christ, Mr. Johannes Wolphius, of blessed memory, and we grieve all the more because the passing of such men usually portends other worse evils. Nevertheless, the church must be commended to the supreme shepherd, and we must not despair of his perpetual care and protection. It was recently reported that in France, after a sortie from the city of Montauban, the new admiral sent with an army to the siege was slain; now it is said that the same city was stormed by another army and slaughtered to extermination without any regard for sex or age, although some more prudent people still doubt this disaster. What plans the antichristian devil is stirring up and with what hope they are now devouring all evangelical kingdoms, you will learn from the letter I have enclosed. Indeed, our infinite sins are lamented, which they insolently and atrociously threaten; yet because they rise up petulantly and rabidly against the Lord, he will undoubtedly defend his own cause and the glory of his name.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the document I am sending was communicated to a citizen of Basel by Lazarus Schwendi, who at the same time quietly advises the Swiss cities that confess the gospel to join with the princes and cities of the empire, and promises to ensure that the emperor himself will make an alliance with the evangelicals against the papists who aspire to a tyrannical monarchy; for thus the papists will be deterred from their purpose. However, how much trust should be placed in this Schwendi and also in such a confederation and other human plans, I leave to the more prudent to consider. History testifies who has repelled the onslaught of the Armagnacs and the like, and it is known how successful our countless alliances have been so far. Our most fortified and invincible fortress is true repentance and the invocation of the divine name. In this world, treacheries and more than Punic perfidy dominate everywhere. Meanwhile, such a face of all things appears, through which we are most manifestly warned and aroused to lift up our heads with eager spirit to the coming and the great assembly of the Son of God. For in such great confusion of all things, I do not see what else or better is to be desired henceforth.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with yours. In my name and in the name of the brothers, you will convey greetings to all the fellow ministers of your church.</p>
      <p>Given on November 26, in the year of our Lord 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most faithful overseer of the church of Zurich, his lord and father in Christ, most highly esteemed.</p>
