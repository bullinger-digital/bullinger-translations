      <p>Greetings. Since (I believe) it is easier to find those there than here who are traveling to Tübingen, and almost no one leaves who would ask if you need anything, I am sending this packet addressed to Vergerio to you, so that you may ensure it is delivered to him at your convenience. I have been informed that our people are making the greatest effort to find soldiers to free the sanctuary of Florenz (Florence) from siege. The Turk (as I hear) is greatly lamenting that his court has been desolated by the unexpected death of his younger son.</p>
      <p>He has a third son surviving and a grandson from Mustafa. You can always make use of my services, as I am a most friendly man. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, 3 days before the calends of February.</p>
      <p>Your Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich, dearest friend.</p>
