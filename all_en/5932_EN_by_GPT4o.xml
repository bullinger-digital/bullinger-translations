      <p>Greetings. I send along with your letters, most learned Bullinger, a book of terms related to currency, weights, measures, etc., and I give this to you as a gift, yet I do not thank you as I ought for your outstanding gifts, because I cannot find the words to do so. However, in place of thanks, I offer mutual love and faith, with which I carry you in my heart and never part. Therefore, I wish you (my Bullinger) to be thoroughly convinced that I will diligently take care of all matters that pertain to your interests and benefits, so that the opinion you have of my love and goodwill towards you will never be disappointed, and that in me alone you may easily recognize the dedication and services of all your friends whom you mourn having lost. Nothing has been added or removed from the Basel Confession; it has been taken and printed in its entirety from the old copy. I have nothing new to write to you at present. I pray to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He may protect you, so that you may serve the interests and benefit of His church for a long time. In return, pray for the success of my calling. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your brothers send you many greetings, Mr. Lepusculus, Mr. Severinus, Mr. Battmannus. Convey my greetings to the most learned man Mr. Rodolph Gwalther, Mr. Wolff, Mr. Haller, and the others to whom I am at least known by name, especially to Zwingli, who has always been most loving to me. Again, farewell, my father, who always remains in my heart, and I will never forget you as long as the spirit governs these limbs. Farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 30, 1563, hastily.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Jonas Grasser, Minister of the Church in Rynach, Basel.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, my most esteemed lord, friend, and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
