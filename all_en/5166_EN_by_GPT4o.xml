      <p>S. As it was before, so it goes now.</p>
      <p>Our synod has a gap.</p>
      <p>Yesterday (as I recently informed you) your letters were read before a large congregation of deacons. It was decided to suspend the synod and send our document to you and to the people of Schaffhausen, so that you may give your judgment on this. Here we now implore your help to spur on our people.</p>
      <p>For I fear, I fear, that many are not taking the matter seriously; they are seeking excuses to do nothing. They are not committed to this matter.</p>
      <p>If you take the fire: you will also be put into the fire.</p>
      <p>Your authority, however, will have great influence if you seriously admonish our people to put their hands to the work. Meanwhile, it troubles me that our document is not being sent to other churches as well. We had advised and requested that it be sent to Geneva and Basel in particular; but nothing happened. What if you delayed your response and in the meantime dealt with the people of Geneva? For if it were also approved by them and accepted by our people through your suggestion, the church might perhaps be advised.</p>
      <p>We could easily bear the judgment of all the churches. We would send it to Geneva ourselves; but if our people found out that this was done without their counsel, they would accuse us of betrayal. They might well consider us traitors; for the bitterness is very great.</p>
      <p>It also vexes me that many of the French seem to have a strange conception in their heads about ecclesiastical power and jurisdiction, from which they seem to exclude the magistrate entirely and leave nothing to them except custody.</p>
      <p>They call this ecclesiastical freedom.</p>
      <p>They do indeed acknowledge that magistrates have hitherto and especially from the beginning performed the office of guardians in our churches; but now that the church has grown, they believe it should no longer be under them, but enjoy its own rights, and they accuse those magistrates of robbery who wish to retain the right they have had until now. I fear that this matter will eventually lead to a serious conflagration and create factions greater and more pestilent than those of the Guelphs and Ghibellines ever were.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on His church and grant that we may serve Him in true peace with holiness and righteousness all the days of our life. I have nothing else now, except that yesterday Nicolaus von Grafenried succeeded Dilger in the questorship.</p>
      <p>I regret that the opportunity for your visit to us has been taken from us; you would have been the most welcome guest I could have had in the world. I truly ask you to still consider a journey to us.</p>
      <p>Your presence would have great influence among our people.</p>
      <p>Your friends Steiger, Diesbach, Haller, Hagius, Zehender, Vincent Pfister, my father-in-law, Musculus, and all the brothers greet you. Give my regards to all yours, especially to Mr. Gwalther, Martyr, and my brother, to whom I am not writing anything now. Bern, February 9, 1562.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, forever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
