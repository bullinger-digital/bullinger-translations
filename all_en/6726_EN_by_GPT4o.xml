      <p>Greetings. Yesterday at nightfall, I received your letters, which you sent to me along with 12 copies and three other copies of our common Confession, for all of which I give you great thanks, especially for the one that you inscribed to me personally. May the Lord grant that we may always live and die in harmony with that Confession! I will distribute the remaining copies as you instructed. I gave two to Steiger, one in Latin and one in German, in your name, because he provided us with exceptional assistance in promoting this matter; he thanks you and sends his regards and shared with me these updates, which I am to communicate to you on his behalf. Among other things, I understand that other letters from you are on their way, which I have not yet received, in which you perhaps write about the people of Basel, whose response we are very curious about. Sulzer sent many letters here during those days, in which Mr. Gwalther was there. What he wrote to each, I do not know; with me (for he wrote to me), he skillfully concealed this matter and made no mention of it. I replied to him expressing my surprise as to why he did not write about this; I will hear what he responds. Through the messenger from Geneva, who brought these updates, I conveniently sent both the letters and the copies that pertained to them; they will have them by the next Saturday or Sunday. I have nothing else to write at the moment.</p>
      <p>All friends and brothers send their greetings to you. Greet in my name those who are with you, especially those who are of your household.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 15, 1566.</p>
