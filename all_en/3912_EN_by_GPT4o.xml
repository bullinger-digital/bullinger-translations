      <p> Greetings. The reason my letters have been silent for so long, reverend father in Christ, is that I lack a suitable subject for writing; however, so that I do not seem to use this as an excuse for my laziness, I will resume the duty of writing and finally break the long silence. Dr. Bacaria, who was already recommended to us because his piety was known and observed by us, has become even more commendable to us through your writing. He preached so earnestly and diligently about your services to him that there is no doubt you have placed a benefit with a grateful and mindful person. </p>
      <p> Here indeed he also needed the help of good men; for when he arrived here for the first time with his wife and a young man who accompanied him on his journey, and was received by me for dinner, at that very moment, as we sat at the table, his wife began to feel unwell, and with the pain gradually increasing, she was in a deplorable state of health for a full eight days, so that he was forced to stay with me for twelve whole days. This illness, as I hear, is familiar to his wife and tends to recur at certain intervals; but due to the constant fatigue of the journey, it was then increased beyond measure, so that her life seemed to be in danger. We have had no news for a long time. </p>
      <p> There is no doubt that you have heard from the legate that peace has been made between the Turk and the Emperor; you have surely heard from the same source under what conditions it was concluded. Whether the peace between the French and Philip will succeed is uncertain; the peacemakers had once parted with hostile minds, but with renewed counsel, they have come together again. </p>
      <p> Calais alone causes many difficulties. I hear that the French king has finally agreed to restore Calais after eight years, provided that a marriage takes place between the offspring of the English queen and his son, yet to be born; but everyone sees how far off this is. I hear that Theodoricus Leo, a relative of mine, stood for examination and was appointed by you to the church of Vassersdorf. Although you already have him recommended because of his parent, I earnestly ask you to do what you do even more diligently. If he becomes what I hope he will, he will be worthy of your support. </p>
      <p> But when I consider the corrupt morals of our age, I must fear many things. Therefore, I ask you to be a constant encourager and advisor to him, so that he may continue on the path of studies he has already begun. </p>
      <p> By these services, you will duly pay respects to a pious parent and add a great deal to your merits towards me. I thank you greatly for the book you sent me as a gift; you have long obliged me in many ways, and I hope you will find me grateful someday. I have written these things, reverend father in Christ, so that I would not write nothing, and I will add that our bishop did not go to the assembly; he entrusted the task to our consul Ambrosius, who undertakes this legation on behalf of the Three Leagues and recently joined your people in Constance. The bishop, as I have written before, who has given himself entirely to his belly, no longer admits sound advice; a man otherwise extremely sordid, he has begun to hold feasts during the day beyond custom and habit. He himself labors to entice our senate and citizens with this; but I hope God will not forsake his church. I congratulate your son Heinrich on this new function; I earnestly ask you to greet him warmly on my behalf. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, and take this writing of mine in good part; for today I have dedicated the whole day to travel; we have crossed the highest ridges, so that I could barely write this upon returning in the evening. Do not hesitate to greet your wife, the most honorable matron, and your children on my behalf. Farewell again. </p>
      <p> Chur, April 5, 1559. </p>
      <p> Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and most revered patron. </p>
