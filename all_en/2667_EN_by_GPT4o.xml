      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Most illustrious Bullinger, I have learned from your letters that Bernardinus is dear to you, even in my name. I lovingly embrace this benevolent spirit of yours and congratulate both myself and the holy old man. Indeed, I understand that those whom you perceive to be loved by me are also loved by you. But this is the matter and nature of divine charity, that by its impulse, all things are loved by us, which He loves, who, by a great demonstration of His goodness, does good to all by nature and harms no one. Let us therefore continue to love one another, so that we may become like Him, who has established the love of His entire law and that supreme and absolute perfection, to which we shall one day attain. What you fear, that Bernardinus may not long continue in the office he has begun, we would indeed rightly fear, if in this matter the will of God, who has defined the life of each within its limits, were not more to be regarded than the use and necessity of men. He is of such an age that, having traversed the vast waves of this world's sea, he approaches the harbor through which he will enter the rest of the heavenly homeland. Piety and his well-deserved service demand that we congratulate him on this state, and charity urges us to pray that another shepherd be given to the sheep, whom he began to feed with the gospel among you, once he is taken from this maritime tossing. Nor is it right to fear that the administration of the gospel will ever be lacking to those who have left everything, parents, children, home, fields, and country for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. As for my commentaries on Moses, which have been recently published, do not think that I wished to importunately impose them on you, a very busy man, for reading, which would have been the act of a man desiring to abuse a friend's services and too indulgently loving his own offspring; but I aimed in my letters that, if you should happen to come across certain passages, which today come into dispute and controversy, you would write to me what you think of the method of treating them that I use. For I believe that certain things are touched upon by me in these commentaries, which it is worthwhile for pious and learned men to weigh in these times, besides the method I follow in explaining the Mosaic pedagogy, in which, having examined the types and shadows of both things and persons, I refer all to the Messiah the Savior and to His body, the church. That part of your letters affected me not a little, where you write that you are rendered less eager to conduct affairs, which you attribute partly to advancing age, partly to constant headaches. My dear Bullinger, you must see to it again and again that you seek a remedy for this evil from yourself, that is, that you reduce somewhat the immense labors you have hitherto sustained and share them with others, so that you may carry on what you do more eagerly and more steadfastly for a longer time; for we are not made of stone and iron, that we should bear those labors with the same cheerfulness in old age as we did in youth. May God, the preserver of this universe, preserve you in His Son, the Messiah, the Savior, so that you, who have hitherto deserved well of the good and pious by your zeal, work, and diligence, may continue to deserve well in the future by amplifying the name of the Lord. You wish for me to be blessed by the Lord and to be retained by Him in true simplicity and in the sincerity of holy religion, for which your concern for me I give great thanks. For what could you wish for me more excellent, or I desire from God? But indeed, since there is a twofold simplicity, one joined with ignorance of the oracles and will of God, the other a participant in the knowledge of the divine mind, I am grateful for your prayer because you add "in true simplicity," which embraces the knowledge of God revealed in the sacred scriptures and is free from the leaven of carnal prudence and wisdom. Farewell, most illustrious man, and keep me commended in your prayers to the Lord. Basel, July 6.</p>
