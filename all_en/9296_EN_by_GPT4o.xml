      <p>Greetings. I send back to your kindness, most illustrious man and most revered father in Christ, what you shared with me, received from friends, and for these, as I ought, I give the greatest thanks. They were indeed most welcome, especially those things that your friend from Nuremberg sent to you about the people of Wittenberg. I share in return what a friend received in Innsbruck these days, along with what I have added by my own hand, which you can trust as much as they deserve. The Prince of Innsbruck requested passage through our city; but how much these people can be trusted, I do not know, especially in this most treacherous age. How much the Austrians favor us is well known to the whole world. They say he is bringing with him three cardinals, who are to correct the lives of the priests; it is also said that the Cardinal of Augsburg has died in Rome, and you know very well what a traitor to Germany he always was. Our infinite sins provoke even the heavens and all of nature against us, and there is hardly anyone who sincerely repents. May the Lord have mercy on us and preserve his little flock. Amen.</p>
      <p>I have no more to write at present, therefore, I beg you to excuse the brevity.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ. All friends reverently send their regards to your kindness; I earnestly ask that you deign to convey greetings in my name and that of my brothers to your entire college with the utmost reverence.</p>
      <p>Written hastily on the 22nd of April in the year of our Lord 1573. Your most devoted Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, lord and father in Christ, most highly revered. Zürich.</p>
