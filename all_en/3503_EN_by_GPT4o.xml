      <p>Greetings. I have absolutely nothing now except this one thing: I beg you to diligently take care of these letters and urge that a response be given to us. Our relative explains to us that she has been defrauded of her property and is in poverty. If we understand that this is indeed the case, action will be taken against those who have wronged the poor woman. Write by the next courier.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the pious.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, 11th of February, in the year 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, my most esteemed and dear lord and godfather. Chur.</p>
