    <p xml:id="regest1">He is surprised that Myconius and Grynaeus have not responded after he requested their opinion on his book "De origine erroris" [No. 1239]. A letter from Rome indicates that in Florence, a plot instigated by Pope [Paul III] against Duke [Cosimo I] has failed, Sicily is threatened by the Turks, a German delegation has advocated in Rome for an alliance against the Evangelicals, and in England, the French crown prince [Henry] is to be installed as king and married to Mary [Tudor], the daughter of Catherine [of Aragon]. Greetings; recommendation of Gwalther.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You would reproach me, Myconius dearest, if I had sent you no letters for so long a time, as I now lack yours. Either I have offended you or you must not be well. However, I would prefer that you express this freely rather than remain silent forever.</p>
      <p>I sent to you and Grynaeus a copy of the book "De Origine Erroris." I had asked for your judgment, but no one has responded even a word. Perhaps you have not yet had the opportunity to go through it. And you write nothing about your affairs.</p>
      <p>A friend from Rome writes these days that a certain person was captured in Florence, who says and confesses that he was sent by the pope to poison the duke, so that Aloysius could be imposed on the Florentines. The same writes that the Turk, with a very equipped fleet, threatens Sicily. He writes that certain German envoys were present in Rome for the consecration of a certain alliance against the evangelicals; but he does not know what was done, etc. He also thinks that war is being prepared against the English, to expel him from the kingdom and to substitute the dauphin for him. When this has been done, by the authority of the supreme pontiff, his wife, of papal blood, will be separated from him, and Mary, the daughter of Catherine of Spain repudiated by the English, will be joined to him in marriage, etc. He writes these and other truculent and treacherous things from Rome, who is not entirely ignorant of the practices of the Romans. I wanted to share these with you; if perhaps other things of this kind have become known to you, please let me know.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, that with the antichrist overthrown, He Himself may reign and triumph in His church. Farewell together with Mr. Grynaeus and the others. You will have my Gwalther commended to you. April 12, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, dearest brother.</p>
