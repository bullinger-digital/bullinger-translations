      <p>The things I wrote about the siege of our city are feared more by some than they truly need to be feared. Herr Gerion Seyler, due to some rumors spread in Bavaria, was placed under the custody of the Bavarian prince, as I mentioned, but was later released. The papists fear for themselves more than necessary; our people, on the other hand, present themselves as more fierce than they truly are. At the Ingolstadt assembly, envoys of three princes (I do not know which ones, but not from the evangelicals) have come, perhaps to settle this dispute. Cardinal of Lorraine was killed by a cannonball fired by someone whose brother he had ordered to be burned; this was reported to me as certain today. I hear nothing about what our Emperor is doing; however, I hear things which I do not dare to speak of, as they are not yet sufficiently verified. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on the 8th of March in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Reverence's most devoted, Georg von Stetten the Younger.</p>
