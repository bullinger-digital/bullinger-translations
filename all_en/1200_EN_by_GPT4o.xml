      <p>Greetings. Today I received your letters, which you sent on February 27th; they were brought to me from Murten, from which I gather that the Italian, whoever he is, to whom you entrusted them, did not pass this way. I owe you greater thanks than I can express or repay for the fifth most learned Decade of your sermons. I will read it with great eagerness as soon as I find the time. However, regarding the delay you reproach me for at the beginning of your letters, I believe I have satisfied you in the meantime, so no further apology is needed; not forgetting my promise, I sent letters through Zingg, your courier, along with the confession of the foreigners' church in England by Mr. a Lasco and the mandate of our senate, where I added what news I had at the time. Now I have nothing, except that the Diet of Augsburg has ended and the recess, as they call it, was read to all the estates on February 14th. Many of the estates refused to sign, especially, as they say, Maurice, the Bishop of Trier, left with great indignation.</p>
      <p>The French envoy, having returned from there, told Schertli that it would be quite safe for the French this year from the Emperor's force; likewise, Ferdinand refused all of the Emperor's requests, and they parted not in good peace. It is gathered from this that the Emperor will now pursue only one thing, that the council proceeds; certainly, everything tends in that direction. Therefore, we must be vigilant, pray, insist, and cry out, if ever before, as you rightly advise, and we will not fail in our duty with the Lord providing strength and growth. If only the Swiss churches had one heart and one soul! I would not yet despair of success; therefore, we must focus solely on ensuring harmony among us.</p>
      <p>As for Vadian's letters, Schertli, who is here now, judges them to be entirely different and asserts with many arguments that they could not have been a deception; whether they are, I do not know, the Lord knows. I truly pity the people of Magdeburg, who are thus deprived of all human aid; may divine power be with them, so that they overcome all evil and do not fall into the hands of that most ferocious beast!</p>
      <p>We have not yet seen the book of that Spanish Bishop of Guadix. Musculus would like you or Bibliander to respond to him, whom we all wonder at for living and studying so quietly, when there are so many and such great evils in the church, which should provoke those with any gift in this matter to write. Perhaps Musculus himself will write about this matter.</p>
      <p>I wanted to respond to your letters in passing. Vergerius himself also sent a copy of his writing, which you added to yours; today I asked Fricker to translate it and make it understandable to us, which he promised to do. He sends his greetings to you, as do Mr. Quaestor, Schertli, Musculus, and the other brothers, but especially my household sends greetings to you and yours; I also bid them farewell. Here you also have Farel's letters, which he sent to me these days. Farewell. Bern, March 3, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his venerable and uniquely esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
