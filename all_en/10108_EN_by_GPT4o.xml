    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's package of letters has arrived, and Haller subsequently informed the responsible council members about the situation in Bremgarten and urged them to be vigilant. Megander is working on restoring unity among the evangelical cities, but shares little about it with Haller. Otter has been summoned to Augsburg; according to Capito, the hostility of the Lutherans towards the Swiss is great there. Haller emphasizes his difficulties in interpreting the Epistle to the Romans, praises Bullinger's latest works, complains about the contentiousness of the Bernese preachers, and shares his concerns about catechism instruction in Bern with him. Wilhelm Zwingli is well. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I had just dispatched the messenger whom our council is sending to yours, dearest Heinrich, when behold, someone brings a bundle of letters from you while I am dining, from whose mouth I immediately learned that the rumor about you spread here is false. Having read your letters, since it was clear that our prefect of Lenzburg had the same cause of the people of Bremgarten recommended to us, I immediately presented what was necessary during dinner to Hagius and other senators present, and urged them to take more diligent and timely care, so that they could not neglect it without loss of their rights, not to mention the piety or the loss of pious citizens, lest delay bring greater danger. They have long been admonished in public by Franz, who is entirely devoted to Bremgarten, to consider the cause of the brothers, whose jurisdiction they wish to enjoy.</p>
      <p>Moreover, when I was listening in the morning while lying on my gouty bed, I had myself lifted so that I could respond to other matters. Megander is working on reconciling the cities, both with you and with the people of Schaffhausen through Erasmus, but I do not know how much he has achieved so far. He keeps his matters silent and only shares what he cannot conceal with any honesty. He writes to Leo many times and vice versa, but I believe never to you. For as we are men subject to emotions, I fear he may envy the glory (which belongs to the Lord) that you have among your people and ours. But let this be my carnal judgment, perverse as it is. I wish he had the first authority before the magistrate and the people. He will hardly regain it, no matter how much he now acts differently in his sermons. For where he teaches with utmost gentleness, those who are embittered against him consider it hypocrisy, and where he mixes in harsher words, they say he has not yet shed his old skin. I hope, however, that if he perseveres in this way, authority will return.</p>
      <p>Capito has called Otter from Aarau to Augsburg. The council agreed, but on the condition that he returns. Capito has long since left Augsburg, waiting for Otter in Ulm. From his letters, I understand that the Lutherans will cause us more trouble than the Papists. They proclaim it a greater sin to share our sacraments than those of the Papists. In Augsburg, he found a sect of Sadducees with a very poor opinion of the resurrection, and he wrote nothing else to us than what he also wrote to you.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you write about the Epistle to the Romans, namely that it is plain, provided it is treated plainly and purely, you add that few or none have touched upon this. Behold, what I gather from it. Megander taught it quite learnedly, but in many things, it did not satisfy me. Melanchthon arranged the discourse of the entire epistle. Here, when I thought I would achieve something - but very little indeed. All these things leave this epistle almost desperate for me. But I am pleased with what you promise in the New Testament, at least in Paul, to provide. Just don't let the printers rush you.</p>
      <p>I have read the discourse on the prophetic function, not without profit. For what I have long pressed in my heart and seemed to be despised by many, you have expressed, indeed opportunely. And if only the method of preaching had come to light a year ago: The truth would not have been made so hateful by so many mockeries, jests, and sneers. It had almost come to the point in Bern that if someone did not ridicule both the magistrate and the people of the mountains and also Papism with the most shameful and ridiculous things, he did not seem to be preaching. Indeed, it was said in the sermon that those who preached the gospel, that is, "For God so loved the world" [John 3:16], and did not inveigh so harshly against everyone, were false prophets. My conscience is satisfied. I will let others rage, rant, and be angry. I will attempt whatever I can with gentleness, yet not neglecting its own salt.</p>
      <p>What you have given on John is complete, brief, and opens the genuine sense of the passages so plausibly that I am amazed at myself why I considered some passages more obscure, which you show clearer than light. Your judgment on the testimony of water, blood, and spirit pleases, and you are the first with whom I find such an easy and open sense. Certainly, unless you had extorted it, I would not have given my judgment, which I have long thought was undoubted with you, how much authority you have with me, how much your genius pleases me. The brothers buy in heaps from us what comes from you. They also expect with such great desire what Pellicanus is producing. Our Megander deems no annotations or spirits worthy of reading. He rejects everything unless it is from Zwingli. Hence, he also utters a wonderful and inconsiderate judgment in many things. I despise no one, I respect and venerate the labors and spirits of all, and I am greatly delighted when I find my spirit among others. You should plainly think this of me: Whatever would displease or I would not understand from yours, I would immediately write to you. I have urged Franz, a good and pious old man, but plainly infirm, to read yours as well. I await your judgment on the synodal acts, concerning the study and predestination.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, pray to God that our ministry may not be in vain, and work diligently and carefully in the Hebrews. It suits me excellently: I do not know how to devise, while pondering, how we might establish a catechism for the youth of our city. We see them being openly neglected, however much we exhort to pious and holy education, nor do I know how these things are established with you. In summary: the more I write, the more falls to me. I hope to come to Lenzburg this summer. I will call you there and make use of you to my heart's content.</p>
      <p>Farewell now. Gout does not allow more, my dearest Heinrich.</p>
      <p>March 23, before dawn, as I spent almost the whole night sleepless.</p>
      <p>Yours, Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>Write more often to Tilmann, so that he may be entirely recalled, and also to Hagius. Zwingli is in excellent health, highly commended to us all. Greet his mother, Pellicanus, Leo, Carolstadt, and others.</p>
