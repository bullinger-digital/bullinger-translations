      <p>To the most Christian Bullinger, may the Lord keep you in the ministry of His word. I fear that my letters have not reached you; for I have sent three, two from St. Gallen, and another from there, for you are not accustomed to not responding to those who love and respect you in the Lord. Therefore, I am eagerly expecting your letters, which will instruct me about all matters. I had requested from you the reasons why you refused this alliance along with the articles proposed to you by the King of the French; I consider both to be very necessary for me with the Lords of Venice when I come to them. Therefore, I ask you to assist me in this matter and at the same time add what has subsequently followed in the same cause, then indicate whether you have received all my letters, and finally, to send this to Basel as soon as possible and take care to send the copies that were to be sent from Geneva to Froschauer. I have long since received from Lord Blasius the ones you gave. Greet (please) those holy ones of God in my name and love me in the Lord, in whom may you fare well. I will remain here until the assembly, which will be held in these parts on the 17th of this month. The ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur, on the 8th of July, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Balthasar Altieri.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious bishop of the Church of Zürich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his ever-honored lord. Zürich.</p>
