      <p>Since I have come across this opportune messenger, most honorable Bullinger, I did not want to miss the chance to send these to you. I recently sent you a letter through Froschauer, which was held with me longer than I would have liked due to the lack of a courier. In the meantime, nothing new has been brought here or arisen here. It was written to us here in Augsburg from the Emperor's court that His Majesty had decided to leave there on the 25th of September; however, during all the intervening days, we have received no certain news whether they have left there or not. Six companies of infantry will remain in Augsburg, whether for the defense or oppression of the city, I do not quite know, and indeed the city will pay them wages. Today I was told that the Emperor has 4000 cavalry in the Duchy of Luxembourg and that Martin Rossius is soon to arrive with very large (if one is inclined to believe it) forces of cavalry and infantry to invade France. Indeed, I can hardly believe that the Emperor will attempt anything in war this year, unless he intends to draw the Frenchman out of Italy and divide his forces. And since the Turk is persecuting Christians with great disasters both in Africa and in Hungary, it is likely that the Emperor will call a diet (assembly), so that with the help of the empire's estates and allied arms, he may resist the Turk and the Frenchman, which he will do more conveniently in these parts than in the Netherlands. Whatever it will be, we will know soon. Commend me to Mr. Butler the Englishman and to your family. My duties towards you will remain constant. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, the last day of September in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>Christopher Mont.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious in piety and learning, Mr. Bullinger, most esteemed friend.</p>
