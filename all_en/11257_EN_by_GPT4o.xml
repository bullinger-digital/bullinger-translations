    <p xml:id="regest1">Will speak with Jakob [Zorn] based on Bullinger's letter and hopes that he can stay [in Alterswilen]. Inquires with Capito about his travel plans and is convinced that [the Concord] is best promoted by remaining still; what Bucer's journey to Hesse and Wittenberg has brought will be revealed upon his return. Delighted to hear about the positive developments in Zurich; the divine warnings are not new, but are rarely taken seriously. Count [Wilhelm] of Fürstenberg came to Konstanz only because he was nearby with his brother [Friedrich].</p>

      <p>I will confer with Jakob based on your letters when he returns to me. I wish he could stay longer, as there are very few who can be suitably substituted, and it is dangerous if the churches remain vacant.</p>
      <p>Today I am sending letters to Capito, in which I ask him to inform me of his travel plans as much as possible; I will share the received response with you as well. Otherwise, things are going well now, and I have always thought that silence can most conveniently remedy controversies. Bucer has been away in Hesse for a long time and is still said to be in Wittenberg; we will hear later what his return will bring.</p>
      <p>Ah, how it delights me that you write about the daily progress in piety and good letters among you! May the Lord strengthen this progress more and more. What the Lord threatens us with is not new; he has warned us with some portent for many years now, but faith is rare.</p>
      <p>Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg did nothing else here except visit the city; he was nearby with his brother Friedrich, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and do not cease to love me and pray for me. I wish the whole family to be well. January 17, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the ornament of the Zurich church, a brother to be respected.</p>
