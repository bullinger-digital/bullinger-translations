      <p>I do not doubt that you bear my long silence with difficulty, especially after receiving so many letters; but I ask you to attribute this partly to the many and great occupations that overwhelm me, if ever before, and partly to the scarcity of couriers, to whom I think these matters can be safely entrusted. Now, however, since this unexpected opportunity has presented itself to me, now that I am already prepared for the journey, I would also like to be excused for the brevity of my letter, even though I have many things to write about. First of all, know that all your letters have been delivered to me. I am very grateful to you for taking such diligent and safe care to have them delivered to Baron von Saliceto, and I ask you to write to me if you incurred any expenses here. As for Baron von Alt-Sachsen, his response was both kind and prudent, and it was very pleasing to our senate; therefore, everyone strongly asks you to express great thanks to him in the name of the entire senate as soon as possible and to assure him that we will always remember his excellent goodwill. The situation is as follows: with rumors of us being besieged in some way, our people thought it necessary to test the disposition of anyone they could, especially those whose goodwill they had previously known either by deed or word; therefore, they wanted to engage somewhat with Baron von Alt-Sachsen, so that if later needed and if our allies (namely the Bernese, on whose protection we depend after God) agreed, they could also use his assistance. To ensure this was done properly and rightly, they asked that he would not mind coming here himself, so that after discussing the matter in person, something could be decided by common consent with the allies upon his return. Now, by the grace of God, we seem to have no need for this concern; for it appears that the Spaniards will scarcely approach us within a day's journey, nor do they have the forces they have been boasting about for so many months. Moreover, quite a few of those whom this city received during times of persecution, upon hearing these rumors, have immediately rushed here, at least three hundred, most of them of chosen courage and some also distinguished in military expertise. If we had not repelled the arriving crowd by sending letters everywhere, I would certainly think that we would soon have a full army, and a well-equipped one at that. Therefore, with these citizens joined by the Bernese garrison, which we have especially decided to use, we will be more than adequately protected against sudden invasions, so that there is no need to seek further assistance from anyone. This is our current condition, with our studies otherwise not yet disturbed by the grace of God. In France, the churches are quite peaceful, and perhaps the fear of an English war, unless Calais is restored, will at least temporarily restrain the enemies.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I hear that our people are very prepared for any event and very attentive to everything. Regarding the Belgian matter, you see that I was not rashly despairing at the beginning. Our Dathenus has finally returned safely to the prince through many dangers; he writes that everything has been overthrown, all the brothers expelled by solemn edicts, and even Antwerp itself, with a six-day safe conduct granted, not even excluding the Martinists, who now pay the just penalties for their treachery.</p>
      <p>Uranius has also left the city and is preparing a retreat to Germany, and he too will indeed pay the just penalties for his actions. Only Broderoclius, deserted by all, still remains strong, but with no hope of assistance, since Ludwig von Nassau has not sent even a letter, let alone the promised support, for three months. In all regions, everything is more than full of Turkish cruelty, and this indeed is the outcome of imprudent counsels according to the flesh. Nevertheless, I do not doubt that all things work together for good for the truly pious, and that our people will ultimately prevail there too, more by enduring than by fighting, whose cause it is most just, indeed absolutely necessary, that we lament and intercede for with the Lord in constant prayers. By now, you have undoubtedly heard about the death of the elder Landgrave, the surrender of Gotha, Johann Friedrich being captured under certain conditions, namely to present himself to the imperial tribunal to state his case, and Krombach being handed over to the hands of Augustus himself. What will follow, the Lord knows. Regarding the English matter, I hope you will not be upset that I have retained the letters sent to you from there for so long, which I now send back to you. Besides that one letter written to the Londoners, which was communicated to you by Viburnus last autumn, I have written nothing at all, and although often asked by the brothers, I have not wanted to involve myself further in this matter, not only for the reason you write (for it was not difficult to notice that some were more difficult than they should be), but also because I know that whatever proceeds from this church displeases that queen and some of her flatterers so much that I cannot help the struggling brothers even in the most just cause. As for the matter itself, although I see contrary things being affirmed by both sides, I cannot hide from you that I am very much opposed to that episcopal domination, of which I can hope for no other outcome than the overthrow of true religion, and such that the latter will be worse than the former.</p>
      <p>Whether I conjecture these things truly or rashly, time will show. But I see that the letter has grown while waiting for the messenger, so at the beginning there was no need to excuse the brevity of this letter. Our D. Gualther's son is at peace. We are very grateful for the reminders from you about our people there. The colleagues and the whole assembly greet you with all their hearts, and I especially do so.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest father; may the Lord Jesus keep you and bless your venerable old age more and more. I especially wish our D. Gualther well. Farewell again. Geneva, May 3.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the Zurich church and a father to me, most worthy of respect.</p>
