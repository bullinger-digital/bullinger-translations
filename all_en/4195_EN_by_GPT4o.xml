      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, dearest and most esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Since Christ has so emphasized love in the gospel, commanding us to do good even to the enemies of truth and bloodthirsty foes, I could not, therefore, because of your instilled excellent and holy integrity, feel ashamed to greet you, an apostle worthy in many respects, with my rustic letter. Nor would I have easily attempted this by my own virtue and prudence, as I am far inferior and dissimilar to you in intellect and all gifts, unless, indeed, I was compelled by the persistent requests of good men to confront my own inadequacy, and I have as the principal authors and architects of this, Lord Matthias Erb, a sweet and gentle old man, and also Johannes Anastasius [Veluanus?], your closest brothers and friends. I came to your old friend and fellow countryman Geta Matthias Erb on the day before the calends of October of the past year, bringing with me the testimonies of good and faithful men, after having spent four years with the venerable man Johannes Anastasius in the valleys, to whose piety, morals, and judgment I wholly submit myself. But enough of this. Regarding my condition, which I endure in Riquewihr, my homeland and joyful disposition, I am sure you will be informed by our Erb, my most beloved patron, who is my life and comfort on earth. For my province is such as should be for pious and good young men, namely, the education of children, which you know well to be difficult and laborious, and also abundant in sweet and pleasant fruits, if only we are diligent in our duty, as is fitting and very honorable.</p>
      <p>And, dearest Bullinger, to confess the truth, I taste, sip, and touch everything in my labors, and my work will not be lacking to pious men both in schools and in the church and the most holy vineyard of Christ. Nor have all labors been so difficult for me, once I recognized such a sweet, pious, and manageable friendship and connection between you and Erb, of which I do not at all doubt I will soon be a partner and participant. And if I achieve this through your work and instilled humanity, I will consider myself most blessed, and the same will be perfect, complete, and thus fulfilled if you respond kindly to your Karl through Hartmann von Halwil, a most pious nobleman, and send us some booklet published and elaborated by your diligence, by which I may more and more recognize your candor and spirit towards me. I departed from the valleys because of the savage and cruel tyranny of the governors and pastors, who began to plot against my studies and safety because of the Eucharist and its mystical exposition, which (thanks to the most good and great God) I absorbed from your writings and those of your followers, so that I owe much to Christ Jesus and to you in this regard, to Christ, as He, through the Holy Spirit, has kindled this light in my innermost being and desires that all come to the knowledge of the truth, and to you, for illuminating those shining and bright sparks in divine volumes from your books. For I firmly believe and do not at all doubt that the supper is a sacrament, that is, as Augustine testifies in book 10 of 'The City of God', likewise the pontiffs in the canon law on consecration, distinction 2, and the scholastic doctors in book 4 of the Sentences, a sign of a sacred thing and the visible form of invisible grace. For the sign and visible form, whether the adversaries like it or not, is bread and wine in the supper, but the sacred thing and invisible grace, which is given with the sign, is the body of Christ once delivered for us and His blood once shed for us. Here you have, dearest brother in Christ, the open and unfeigned confession of your Karl, which if it cannot be professed openly in this company, as is at hand and you will learn more fully from Erb's letters, I would rather migrate to you and pour out openly with you in the vineyard of Jesus, our redeemer and savior, what I can through Christ's grace and ineffable mercy. Nor, as I hope, will there ever be a lack of a place for me in Zürich, either publicly in schools teaching the logical arts and the first rudiments of the Greek language or teaching publicly. Concerning all these things, inform us at the first opportunity and impart to us the consolation we greatly need in this time, and especially to Erb, who (alas) is now worn out and exhausted by old age, cares, diseases, and labor, and is easily a thorn and splinter in the eyes of our Wittenbergers, however sad and weak an old man he may be, and the Lord of the harvest must be earnestly prayed to, that He may preserve him, a valetudinarian, for us and His church as long as possible and send forth and thrust out someone similar, adorned with such virtues, learning, piety, constancy, and authority, into our vineyard.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus be with you and the church entrusted to you and with all your fellow students, whom you will exhort to newness of life. Again, farewell in the Lord and remember us and the impending evils.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, as you can easily see, on the 20th day of January in the year 1560. In Riquewihr. Your Karl Fabricius of Düsseldorf.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and well-deserving man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his esteemed lord.</p>
