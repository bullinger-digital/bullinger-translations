    <p xml:id="regest1">Is astonished by the lie that he has recanted his previous doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Württemberg Concord with Schnepf. Duke Ulrich commanded both not to claim that the other had abandoned his earlier view. Many pastors are satisfied with the Concord. Blarer and his followers have always taught, contrary to other claims: Wine and bread are not just symbols; Christ's body and blood are truly present in the Lord's Supper. This is in agreement with the Augsburg Confession, to which the Württemberg pastors are committed. Bible passages against enemies and the godless. Three enclosures with an insertion, a title suggestion along with a justification, in case Bullinger wants to publish Blarer's explanation in the form of an open letter, as well as an improvement. Johannes Wagner is the letter carrier. Georg Distel returns.</p>

      <p>Regarding my alleged recantation concerning the article on the Lord's Supper, I am deeply troubled by who could have spread such a shameless lie in the first place. It must have been the deceitful Satan, who has never stood in the truth from the beginning, spewing this through his many messengers to the detriment of the truth, which, God willing, shall not prevail. In my agreement with my dear lord and fellow brother Master Erhart Schnepf on this matter, I have not conceded a single word beyond what I have often and extensively taught here in Constance and in other Swabian cities. I also testified before the aforementioned Schnepf and the prince himself that I would not in any way abandon my previous opinion and teaching through such concord. The Christian prince himself has also willed and orally commanded us both that neither of us should claim that the other has abandoned his previous opinion, but that we have agreed on a path and measure that is acceptable to both parties. Furthermore, all prominent and notable servants of the word of God are well satisfied with this concord and agreement, as I have friendly and brotherly letters from them on this matter. It is not as many people think or want to believe, that they or I have taught our churches that in the gracious Lord's Supper there is nothing but wine and bread, or that the holy sacraments are merely signs of the absent Christ; for what benefit would this be to the believers? Rather, it has always been earnestly and truthfully presented by us that the true body and true blood of Christ are truly present and offered in His Supper, as the Saxon Confession, recently presented to His Imperial Majesty at the Diet of Augsburg, simply states. This confession in this article has also been commanded by our gracious prince and lord to be presented to the pastors in his princely dominion, or to those who have remained from the previously appointed, and to instruct their churches in this manner, with a serious injunction that everyone should remain with the other and leave further inquiry alone, and also refrain from all slander or defamation on this account. Indeed, such a thoroughly Christian intention and action of the pious prince angers the devil, who thinks of taking revenge in another way. Yet the Lord will soon crush him under our feet. Therefore, let the world be the world and act according to its nature. "He who is in us is greater than he who is in the world" [1 John 4:4]. Our adversaries always tend to bring up something to comfort themselves in the decline of their realm, which daily vanishes under their hands, and to make themselves some solace and joy. But, as it is written: "The triumph of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment" [Job 20:5]. May the faithful God and Father in heaven sanctify and preserve us through the truth of His powerful and everlasting word unto eternal life. Amen.</p>

      <p>I would like these inserted immediately after these words from the beginning: "The deceitful Satan, who has never stood in the truth from the beginning, spews this through his many messengers to the detriment of the truth, which, God willing, shall not prevail" - here insert the following: "just as little as he has spread many other splendid lies through his members, such as that I supposedly fled from Constance, or that I am no longer allowed to return to Esslingen or other cities where I have preached, along with countless other insignificant rumors, whose falsehood is clearer than day and do not require a response. I am well accustomed to such slander and insults. We are no better than our Lord and Savior Christ, who promised us no other reward for all our faithful service in the world than disgrace, shame, and persecution. He truly exemplified Christian patience, and that we may possess our souls in patience and persevere to the end." Now add: "In my agreement with my dear lord and fellow brother Master Erhart Schnepf on this matter, I have not conceded a single word" etc.</p>
      <p>What if you take care to print these in slightly larger type? But not as if ordered by me, nor should any name be prefixed, but this title: "On the Recantation of Ambrosius Blarer, an excerpt from a letter written by him to a good friend in the year 1534, October 6." This title would make the adversaries immediately seize whatever it is on the page. Perhaps one or two pages would be filled, or it might be necessary to print it on a single sheet. Do what seems best. Suppress or publish, as you judge to be expedient for the glory of Christ and my name. For I would like to vindicate both, if I can, although I do not want anything to be published here as if officially by me. And be careful not to add anything else.</p>
      <p>What I wrote to you today through Johannes Wagner, among other things, is as follows: "Rather, it has always been earnestly and truthfully presented by us that the true body and true blood" etc., which I would like corrected as follows, if you think it should be printed: "that the body and blood of Christ are truly present and offered in the Lord's Supper." For this is how the Saxon Confession has it in Latin, so that "true" refers not to the body and blood, but to the presence and offering. Not that this matters at all, but since it seemed appropriate to cite that confession here, it would be fitting to render it in those very words, lest, as some are superstitious, they think I deliberately wanted to change what they would prefer unchanged.</p>
