      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Here you have, Bullinger my brother, Michael Back, who was thrown into prison and chains here, already flogged and banished for a cause that could never seem so bad to good men and those who understand the gospel of Christ. His wife, Margareta, was drowned because she married two husbands, and she passed away in such a way that no one doubts she has gone to Christ. I commend the surviving husband to you and all yours, for he is truly worthy. He tended his sheep and administered the church entrusted to him with such faith and diligence that it is with the greatest sorrow of all that he has been banned from this jurisdiction. I am not inclined nor is it safe to write about the cause itself, which would not have fallen upon most. But farewell, and receive this minister of Christ as my own heart.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, July 7, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, his Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
