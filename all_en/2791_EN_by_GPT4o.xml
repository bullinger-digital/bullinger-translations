      <p>Greetings. Your letters reached me in due time, most learned Bullinger; for a long time I awaited an opportunity to write to you, which was certainly abundant if I consider the things I wanted you to know, but none if I consider the opportunity of trustworthy messengers. Therefore, I wish to send these to you now that I have found a messenger going as far as Constance, which I want to be shared with you and Mr. Gesner, whom I wish to greet most warmly in my name. I am sending you a collection of news, but which, due to delay, have already become old; for I collected them gradually as they were brought to me.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the confession of a certain pious priest and the entire history of this matter, which you will be able to understand from the anonymous letters sent to me, as well as the confession and history of the learned, pious, and most upright Bavarian noble Hertzhainer. The Bavarian nobility is entirely consistent in seeking the preaching of truth. The prince wanted to obtain from the pope for several years the communion of both kinds, the marriage of priests, and the eating of meat; but the Bavarian envoy returned from Rome with the matter unresolved. The prince considered more the appeasement of his subjects in this petition than the salvation of souls; for he does not dare easily to ask for financial aid, which he greatly needs, from his subjects unless he has something to offer from the pope in religion. Thus, he holds the wolf by the ears and does not know whether he dares to convene the selection of his subjects or not; for if convened, they will repeat the old song about seeking religion, and if not convened, he will lack until he convenes, and if he convenes, he will have no aid unless he gives; for they will give so that it is given to them in return. That Adam of Ulm, who has been in Munich for another year, freely preaches Christ and sharply criticizes opponents and perpetually offers himself to defend the truth, detesting private masses, sacrifices for the living and the dead, and other things with the strongest testimonies of the scriptures. He has two antagonists, both of whom, although each has great authority with the prince, as hypocrisy easily ensnares the minds of the imprudent, one a Franciscan, the other a Dominican born in Lower Germany, a very impudent man, who is said to be something in sophistry, who have dealings with him. He preaches at court and is almost worshipped by the prince, and when Adam recently snatched the handles from the hands in his church and with great applause from the whole church, especially refuted the false interpretation of the wedding garment, for works are to be understood by this garment, the Dominican monk wanted to prove with the testimonies of the fathers, omitting the argument about the church, about the inveterate custom, about councils and traditions, he fled to another refuge, which he perpetually thrusts forward and moved other promoters of lies to do the same, namely that it is a sign that the papists stand with the truth, while others stand with lies, because hardly three or four among those Lutheran innovators can be found who agree among themselves, but if 3 or 4 thousand Catholics agree, they all think and say the same. The common people and the prince of the common people are rendered very perplexed by this kind of argument. It would be beneficial, my Bullinger, to collect in some handbook, in which councils have fought among themselves, especially in which Dominicans are condemned by other cowled ones, in which also Franciscans rage against the more lenient and these again against them, all these against the Carthusians, shaved ones and those they call priests and laymen miserably tear apart all monks, etc. Therefore, I ask you to entrust this task to some idle person, who will also refer to the places from their rules where the discord of these concordant ones is shown and place that fictitious concord before the eyes. The simplicity of the Bavarians, yet pious for Christ... onem. Your antitheses are more learned than can be understood by the common people; therefore, it will be necessary to consider the understanding of the Bavarians and to lower oneself to their capacity. The monk thinks this Gordian knot is insoluble, which can easily be untied, yet it would be better to publish this work and especially if they were hanged by the noose they themselves set for you (or are setting). This would happen if such controversies were collected from the different rules of different monastic orders. Those rules are not known to the unlearned; true arguments from the scriptures would follow later. For the tumult of the nations and the vain meditations of the people would sufficiently declare what the concord of kings and princes against the son of God Christ had contrived. The same is also demonstrated by the unanimous consensus of Annas, Caiaphas, and Pilate, therefore no Christian should obey the consensus of those who do not agree in Christ, but rather the yoke of those should be cast off and their bonds broken. Thus the monk lies excellently when he triumphs over the concord of councils, when it is clear to the bleary-eyed how discordant they were. Many of these can indeed be collected from different books, but no one, as far as I know, has treated this in a work written for this purpose.</p>
      <p>I would not write these things to you, my Bullinger, unless I experienced in reality how much that rascal imposes on the more sensible with such deceit; they see our discord openly, and they hear that concord, which resists the truth, being boasted about; but they do not understand how discordant that concord is. I have attached the description of the recess of the diet in a bundle of letters; but later 4 printed copies were brought, one of which fell to me. Soon others will follow concerning politics and public peace. But those that pertain to religion, I wanted to send to you completely finished. Mr. Gesner communicated some experiments to my friend Achilles. I ask that he share them with me for copying. I will give in return those which I once received by hereditary right from the greatest masters of experience, namely those collected by Penerus, Stockerus, and Peter Burkhard. For each of them practiced medicine for over 40 years.</p>
      <p>I will add my own experiments, either new or those of others which I have found to be true. Experiments are indeed deceptive, but still such that they can be more correctly applied by an experienced physician. There remains another matter to be written to you and to Mr. Gesner, an excellent man. A pious, learned, and most sincere man imposed on me to write for his friendship with me. King Ferdinand has an Italian physician, though stammering in German, named Julius Alexandrinus, who has also become known to the world through published writings. He has great authority with the king, and because he favors religion and comes to Christ by night and is daily more and more inflamed with the ardor of religion, so that I certainly promise myself that he will one day and perhaps soon even in his grove with a certain Joseph seek the body of Christ for burial. Therefore, if anyone, he is considered especially useful, who can one day persuade the king, with whom he always speaks familiarly about various things in the morning before the fire, when the king is dressing, to listen.</p>
      <p>King Maximilian, the king's son, places more hope in Julius than in himself to bend his stubborn father. Julius greatly helped me in obtaining a privilege for surgical work. The characters of the Gesners, which were used in the said work, are very much approved by Julius, therefore he earnestly requested me with many prayers to write to Gesner to publish that book, which I am sending to you, but with those characters with which the surgical works are published. I could not deny this or a greater labor to a man so friendly, upright, and pious for his authority with me.</p>
      <p>For he has a character very different from other Italians, that is, neither deceitful, ambitious, nor greedy, but calm, humble, and most eager to deserve well of all. He could indeed and certainly would benefit Gesner and will benefit if they indicate to him in what matter he can gratify them. Another thing is added, that the book is very learned and that the author, with that book completed, will give far more and greater things to the Gesner's workshop. Therefore, I ask you, my Bullinger, to be both the author and advocate for Gesner, not to let the books lie hidden and be eaten by moths and bats, but to promote that they come out into the public as soon as possible. The author wants nothing but a few copies. By this benefit, the Gesners will prepare an entrance into the king's court, so that they can later freely both ask and easily obtain what is asked (believe me). If I can repay that service with my meager means, I will not fail my friends with any of my services.</p>
      <p>The empire is divided into provinces, which are commonly called circles (Kreise), each of which meets to consult about the execution of those things that were decreed about public peace in the diets, so now a famous assembly of the Swabians is held in Reutlingen, for this reason also the Franconians have met; but with matters unresolved and great bitterness of minds, the assembly was dissolved, because they do not want to make their already devastated Franconian territory more burdened with fires, thefts, and murders to protect the plunder of the Nurembergers and the bishops of WÃ¼rzburg and Bamberg. This matter undoubtedly nourishes some monster, and it is a certain omen of future disturbances throughout Germany. Another thing is added, which will bring in a swamp of evils, namely that the Emperor signifies to the electors that he will not resign the empire unless he first greets the nobles and communicates his plans for protecting Germany against Turkish assaults and other conveniences of the empire, which being understood, the princes will firmly conspire and perhaps some have already conspired that no one will come to the diet. What occasions of great evils will sprout from this, no one, however infected with Batavian dullness, does not understand; for what emanates from the Spanish court is suspect to the princes because of the Arians and Spaniards.</p>
      <p>There is a constant rumor brought to us from Rome and from many places in Italy about composing between the French and the Emperor and the King of England through the pope. If this happens, it is certain that the pope, although a capular, yet cunning and restless, will contrive something bristling against the sincere religion with the help of the Emperor's followers and the remaining dregs of the papacy. Here in barbershops and wine taverns, moreover also in merchants' guilds, it is certainly asserted that the pope will strike with the 5 Swiss Cantons,... hitherto they have raged at their own discretion against the greater and more useful part and the defenders of sounder doctrine, what will they do now that they are amplified by this alliance?</p>
      <p>The Prince of Bavaria daily more and more aligns himself with the pope's counsel and will with hands and feet and carefully considers by what means and with what machines he may carry around this sacred image of Jupiter at a slow pace, lest it collapses when promoted with force. For this reason, he calls the Jesuits, the offspring of this pope worthy of their parent, to Ingolstadt, prepares an old college, a very spacious house, for their pleasure and convenience. Their leader will be a certain Canisius, to whom many Germans, who were sent from Austria to Rome for sacred inauguration a few years ago, will come to support him, to extirpate the new fictitious faith and parent of tumults, as these men of war boast, and to plant the old religion, with what nausea, with what pain, and how reluctantly the Bavarian nobility and the best of the common people hear this and are now forced to witness it, I can hardly say, even if I spent many days recounting the sorrows of pious-minded souls. The prince hopes for a rich bishopric and undoubtedly some others for Italian gold. You can easily guess what all these things will bring forth. I am sending you a copy of what the king asked from his subjects; they met on December 15 and unanimously concluded that religion should be sought from the king. For this reason, they will meet on February 1 to give their opinion on each of the requests, which day is appointed for this. You will have about the Turk and many other things. Farewell, my Bullinger, and be assured that no one is dearer to me than you. Greet my Gesner. My Raphael will go to Paris to Ramus, with whom he will spend two months, then he will return to you. I will retain Maximilian until April. As you know, I ask you to accomplish the rest. Farewell again and respond as soon as you can.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, December 26, 1555. I eagerly await the book to be published by you. Your Gereon Sailer.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man distinguished in all learning, sanctity of morals, and piety, tireless professor of purer theology, most worthy bishop of the church of Zurich, most esteemed lord and friend. To Mr. Bullinger... Zurich.</p>
