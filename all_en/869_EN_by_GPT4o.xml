      <p>I gladly read the letters of the holy martyr and congratulate England on finally achieving the accession of the gospel after so many attempts. They say, however, that he easily surpasses everyone there both in discussing and disputing, so that it should clearly be seen that he came there not by chance, but by fate.</p>
      <p>I hope, however, that those bishops who still resist will finally become servants of Christ, who have been consecrated to the Antichrist for so long. I have little news to write. Various rumors indeed are spread among the people; but according to our local proverb, lies are free in the month of March. However, these things are certain, which I will now report. Philipp (Melanchthon) is criticized by the ministers of Saxony because he attributes more to certain harmful abuses as if they were indifferent matters, while he orders them to be admitted, than the reason of piety can bear; although I suspect that in such straitened circumstances, with that Babylonian captivity of his, he has this plan in mind: it is better to allow something to the adversaries than to reject everything and provoke the hornets and endanger the essence of religion. Concerning Johannes Agricola, it is a constant rumor that in Berlin (the primary city of the Elector's marquisate) he took his own life by stabbing himself in the chest with a knife; perhaps he preferred to perish by iron rather than by a noose, lest he be seen as a companion of Judas in death, who had been his companion in life.</p>
      <p>The young king of Hungary, the son of János, raises his crest and is so favored by everyone that King Ferdinand has decided to betroth his daughter to him and to grant him a distinguished part of the kingdom; but I hear that the offered condition was rejected, by which he would not receive all his own, but would voluntarily lose a great part of the kingdom if he allowed himself to be bound by certain limits, and there is no doubt that even the Turkish prefects of Hungary favor the son of János. From Augsburg, it was reported yesterday that Wilhelm, Duke of Bavaria, passed away around the Ides of March, evidently a plague of piety, which, however, will have nothing better for his son, Ferdinand's son-in-law, who will moderate the reins. Our people write from Italy that Pope Julius III is now dissenting from the Emperor, and I do not know whether a treaty of peace is being negotiated between the English and the French, so that he may be able to assist Italy more strongly; for against two not even Hercules, as the old proverb holds. Farewell. St. Gallen, March 26, 1550.</p>
