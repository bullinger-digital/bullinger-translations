      <p>Finally, I have come to Chur, thanks be to God. That papal legation has occupied me more than all other matters. I was forced to enter the Valtellina, and also compelled to go to Sondrio to Mr. Travers and to engage in many activities against certain emissaries of that scoundrel. Now, a certain relative of his is lingering here with the magistrate of Chur, and he does not cease to sow discord, nor do I cease in turn to uproot and resist. I believe we have already won; for we have achieved that the legate is not allowed to enter the Valtellina, but only to come directly here, if he wishes. But he will not come here, believe me; for everywhere spirits are inflamed against him, and I know he is afraid. Everyone agrees with what you wrote to me, that this is an arrow drawn from the quiver of the Emperor, who would like to incite the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>I will not be torn from here until I see that relative of the apostate messenger has left, and also because I am forced to wait here for someone of mine, who will follow me shortly. Tomorrow I am sending Aurelius to the Duke, to report what he has accomplished in Italy for his Highness in a certain not insignificant matter. But the good nephew miraculously escaped from the hands of the impious, into which he had fallen, thanks be to God. From here I will come directly to you, and since I hope this will happen soon, I send many things to write, which are more convenient in person. I have translated your entire booklet on the Lord's Supper of Jesus Christ. Mr. Antonio Mario Besozzi, who now resides in Chiavenna, has translated into Latin the preface, which I want to attach to my Italian version; you will have here an example written in his hand. The legate, the Bishop of Bayonne, loves you very much and often speaks of you honorably. Farewell and greetings to you with the whole family, school, and church.</p>
      <p>Chur, 25th of September, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>We would hardly have won, had the Lord God not sent us that brief; for that apostate Jesuit was saying he was coming to discuss other matters. But when the Rhaetians read about the prisons, tortures, and punishments even against supporters and harborers, they immediately turned their minds away from that Roman beast.</p>
      <p>That friend of ours, who seemed different in voice than his hands indicated, wishes to convey something to you through me; but they are of such a nature that they should not be entrusted to letters. Pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>To you, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
