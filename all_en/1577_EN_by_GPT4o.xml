      <p>Greetings. I had written a letter of complaint on February 23rd, because you had written nothing to me, I mean; for you do not cease writing to others.</p>
      <p>However, the very next day your letters arrived; therefore, I immediately tore up mine upon opening them; for you have satisfied my wish, except that I still have nothing from you about the council. You mention the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th sessions and ask that we send them back immediately; but I have nothing about these. The same goes for Mr. Vergerius: "These," he says, "I send, and I will send others in the future;" but I receive nothing.</p>
      <p>How this happens, I do not know. Therefore, I am still very curious about what the council members are doing; I know well enough that they do nothing for the Lord, for how could they, sworn to the Antichrist, violate their oath? They would become perjurers and continue in their dignity, and whatever benefit comes from it. But for this reason, I desire more to know what evil they are planning against Christ and His followers, if ever the measure is filled and they are forced to cease from pouring out their malice. The Jews of old did not oppose the Lord so stubbornly. And they keep decorum, in my judgment, rightly; for as they are, so they act, and who would act otherwise? Although Nausea tries in his dialogues, as you have seen, to make gods out of them. This wretched man is shameless, for he would gladly be among the number of gods himself, because he is a bishop. Thus, similar lips have similar lettuces.</p>
      <p>They please monarchs, potentates, and those who are like them, which is more than enough for them, and they themselves satisfy the saying commonly used: that a prince is rarer than a phoenix in heaven. They have great affairs on earth, they cannot devote themselves to religion. They leave it to monks, priests, nuns, and women. Let these pray, while those handle arms to destroy, or rather to prepare kingdoms. Do not Charles and his brother render excellent service here? Indeed, I am now sixty years old. How many kingdoms, how many peoples have I seen perish from the Christian religion in the meantime under these princes? As that brother rightly said to Mr. Egidius: "As long as these Austrian princes rule in Germany, it will have neither happiness nor salvation." He agreed, who said freely in Frankfurt, upon hearing that Charles had become emperor: "Therefore," he said, "Germany will be neither fortunate nor safe." We have experienced for several years now what they prophesied, nor do these corpses cease to provoke God and men. May our Lord grant us patience. Meanwhile, I am comforted by the old saying: a bad plan is worst for the planner. So far it has not failed, nor will it fail in the future.</p>
      <p>But in the meantime, we must endure. Let us endure, so that we may become like the image of Christ the Lord, provided He is present with His spirit of patience, so that for His sake we may despise all things to the end; for "if we endure, we shall also reign with Him," says Paul. Farewell with yours in the Lord. Greet Gwalther and Otto for me. Basel, February 25th, 1552.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the people of ZÃ¼rich and his brother in the Lord, to be respected.</p>
