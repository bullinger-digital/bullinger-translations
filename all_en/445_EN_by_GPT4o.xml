      <p>Greetings. Until this day, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, nothing has been done or decided regarding my calling; for many of the lords are absent, whose presence is desired for this matter. Haller is also absent, as I hear he has gone beyond Lausanne to Geneva, but he is expected back by tomorrow. Yesterday and today I appeared in the council, but in vain due to the aforementioned reasons. At this hour, I have been ordered to send my companion back to you, whom they dismissed with an honorarium of 2 florins beyond the reimbursement of expenses. Therefore, having dismissed him, I await here to see what the council will decide. In the meantime, I commend to your faith my wife and children. As it appears, I will not return to you until the synods are completed, so it is likely that I will remain here for a period of 3 weeks. My wife will not have enough money; for I only gave her 2 florins when I left. I therefore beg you, if it is necessary, to give her as much as necessity requires. When I return, I will repay in good faith. Farewell excellently, dearest of men. Greetings to your whole household and to the other lords and my brothers, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Theodor, and Walter.</p>
      <p>The brothers here greet you, and Eberhard also, in Bern, February 26, 1549.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, lord and brother in Christ, dearest by far. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
