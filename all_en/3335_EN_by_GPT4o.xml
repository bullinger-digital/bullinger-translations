      <p>Greetings. What you write about the pope's reconciliation with Philipp (Melanchthon), Farel (Guillaume Farel) and Beza (Théodore de Bèze) have confirmed, and it has happened as foreseen and anticipated by many, and yet this beast is worshipped by those at least who, although they detest the pope's treachery, still hold the papacy in esteem. I have nothing yet about the colloquy, because our Oporinus (Johannes Oporinus), as far as I know, has not yet returned, through whom I expect letters and a report or knowledge from him. He is involved in danger because of the booklet on the Misnian and Saxon war, published by Brillinger (the exhibitor himself), in which, although the author, whose identity is said to be uncertain, judges sincerely and sharply, it is attacked by the Elector of Saxony because it touches upon his brother Maurice not lightly. I fear badly that this tragedy may also give some prejudice that will be an impediment to even sounder writings in the future. For we have only recently settled the complaint that arose because of our Caelius's (Caelius Secundus Curio) book "On the Amplitude of the Kingdom of God," so that there is a danger that the magistrate may eventually become aggravated and decide something more severe. I know that you are aware of everything about Gribaldo (Matteo Gribaldi), whose grave misfortune I deeply lament and pray to the Lord to mercifully lead him to the path of truth. Farewell well in Christ Jesus with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, 26th of September, in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Today I presented the letters given to me by Mr. Gwalter (Rudolf Gwalther) to Beza; greet him reverently with my words. Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
