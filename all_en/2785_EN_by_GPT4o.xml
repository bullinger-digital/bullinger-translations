      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, honorable lord and godfather, sent through Mr. Lysmaninus.</p>
      <p>He explained to us in detail the success of the truth in Poland. May the Lord further it more and more everywhere. Here with us, there is nothing new, except that Mr. Johannes Rodolphus von Grafenried, that tribune who first summoned me from Zürich, has been appointed governor of the people of Saanen. This was a new example in our city, that a tribune and such a great man would be sent to a governorship; but he himself seemed to request this and easily obtained it, so that with his authority he might more easily tame the wild people, who are very impatient of any discipline. May the Lord be with him.</p>
      <p>Someone from our number will be added to him, who will travel with him to reform the churches there. I fear that this burden may fall upon me; for everyone seems to agree on me already. This will be a heavy burden for me and certainly more difficult than the Augsburg calling because of the incredible barbarism of the people and their insolent license; yet if it seems so to the Lord, I will do what I can; the Lord will grant success. You do well to write to Maurice and Benedict.</p>
      <p>Benedict is both a very learned man and familiar with Mr. Gessner. I would like to keep them in friendship with gentleness. As for your relative, I have already spoken with some friends who are of that order, who, as I know, will do what they can for your sake, but they have not yet been able to give me any certain hope; for what happens here also happens there with you. There is a great abundance of scribes; for this reason, many ascend to governorships and other dignities. Hence, many citizens instruct their sons in this art, who, if any position becomes vacant, flock in great numbers to seek it. I will, however, press further and see what can be obtained.</p>
      <p>There is now a great delegation from Geneva here; it is about continuing the alliance. It seems that an agreement cannot be reached, and we all greatly fear that nothing will come of it and that it will give rise to the matter and occasion of a more serious dissension. There are scoundrels who always pour cold water on things. For recently, while Lysmaninus was present here, someone who called himself a Genevan secretly asked another of Lysmaninus's servants, since she was going to Calvin, to tell him that his books had been burned in Bern. He, being struck by this, asked me about it. When I denied it, we understood the treacherous plan of this scoundrel, who wanted to agitate Calvin with this uncertain news through a certain person.</p>
      <p>When I asked to be shown the man, he could not be found; but as far as we could gather from conjectures, he is one of the secretaries who are attached to the Genevan delegates. Such scoundrels and lying slanderers sow much dissension on both sides. May the Lord cut off their tongues. This is all for now; for I have nothing more. May the Lord keep you safe for a long time with all yours, to whom I ask you to convey my greetings. All of ours also greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 14, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and godfather.</p>
