      <p>Greetings. Since the Swiss did not accept the mediation and gave a defiant answer, despite the fact that the four places Bern, Uri, Unterwalden, and Zug were inclined towards them in the community and advised them to be calm, etc., my lords have scheduled a meeting in Baden in haste, on Tuesday in eight days, August 20th.</p>
      <p>It is said that Bern and Savoy have reconciled and are united. The Emperor died on St. James' Day; the Turkish Emperor is also dead.</p>
      <p>The mayor has told you everything well from France; nothing further has come.</p>
      <p>He has also given you the sad history of Denmark and Sweden. The Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Pray for me.</p>
      <p>Today Heinrich Dam√ºr from Chur came to me, he is on his way to Basel, having come up here because of the terrible plague there; he wants to see if he can continue his studies here.</p>
      <p>Say that Bastian Zock knows about his matters. Please inform him of this.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>Given on August 11, 1564.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my godfather and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
