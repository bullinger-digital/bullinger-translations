    <p xml:id="regest1">[Konrad] Klauser arrived [in Konstanz] the day before and fully matches Bullinger's description, so the church of Isny is to be congratulated. Blarer has informed him as requested about the complicated circumstances in Isny, which require prudent behavior. He would have also recommended him to the council, but the council is critical of Blarer without his fault, so Blarer only sent a letter to [...], Klauser's companion, to the also council-hated [Peter] Buffler as well as Bullinger's [not received] letter. It is hoped that with God's help and through Klauser's activities, better times will dawn. Of the two pastors [in Isny], [Konrad Frick] lacks zeal and [Georg Denneler], the originator of the evil, lacks wisdom, which is why Blarer did not send a letter to them. - Blarer hopes for a successful action by the Diet against the Marquess [del Vasto, Alfonso d'Avalos], whom some believe is supported by the Emperor [Charles V]. In many cities, especially in Swabia, soldiers are being recruited. It is not known for whom or against whom. However, there is a rumor that [Duke Henry of] Brunswick is raging in the territory of the [Arch]bishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] and Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] is therefore sending a large army there. In view of this situation, the [Confederates] should unite even more closely. - A dissolution of the Schmalkaldic League would have dire consequences. - It is said that [Charles II of] Orléans was poisoned by his brother [Henry]; worse will follow. - Blarer finally delivers the letter from [Georg] Frölich [No. 2256], who, like [Jakob] Funcklin, could not praise the Zurichers enough. - What Bullinger wrote about the [Duke of] Burgundy, [Emperor] Charles [V.], pleases Blarer. It would be nice if God would execute the same punishment on [the Emperor] that he devises against the [Protestants]. Yet one must submit to God's will, especially since [human] zeal is often corrupted by emotions. - Bullinger need not worry about [Konrad Zwick's military skills], who would not undertake anything that could harm the good. - Many miss the same in [Martin] Frecht as Bullinger does. However, Frecht compensates for the deficiencies with other excellent character traits. - Bullinger's rejection of a colloquium with Schwenckfeld as a waste of time reminds Blarer of his own similar experiences in Württemberg, where he was often urged to do so, especially by [Hans] Friedrich Thumb [von Neuburg]. He once engaged in [a colloquium with Schwenckfeld] in Tübingen, in which Bucer also participated, and after which [Schwenckfeld], despite his defeat, presented himself to his followers as the victor. However Bullinger decides, Schwenckfeld will interpret it to his advantage. - In this time, Blarer finds it important to reflect on [biblical grounds] about alliances; scholars hold very different opinions, from complete rejection to purely intra-confessional alliances to general acceptance, albeit excluding matters of faith. Blarer asks Bullinger to briefly present his opinion on this in German (also for those not proficient in Latin). - He fully agrees with Bullinger's judgment of Johannes Zwick and sends, at Bullinger's request, his writing [„Christenlicher gantz trostlicher underricht“], which he himself has perhaps adorned with a somewhat exuberant preface, which nevertheless does not do justice to the deceased Zwick. - Greetings, especially to [Rudolf] Gwalther, for whom he encloses a [letter from Sixt Birck].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, your and indeed our Clauser arrived, who seems to me exactly as you described him, so I wholeheartedly congratulate the church of Isny on him. I kept him here yesterday as he was leaving, so that I could more fully explain to him the state and situation of his church, as you had requested in your letter. Great prudence and circumspection will be needed if he wishes to perform his duties with any success in such a factious little town; which he certainly wishes to do. I would have recommended him to the council, but the greater, though not better, part of it has been estranged from me for some time now, through no fault of my own that I can recognize. I wrote to the truly pious and excellent man Buffler, but in such a way that it seemed best to have both your letter and mine delivered to him not by Clauser himself, but by a companion whom he brought with him from here; for the council is so unjust towards that truly good man, and that solely because of his many and outstanding good deeds, that Clauser will suffer from this alone if the council understands that he is received into Buffler's friendship. Therefore, this must be entirely concealed for some time, until by the Lord's kindness and the ministry of our Clauser, the minds of all may more firmly and happily unite; which, I earnestly pray, my dearest brother, we may diligently entreat the Lord through our only peacemaker, Christ. The two ministers of the church who remain in Isny, one is of no judgment, the other of no zeal for God; since I also have little favor with them (especially the latter, who is the author of all these evils), I did not think it right to burden Clauser with my letters to them rather than commend him.</p>
      <p>May your assembly be fortunate and successful in repelling the unbearable injuries of that Marquess! Some believe that these things are done by the authority of the Emperor, so that he may provoke you with such evils. You understand the rest. Soldiers are being recruited in many cities (especially in Swabia); but it is still uncertain to our people against which enemy or to defend which ally this is done, except that rumor spreads that Brunswick is now raging with great cruelty by fire and sword in the territory of the Archbishop of Cologne, and therefore the Landgrave is sending a large army there. Ah! We pray to Christ to declare himself Jesus and the savior of his own in that excellent prince, lest the spirits of others also be broken if he does not show himself present here and the glory of his name and the truth of his word be obscured to the great detriment of his own. Your people, if they are wise, will unite more closely and be bound by the strongest bonds of solid concord, seeing that others are being scattered to their miserable and great (which certainly threatens them) destruction.</p>
      <p>If the Schmalkaldic League is now dissolved, that is, at such an unfavorable time, everything will soon be ablaze with the fire of inextinguishable dissensions, and our entire Germany will be destroyed by slaughter, robbery, and wars.</p>
      <p>It is thought that the Duke of Orléans was poisoned by his brother, and this evil is soon followed by another far more atrocious. May the Lord timely deliver us from all these things with his strong hand and outstretched arm!</p>
      <p>I am sending the letters of our Leto, which he asked me to give to you as he was leaving; however, I could not give them sooner. That excellent friend has extolled your courteous humanity and human courtesy to the heavens, and even affirmed it to be excessive; which our Funcklin also did. Therefore, we will proclaim nothing else than this, as much as we can, since we cannot imitate it in any way.</p>
      <p>What you wrote in your previous letters about Charles the Burgundian was very pleasing. It would be most delightful if he who meditates the same would pay the same penalties to the heavenly avenger, yet it is entirely fitting that we also diligently moderate our zeal, which is often corrupted by emotions, according to his will, so that we do not, as they say, go beyond the olives.</p>
      <p>Regarding the invention of your cousin, I have long advised you to be of a secure mind, since nothing is more alien to his nature than to attempt anything that could harm the good in any way. Therefore, there is no reason for you to fear anything here.</p>
      <p>In our Frecht, our common friend, what you desire, some other good men also desire; but he is so constituted by nature, which you cannot easily expel, that these things must be overlooked and forgiven to him, which he abundantly compensates with his other excellent gifts.</p>
      <p>That you reject a colloquium with Schwenckfeld in this manner and flee from it as the most certain waste of good hours (if there were nothing else), you do exactly what I also remember doing not infrequently when I was in the territory of Württemberg, where I was often and much solicited to this by some, especially by Friedrich Thum. But having become more circumspect through the danger of others, I allowed myself to be brought to him only once, and that in Tübingen, where Bucer also happened to be staying from his journey; with whom he contended in such a way that, although openly defeated, he nevertheless seemed to himself a vigorous victor, and then among his own he would boast of miraculous glories. This is indeed perpetual for him, that whether he is admitted or expelled, he always has something to boast about himself to his disciples.</p>
      <p>For if you refuse a colloquium, he already affirms that he is prepared to give an account of his faith even to our most learned men, but that they, out of fear and consciousness of a bad cause, do not wish to confer with him. But if you do converse, whatever you say, he twists it with some marvelous artifice into a confirmation of his error among his own. Therefore, let him be long gone and may he eventually experience the hand of the Lord, so that he may learn not to blaspheme his doctrine!</p>
      <p>I clearly see the time approaching when some exact account of forming alliances, which relies on the word of the Lord, must be given. For here the opinions of even the more learned vary greatly, while some simply deny that they can be joined with the impious, that is, the adversaries of the gospel of Christ, others think it is permissible if the cause of religion is excepted. Some think that only ecclesiastics, that is, papists, should be excluded, while others should be admitted indiscriminately outside the business of religion and faith. Some, in the great perfidy of this age, altogether abhor alliances and resolve to commit themselves entirely to the Lord, and they try to persuade many others of this with many arguments, although there are fewer who depart to their opinion. Therefore, I earnestly beseech you, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, that, when it is convenient, you write to me your opinion on this matter. Believe me, you will do a work not to be regretted, which will be of use to many. You will write in German, so that those good men who do not know Latin may also read it. I do not ask for a full treatise, but that you reveal your opinion to us in the fewest words possible.</p>
      <p>I have so embraced your judgment of cousin Johannes Zwick, I have almost adored it, that I have scarcely ever more. I send to you, as you requested, the testament of our Lord and Savior, which he declared with great grace and no less fruit to our church shortly before his departure.</p>
      <p>I have prefaced it with some words. If I seem to have been excessive in his praises, you will attribute it to my love for him, which was more than the greatest, although those who knew him more intimately affirm that I have said less than the matter deserves. May Christ grant that we too, by his example, may burn with zeal for his glory and the salvation of his church, both living and dying.</p>
      <p>Farewell, venerable and dearest brother. October 7, 1545. Greet the friends and brothers, especially your household and our excellent friend Gwalther, to whom I send, as you see, a letter from Sixtus Betuleius given to me these days; I would have written if I had had any leisure.</p>
      <p>Yours, Amb. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
