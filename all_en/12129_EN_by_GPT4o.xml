    <p xml:id="regest1">The Bernese Council has ordered a revision of the catechism revised by Bucer: A unique opportunity to get rid of Lutheranism; at the same time, a dangerous matter, as it could lead to a [new] dispute. Johannes [Wäber] is indeed hesitant about any statement that attributes the mediation of any merits to the sacrament. However, Ritter believes, according to the previous [confession], that the merits and effects of Christ's Passion are imparted to people in the sacrament, so in this case, Ritter cannot agree with the opposing party Wäber. What may arise from this situation, the [Zurichers] themselves can judge! If one denies that the merits of Christ are mediated in the sacrament, this could prompt the opponents to call upon Bucer or any Lutheran. - Should Ritter be mistaken, may the [Zurichers] point out his error, and otherwise admonish Wäber. The revision of the catechism has been postponed to the 20th [of February]. Kaspar [Megander] should particularly admonish [the Venner Peter im Haag], but especially [the city clerk Peter] Cyro in this regard. Ritter encloses the [Bernese] catechism [of 1541?] and the statutes [the "Agend büchly" of 1541 or the decree issued by the Small Council on December 5, 1544, which ordered the revision of the catechism] with his letter. The Zurichers, to whom he submits himself, should make a decision. - [P.S.:] Due to Ritter's [poor] health condition, someone was taken to help with the drafting of the letter.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>A very great opportunity has been opened to us to expel Lutheranism once and for all, but the greater the opportunity, the more dangerous it is. Our council has ordered us to correct the catechism that Bucer left us to disturb our church, if there is anything that needs correction. Here among us, there is a fear that dissension may arise, for Johannes (Wäber) abhors words that imply that any benefit or utility returns to us (thinking that all these things were received before the action; therefore, it is not necessary to first receive them in the Lord's Supper) from the taking of the Lord's Supper. But I think we ought to be more circumspect about what we receive; for we have so often confessed that in the Supper, Christ gives us the communication of His body and blood, and that the Supper consists not only of bread and wine, but especially of the fruit and power of the passion of our Lord. Therefore, we have confessed that Christ's body is present to us in the Supper, but through the fruit and efficacy of the salvation obtained through the body delivered to our faith offered by the sacraments. Johannes firmly denies all these things. Since I cannot deny them, I am forced to disagree with Johannes and to some extent side with the opposing party. What this might bring about among our people, you yourselves can judge! Even if I wanted to concede so much to Johannes, I fear for the danger to the whole church; for from there, the adversaries might seize the opportunity to call Bucer or some other Lutheran, so that the whole religion would come into danger.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beseech you, dearest brothers, if I am in error, point out the error; if not, admonish Johannes to act more prudently and to listen to you. For the matter has been postponed to the 20th day of this month. I would also wish for Kaspar (Megander) to admonish Gyronus and Sepinus, who are almost of the same opinion, especially Gyronus, otherwise a faithful and constant brother. I am sending to you the catechism and the decree of our council. Read and arrange them yourselves; for I willingly entrust my authority to you in this matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on the 14th day of February in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter.</p>
      <p>You can easily judge my health, as a third hand had to be employed to prepare these letters.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious brothers, Master Heinrich Bullinger and Kaspar Megander, the most vigilant pastors of the Zurich church.</p>
