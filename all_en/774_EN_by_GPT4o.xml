      <p>When the cardinals first convened, more than forty-one in the first and second scrutiny, that is, once and again, Reginald Pole was designated as pope by 26 votes, whom Farnese and the Caesarians desired. However, since the others did not agree with this election, Farnese immediately rose, along with the Tridentine, as if to reverently kiss him, thinking that everyone would follow and approve the election, as it could no longer be hindered. But the Ferrara, Trani, and Theatine strongly opposed, boldly asserting that since he was not legitimately elected, they would be pronounced excommunicated by the canons if they proceeded to adoration. The next morning, while they were still contending, behold, the royal envoy arrived with letters from the Parisian cardinal, brought by a courier, who solemnly swore that he had left the French cardinals in the port of Spezia and that they would soon be present. Upon receiving this news, everything was thrown into confusion. Thus, that day was lost.</p>
      <p>The next day, which was the 12th of December, four of those Frenchmen arrived, namely Ghisla, Belay, Va d'-homo, and Sciatiglion, who immediately entered the conclave, arguing that the matter of such great importance should not be rushed, until in the evening, with the arrival of the Turin cardinal, an equilibrium was reached such that we will not have a pope so soon. The French indeed propose Trani, Theatine, Salviati, Rodolfo Monte, and the cardinal of Santa Croce; however, the imperials and Farnese persist in their original opinion, wanting the Englishman, and will never admit the cardinals of Santa Croce and Monte, etc. Everything else here is very quiet, etc.</p>
