      <p>Greetings, Reverend Father.</p>
      <p>The illustrious Count Martinengo has come to us, but he arrived at a very busy time and now, unexpectedly, he is leaving suddenly. It is not necessary to commend him to you.</p>
      <p>However, I did not want him to come to you without my letters, as that would seem contrary to my duty and office. If there are any matters commonly discussed here, you will hear them from him; but there are few things that you need to know.</p>
      <p>We are waiting to hear from you what the fairs have produced. The matter of Philipp is pending and, as I think, will cool down; but still, I affirm nothing yet.</p>
      <p>You will not miss any opportunity to inform us about what is happening in Germany, especially in Lower Germany, where it is said that several thousand Spaniards have landed; how true this is, I do not know.</p>
      <p>This is written in haste.</p>
      <p>The rest you will hear from the Count, who knows how busy I have been; therefore, you will forgive me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, the evening before Easter.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
