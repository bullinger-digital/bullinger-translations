    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] As Bullinger suspected [in his last letter No. 3041], Heinrich Buchter passed away a day later. Buchter leaves behind seven children. It is expected that the authorities will take care of them. Buchter's son Johannes arrived in Zürich only after the burial.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Johannes Haller returned safely from Augsburg. Many believe that he will become Buchter's successor. May the Lord grant this, for Haller is useful to the church! Haller has reported on matters that cannot be conveyed in writing. At the court of Emperor Charles V and in the city of Augsburg, there are many God-fearing people, but also many hypocrites.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] How strange that Myconius did not understand with whom King Henry II of France seeks an alliance, even though he understood that the Swiss would become allies of Pope Paul III if they allied with the French. Therefore, it is clear that Henry II is seeking a new alliance with the Swiss! Namely with the people of Zürich, Bern, the Five Places, Glarus, Basel, etc. Meanwhile, the king admits that the old mercenary alliance is still valid for three years after the death of his father Francis I. It is likely that the Swiss would also become allies of the Pope in the event of an alliance with him, as it seems indeed that a pact has been made between him and the Pope, especially since the royal envoy in the Swiss Confederation [Louis Daugerant, Seigneur de Boisrigaut] deeply regrets the death of this "innocent" [Pope's son] Pier Luigi Farnese in a letter to the council of Zürich. It would be fatal for the Swiss if they placed their trust in this "Egyptian" king and in worldly alliances! Blessed is he who hopes in God, but does not despise lawful means (unjust means are to be abhorred anyway).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Now Bullinger must convey some bad, unfortunately confirmed news: The people of Constance have allowed themselves to be persuaded (hopefully not confused) by Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle! They are now negotiating a reconciliation with the Emperor. However, they intend to accept nothing that would be against God, their faith, their state, and their neighbors. But they are only petitioners, while the Emperor is the benefactor who decides at his discretion! And there is a danger that he promises much and delivers little! Myconius should therefore pray for the people of Constance. Their best men still harbor some hope. May God grant them success. The council of Zürich is writing to the council of Basel regarding this matter. That's all for now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to Francisco de Enzinas, Johannes Oporin, Johannes Gast, Celio Secondo Curione, and all others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] If Gast wanted to respond to Bullinger's letter [not received], which Ludwig Lavater had delivered to him, a messenger [Thomas Binzmüller] would be at his disposal.</p>

      <p>S. D. Heinrich Buchter passed away the day after, as I had predicted, in the true confession of faith. His son found him already buried. He left behind seven children. I have good hopes for the magistrate's benevolence.</p>

      <p>Johannes Haller returned safely and unharmed from Augsburg. Many predict that he will be appointed as Buchter's successor. May the Lord grant us the one He knows to be useful for His church. Haller reports astonishing things that I cannot write. There are many faithful and also many hypocrites at the court of Emperor Charles V and in the city of Augsburg, etc.</p>

      <p>Do you not understand with whom the French King seeks an alliance? It's astonishing! It's truly surprising that you do not understand this, while you understand what follows: that we would be allied with the Pope if we connect with the French King! Who are these "we"? The Swiss! Therefore, he seeks an alliance with the people of Zürich, Bern, the Five Places, Glarus, Basel, etc., and indeed a new alliance! Meanwhile, he admits that the old alliance will last another three years after the death of his father. I believe that those connected to the French King would also be allies of the Pope, as it seems there is a syncretism between the Pope and the French King. For in letters sent to our council by the royal envoy, it is lamented that Pier Luigi Farnese, an innocent man, was miserably slain, if it pleases the gods. But believe me, Myconius, we will perish if we place our trust in that Egyptian king and in worldly alliances. Blessed is he who places his hope in God, and does not despise just means, while abhorring unjust ones. These are my few words to you.</p>

      <p>Now I must bring you the unfortunate news: The people of Constance have been captivated by the arts of Granvelle, hopefully not driven mad! They are now beginning to consult about reconciliation with the Emperor. What I write is certain. They have firmly resolved not to accept anything that is against God, religion, the safety of the state, and their neighbors. But they are petitioners. It is the Emperor's role to give. He will give what he pleases. And there is a danger that he will be generous in promising, but sparing in delivering. Pray to the Lord for them (all these matters are being written in detail to your most honorable council). The best among them still hope for the best. May God grant them to achieve good outcomes. I cannot write more now.</p>

      <p>Tell Mr. Gast that a messenger is present, in case he wishes to respond to my letters sent through Lavater.</p>
