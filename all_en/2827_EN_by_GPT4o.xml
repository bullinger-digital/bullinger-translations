      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a most learned and upright man, François Bérauld sends greetings. It may be of no interest to you, but it is of great importance to me, most holy man, that you understand how highly I have always esteemed you, even from your well-known name alone. For from the time I first began to have understanding, I sought the friendship of those who added the pursuit of true piety to their singular expertise in human arts, not only as an honor but also as a fruitful endeavor. And while in many places men of great and excellent talent were celebrated, who nevertheless had no taste for Christian truth, I used their writings as much as I deemed useful, but I did not seek their acquaintance or friendship. For since all men are united by this one kinship, if they recognize and proclaim Jesus Christ as their common parent, anyone who does not agree with us in this part cannot be joined with us in friendship. But if God willed me to be born in this age, in which He revealed the doctrine of His Gospel, buried and overwhelmed, raised it up when oppressed, made it known when unknown, and finally granted it a firm seat when it was errant and driven out everywhere, certainly I consider it no small part of my happiness to be known to those whose work and constancy (which He Himself gave) He willed to use. Among whom, most worthy of my respect, the place you hold, as I perceive, I would not hesitate to freely and truly confess, if I were ignorant of the custom of learned and pious men, who, while they delight in doing well, admit with difficulty to being praised to their face, as they ascribe the praise of all their actions to God alone. I will say, however, what I wish to be known to all, that the friendship and trust you first voluntarily offered me, I would have eagerly purchased at any price, and now that it has been offered, I will most devoutly cultivate it. But to begin speaking at last of Wilhelm von Freiburg, a young man of excellent promise and the son of a most noble and good father, it happened that at the very time he was passing through here on his way to Bern, I was staying in Bern for some business for a few days, and we both, unknown to each other, stayed at the same inn. But having been informed by Mr. Musculus, with whom I was conversing familiarly, that I was in that city, he immediately came to me and delivered your letters and those of Mr. Funck, which pleased me so much that I leave it to you to judge, as they immediately wiped away a very serious sorrow contracted for other reasons. But before I had opened them, still unaware of what they contained, I noticed something noble in that young man at first sight, which affected me not a little. After reading the letters, a much greater increase of love was added by your commendation.</p>
      <p>Now indeed, since you indicate that I am deemed worthy by the judgment of the most learned and loving man, Mr. Théodore de Bèze, to whom this boy should be entrusted, I can boldly promise this: if I have not been worthy up to this day, now I can be worthy. For what would I not do to free such a sponsor from any fraud to his detriment? It is true, which I remind you of, if perhaps you do not know. We French, who have left our homeland for the name of the Gospel, cannot be very wealthy, not rich, not splendid, not elegant, nor do we gather any casks of wine or bushels of wheat from our revenues; we must buy everything daily, while I remain silent that everything is sold more expensively to foreigners than to natives.</p>
      <p>Hence it happens that everything is more difficult and inconvenient for us than for the locals or certainly for those who have settled in these places for several years. But yet we are not so inexperienced in matters or greedy that we seek to become rich in a short time from the pension of one or another boy. But this, which is most fair, we demand, that we receive some rewards for our labor and care. Therefore, I know there are some citizens here, with whom he will have everything more abundant and splendid at a lower price; but what you do not find everywhere, you will find with us: I live with my wife and children without tumult in the greatest peace and harmony, daily some studious young men visit my home, and I privately lecture. Intent and content with my studies, I do not involve myself in any business, staying at home unless Viret or Bèze or men of the same caliber either summon or visit me, and that rarely. I will teach this boy to speak Latin and French purely and elegantly, and Greek if necessary. But many others can do the same.</p>
      <p>But that he may learn to live Christianly and piously and chastely, the Lord Christ will grant that I can teach by words and example. As for sustenance and care of the body, I know, having professed it for many years in France, what is fitting for young men brought up liberally. Therefore, having consulted many others, especially Mr. Bèze, and having calculated all the reasons considering the scantiness of our resources, I see that for the common good of both the boy and myself, I cannot be given less than thirty-six gold coins annually, and I also request that the quarterly pension be given to me as soon as possible, which I will spend on provisions. These are the things, most excellent man, which I thought should be declared to you; for what you wrote to me, I will diligently observe each point. I wrote these things hastily in the greatest constraints of time.</p>
      <p>At another time, I will write to you more elegantly and as befits you, now I have written according to duty. Farewell.</p>
      <p>May our Lord Jesus Christ preserve you and your entire church. Lausanne.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright man and his esteemed lord, Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zürich.</p>
