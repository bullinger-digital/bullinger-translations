    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Simler was informed by a letter from his father [Peter] about the birth of Bullinger's son [Felix] and congratulates him on this occasion. May Felix one day bring all honor to his father!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Simler's requests to his father and also to Bullinger to be allowed to change his place of study have so far been rejected for various reasons. Now he is allowed to continue his studies in Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He has chosen this city because in Germany, [as a result of the war], most universities are in decline, and he is not allowed to go to France. Strasbourg is no less safe than Basel, but the level of education is better. In Basel, only Celio Secondo Curione is recommended. More about this from Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings, especially to Anna [n√©e Adlischwyler], to whom he sends his congratulations. The whole family is also greeted.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I have learned from my father's letter that a son has been born to you, most esteemed father Bullinger, and I heartily congratulate you and pray to God that he may one day become a son worthy of you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have often requested, as you yourself know, both from you and from my parent, that I be allowed to go elsewhere. However, since this has not been granted until now for various reasons, I have finally obtained permission from my father to go to Strasbourg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Briefly receive the reason for my decision: Since at this time most of the German universities are silent and I am not allowed to go to France, I have decided to go to Strasbourg, for there I am no less safe than in Basel, and furthermore, I can benefit from better lectures. In Basel, except for Celio Secondo Curione, you can hardly find one whom you would approve. I will write more about all this when I have arrived in Strasbourg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>May God preserve you in safety for as long as possible! Greet your wife and congratulate her on my behalf for the happy birth. Furthermore, wish the family many good things on my behalf. Given in Basel, June 1st. Yours, Josias Simler.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, and his most esteemed father. In Zurich.</p>
