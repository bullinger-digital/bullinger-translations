    <p xml:id="regest1">From Cologne, new discord is reported between Emperor [Charles V] and [King Francis I of] France. People from significant families who need money are already looking forward to the war. When Myconius asked them for more information, they replied that they had no exact information but were confident; soon they would receive news from France. Meanwhile, [Charles V] is preparing for war, even though he is plagued by his [illness]. It is considered certain that he is preparing for war against the Archbishop [Hermann von Wied] with some people at the Cologne court. Therefore, a delegation from the Frankfurt [Schmalkaldic] League approached him. Myconius hopes to learn what came of it in the coming week.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- At the Regensburg [Religious Colloquy], the theologian Pedro Malvenda is present, who will support [Charles V] in whatever he decides about the colloquy. This is the opinion of Burgundians who were in Basel and know [Charles V] and [Malvenda]. No one believes that the Diet of Regensburg will take place because nothing is being prepared there, the plague is raging in Ingolstadt, and the transport routes in Bavaria are blocked. And if King [Ferdinand I] and [Charles V] were to come to Regensburg, they would probably only prepare the marriage of Ferdinand's two daughters, [Anna and Maria of Austria], with [Albert V of] Bavaria and [William V of] Cleves. - The Turk [Suleiman I] has left a district of government in Hungary to [John Sigismund Zápolya and his regents Isabella Jagiellonica and George Martinuzzi], the heirs of the Voivode [John I Zápolya], on the condition of an annual tribute. The inhabitants of [Transylvania] have long since adopted the Gospel. To improve [the church system], they called someone from Wittenberg, removed the images, and introduced the vernacular in the church. When [George Martinuzzi], a Pauline monk and [advisor] to the deceased [John I Zápolya], heard this, he reported the [supporters of the reform] to the Turkish [Beylerbey Mehmed Yahya Pasha] in Buda. An interrogation was scheduled. The accused appeared with a wagonload of [sacred objects and] images, well aware that the Turks abhor images and do not even mint them on their coins. They began their defense by saying that they had so far been taught by their priests to worship stones and wood, without voice and without perception. Furthermore, everything in their church was celebrated in [Latin], a language they did not understand. The [Beylerbey] replied that they should not be surprised if God had led them into bondage because of their idolatry. In the future, he will behead anyone who holds a service in a language he does not understand. This was reported from Vienna and Wittenberg. No one wants to hear the truth from the preachers. But now we will see what the word of the Turk and [the fear of the] executioners will accomplish. For the latter also strangely preach while they kill people. Even today, there are those condemned to death who cry out: "If you do not repent, you will die like us!"</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The letter addressed to Ambrosius Blarer should be forwarded by Bullinger to Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [P.S.:] [Ludwig] von Reischach just reported having learned from a letter that a day in Cambrai has been set, on which the imperial and French envoys will discuss the confirmation or annulment of the existing peace [of Crépy]. [Francis I] fears the power of [Charles V], which is why he would prefer peace with [King Henry VIII of] England, and [Charles V] distrusts [Francis I].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The son [Lamprecht] of [Nikolaus?] Zehnder was supposed to deliver this letter, but he had already left without Myconius' knowledge.</p>

      <p>S. From Cologne to here, there is a rumor of a new discord between the Emperor and the French. There are those who rejoice because of this, hoping that they will achieve their desires, being people of great lineage but suffering from poverty. So, I approached some of them, asking if they had any certainty about the discord. They replied: "Nothing certain, but much hope"; however, they expect to respond soon from France about what the situation is. Meanwhile, the Emperor is preparing for war, despite being gnawed at by his wolf. But there are certain conjectures in the Cologne court that everything is being prepared against the Archbishop. Therefore, they sent a delegation from the Frankfurt assembly to the Emperor for this reason. However, I have not yet learned what they reported. Perhaps I will find out next week; for he is on a journey, about which I have good hope.</p>

      <p>From Regensburg, there is nothing noteworthy. There is a theologian, Pedro Malvenda, whom the Emperor sent with the task of defending whatever he concludes from the colloquy with all his might. This is what the Burgundians here, who know both the Emperor and the theologian, have testified. No one believes that the Diet will be held in Regensburg, both because nothing is being prepared there and because the plague is raging in Ingolstadt, and the Bavarians are blocking all transport routes with their sieges. Even if both the King and the Emperor are to come, they will celebrate, or rather prepare, the marriages of Ferdinand's two daughters, one of whom will be married to the son of the Bavarian house, the other to the Cleves. May the Lord turn it to good. Let it not be hidden from you: In Hungary, there is a small region left to the heirs of the Voivode, to pay an annual tribute to the Turk. The inhabitants, having long since received the Gospel, have not yet fully called from Wittenberg someone to teach everything more perfectly; and they have reached the point where they have finally cast out idols and ensured that everything in the church is conducted in the vernacular. When a monk, the brother of the deceased prince, of the Pauline order, noticed this, he accused them gravely before the Turkish prefect, who resides in Buda. A day was set, and when it arrived, the inhabitants brought a wagon loaded with images, knowing that the Turks pursue images with such hatred that they do not even engrave them on coins. They began their defense by saying that they had been wrongly taught by their priests to worship stones and wood, which have neither voice nor any sense; moreover, all sacred things in their temples were celebrated in a foreign language and therefore not understood by them, and thus without any fruit or affection of piety, with some other words and statues meanwhile being brought into view. There the Turk said: They should not be surprised that they have been reduced to this servitude after so many calamities received, for they have deserved it because of idolatry. Moreover, he is so affected that if anyone were to perform sacred rites in an unknown language, he would soon cut them down with a sword: Er wett in seblen. And with these words, he dismissed them freely. This from Vienna and Wittenberg. No one can bear to hear the truth from the preachers. Let us see what the voice of the Turk and the executioners can achieve; for they also strangely preach while they kill people. And among us today, there are some of the condemned who cry out: "Unless you repent of your evils, you will perish as we have perished." May the Lord grant us His grace and increase our faith.</p>

      <p>After writing this, Mr. von Reischach came to me and reported that he had read letters in which it was found: A day has been set for the imperial and French delegations to meet with full power to do everything and to settle what pertains to the confirmation or annulment of the peace made. The French fear the power of the Emperor, therefore they would prefer peace with the English, I say honorable. The Emperor does not trust the French, therefore he fears that they may seek an occasion to do harm. Cambrai in the Belgians has been designated as the place for the meeting. Let us wait to see what good or evil will erupt from there. I had prepared these to be delivered to you by the son of Zender, but he left without my knowledge; which has greatly troubled me.</p>
