      <p>Gentlemen, having heard of the agreement between your church and ours, I cannot help but rejoice... knowing how much this can benefit the advancement of the glory of God, of which I am assured you are very zealous and affectionate, I have no doubt that you have a very good will to uphold the conservation of the agreements and not otherwise for the affection that we must all have for it. I will not fail to strongly urge you on my part - similarly to the alliance that I understand His Majesty wants to make... -.. cease.</p>
      <p>By this... thing that you can also think can bring great good to all the reformed churches and in general to all good people. And if in recognizing you see that I can do something for you either in general or in particular, rest assured that I will employ myself with a very good heart, from which recommending myself to your very good graces and proofs, I will pray to continue and increase. Gentlemen, in health, yours. (?) From Châtillon this 13th day of January 1572.</p>
      <p>I pray you, gentlemen, that as you see that the devil does not sleep to do harm, that on your part you also watch to repress the saints and practices and remember me in your good prayers.</p>
      <p>Your entirely good friend Châtillon.</p>
      <p>To the ministers of the church of Zürich.</p>
