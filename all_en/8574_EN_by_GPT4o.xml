      <p>Greetings. From the letters written by my son-in-law, Mr. Simler, I understood that mine have been delivered to you, which makes me glad. When I read those you sent to me and saw that mine had not yet been delivered to you, I began to worry that they might have fallen into untrustworthy hands. From yours, I gather how miserable the anarchy is among you. May the Lord Himself watch over us and have mercy on us, who daily add to the heap of sins something, but what do I say, something, indeed we add infinite things. Therefore, I fear the greatest dangers and infinite evils are hanging over us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if we are wise, let us prepare ourselves to endure future evils by the grace of God and encourage the churches entrusted to our faith to reconcile themselves to God through repentance and faith.</p>
      <p>As for your synod, be of undaunted spirit and invoke His help and spirit. Certainly, the Lord is near to those who call upon Him, to those who call upon Him in truth. And it seems beneficial to you ministers and your church that none of ours are summoned to you, lest your lords and your people suspect that you are not sufficiently instructed, etc., and thus your authority diminishes. However, be constant and simple, adhering to our confession in all things and not allowing yourselves to be drawn away to foreign things. To this end, I send you here copies of the synodal letters; from these, it will be clear that the churches of France agree with us in all things. Therefore, you may use these as testimonies against the cunning and for the consolation and confirmation of the pious.</p>
      <p>Then you will send those letters back to me; you will have sent them soon enough when you hear after a month that I have returned safe and sound from the baths of Veltlin. In the meantime, may the gracious Lord keep you, all the brothers, your family, and the whole church! If you wish to write something to me, send it either to Haller or Simler, my intimates; they will in turn send it to me through the scholarly couriers whom I have appointed for this task.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, honorable lord and dearest brother. May the Lord bless you! Greet my most esteemed lords, the councilors, Pontisella, our Gregory, Bonet, and especially our Campell and Johann MÃ¼ller, if he is with you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, very quickly, June 1, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Jesus Christ and faithful minister of the church of Chur, Mr. Tobias Egli, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
