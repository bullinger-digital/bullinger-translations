    <p xml:id="regest1">Was pleased about the letter [No. 819]. Has no news yet from the convention in Eisenach. The people of Zurich mostly adhere obediently to the ban on mercenary service, while it is to be feared that from the currently still divided Five Cantons, crowds of mercenaries will soon join the French king; Bern has become entangled in the matter in a most unwise manner. Jakob Frömbd is welcome.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, most illustrious man, with great joy of heart; for what you write is most welcome.</p>
      <p>Regarding the convention in Eisenach, I have not heard a single word in the meantime, and therefore I do not know what I can predict. I wish I am mistaken! I fear that they will bring wagons of ceremonies, a most unwelcome burden.</p>
      <p>Here with us, there is indeed great security. The citizens and those who inhabit the countryside beautifully obey the magistrate prohibiting mercenary service. Only a few scoundrels have broken out with the danger of their lives. Among the Five Cantons, there is a remarkable turmoil. They provoke each other with mutual words and blows. For there are some magnates who support the emperor's side; but the common people, corrupted by French gold, oppose them. Those who are more sensible among us suspect that within a few days, they will, in groups and with raised banners, join the French king, neglecting the emperor, who is thought to have paid them 6000 crowns. The people of Zurich lament that faith is so miserably betrayed and all discipline trampled upon, that everything is for sale among them. The people of Bern seem to have most unwisely entangled themselves in this evil. But fate leads the willing and drags the unwilling. We have sufficiently marked out crimes, sufficiently despised the long-suffering of God, trampled on patience. Soon the avenging God will be present. You will pray to the Lord to have mercy on us, and that for the glory of His name. Jakob Frömbd, in your name and because he is a good man, will be most commendable to us.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 9th of June, 1536.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Thomas Blarer, the most prudent senator of Constance, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
