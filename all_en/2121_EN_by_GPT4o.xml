      <p>In the past days, I was in Strasbourg (Argentoratum), I saw your son, spoke to him, and also asked how he was doing, what company he kept. He often speaks with Mr. Zanchi, and from him, I learned all good things about that young man: and when I wanted to leave, I indicated that I would come to Zürich (Tigurum) and bring his letters if he gave me any. He gave me these, and also instructed that if I found a messenger in Basel (Basileae), I should send them to you through him (for I indicated that I would go to Bern (Bernam) before coming to Zürich): therefore, I am sending them. Within four days, I will leave for Bern; where, after staying for two or three days, I will come straight to Zürich to enjoy the sweetest company of all of you for a few days: so much for these matters. Mr. Peter Martyr and Mr. Zanchi send you many greetings. Nothing good is heard from England: through letters, we have received that the most pious Archbishop of Canterbury was first sentenced to the gallows, then to be cut into four parts as a traitor of majesty. Also condemned were all the sons of the Duke of Northumberland, as well as the sons of the Duke of Suffolk, along with Jane herself who had been elected queen. But whether punishment has yet been carried out on any of these, we have learned nothing certain. The day before I left Strasbourg, all of Mr. Peter Martyr's chests, with God's favor, were brought; and I hope that he will again have a most honorable position from the lords. He had rented a house and was daily furnishing it with various furniture, awaiting the help and calling of the lord. Public prayers were held daily for the English church; and it is certain that Queen Mary, the sister of the Emperor, is seeking Calais (Caletum), where the most impious Jezebel of England is also expected to come: everyone asserts that a marriage has been made between the King of Spain and Jezebel; which, although it was not allowed by papal laws, is said to have been consented to by the pope, with the condition that the pope himself be again received as the supreme head of the English church: therefore, it is necessary to pray constantly for that miserable and almost lost church. Farewell and love me, and please greet Mr. Gwalter in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 21, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Girolamo Massari.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
