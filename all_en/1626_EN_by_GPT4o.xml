      <p>I received your letter, written on the 15th of this month, yesterday in the town of Beaune, along with your two books, one of which you wish to be offered to His Majesty the King, and the other to Margaret of France. Today, I will send it to His Majesty, who is in the camp located at the Meuse; I will personally offer the second to Margaret, as I am heading to the Queen and will not stay there long.</p>
      <p>She was gravely ill, to the point where all the doctors despaired of her recovery; but now she has recovered. As for what you write about the practices she supports in Switzerland, I am grateful; but the Pope can do little or nothing, as he is exhausted of both money and strength, and without these, those with whom he has dealings can do little. Nevertheless, we must be extremely vigilant. I know that many do not approve of this expedition of His Majesty, which has a distinguished army. I certainly wish to return to you; but it is not yet permitted, nor will I be able to attend the next assembly. With God's help, I will attend the following one. In the meantime, His Majesty will write to the Swiss. What is said about Mirandola is false; indeed, our soldiers who are there left the town a week before Easter, made raids on the enemies, killing many, among whom was the Pope's nephew, and took others captive back to the town. I believe the army of the German princes will soon visit Constance, and I hope to see you soon, if the Lord wills, and if it were not for the need to communicate with the Queen and the Admirals about serious matters, I would already fly to you. These are the things I could write in passing amidst many anxieties and endless affairs. Farewell. May the Lord keep you safe for His church. From Drudano, Burgundy, April 28, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Maurilius Musaeus.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, honorable, wise Lord Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the holy word in Zürich, my kind, dear lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
