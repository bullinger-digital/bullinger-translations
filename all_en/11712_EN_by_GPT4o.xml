    <p xml:id="regest1">[Peter] Kunz reacted with great joy to the letter from Bullinger and Erasmus [Schmid] as well as to Bullinger's [Commentary on Matthew] and fully agreed with his doctrine of the Lord's Supper; only due to time constraints, he does not write himself but is considering visiting Bullinger in Zurich; he would also welcome a visit from Bullinger in Bern, as Rümlang has hinted. However, he insists that in the dispute with Erasmus [Ritter], he has not deviated from the doctrine of the [Bernese] Disputation, but this should be overlooked; Bullinger and [Schmid] should write to him again and also mention Rümlang's mediation; in this way, Bucer's influence can finally be overcome, for which Sebastian [Meyer] rather than Kunz was responsible anyway. Sends excerpts on Swiss history requested by Bullinger, of which he will later send an improved version. Greetings. It is understandable that [Kunz] does not openly admit his error, but there is hope for improvement. Further greetings. Another request to write to Kunz, after he received the first letter so well.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Most learned and faithful Bullinger, I cannot adequately express in words how much Kunz was delighted by your and Erasmus's letters and how grateful he was for the gift of your book; he was overjoyed and even told me that he eagerly read your opinion on the Lord's Supper first, which he approves and recognizes as truly consistent with the Scriptures and orthodox, and that he agrees with you in everything. If it weren't for the brevity of time and current occupations being an impediment, he would have written to you; for he mentioned that he was contemplating what he would write; for he abundantly wishes to clear himself and does not doubt that he will satisfy you, and that he has been unfairly accused in many things. He indeed extols your praises and asked me to inform you that he will write to you and, when he has sent letters to you and received yours in return, if he could conveniently obtain company, he would set out to visit you and discuss in person all matters that seem beneficial to the churches; for I had indicated to him that you desire an opportunity to visit Bern. He said that such a visit from you would be most welcome to him. I informed him today that a messenger had arrived; if he wished to write to you, he could do so conveniently. But he excused the lack of time; therefore, he entrusted this to me. Our discord, abolished by your and Erasmus's letters, seeks your company, and today he repeated to me what I had also indicated to you, that he does not want to appear as if he had repented in the recent (as he called it) paroxysm with Erasmus, but that he never deviated nor attempted anything against our disputation. Here lies the crux of the matter; we should willingly concede this with the certain hope that what was admitted through imprudence will be repaired with greater zeal and effort in the future. For he testified that he will handle the matter of the Eucharist so openly that everyone will have to feel what his mind is and that he wants to defend the parts of our disputation. I ask on his behalf, on behalf of our church, and on my own, that you and Erasmus would write to Kunz through this messenger and also mention me as a faithful interpreter, who desires your minds to be united for the progress of the church. Then he will feel my diligence and integrity. You can do nothing more desirable, so that great fruit will also abound for the entire church. Do not, I pray, regret the labor nor be reluctant, so that finally Proteus Bucer may be expelled. And, to tell the truth, Kunz is not the author of this tragedy, but Sebastian, who has left; he often preached impudently, not to say foolishly, although we often said he was foolish because of his old age. Please comply, etc.</p>
      <p>I send what you requested, always mindful of you; what I have compiled from Latin authors about the Swiss and our homeland is still confused, for I have only assigned the places. They are also written so negligently that no sense seems to be able to be extracted from them, wherefore I will sometime annotate them more clearly, so they can be read, and send them to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily. Greet Erasmus, Gaspar, and all the good men you have in great numbers.</p>
      <p>Always, my Bullinger, let us hope for better things. Such is the human nature, that it is ashamed of error. Let us support those who are so ashamed of error that they do not want to appear to have erred so disgracefully. He does not defend the error nor uphold it; the error is so gross that he detests it. From this, I conceive a certain hope that the matter will be better in the future.</p>
      <p>For the benefit of the church, let us overlook many things and always be ready and inclined to gather, so that we may win over people. We often stumble in many things. I believe it was not without the special judgment of God that the matter was made clearer, etc. I cannot restrain my pen; please take it in good part.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your entire honorable family, etc. Greet the consul Hab, Lavater, Nasal, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>Please, write to Kunz, also urge Erasmus; for your letters are most welcome and the previous ones were very well received.</p>
