      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Since we hear that your excellency is in good health and, more importantly, that you are undertaking your usual labors, if not even more burdensome than before, with a certain vigor of spirit and firm bodily health, we cannot help but rejoice greatly and praise the eternal Father, who, after so many lights have been taken from us by the envy of past times, preserves you as the remaining common parent of all learned men, until other men of good hope and great expectation reach the full maturity. What is happening in our country [you will learn from the distinguished man Trecio, my brother]. Not indeed with sword and fire, as Satan plans the destruction of the church of God in France, Flanders, and other provinces, but by other means, which are undoubtedly more pernicious, namely by stirring up the frivolous minds of various heretics, who, due to their innate malice, never rest but constantly bring forth something new.</p>
      <p>May the Lord restrain and curb their mad minds. I will mention your most learned letters, so that you do not think that I have either forgotten them or that they have not been delivered to me. I had written down some of my thoughts and sent them to you, distinguished man, in writing, in which I recall having advised that not only separately from anyone, but with combined forces (which are usually stronger), the kingdom of the Antichrist should be attacked as if by an army properly arranged.</p>
      <p>I wrote this when many excellent things were being reported here in our country about this emperor and the king of France, but since the die fell otherwise than it was cast, I myself almost come over to your opinion. However, concerning the manner of abolishing the kingdom of the Antichrist before the day of judgment, since you have written some very beautiful things and since the doctors seem to disagree with each other in this matter, I would gladly inquire from you, distinguished man, whether anything certain can be gathered from the sacred scriptures. For some say it is to be destroyed by the spirit of the mouth according to Paul, others say it is to be consumed by fire descending from heaven according to John. Then some extend this time until the last day, others believe it is to be accomplished within a just period before that day. I have always favored this latter opinion more, unless I was advised by your letters, and I judged that this destruction by the spirit of the Lord's mouth could be administered in as varied a manner as the word of God is announced in various and multiple ways. It is announced both publicly and privately, now in parishes, now in synods or councils, now by persuading the kingdom of God, now even by convincing the contradictors. Nor did I think it would be alien to scripture if such a council were convened against the obstinacy of this wicked one, and there, as happened to other Antichrists, namely Arius, Eutyches, and Nestorius, he would be convicted, confounded, and finally excommunicated, exposed to ridicule and prey to kings and princes (if it seemed possible to do so because of their internal hatreds). Nor did I think that the fire, which should descend from heaven, would be more terrifying to the eyes of the Antichrist than if in this way a burning pyre were erected for him by men of sound mind and excellent doctrine.</p>
      <p>To this opinion, I was greatly invited by that prophecy of Mr. Calvin on Genesis. He said, "The pope will be dealt with until he is reduced to that title, as he calls himself the servant of servants, which title was first given to Ham." I inserted this little question here, partly because no more pliable material occurred to me, about which I could more pleasantly converse with you as with a most dear father, partly because you made not an obscure mention of this matter in your letters to me. Therefore, if I am troublesome to you, I do not wish you to respond to these things, but if you are freer, as is likely during the time of the harvest, let it be permitted to converse with you in writing, since it was not allowed in person due to the Lord denying the opportunity. Indeed, I would have counted it among the happiest things that happened to me in life if I had been allowed to gaze upon your dignified face in such venerable old age. But what was not allowed in such a miserable life will undoubtedly be allowed in that blessed and most happy one. May the Lord guide us by His spirit to the praise and glory of His most holy name. Amen. Farewell, distinguished man, and may the Lord keep you with all your colleagues for as long as possible. Given in Krakau on the 15th of June in the year of our Lord 1568.</p>
      <p>Stanislaus Stadnicki, minister of the church of God of the Ursins, most devoted to your piety.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most prudent pastor and moderator of the church of Zurich, my lord and friend to be reverently honored.</p>
