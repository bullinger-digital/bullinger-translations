      <p>S. Gesner delighted me wonderfully with his unique modest erudition and candor, most learned Bullinger. As much as I could, I received the man as a friend, assisted him in his affairs, and if I could have done more for him, I certainly would have, this I dare say, unless it had depended on me, with matters unfinished and with the detriment of personal affairs, and, as it is said, wasting oil and expenses, he would have left here. But about all these things, and in what state the assembly still lingers, he himself will inform you with a living letter.</p>
      <p>I can write nothing to you about our assemblies that could not have been written 5 months ago; the Catholics seek perpetual postponements, with their head promoting this excellently, and if serious and arduous matters, in which they say the state of the empire is not entirely, when they want and the head says something, they cause annoyance, the mind is refreshed with hunts, and to have everything in one word, the whole controversy hangs on this, whether because of a legitimate wife and if in other matters also to our confession a bishop, canon, abbot, parish priest, or provost should be admitted, he should be dismissed from office and administration, he can freely use, if he nourishes countless harlots, dogs, parasites, gambling and gamblers, and myriads of that kind. About secular, as they say, princes and states, commonly von den weltlichen, they are not very concerned, doing this one thing, lest by acting rightly and conforming to Christ's institution, namely their sacred ministry be confederated, their anointed ones also be retained in idolatrous office. Thus you have the whole account of the assemblies. Moreover, they urge and desire, as many as stand by the gospel, that it be free for all universally to defect from lies and imposture to the truth, nor do they want the doctrine of Christ to be branded with a mark, so that it is such, for which one who gave his name to this should be dismissed from sacred duties. May the Lord grant that they persevere strongly in this opinion.</p>
      <p>These so horrendous things our preachers, who hear these blasphemies of the papists not only from the counselors of the bishops and their adherents, but also from the preachers, are vigorously agitated from the public pulpit, for a certain theologian doctor raged terribly at St. Ulrich, another no less fierce at St. Moritz, who once acted among the Freiburgers near you, a third in the church of the Dominican monks, a fourth in the cathedral church, a fifth in the royal Franciscan church no less rages, eloquent and not unlearned men, meanwhile ours, who preach the gospel, care little about this, but with all their might they rage against the fanatics. Recently, a young man at St. Cross slandered my Musculus with amazing calumnies from the pulpit. Such is the madness of the Wittenbergers and the most shameless license of speaking, that our senate, plainly papistic, nevertheless moved by the injustice of the matter, sent away three principal ones; they would all prefer, if it could be done conveniently, to be sent away.</p>
      <p>The Turkish attack against Hungary is certainly feared. I believe Werenthovius is dead; for he writes nothing at all to me.</p>
      <p>I ask you to write more often; for your letters delight me greatly. I thank you innumerably for the most learned little book sent to me. Strozzi is said to have betrayed the Port of Hercules without any urgent necessity, certainly to the great detriment of the French. Farewell, my Bullinger, and continue happily to propagate the kingdom of Christ. Augsburg, July 20, in the year etc. 55.</p>
      <p>Your G[ereon] S[ailer].</p>
