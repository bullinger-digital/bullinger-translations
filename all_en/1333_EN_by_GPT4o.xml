      <p>Partly detained by occupations and partly lacking the convenience of messengers, I have not written anything to your magnificence for a long time, most illustrious Bullinger. The affairs of Parma could achieve beautiful outcomes, if only that vigor and sharpness for vindicating his majesty were present in Heinrich, which was present in his father Franz. But the authority of the cardinals, the ambition and pursuit of honor by the French bishops, the superstitious filth of the clergy, and the gluttony of the young king will soften his mind and call him back from arms. We hear that the Pope is urging you not to want to bring any aid to his and the Holy See's enemy against the ancestral confederation and faith; but I think that among men of that kind, French shields will prevail more than papal prayers; for faith and piety are rare among men who follow the camp. It is written from Augsburg that the emperor has sent ten companies of foot soldiers to Italy to aid the Pope, and that the captain from Syseneck is now assembling ten other companies, and that the count from Ladroen will soon enlist ten companies, so that the emperor has decided to send thirty companies there.</p>
      <p>The emperor is reported to have changed his lodging in Augsburg; it is said that he has moved to more spacious houses and more pleasant with a magnificent garden. Nothing is heard about his departure from there, and because the place is convenient for Italy, France, Hungary, and all of Germany, it is heard that he will not leave there immediately. The civil war at Magdeburg is being dragged on and continued, not without great infamy and weakening of the entire empire. It was fitting for the princes to avert this war and not to commit Germany to arms among themselves out of the lust and disdain of our druids; but it is likely that this counsel will be most pernicious to the advisors, for it is believed that money will run out sooner than that city can be conquered; the city is also said to be well fortified and equipped with soldiers and provisions, and they have praise for fortitude and virtue from the enemy, and the cause of the war undertaken is considered great enough and worth the effort, for which such great dangers are approached.</p>
      <p>For he who does not wish to face extreme dangers for freedom and religion is unworthy of life and light. It is likely that this war will give rise to greater movements; not everyone perceives that this war has been undertaken and is being conducted not so much for seeking peace as for the pursuit of private gain.</p>
      <p>Men of great name and place have set out from England to France, and men of the same dignity are expected to arrive from France to England, and it is said that there is sufficient agreement between the same kings; but if only French faith is now more constant and integral than it has been before. Our church and school are still quite intact and whole; but what fate future times will bring us is a matter of uncertain expectation. I would not want the care of the council to be rejected by us, but now, while leisure is given, arms should be prepared against our enemies; for it is likely that the emperor will demand the continuation and perfection of the council from the Pope in return for the benefit provided. But when the Pope sees that we are prepared for the defense of our most just and holy cause, he will postpone and delay the judgment. I ask that you commend me to the most illustrious man with you, Habeo, also to your son-in-law, Bibliander, and the other friends, and to Butler the Englishman. If I can gratify your magnificence with any service, I am most ready. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, July 9, 1551.</p>
      <p>Christopher Mont.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Bullinger, a friend to be respected.</p>
