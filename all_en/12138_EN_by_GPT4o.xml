      <p>Greetings. You may wonder, most learned Heinrich, with what boldness I, such a person, have dared to write to you, especially since there has never been any acquaintance or familiarity between us. But you would certainly cease to wonder if you knew well enough my feelings towards you and my dedication to you.</p>
      <p>I have read several of your works, which you have given us on the Acts of the Apostles and all the Pauline Epistles. Furthermore, those most learned commentaries of yours on Matthew and John, which were recently published, are received with such great desire by all pious scholars and are eagerly consumed by everyone, that the holy Church of Christ owes you immortal thanks for these most beautiful labors. May the Lord Jesus, whose cause you vigorously promote, strengthen you with His good spirit and increase the excellent gifts granted to you, so that the most sacred truth of the Gospel may be more widely spread and illuminated through your work. For we also hope, brother, for commentaries on Mark and Luke to be either published by you or soon to be published.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most kind Heinrich, and kindly accept these my writings, though unrefined and more than extemporaneous.</p>
      <p>Given at Gundelfingen, March 5th, in the year 1545. Wolfgang Strasser, minister of the church in Gundelfingen, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the man of great piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church in Zurich, these letters are given.</p>
