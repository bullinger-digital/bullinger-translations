    <p xml:id="regest1">Dares to write to Bullinger only because he knows his kindness. Recently had a conversation with Bullinger and Leo Jud together with [Hans] Briner to achieve a better professional position; now that the burden of his growing family is increasing and it seems hopeless to reach the council in this matter, he hopes for Bullinger's support. Has repeatedly substituted for the ailing pastor of B端lach, [Johannes] Ochsli, at the pulpit; he wishes to resign and, like the majority of the church congregation, wants him as a successor. Besides Bullinger and the former Kyburg bailiff [Hans Rudolf Lavater], he has no one he can count on for help; he would do everything to meet the expectations, and he also leads a blameless life.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Many times I have resolved, most learned Bullinger, to write to you, but my ignorance has always held me back, which indeed seems safest to remain hidden in silence. However, when your kindness comes to my mind, which constant fame has spread about you and I have somewhat experienced, it happens that, casting aside all shame, I do not fear to trouble you with my letters.</p>
      <p>Not long ago (which I do not doubt you have not forgotten), Briner and I met with you and Leo (Jud) seeking advice and help, if by any means it could happen that the state of my condition might be changed. I have now served many years as a deacon, and that with a rather meager salary, yet with which I have been content until now. But since my flock of children has now increased and grows daily, and I do not have enough to support my family, I am compelled by necessity to seek a state of greater fortune. You might say: "Demand this from your council, whose duty it is to help those who serve in public offices!" I have indeed begun to attempt this, but was amicably dissuaded by a very friendly member of the council. "For do not even dream," he said, "of coming to the council for this matter, for you will hear sooner than said: 'If you are weary of this province, seek a more splendid one abroad. There is someone who will gladly take this up with open arms!'" Hence, I must remain silent among my own. However, when we were with you, your benevolence and brotherly love, which I sensed was forthcoming to all, called me to great hope, and I was pleased to seek help from abroad.</p>
      <p>We also spoke with you about Bovillus, who acts as bishop in B端lach, to whom his function seemed quite hard, which he affirmed he was less able to administer, and that he would seek a quieter one, indeed, if by any means it could be done, he would exchange his for mine. However, at present, the good and pious man is confined to bed and cannot perform his duty, he called me, to which I willingly complied and have already preached several times in his place, and will continue to do so until he can travel to Z端rich to seek release; for he is entirely persuaded that he will resign from the teaching office. Furthermore, as far as I understand, both Bovillus and the majority of the church congregation would wish for me as a successor (if anything could be achieved by wishes). But there is no reason for me to anxiously seek it nor to appeal to anyone about this matter, yet I would not refuse it if it came, indeed I would accept it with great thanks.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I humbly beseech you as the pillar of my family, to support it with your strength; for besides you and the one who not long ago held the office in Kyburg, I have no one at all. I therefore uniquely ask and beseech you to do what you believe will be in my interest. I, in turn, will be vigilant not to disappoint either your or anyone else's expectations. I have served as a deacon for thirteen years now and, not to speak boastfully of myself, inquire from those who have observed what the course of my life has been.</p>
      <p>Farewell and hold me in your highest regard.</p>
      <p>Given at Winterthur, on the eighth day before the Ides of March in the year 37.</p>
      <p>Melchior Bucher, Deacon of Winterthur, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To M. Heinrich Bullinger, Chief Bishop of Z端rich.</p>
