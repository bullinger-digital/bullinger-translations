      <p>It has been a long time since I last wrote to you, most kind Bullinger, and during this time nothing worthy of writing has occurred, and I know that you receive letters from England regularly and are not ignorant of the state of the kingdom. The inclination and dissipation of all things here with us is known to the whole world. The Imperial Majesty is hastening the completion of the diet; for many believe he is going to Mailand and, having held a wedding there between his son and his cousin, is planning something monstrous.</p>
      <p>For many suspect that he is troubled by the agreement between the Pope and the French, and it is believed that the Pope, with his prudence, is more pretending than genuinely having friendship with the Emperor. It is likely that the restoration of Savoy will cause some disturbance in the coming summer. We hear that the Saxons still retain and teach their religion with usual constancy, and merchants coming from there report that there are raids and depredations of fields between the Duke of Braunschweig and the city.</p>
      <p>However, in the rest of Saxony, nothing violent or hostile is being prepared or committed.</p>
      <p>I think that in these upcoming diets, the play of the general council will be seriously and earnestly pursued; for the Emperor, with this scarecrow, which he knows to be formidable to the Pope, will shake the Balaamites by promising ample and magnificent offices in the name of advocacy and ecclesiastical prefecture to our people. The Pope will commend his efforts and diligence greatly, having achieved that after so many years of stubborn refusal and rejection of the council, the Protestants have now consented and agreed to comply with the decrees and constitutions of the council, etc., and thus he will terrify both with this thunderbolt. But the Italians, with their prudence and experience, know how to outwit the Cretans. We, however, with our cowardice, tremble half-dead at the rustling of the eagle's feathers and, falling from the best cause, offer our throats. In my opinion, it would be in the common interest if there were agreement and union among the Swiss Evangelicals, Germans, Saxons, English, and Danes, so that with united minds and shared counsels they might defend and uphold the same doctrine and confession of faith in the council; for if the children of this world, made strong by united votes for preserving their superstition and mammon, decide to risk their ultimate salvation out of desperation, what should we, bound by the equity of the cause and the religion of the sacrament, do under the leadership of the lion against those condemned and acting for a cause most desperate to their consciences? I ask you to consider this cause, and that we may not descend to this arena unprepared and unarmed. For the truth, which is the foundation and ground of our cause, is far more powerful than the shield of Ajax and the arms of Vulcan. I ask you to commend me to your son-in-law Rudolf and the other companions. Peter Paul Vergerius was with us these days; as he is already known to me by name and reputation, so too have I begun to have a thorough understanding of his character and life. I ask you to reveal your judgment of this man to me. Farewell. Stra√üburg, July, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Christopher Mont.</p>
