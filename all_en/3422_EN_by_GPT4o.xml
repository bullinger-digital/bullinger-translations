      <p>Greetings. I am sending you, most esteemed lord and godfather, this letter (from Mr. Beza), in which he undoubtedly explains to you his journey to the princes, and what happened in Worms and elsewhere... He has explained the same to us through letters. He strongly urges that we agree to a colloquium so that we may persuade our people of this.</p>
      <p>He also sends another confession presented in Worms by the theologians gathered there, which I do not like. I would have preferred that we had presented the earlier one left with the Palatinate.</p>
      <p>You see how they twist themselves and try in every way to satisfy the Lutheran expressions.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I fear for myself from them, if ever the matter should come to a conference. For I foresee that they will lead us from light into some darkness, from which we might scarcely emerge later. Therefore, I ask that you immediately share your judgment with me on this confession of theirs and their entire plan, so that I may also act here as seems appropriate. I wrote recently about the people of Geneva.</p>
      <p>The legates are going to accept the citizenship for themselves, who have full authority, yet they want to bring it behind them. They are only waiting for their message, which is difficult here; then we will also send a message to them, which will be difficult for them. While these things are happening, the Count of Chalon and another one with him, sent by the Duke of Savoy, arrive. He desires to renew the citizenship with my lords.</p>
      <p>This is therefore a pretext; he would like to negotiate with my lords about the land. Some think he would like to hinder the citizenship with Geneva.</p>
      <p>But the more he negotiates, the more Bern and Geneva will become united.</p>
      <p>They will receive a brief decision here.</p>
      <p>Regarding Johannes Göldli the Younger, I can testify this (as my brother asked me to do this with you): he has enough talent, if he had enough diligence. He spent a whole year here, conducted himself honorably in terms of life and morals, but I missed some diligence in his studies. Now he is in Lausanne, where I hope he can make more progress than here.</p>
      <p>This is written very hastily; therefore, please excuse if anything is written carelessly. Bern, the last day of November 1557.</p>
      <p>Musculus and all of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Greet all of yours in our name.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed and dear lord and godfather. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
