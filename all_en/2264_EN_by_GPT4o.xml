      <p>I had indeed spoken much and highly of my Zurich friends; but recently you have far exceeded those expectations for an Italian man, unknown and traveling through your area, who now sports a graying and long beard. You received him with such humanity that I must acknowledge my great debt to you and all the others on his behalf, and I now dare to commend this noble compatriot of mine to you, hoping he will not be ungrateful. For I know, and have often experienced, how much you value learned men and friends of truth, such as Mr. Hugolino here. My dear Mr. Bullinger, he desires nothing more than to see you, to hear you, and to enter into your friendship. I seem to see how affable, how pleasant yet serious you will present yourself to him, for which I already congratulate him and thank you. I am only waiting for letters in which you write something certain about our Vergerio and instruct me to do something for his or his friends' benefit. I greet all the brothers, especially your son-in-law Simler, to whom I would not want to send empty letters, since he has sent me full ones.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I am grateful. You will also greet, if it is not too burdensome or troublesome, Mr. Johann Ziegler, my friend, to whom I would like to commend all my matters. What else? May God be with you, strengthening you with His spirit, so that you may serve His church for a long and happy time. Geneva, April 19, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Lelio Sozzini.</p>
      <p>Regarding the book you wrote in Italian about the origin of the error concerning the mass, which I had left with you, please send it to us here as soon as possible; an opportunity will arise for me to send it back to you printed shortly. Send it either to Mr. Calvin or Mr. Marquess, so that it may be delivered most safely.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, always to be honored by me.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
