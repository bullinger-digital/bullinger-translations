      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Francesco Negri sends greetings.</p>
      <p>The one who delivered my letter to you is commendable not only in his own name, as he is endowed with uncommon virtue, but also in his knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ and his sincere profession of the gospel, for which he is now suffering persecution and has come to you. I wish him to be recommended to you, most kind Bullinger, and to all the other brothers there, so that, in whatever matter he needs your assistance, which is your kindness, you may support him. From him, you will learn what he particularly needs, all of which, however, are done to promote the glory of Christ rather than to preserve his own comfort. Farewell in the Lord and commend me to all the brothers. Sils, 24th December 1545.</p>
      <p>Petrus Franciscus Rizardus, who was expelled from Merano for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and is now acting as a preacher in Thusis, wishes to be commended to you and the other brothers there.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed minister of the word of God. Zurich.</p>
