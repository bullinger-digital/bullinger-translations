      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Dearest brother, I am sending my eight-year-old daughter, who is motherless, to your kindness, with her uncle as her guide, trusting so much in your benevolence that I could almost be accused of presumption; but you bear with those already pressed by much calamity. The plague is raging among us beyond measure, as never before in the memory of the people who are now living. Herr Johannes Blasius, my colleague, is also bedridden. I wish that your entire church would pray to the Lord for him, so that such a useful servant would not be taken from our church. The girl, as well as her uncle who is bringing her, have had no contact in our town for more than thirty days, but have been above the mountain in a healthy place and air; nor did I want to give her clothes from my house, lest I infect others with any contagion. Dearest brother, see to it that she is placed with some pious and honest people for a price, but not for idleness, rather she should be taught to spin thread and other works that befit and adorn this sex and age. For I believe she will be quite timid and obedient, and whenever something is lacking, I am ready to provide; and if I should die, Heimius the consul, the girl's maternal uncle, or Tscharner will satisfy. Let no one doubt; nothing will be lost from the expenses. I also ask that the girl sleep alone, for she has been accustomed to this from the cradle, if it can be done. Pray for us to the Lord, that He may forgive our sins even from the most severe correction. Farewell in the Lord. From Chur, the fourteenth of July, 1550.</p>
      <p>Johannes Blasius and likewise all the brothers greet you very much. Let the son not learn of the father's adverse health, lest he relapse. There is hope of life; for he is not entirely unwell.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord and primary friend.</p>
