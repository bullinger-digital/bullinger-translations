      <p>Greetings. I now rarely write letters to you, most esteemed lord, father, and godfather, because for a long time I could have written almost nothing but private and domestic calamities. The Lord has taken from me within a few weeks six dearest children, three sons and as many daughters; six remain with me. Thus, he has divided equally with me, so that I may recognize his grace. Blessed be his name! Indeed, their death pierced my heart; yet I rejoice that they have now fought off all evil and enjoy eternal joy with Christ and all the elect, and I prepare myself, in the weakness of my faith, to follow them and join them there, where there will be perpetual joy without any alternation, when it pleases the Lord. Today, the other son of the late Michael Schlatter, Michael, the treasurer, died; otherwise, I know of no one who is currently ill. Also, in these days, Magdalena Göldli, the sister of my wife's brother, who had been married here to a certain minister, Johannes Placentarius, passed away. From Hungary, we have heard nothing for a long time, except what we received today from you and from your senate in these days. I greatly fear for the churches in the Netherlands; may God appear to them as from a cloud! We will diligently pray for him to do so. From Geneva, I also have nothing for a long time. In Lausanne, the plague is also threatening; I greatly fear for my Blasius. May the Lord preserve him! Otherwise, I have nothing to write. All of ours greet you, especially Mr. Steiger, who again sends you some of his wine through the steward Küngsfeld and greets you warmly along with the Zehenders, of whom the younger Ludwig, whose wife recently died, today celebrates his marriage with another, a rich widow from Solothurn, who was previously married to Sebastian Summerer, the prefect in Sumiswald. My father-in-law also sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 14, 1566.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours, as you know.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and godfather. Zurich.</p>
