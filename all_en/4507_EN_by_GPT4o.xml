      <p>My humble service is always ready for your honor. Your letter, honorable sir and godfather, has been faithfully delivered to me.</p>
      <p>In response, I briefly provide this reply (for I would gladly write much and at length to your honor; however, it is not well possible for me, because I am still under the doctor's care and have taken syrup for five days, but today, so that I may speak and write to your honor with permission, I have taken a purgative and universal evacuation. Therefore, my request to you, my lord and godfather, is that you have patience with me.) The situation in our land is as it is in yours, and as you imagine it according to the form of your government, it is not; for I have previously outlined the form of our government in my writing and have also sufficiently reported orally to my gracious lord, Mr. Müller, the mayor. Furthermore, my gracious lord from Chur, the mayor, knows somewhat of the situation. However, it is not possible for someone outside the lands, who does not daily handle the practices, to inquire and understand these matters piece by piece, from person to person, as someone who resides in the lands, knows their customs and practices, and through daily experience and acquaintance, constant practice and consideration, understands all these matters better and better. And therefore, since I have now spent four years in these lands, observing and noting one thing and another, my humble request to you, my lord and father, is: since a king or a prince trusts his ambassador and envoy, and is not ashamed to receive a report from them, you should not take it amiss if I also report, on the one hand, what can be hoped for from these lands, and on the other hand, how the matter should be handled. As far as the common land is concerned, the situation is good and there is much to hope for; but everything depends on patience. Therefore, you should not take it amiss: I was greatly surprised that my gracious lord from Chur, the mayor, knew the customs of this land and yet nothing was done about it; for the majority in the Pünthen sit in the wilderness and know nothing of these matters. However, our mayor came to Einsiedeln on the next appointed day and was sent, not because the Glarus people requested a word of it, nor an honorable council of the city of Zurich, but because G. Carlin came from that day and did not understand much good in Baden (for they have trusted him with all their secrets). He shared all this with me, and we both contributed to the fact that the three heads were summoned and the mayor was dispatched in haste; for there was no more time than three days. Therefore, he could not be dispatched with full authority.</p>
      <p>Also, a messenger from an honorable council of the city of Zurich came here on a Saturday. I did not know a word of it; nor did any Zurich messenger, of whom many have been sent here while I have been here, ever speak to me or greet me with a word, neither little nor much, and that I did not wait for other matters, I have taken to heart in this current situation. For whatever one may think of me, I still believe that I am not a bad man for the city of Zurich in these lands. And to be brief, it was discussed here yesterday, and not a man was found in the entire city of Chur who was against it, indeed, who was not willing to help the Glarus people with justice and, if it cannot be done otherwise with goodwill, to risk life and property for them. The same is true in the Pergel area.</p>
      <p>I hope it will be the same elsewhere in the God's house - for it was discussed yesterday in the common Pünthen - if indeed the bishop has not used any deceit in the proclamation. It is such a situation that a man who does not represent the community properly can hardly prove that the community is good.</p>
      <p>From the courts, I hope for all good things - Paul Paul, the treasurer's father, comes from them; we can trust him with all good things -; for those in the courts are a brave, capable people. Our consul comes with Baptista a Salice; there you will not hear smooth words, but briefly yes or no; for the situation in the land is good. They come from the Upper League, where the papist faction always prevails, the land judge and the lord of Rozins, Planta, both papists. And since the custom is that those from the Upper League speak at the meetings, they actually let it go and do not leave it at that, also inquiring about the others. And if it comes to a meeting, and the matter is delayed so long, they will put it to a vote; and if they are asked (I speak of the papist men of the Upper League, I do not doubt the others) and say it has not been decided, they must bring it before the communities and write an answer, yes or no. But if the matter should proceed and the meeting is not attended, I hope to God, we will stand honestly, unless the people deceive me greatly, and many pious communities will stand faithfully with us. - Our lords have written to their officials in the Valtellina that good words should be had, quod ad exterum militem. However, there is a strong rumor - it comes from everywhere, it is also said to have been written to the bishop of Constance; indeed, merchants who come from Italy affirm -: the Turk has now caused great damage in Corsica while withdrawing, also plundered Ostia, and turned around and, when a captain from Ancona with 800 men shipped for provisions, captured them and unexpectedly sailed towards Ancona. Some say he has conquered it, some doubt the fortress; the rest is said to have been taken by him. So the pope had to use the troops that were supposed to go elsewhere there in haste. These things are now being reported consistently by many, so that I hope God will intervene, and thwart their plans at sea, only that one is capable, as I have heard with great joy, that many are willing and ready. If ours stand firm - it is well and good -, they will do what is right for them; but if they are hesitant (as human practices are swift), we will still let God prevail, who can win with few as well as with many, so that all honor is his. But it is certain: if ours, that is, the 3 Leagues, do not do what is necessary (as I will report to you on the next Wednesday with our messengers, who have delayed the matter so long, all the dealings; for now, on Wednesday, we are waiting for the answer from all places) - although I hope for the better -, I will no longer be in these lands; for I have done everything that is to be done. And if I do not find a corner in the Tigurine field, I will not serve any less in those places where all faithful service, effort, and work would be lost.</p>
      <p>However, I hope for better things and fear worse, because that delay and hesitation do not please me. I have done my part.</p>
      <p>May God grant that the matter turns out for the best. Amen. The form of the republic is not like ours in Rhaetia under the sky today.</p>
      <p>What an oligarchy can do is shown to us by the 5 Pagi; for they conceal everything from their magnates and do not present the cause at home in the communities in the way it is debated in the assemblies, and therefore they have their subjects, whom they would not have had if the matter were open to them.</p>
      <p>A few were recently summoned here to the assemblies by the bishop's laziness and malice, who could have instructed their people at home about everything. Now in many communities (I say what I fear) it is likely that the matter is not presented in the way it should be. If the matter is referred to your assemblies, there is hope that ours will not be lacking.</p>
      <p>Now in such haste, with the malice of many and the negligence of many and the magnates, I do not see what to hope for. But all our hope is fixed in the Lord; cursed is he who trusts in men. If God is for us, who can be against us?</p>
      <p>The desire to write leads me further than I intended. However, as I write this, letters come from Chiavenna; the messengers who bring them affirm the same about the Turk as I wrote above, but add that Ancona was not captured, but everything around it was devastated far and wide. Others come from the market in Rüfli, Rüfli being near Bellinzona, and among others, an honest citizen who recently moved here from Glarus brings this: he was further with horses in the Duchy of Milan, but found no other servants than in a village called Verriss, about 300 Spaniards. And they and the community say they are waiting for the Confederates to rise.</p>
      <p>But what are 300?</p>
      <p>So much for this.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve you for His church. Amen. I gladly accept your excuse for writing less; I know your occupations. But still, if there is anything that we should know, give this task to Mr. Lavater or Mr. Heinrich or Rodolph, the sons.</p>
      <p>Our people write to the council of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours.</p>
      <p>Chur, October 21, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, always honorable lord and patron.</p>
