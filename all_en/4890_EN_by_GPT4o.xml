      <p>I do not doubt that you received my rather long letter yesterday through a certain good man, whom I found at the inn of the Crown, whose name I did not ask; however, he affirmed that he would go straight to ZÃ¼rich and deliver everything to you in good faith. After lunch, a young man from Thurgau brought me a letter from Jung, dated July 20th in Basel. Among other things, he writes: "Yesterday, two very Christian brothers from the Val d'Aosta came to us, who testify that peace has now been made with the Duke of Savoy, after he was driven into flight ten times by them, and finally, with the open hand of the Lord miraculously fighting for them, however impious he may appear; now they are seeking alms from the churches." This is what he wrote, which I wanted to convey to you, in case they (I think they will come to you as well) and other churches that love the word of God, so that they may be helped by their pious and fraternal contributions, are clearly worthy to feel the generosity of all. Farewell. July 23, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
