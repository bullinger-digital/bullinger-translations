      <p>Greetings. Due to fever, I was not free to write as much and as extensively as Utenhovius desired. However, I exerted myself beyond my strength so that good men might know that I willingly comply with their wishes and do not neglect the welfare of Poland. As for you, most honorable man and revered brother, to whom more leisure was given, I do not doubt that you have done what was necessary: for I could not persuade the messenger to grant me a single free day. Regarding my illness, I have nothing to write except that, although it treats me a little more gently than at the beginning, it has not yet abated to the point where it does not weaken my strength and even make my spirit languish. Indeed, I am forbidden to leave my room and am compelled to refrain from almost all parts of my duty. To these troubles, the duration is also added, because the hope of relief is very slight unless winter is over. I know the attacks of the Westphalians will dissipate themselves: because I see the foolish man considers it no small glory if I engage with him, I have decided to disdain him and now seem to have refuted his absurdities more than enough. Perhaps another will be found who will agitate him as he deserves.</p>
      <p>Our Philippus, tiring himself with vain complaints, does not seek a remedy, nor does he even admit it: perhaps because no one extends a hand, which has always been the reason for me to seek a conversation, from which, while you are averse, the door is closed. Nor do I care that those who are on the adverse side feel less rightly, because their teachers would be swayed, unless I am mistaken, and would come closer to us, whose authority holds them back. Indeed, I do not doubt that they are hindered by fear from expressing their opinion more freely: just as Jacob Andreas, responding to Staphylus, servilely gratifies his Brentius and others. You are not unaware of the danger we are now in.</p>
      <p>For with peace concluded between the two kings: while they rest at home, the Duke of Savoy, aided by both, will turn his arms against us for his own advantage. He will be carried by implacable hatred against this city, from which he was expelled from his dominion. Therefore, if ever, now we especially need the prayers of the saints, which may commend us to the protection of God. Farewell, most excellent man and brother to be respected by me.</p>
      <p>My colleagues and friends greet you.</p>
      <p>In my name, I also wish greetings to be conveyed to all your fellow ministers, your wife, and the rest.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect, guide, and bless you all. Geneva, November 19, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>Please excuse me to Mr. Peter Martyr for not receiving any letters from me now, as I am nearly broken by fatigue. To the distinguished minister of Christ and faithful pastor of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, brother and fellow minister to be respected by me.</p>
