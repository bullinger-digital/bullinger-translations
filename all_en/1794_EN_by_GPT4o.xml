      <p>S.P.D. I recently received the booklets you sent as a gift, most esteemed man, in good faith and read them immediately with great delight, for which I must confess that I owe much to your piety, as I am daily enriched with new gifts. However, I wish that an opportunity may arise for me to demonstrate a spirit not at all alien to gratitude, not only to you but also to other good men.</p>
      <p>I have long been anxious about your health, but I am very glad and congratulate you and all of us that, by God's grace, you have somewhat recovered, especially at this time when the Church of Christ is daily attacked by new enemies and there are few who resist their cruel attempts with the fortitude of spirit they should. Regarding the letters entrusted to Oporinus' servant at the last fair, there is no need for you to worry. Although Simon unexpectedly passed away before the transaction was completed, Oporinus, who is very fond of you, says he has taken care of everything properly. He entrusted your letters to be delivered in England at Frankfurt and in France to Jacques du Puy, a bookseller in Paris. We have no certain news of new events yet; we have heard in recent days that the small town of Rimelsperg, located on the borders of Lorraine, was invaded and plundered by soldiers of the King of France, whose names I do not know, because of the supplies they have sent to the Emperor so far, and we are waiting to see what else our scouts will bring. Farewell, most illustrious man, and take care of your health. Hastily, in Basel, 15 days before the calends of February in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Conrad Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>The soldiers who were stationed at Metz are passing through here in great numbers, very laboriously, dressed in old coats, stoles, and women's furs, which they have robbed and stolen, to protect themselves from the cold. Some of them were struck down not far above Basel by the peasants with flails, after they had stolen a side of bacon from them at Muttenz, etc.</p>
      <p>To the man of remarkable piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich and incomparable friend.</p>
      <p>To Zürich.</p>
