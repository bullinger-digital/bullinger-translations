      <p>Greetings. The letter you wrote on November 28, dearest godfather in the Lord, I received on the first of this month. I am occupied with writing to the people of Augsburg and assisting the faithful of that church, who are now miserably in danger, to the best of my ability.</p>
      <p>A catechism infected with papal impurities has been imposed on them. Good men have sent this to me, beseeching me through Christ to respond to it. I could not neglect their so necessary and Christian requests; therefore, I wrote and addressed many parts of it in a piecemeal fashion. I am sending you both copies, but on the condition that you not only read the adulterated doctrines but also refute them yourself.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you wrote about the captured princes of England, I do not quite understand whether it is to the detriment of the cause of Christ or otherwise; therefore, I ask you to write more clearly about this matter when it is convenient. I fear the plots and schemes of Charles, lest they bring any poison to the struggling and not yet sufficiently established kingdom. Farewell excellently. Yesterday I received news that the Emperor is in Trento, so that by the authority of his presence he may drive the mass of Satan to where it is destined. Bern, December 12, 1551.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musc[ulus], your godfather in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest godfather in Christ.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
