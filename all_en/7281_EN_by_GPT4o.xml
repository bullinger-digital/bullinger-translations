      <p>Greetings. At this hour, I receive your letters sent through the steward from Königsfelden; however, since I have not yet used those things that were enclosed, I will return them at another time. Currently, I have no certain news from France, except for an uncertain rumor that Paris has been captured by the forces of Condé; but I do not yet give any credence to these reports. We await daily to see what will be brought forth.</p>
      <p>A messenger was sent these days to your senate; but I did not write through him, because I was in Münsingen with Mr. Steiger, who sends you his warmest greetings and expresses his utmost gratitude for your pious consolation and exhortation. He is still recovering little by little, and still suffers continuous pain; we fear that he is not being treated properly. The fracture of his shin was such that the broken bones not only pierced through the flesh and skin but also tore his leggings; you can imagine yourself the pain he has endured from this, and they have not yet ceased. Meanwhile, he is very patient and acknowledges the hand of God.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Savoy has forbidden all his subjects, under the penalty of 100 crowns, from transporting wheat from his lands elsewhere or selling it to foreigners, except to the subjects (whom he exempts) of the Bernese lords. This is intolerable to the people of Geneva and seems to be the beginning of a new war. They have sent an envoy here; our people are writing to the prince; what he will do or respond, we do not yet know. The people of Lucerne refused to act as arbitrators; I hear that the people of Zug will provide one for them. When this meeting will take place, I do not know; it is happening at a very inopportune time, and I cannot hope for anything good while these disturbances in France continue. It has been deliberated here these days whether to recall our people from the king, and also whether to allow the Confederates to pass; the sea is rough: the situation is dangerous in France; our people are steadfast and the majority are returning home (for many have returned); if we were to recall the others now, when the king is at his highest point, it might not bring much except future great displeasure with the king; moreover, they themselves know well what they have to deal with; we should punish them all the more when they return home. For the same reason, we cannot deny the Confederates passage; but we should otherwise consult with other places on what to do about the matter. I think that is why a letter was sent to Zurich. Letters are also being sent to all other evangelical places.</p>
      <p>Muralt, who brings this to you, has not yet been able to find any favor with his father-in-law; nor could he obtain from your senate, which opposed him, that a place to stay here be granted to him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he is setting out for Zurich with his wife, although most of the senators favor him more in this matter than his father-in-law. He asks me to ensure that you intercede with his mother on his behalf, for although he now has a wife with a dowry, it will be that he will eventually receive an equal part of the inheritance with the remaining brothers and sisters. For since his father-in-law did not take it from him according to the laws, as he could have done, he cannot now exclude him from a rightful portion of the inheritance. I have gladly written this for him; for I have always loved him for his candid nature, and he was certainly dear to everyone here and did not harm anyone except now the parents and relatives of his wife, because he married her without consulting them.</p>
      <p>All of ours send you greetings. Greet yours also in my name.</p>
      <p>In Bern, October 28, at nightfall.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
