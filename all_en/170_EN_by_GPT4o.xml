      <p>S. D. Dr. Augustinus praised your humanity in a wonderful manner and requested that I also express my greatest thanks to you for your kindness.</p>
      <p>Dr. Panthaleon delivered your letters to me, and I wish I could have provided him with what he deserved, as you recommended him to me. Certainly, I did not lack the will, but the means.</p>
      <p>For those recent matters, I thank you; it is only fair that I also share my recent news in return. They are certainly extensive; therefore, the bearer of this letter, a good man, will be a living letter.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand is gathering an army against the people of Siebenb√ºrgen. The Emperor is enlisting German soldiers for 12 regiments. The cities have prepared a pious response to be given to the Emperor regarding the impious Interim. Unjust demands are made by the people of Constance, especially that they restore the bishop with his followers - the bishop passed away on June 14th after being struck by paralysis; that they accept the prefect appointed by the Emperor into the city as in Regensburg, to whom they would pay 500 guilders annually, etc. But I understand they will not accept these conditions; however, they have not yet been presented to the people.</p>
      <p>The Emperor simply demanded from the people of Lindau that they accept the Interim and celebrate masses and pay 4 guilders out of 100 guilders. Dr. M. Heinrich will explain what a friend from England has written. I can say more. I fear it is not true, what many have reported as true: that the Scots, along with the Germans allied with the French, were defeated by the English and that New Boulogne was occupied. If you receive any certain news, please inform me.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell. Share this with Dr. Gast, whom you will greet as a friend. Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 25, 1548. I wrote in great haste. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I judge that Michael to be an impostor, especially from the Interim, which he is said to have primarily composed; otherwise, I have not yet read his speeches, nor do I know when I will read them. The words of wicked men are poison, and when he speaks well, the good is still suspect because of the evil.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Oswald Myconius, colleague and dearest brother. Basel.</p>
