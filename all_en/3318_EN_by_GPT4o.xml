      <p>Greetings. These are the second letters I am writing to you today, but these will reach you before the previous ones. Gribaldo today humbly requested the council not to send him back to Tübingen, stating he is ready to accept and do whatever he is ordered. Therefore, he has been sent back to us again.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow we will deal with him.</p>
      <p>If he renounces his errors and subscribes to our confession, as well as to those ancient creeds of Nicaea and Athanasius, the sentence passed on him might be mitigated. I will inform you of whatever is decided.</p>
      <p>You will learn from Budaeus what he brings.</p>
      <p>Our council is writing to yours about this matter. I do not doubt that France will eventually pay the penalty for the great bloodshed of the pious and the relentless fury against them. May the Lord protect us, so that we do not become participants in this crime and its punishment as well. Amen.</p>
      <p>Our people send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 17th of September, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed and beloved lord and compatriot. In Zürich.</p>
