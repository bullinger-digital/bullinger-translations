    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over Bullinger's safe return from the spa treatment. Reports on Bullinger's request about his activities in Basel: He is giving lectures at the university to a very diverse audience on Deuteronomy, where the Hebrew pronunciation still poses some difficulties for him, preaches every third week, and, at the behest of Myconius, instructs the clergy on the dialectics and rhetoric of Aristotle, supplemented by practical exercises for the participants; among them is Markus Bertschi. Karlstadt hopes for good results. He attends the lectures of Simon Grynaeus and Alban Thorer. Grynaeus will be loaned to Württemberg for a short time. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace from God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>I congratulate you on your safe return from the spa and wish for you all to always lead a healthy and blessed life.</p>
      <p>Since you inquire about the nature and course of my studies, I comply: I both read and interpret Hebrew, specifically the Deuteronomy of Moses. As for the quality of the interpretation, let others decide. Regarding pronunciation, I must confess that I am not yet sufficiently skilled. Nor do I complain that the opinions of the rabbis on pronunciation are not at hand. For who could, when they so often diametrically disagree, that is, contradict each other? But I wish my tongue were quicker and more prepared. Otherwise, I have a sufficiently quiet audience, but remarkably diverse, and it cannot be helped that I neglect some while trying to assist others. I have taken on the role of the absent Myconius to the best of my ability, who now, praise be to God, has returned safely. Henceforth, I will conduct my lectures on Deuteronomy every other week, having completed up to chapter 5 so far. Every third week, I must preach, etc. Out of order, at the behest of my Myconius and at the request of some preachers, I have begun to explain the dialectics of Trapezuntius, omitting the Aristotelian ones, as time permits, mixing in such things as those Aristotle wrote about the one and the many, the composite and the simple proposition. We have finished the treatise on enunciation. Now each of the listeners brings examples from the Bible. For I have explained everything with such examples. Dr. Markus presented a beautiful, composed prologue, but only one. Then each brought forth one thing either from the material they preach or from elsewhere. Now we strive to render the use of the predicables and categories to a far better fruit than the scholastics, unless we deceive ourselves. From this, you can easily gather how closely we are united among ourselves, and you can see almost the tasks I have undertaken. But I also listen to others. Indeed, I am a listener of Grynaeus in the book Pen Hermenias. I listen to Dr. Alban, who interprets Dioscorides in Greek. You now have, I believe, to your annoyance, what I am doing.</p>
      <p>Grynaeus, having been called, will be accommodated, so to speak, to the Prince of Württemberg for a not so long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily. Greet your wife, mother, my lords Heinrich</p>
      <p>Uttinger, Theodor my teacher, Leo, Pellican, Nüsseler, and Heinrich Gold.</p>
      <p>Basel, the 15th of September, year 34.</p>
      <p>Your Karlstadt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished and most learned man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his superior.</p>
