      <p>S. I received, my most reverend lord and godfather, your letter along with those new and very sad news from the Netherlands; may the Lord grant that we soon receive better news. A similar rumor has reached our papists in Glarus, as the one that the man from Chur spread; many rejoice greatly and boast that their affairs have remained safe. However, others doubt the truth of what is being spread, as they have not yet received it from anyone to whom they can safely give credence. May the most good and great God cause all adversaries to be confounded in their vain hope and perverse joy.</p>
      <p>We rejoice that affairs in France are going well; may God deign to preserve them perpetually along with all the kingdoms and churches that have submitted themselves to the word of Christ. I also give you immense thanks for the booklet by Mr. Haller, which he has indeed elegantly condensed from that immense sea of canon law into a brief compendium. May God bless his labors more and more. He recently wrote to me from Bern, in which writing he affirms that at this time he has nothing else than what has been published everywhere, and among other things (which pains me greatly) he writes that he is so afflicted by gout that he is almost deprived of the use of his hands as well as his feet. I ask you, my lord and godfather, that as soon as certain news about the affairs of Lower Germany reaches you in Zurich, you would inform me, so that if it is good, we may continue to give thanks to God, or if it is less favorable, we may persist in constant prayers to Him, that He may deign to protect His own from the tyranny of enemies and all adversities. As for our affairs, they remain in that mediocrity in which they have been until now; we hope for better things daily. Consider this favorably.</p>
      <p>My wife and my entire household send their greetings to you and all yours. Our bailiff Schuler, Thomas Schmid the treasurer, Elmer the scribe, and our lord Avienus, to whom alone I have shown these new things, also wish you well. Hastily from Glarus, August 27, 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Johannes Hugo of Glarus. To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the church of the city of Zurich, my dearest lord and godfather, to be honored with the highest respect.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
