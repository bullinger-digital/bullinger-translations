      <p>Greetings. The illustrious Lord Margrave Count of Vicosoprano from Naples, who offers this to you, my most esteemed Friedrich, resides in Geneva and is recommended to me with the highest regard by many good men. I have also known him for several years now; he is pious and endowed with many gifts; he is worthy of being supported by good men. Therefore, I commend him to both your father-in-law, the most distinguished Mr. Johann Travers, and to you.</p>
      <p>He wishes to be received into the society of the Rhaetians, so that he might enjoy the privilege granted to the Rhaetians by the Lords of Venice with you as an intermediary. Therefore, my friend and brother, ensure that my recommendation proves useful to him.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write; therefore, I wish you and yours the best of health. Johann and Hector are safe and sound; they send their greetings to you all.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 18, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Friedrich von Salis, Rhaetian residing in Samaden in the Engadin, his esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
