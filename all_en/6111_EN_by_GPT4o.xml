      <p>Our recent martyr's brother-in-law will explain to you the state of our Admiral and what the face of France is like: although today there is no man who can explain this well enough. For as many as there are not only cities but also villages and fortresses and houses, there are almost as many different appearances. For Satan cannot be dislodged from his stronghold without significant tumult, and in those regions, as the governors or lords of the places lean to this or that side, the churches must also experience different conditions, since the state of France is now composed partly of anarchy, partly of gynocracy. May the Lord grant us to rest peacefully in the bosom of His providence and to await each event. The king is now expected to be not far from Bar, beyond which town he is not thought to progress. From there he is to come through Burgundy to Lyon around the end of May. The Queen of Navarre is also expected to come there, whose presence I trust will be most advantageous for us. They also say that the Duke of Savoy will be there with his wife, whose son, now entering about his third year, the king is to present for baptism. Nor do I doubt that he will gladly seize this opportunity to terrify our neighbors. But the Lord, in whom we hope, will prevail.</p>
      <p>We have heard that strange and truly monstrous things are being spread everywhere by his envoys, which I hope will vanish of their own accord. As for the health of our Calvin, you have recently received his letters, which I greatly fear may be his last. For the torment of the stone increases more and more, combined with other various and contrary pains. His little body is so thoroughly exhausted that it is incapable of any remedy. From this, you can well understand, my father, the sorrow we all feel here, especially since we seem unable to receive a more grievous wound than if, in the midst of a storm, and that a very severe one, this little ship is forced to drift without such a great and worthy helmsman. Nor do we doubt that you there are also partakers of this sorrow, due to our mutual love and your private benevolence towards him. May the Lord therefore be with us, and if He has now decided to call His faithful servant to Himself, may He not abandon us, but rather refresh and comfort us, until we too, having completed our course, are gathered into that eternal rest. Moreover, this same man who delivered these letters to you, when he said he was going there for this reason, since the Italian church has no pastor there and does not seem likely to have one, to bring his sister back here, asked Mr. Calvin and me to write something to you about it, since he fears that it may not be easily obtained from the guardians of our martyr's little daughter. We only ask of you, at his request, that after considering the matter and what can be done without harm to the ward, you allow what seems fair to be obtained from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, with all the fellow ministers, whose prayers we again desire to commend this church more fervently than ever before. May the Lord Jesus in turn keep you and bless your holy labors more and more! Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Geneva, April 15.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered father, the truly faithful pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
