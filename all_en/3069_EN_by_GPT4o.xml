      <p>Greetings. I have read your sermons on the Apocalypse, dearest brother in the Lord. There is no need for you to expect anything from me in terms of annotations on them. I see that you have approached them thoroughly prepared and equipped; if I had any desires, I would have already mentioned them. I had a writing from a certain brother from Savoy about the number of years of the beast, which I believe you received from Lord Haller, on which I await your judgment. I pray to the Lord that your neighbors, as you write, may finally understand and turn away from the beast, which they think they must defend above all others.</p>
      <p>As for what you mention about Philip, I wish it were firm. The same was written to me today by Mr. Blaurer, but I believe it was received from some of your citizens. I ask you to share if you receive any certain news. Whatever the case, he is entirely ours, which I was convinced of fifteen years ago.</p>
      <p>Further, my request to you is to let me know how things stand with you regarding the woodcraft that Mr. Conrad Zwick is supposed to bring to light. Our lords have not wanted to take up the matter, which I deeply regret. The wood costs me annually up to 10 crowns, which is a considerable hole in my salary. I was very pleased; however, it seems to me that we must lack this convenience here. If it were summer, I would have to go out to Mr. Zwick himself regarding this matter. If he comes to your city, please convey my greetings to him and inform him of this; I trust him enough due to old friendship that he will also consider me, which is why I want to ask him.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, dearest brother, together with your entire household, brothers, and friends, Mr. Bibliander, Bernardino, Peter Martyr, Gualter, and others. All of mine greet you and yours, especially your little Heinrich. May the Lord grant that you begin, continue, and end this new year with happy auspices.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 31, 1556.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your brother.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
