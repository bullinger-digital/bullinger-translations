      <p>Greetings. I received two letters, dearest brother, and have not responded until now because I have nothing to write. We are expecting Froschauer, whom we hope will arrive within eight days.</p>
      <p>The brothers from Geneva write that the Guise family, the most hostile enemies of Christ, reign in France, and therefore persecution is increasing. But I know that Christ is powerful and can unexpectedly come to the aid of His own.</p>
      <p>They say the king was anointed on September 17.</p>
      <p>It is indeed strange what is happening in Rome; but Christ reigns everywhere.</p>
      <p>Be vigilant, lest Quadri corrupts the hearts of many with gold and gains some step towards his impiety, and you are doing very well to oppose him with all your strength. The grape harvest also makes me briefer.</p>
      <p>I am returning the Italian letters.</p>
      <p>I received letters from the most distinguished man, the ambassador; you will excuse me to him for not responding; I will defer to another time when I receive letters from Frankfurt; for if I receive anything worthy of him, I will share it. You will greet him most dutifully, and you will greet the consuls, Philipp, Pontisella, and all our friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you and your household.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 22, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, his esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
