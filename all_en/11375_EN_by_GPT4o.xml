    <p xml:id="regest1">The university demands that he obtain a doctoral degree, even though he has been a duly appointed teacher for years, and threatens him with dismissal, with certain opponents already waiting to succeed him. He himself would prefer to leave Basel and accept the damage as well as the alienation of his wife [Katharina Lompart] from her homeland, although it is uncertain who would take him in. He finds it unacceptable that the new law requires all professors to accept [academic] titles and that all theologians - even outside their academic duties - are obligated to the university; if he were to give in, it would cast a bad light on him and make his relationship with [Karlstadt] hardly more bearable, while on the other hand, his departure could strengthen the freedom of the church in the long term; giving in, however, would increase the pressure on his colleagues and violate his conscience. The people of Strasbourg can testify that he would have accepted a title and supported the increased training of pastors if the rights of the church had been preserved, but now a different decision has been made; with his departure, he would indeed leave the field to his opponents, but he has hardly any influence left anyway. Since the opinion of the neighboring churches is important to him, this inquiry also goes to the pastors of Bern and Strasbourg; he hopes for their help so that he can be spared the decision between submission and departure, or at least for their advice, and asks them to address their response collectively to the theologians of Basel. His letter is to remain confidential.</p>

      <p>The university demands that I become a doctor, which is precisely what I have been for so many years by public authority and legitimate church appointment, and to which I have been reluctantly drawn by them. However, this demand is not only unjust in that respect, but more so because, unless I comply, I will be excluded from all positions and professions here.</p>
      <p>And I am well aware that those who most insist that I become a doctor, most desire that I do not, not so much to expel me from here, but so that they themselves may gain control. I know this and I am not deceived in my mind. There is nothing left but for them to occupy the position here once I am removed.</p>
      <p>I am uncertain about the matter, what I should do, but not about myself. For a long time, the situation, the state of the school, and the ingratitude of people have urged me to leave. And although I make a considerable sacrifice and take my wife [Katharina Lompart] away from her homeland, everything is prepared for this, and I have her, by God's grace, most obedient. Therefore, there is no delay on my part. Where I will be accepted after leaving here, I commit to the Lord Christ and to you, my friends. And this indeed is my opinion about myself and my affairs.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter itself: it is very complicated. I am convinced in my heart that this matter could have been resolved more gently without any harm to the ministry and Christian freedom. However, I think that what has been established by law is not right in either case. Therefore, it is very distressing to confirm this law by my example and first, from which my mind recoils as from something wicked. I consider it unworthy to impose these titles on all professors by necessity of law with this new church reformation. I also judge it equally unjust to bind ministers, outside the time they spend dealing with and learning letters, to the laws and exercises of the school as far as they are ministers. And what will happen if there is no one who, with their freedom, finally resists bad laws as they arise? If I have fought until now, if I now yield, I will seem to do what I do not by reason and counsel, but by necessity - that is, by the slight advantage of my affairs. Now, if I concede to these laws and allow a full triumph to my adversaries, I do not see how I will bear this colleague, who can bear no one now because of his intemperance of mind. Therefore, if I cannot be useful here and am forced to leave unwillingly at some point, it will be more useful, I think, to leave when it is most honorable and has a useful and laudable example and will greatly benefit the freedom of the church for posterity. Certainly, if I concede to these laws now, I not only draw all those who have professed here without a title until now into the same necessity with me, but also all those who will follow us.</p>
      <p>Add to this that I submit myself to these laws against my conscience. I have the brothers of Strasbourg as witnesses that I promised in their presence not to avoid this title, but to be ready to assume and acknowledge it immediately in their sight as a gift of God, if the freedom of the church were not endangered by my action. They are also witnesses to me that I wanted to bring the brothers into order and fit them for the use of the church with all suitable exercises, provided that this right of the church, which it is, was believed, not of the school, which it is not.</p>
      <p>Neither matter had a place or was pleasing, but it was done by the art of a few men that this crowd prevailed. And indeed, in this part, these are the things that the people of Strasbourg know as well as I do. On the contrary, there is the fact that by leaving this place at a most inopportune time, I leave it to those to whom I have spoken, and also stir up a crowd and rumor, which is the greatest inconvenience in this part. But when I consider what I can achieve here with my authority at this time; I fear that if I stay, I will achieve very little. My favor with the senate has fallen, and all my credibility has been greatly weakened by the slanders of the wicked.</p>
      <p>These are the things that move me here. It also moves me that I must consider what the judgment of the neighboring churches about my action will be. Therefore, I write to the Bernese and the people of Strasbourg with the same example of letters. For I do not want anyone to think that I am so bold as to want to follow my own inclination and despise the authority of all. I have always judged these laws to be unfair. Whatever is privately decided about me, I wanted to follow the authority of the good. But at the same time, it is necessary to concede both about my right and about the right of the church, of which the former is by no means difficult, about one's own right, the latter is plainly intolerable, to detract anything from the right of the church. In this so uncertain deliberation, the first thing is, if it can be done with your help, that it is not necessary either to concede to these laws or to leave here, that it be done through you, the next that, if it is necessary to do one or the other, you, if I submit to these laws, will consult for me, who will sin gravely both against myself and against the church, if I leave, perhaps neglecting some utility, according to your wisdom and faith, which is most holy towards Christ and his church, before God that you consult for yourselves.</p>
      <p>Whatever response the good and faithful spirit of Christ suggests to you, I pray that it be written not only to me but also to our brothers in common by you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, most esteemed and dearest fathers and brothers to me before God. Pray to the Lord that he may deliver me from evil, lest I do anything unworthy of his holy name. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>You will keep the letters, lest my complaints to you come to our people.</p>
      <p>To the ministers of the word in Zurich, to the esteemed brothers.</p>
