    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's report, will gladly show gratitude when the opportunity arises; currently has no news about the Emperor [Charles V] or the war against the Turks, but will forward such news immediately; hopes that God will guide the war between the Emperor and [King Francis I] in such a way that the Kingdom of God can still enter further places in the Confederation. Best wishes, Bullinger should pray for them; the plague is increasing, three days ago the wife of his brother [Thomas Blarer] was buried, who died after only four days of illness; the mourning brother recommends himself and his friends to Bullinger's intercession. Regret the death of [Werner] Steiner, yet he is to be happily praised; greetings. [Johannes] Zwick reports that in Bischofszell this week already 36 people have died of the plague; may God let us exchange this life for life in Christ through death.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Indeed, my venerable Bullinger, I owe you much greater thanks for your willingness to write so much by your own hand for our sake. We will do the same for you when the occasion provides us with a subject. Now, as you love me, I have not a single word about the Emperor or the Turkish war beyond what I recently wrote to you; I am expecting letters at any moment. If they bring me any news, I will take the utmost care to inform you of everything as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I very much hope that the Lord will temper this war between the Emperor and the French King in such a way that it will provide an opportunity to spread the Kingdom of Christ even among other Swiss cantons, as He often brings forth the best from the worst.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest soul, with all your loved ones, whom you will beautifully bid farewell in the Lord with my words. Pray for us, that the Lord, having mercy on us, may command the angel of destruction not to devastate everything in this manner. The plague is still worsening among us; four days ago, we buried my dearest sister-in-law, who succumbed to a hidden poison unknown even to the doctors after only four days, causing my dearest and truly brotherly brother much grief, who also bids you to ascribe his safety to you and earnestly asks you to remember him in a Christian manner before Christ. We deeply mourn the loss of the excellent Steiner from you; yet, as we ought, we heartily congratulate him on his fate. Commend us to the best men Pellican, Gwalther, Bibliander, Megander, Fabricius, etc., and especially to the consul RÃ¶sti, etc.</p>
      <p>Our Zwick has not yet returned, but he writes that this week in Bischofszell, 36 people have died of the plague, and yet the hand of the Lord is still extended. May He grant that we may happily exchange this life for the life we have in Christ through death. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, October 5, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
