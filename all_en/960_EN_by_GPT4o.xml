      <p>You can hardly believe how grateful I was for your last letter, which explained the cause of the dispute between you and the people of Schwyz.</p>
      <p>Old hatred stirs, and the present times urge them to act in a way that is not fitting.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there must be something underlying that not everyone perceives. In short: between God and Belial, there can be no true harmony, no matter what is pretended. May God be with us. I commend to you these two noble young men, Prussians, learned. They have been with Dr. Philipp for a long time; they come here to explore the regions and see learned men.</p>
      <p>They followed the Emperor to Speyer, then went to Strasbourg, where by chance they found Dryander hiding there because of his books, Plutarch, Livy, and the Spanish-Latin Lexicon; for some years ago they knew each other in Wittenberg. Dryander also recommended them to me and asked that I provide them access to you as well; he would have written himself, had not those typographical matters hindered him.</p>
      <p>You will therefore have them most highly recommended either because of Dryander or because of the communion of religion.</p>
      <p>Besides this, I ask you to write, when you are most at leisure, where your gout has gone; for I hear nothing more about it. Indeed, I have not gone out again for eight whole days and still walk with difficulty; only my feet hurt.</p>
      <p>I do not know what it is, unless this new old age brings something new every day. Someone told me about the Five Cantons, that they secretly sent to the Emperor, urging him to exert all his strength in restoring the Mass; for they leave nothing undone here. And although I do not believe it, I could not remain silent with you. Farewell in the Lord with all your good family and brothers. I do not know what evil I hear about Theodor. Basel, July 5, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the people of ZÃ¼rich, in his Lord.</p>
