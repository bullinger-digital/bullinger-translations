      <p>Theodericus Bitter to his lord Heinrich Bullinger, grace and peace from the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>I am grateful, my most distinguished lord Heinrich, for the rites of the Zürich church recently sent, and certainly the care and arrangement of each is very commendable, and I wish I could send a similar booklet from our people in Cologne. However, since that is not possible, I am sending you instead some tables organized by our people, from which you will be able to discern the efforts and endeavors of our people more clearly than the sun, and you may, when the opportunity arises, resist and counter these with appropriate measures in time and place.</p>
      <p>In my humble opinion, it will soon be necessary for one side to yield; for on both sides, these differences and seditions in the Christian republic and religion have been lamentably debated and discussed for more than forty years now, so that the truth of the Catholic Church can hardly be suppressed any longer. And oh, if only the course of this present life would not be denied to us until all who are called Christians truly with one voice and spirit, without any schisms of our faith or ceremonies, implore God, our Father, who is in heaven, the only and true giver of peace, and serve Him. Among us, the warlike tumults are now silent everywhere.</p>
      <p>The illustrious lady of Lupfen, whose letters, as she reported, you will also see shortly, is still in good health, as am I with my wife and six children, and I wish in return that you would inform me of similar matters and write back, if the tables of this kind by Wilhelm Lindanus are not entirely unwelcome to you or to be rejected rather than read. If you indicate the former, I will send the larger work of the same at the first opportunity, from which these were transcribed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, may you fare well in Christ Jesus, and greet your brother Lord Johannes, if he still survives in this calamitous age. Given in Cologne in the year of our Lord, etc. 60, on the very feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. To the most distinguished and truly pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful and foremost ecclesiastic of the most ample church of Zürich.</p>
