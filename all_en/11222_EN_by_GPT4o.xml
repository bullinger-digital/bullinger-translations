      <p>My willing service beforehand.</p>
      <p>Gracious, dear sir, although I believed, based on my previous declining response, when I was asked by Count Georg of Württemberg, my gracious lord, to enter his service, that I would not be asked again for many reasons that were presented at that time, since I am now informed that his princely grace is inclined to seek me again out of special gracious will, I will, for his princely grace's humble satisfaction and for your love and honor, continue negotiations without hesitation at the appointed time. I did not want to withhold this response to your letter from you.</p>
      <p>Herewith commending to God.</p>
      <p>Given at Hallwil, the 18th of September in the year 1538.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hartmann von Hallwil.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, prudent, and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my beloved lord.</p>
