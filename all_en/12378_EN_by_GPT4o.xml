    <p xml:id="regest1">Even though Claudius knows that the people of Zurich receive news daily, especially about the [Regensburg] Imperial Diet, Bullinger will likely be interested in written news from the councilors of Ulm and Augsburg. In the enclosure [not received], Claudius has recorded the reliable news. Bullinger should also share what he has heard about the Imperial Diet.</p>

      <p>Even though I know that many new things are brought to you daily, especially at the Imperial Diet, I did not hesitate to write to you as well, with news partly from the councilors of Ulm and partly from those of Augsburg. There is no doubt that these are certain, and you will find them enclosed in the notes. I hope that from your kindness, I will be informed about what has been done or will be done at the Imperial Diet (regarding those matters that need to be mentioned). I have nothing more to write at this time. Take it in good part. Saturday after Epiphany 1546.</p>
      <p>Mathias Claudius, devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the venerable lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his uniquely esteemed patron. Zurich.</p>
