      <p>Greetings. I have nothing at present to write to you, dearest compater, except that yesterday Mrs. Musculus gave birth to a beautiful son, whom today Felix Tobler and I lifted from the sacred font in your name, along with Elizabeth, the daughter of Mr. Johannes Textor. I have paid the gold coin for you as you instructed. The mother and child are well, as is the whole family, except that on the 18th of this month, Abraham, the son of Musculus, broke his leg in a serious accident, causing considerable pain to his parents and all of us; but he is being well cared for and is beginning to recover somewhat.</p>
      <p>However, since you will learn more about this from his own letters, it is unnecessary for me to go into further detail. The child has been named Johannes Heinrich, as you had arranged. I await your response to my last letter, which I hope brought you considerable joy. God willing, I will come to you soon. In the meantime, farewell, and from me and my wife, I bid you and your whole family good health.</p>
      <p>Bern, 22nd September 1549.</p>
      <p>Eberhard and our [Greek] send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord and compater, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
