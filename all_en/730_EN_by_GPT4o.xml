      <p>Most excellent Bullinger. Your incredible love and singular kindness towards me have been well known to me for a long time from many and certain proofs; for I have known no one more obliging than you, who never omit anything, however laborious and difficult it may be, in which you understand that you can gratify even a stranger, and in this matter you have very well imitated the nature of the heavenly Father, who makes it rain on the just and the unjust and makes his sun rise on the good and the bad. This Christian kindness and modesty, by which you lower yourself below all, so that by serving all you may gain all, greatly illuminates your ministry; for you would wish to act the part of each person, provided that you could form Christ in the hearts of men through his Spirit. These are the ones who are rightly called fishers of men. May God grant that you live long, so that you may bring more children to him through the gospel.</p>
      <p>As for me, you could have learned what I am doing from these letters, which I sent to you twice after my return to Italy. In short: those commendatory letters brought me more trouble than benefit; therefore, I greatly desired procuratorial ones. However, the Lord did not wish to test my faith. If there is any hope left that they may be obtained there or elsewhere, make sure that I clearly feel you are the same towards me as you have shown yourself to be before; for know that I am in great troubles and dangers of life, and there is no place for me in Italy where I can be safe with my wife and child, and my fear for myself increases daily. For the impious will never rest until they have swallowed me alive, although the Lord often whispers to me in the innermost parts of my heart, telling me to be of good cheer, affirming that he will not forsake me. You, however, with your church, will diligently pray to him that it may be so and that all things may turn to his glory and my salvation. If I write nothing new to you, it is because of my hiding places, where I lead a most miserable life. Farewell in the Lord and greet the other brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>Given from the fields of Brescia on the day before the calends of November 1549. If you write back to me, which I ask again and again, send the letters to Clavenna to Francesco Negro.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, B. Alt.</p>
      <p>To the most upright and learned minister of Christ in the church of Zürich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord. Zürich. Let the letters be sent to Basel as soon as possible.</p>
