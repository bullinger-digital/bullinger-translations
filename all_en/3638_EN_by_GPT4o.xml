      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, we have long been taught by many arguments that the cause of the Christian church is no less a concern to you than your own salvation. Therefore, we did not hesitate to entrust to you the protection and advocacy of our churches, whose condition is somewhat afflicted. Now, you must imagine, not us, but the church itself stretching out its supplicant hands to you and beseeching you by Him, whom it worships with you alone, our Lord Jesus Christ, the prince of shepherds, not to consider and judge its cause as foreign and irrelevant to you, but as common and connected with the salvation of the whole country. For just as the Christian churches are not separated from each other by the distances of places, so they are not separated by the desires of their souls. And if those who are governed by the same laws under the same prince form and constitute one and the same body of the republic, why should we, who have been baptized into one body by one Spirit, whose citizenship is in heaven, be in a worse place and condition? Why should we not, if necessity demanded, extend helping hands to each other? Now indeed, the condition and form of our churches is such that it is to be feared, unless some of them are promptly assisted, that they may suffer some notable detriment due to the singular lack of ministers. For day by day, we are more and more aware that the restless satellites of the Antichrist are diligently and studiously striving to restore the torn and scattered body of their churches in our Confederation to its entirety. And indeed, what seemed to drag along as barely half-alive members before, now experiences the healing hands of their own and would like to raise its otherwise sick and humbled head, if not for the singular providence of God that has hitherto opposed it. Therefore, we must strive not to be found to have served Christ, our Savior, less than the adversaries have served the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Reverend Father in Christ, we earnestly ask you, indeed, what is more, we beseech you by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, that since the church of Davos, which is the principal head of the Third Confederation, is without a minister, you would take care of this matter, and not deny us the pious service you have hitherto provided to other churches. The condition of the church of Davos is such that it needs a man of some wisdom, not a novice, and, which is the main point of the petition, who is of upright and proven morals and is not at all subject to the detestable vice of drunkenness. But it is difficult, someone might say, to be torn from one's native soil with wife and children and to strive through the difficult path of the impassable Alps. Indeed, that is true; but that evasion, which is too often on the lips of some today, will not excuse us when we come to the tribunal of Christ. Private advantage must rightly be postponed to the utility of the church, nor are we so fixed or attached to one place that, if we are called elsewhere, we should not resist the calling of God.</p>
      <p>Nor is there a need to seek far examples of those who (although they have deserved well of the church) were sent and not unwillingly, because the utility of the church demanded it, they obeyed not without singular loss of their family affairs. It will be your task, Reverend Father, to ensure that it appears that the consideration of the churches has always been more important to you than that of individuals, lest those who have once undertaken this risk seem to have been ejected rather than sent, lest what was a work of piety in you incurs the suspicion of private affection.</p>
      <p>The people of Davos promise a stipend of one hundred and thirty florins annually; hitherto they have spent only one hundred florins annually. Make an effort, Reverend Father in Christ, that we may understand that our prayers have had some weight with you, as is your piety. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, July 4, 1558. Do not hesitate to convey our many greetings to all the fellow ministers and brothers of your church. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Philippus Gallicius, Johannes Fabricius, most devoted to your kindness. Philippus Gallicius, entirely devoted to your integrity, beseeches you the same; for in the same manner as written here, the aforementioned church has beseeched us.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful overseer of the church of Zurich, our lord and most esteemed patron. To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
