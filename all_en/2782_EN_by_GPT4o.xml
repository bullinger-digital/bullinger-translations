      <p>Most illustrious man, I write far less often than I would like; but this is due to the scarcity of messengers. I write now because a messenger from Schaffhausen has presented himself. I am in good health, by the grace of God, and I work in my usual manner. I have translated Brentius's book against the Asotus, and it is almost printed. If only you understood Italian; for I have added not a few things, but with the author's consent. I will depart from here next week, as I hope, to be partly in Stuttgart, partly in a certain town called Bachen, where Lord Gribaldus teaches.</p>
      <p>Germany would be well off regarding religion, if not for the Schwenckfeldians on one side and bitter zeal concerning the Eucharistic article on the other, tearing it apart; may the Lord grant peace to His churches. There will certainly be a diet in March in Regensburg for the expedition against the Turks to be undertaken; for already, although it is winter, they are making incursions into Hungary. Within eight days we are to have a meeting of the entire Swabian circle here in Reutlingen. Our prince came today to the nearby village to hunt, while waiting for the appointed day for business. I was with him for a while; an enemy has poured many things into his ears about Calvin, against whom I certainly see not a few adversaries from all sides.</p>
      <p>If by chance an image from Bern comes from Matthias Apiarius, ensure it reaches our Ruger in Schaffhausen; if it has not yet been sent, urge Haller to press Apiarius, who has already received the payment. I send some images with a German inscription; with this game, I play, when I must rest from more serious studies. I bid greetings to Lord Gualter and your sons-in-law and the other brothers. Help me with your prayers, which I earnestly ask of you. Reutlingen, December 6, 1555.</p>
      <p>In this meeting, it will be discussed how Swabia is prepared with infantry, cavalry, artillery, etc., if there should be a need to fight. This is the main point.</p>
      <p>Brother Vergerius.</p>
      <p>(A. H.) To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, honorable brother. In Zürich.</p>
