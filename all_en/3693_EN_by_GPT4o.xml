      <p>S. P. D. I am waiting daily for an opportunity (most illustrious man) to write to you about our affairs and the great events that the Christian princes are bringing forth. And while I wait, behold, unexpectedly, I have been informed from Italy that the Roman pontiff has been affected by a severe illness. If this is the case and death is to follow the illness, may God Almighty at least ensure that he takes with him all the seeds of evil and wars, with which Europe is everywhere teeming, and of which he himself has been the author and supporter. I will write more extensively on this matter and on other things that may present themselves.</p>
      <p>I understand that the Turkish fleet has long since set sail from all of Italy. In the meantime, take care to be well (most esteemed lord) and love me.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 3rd day of September 1558. Entirely devoted to your service and duty, J. Ja.</p>
      <p>De Cambray.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
