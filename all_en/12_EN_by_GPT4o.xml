    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's last letter [not received] has arrived, but it does not require a response.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">The situation with the "[Swiss] Chronicle" [by Johannes Stumpf] is as previously communicated [in hbbw XX, No. 3099, from December 26, 1547]: [The bookseller] Gregor Mangolt does not sell the work for less than 5 ½, and bound not for less than 6 guilders. Mangolt has purchased copies of the work "The Seven Words of Christ" by Johannes Zwick, printed in Konstanz, from Blarer's stock and included them in his offer. This will bring him much profit, as he pays Blarer 4 ½ pennies per piece, but sells them for 6! Christoph Froschauer the Elder wrote Mangolt [regarding the price of Stumpf's Chronicle] such an unfriendly letter that Blarer already feels pity for Mangolt. Bullinger should have rather said nothing to Froschauer or not written to Bullinger [on December 26, 1547 (hbbw XX, No. 3099,73f)] about it at all!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">As for [Lazarus Kölli], the son of the deceased Andreas Kölli, it is correct that Bullinger straightforwardly communicates that there is currently no hope [for a Zurich scholarship]. The Lord may perhaps show [the young Kölli] another way.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Johannes Gisling disregarded the Konstanz order at his wedding celebration. His bride [Barbara née Sumenberg(erin)] organized a dance, which has not happened for years. And this in the current, unfortunate situation! Therefore, the city council is making everyone who danced pay a fine of one guilder. The bridal couple themselves and the musician [N.N.] were imprisoned. The couple will soon come to Zurich. Gisling claims to have received a position in the Bern area.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">The situation [in Konstanz] remains unchanged. The fact that there has still been no [response to the Konstanz reconciliation request to Emperor Charles V.] can be attributed to various machinations. May God bring it to a good end.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Soon, [despite the uncertain situation], the fields outside the city will have to be cultivated. This will require a lot of work. Bullinger should unceasingly pray for God's help.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">The courier [N.N.], a servant of Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz, will be able to provide information about the rumors from Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Blarer has learned from a reliable man [N.N.] through a letter that this man, during a meal with a sailor [N.N.], a servant of Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Büren, heard that a Swiss from the area around Ermatingen, on behalf of the Count, determined the thickness of the ice layer of the Untersee and reported on it. This is related [to the rumors about] the zoo in Öhningen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">According to the same person [N.N.], it is assumed in Augsburg that the Swiss Confederation will split, and also that some of the leading evangelical places are fickle. The letter writer does not believe this. May God preserve them! Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[P.S.:] The young couple [Hans Rutishauser and his cousin Dorothea Diethelm known as Münchin] have not yet appeared at Blarer's.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace with all good through Christ from God, etc. Dear lord and brother, I have well received your last letter, etc. To which there is nothing special to respond, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the chronicle, as I have written to you, Mangolt has none, nor are they bound, nor given for less than 5 ½ guilders and 6. He has taken booklets from me, the seven words of Christ by the late Hans Zwick, which were printed here, on which he can gain as much profit as he has from me. He gives one for 6 pennies, costing him 4 ½ pennies from me. Froschauer has truly written him a harsh letter, which makes me pity him. I wish you had not said anything to him or I had not written to you about it, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding the late Andreas Kölli's son, you are right, as there is nothing to hope for, that you inform me well about it. The Lord God will perhaps show another way.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Gisling has had a wedding here and overlooked the order of my lords, and his bride arranged a dance, which has not been danced here for many years, as it is not the time for dancing in these difficult times. My lords were greatly displeased, and every person who danced was fined a guilder, but the bridegroom, the bride, and the musician were imprisoned. They will now return to you. He claims to have a position in the Bern area.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Our situation remains as I wrote before. The delay in response is due to various machinations. May the Lord God bring it to a good end.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Soon, the fields outside the city will have to be cultivated. This will require effort and labor, but the dear God will make it well, etc. Praying unceasingly for our city, that He may protect us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>From Augsburg, Zöger, the servant of Marcell Dietrich, will inform you about the rumors there.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Nothing special is written to me, except a good, respectable man informs me that he dined with a sailor, a servant of the Count of Büren. He also said that his lord, the Count of Büren, through a Swiss, who lives not far from Ermatingen, made inquiries about how deep the Untersee freezes in cold winter. He also wrote all the details, etc. It all relates to the zoo in Öhningen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>He also writes to me that he has often heard in Augsburg that it is certain the Swiss Confederation is not united, and also some of the best evangelical places are leaning to another side, etc. May the Lord God grant us repentance and improvement, that we may please Him and obtain His peace. Greetings to you and yours here and there. Also, say the same from me and mine. Dated January 18, 1548.</p>
      <p>A. Bl., your faithful dear brother.</p>

      <p>The young couple has not yet been to see me.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and by far most beloved brother of all.</p>
