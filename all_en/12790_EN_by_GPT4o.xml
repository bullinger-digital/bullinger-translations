    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] New Year's greeting.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Due to the difficult times, Frölich could not respond to Bullinger's last letter [not received]. However, he expressed his thoughts on the threatening situation in a letter written in German to Ambrosius Blarer and asked him to forward it to Bullinger. If this has not happened, Bullinger should know that Ulm, Memmingen, Biberach, and Kempten have surrendered! Augsburg is thus surrounded by the enemy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In Augsburg, they are also considering a surrender, or rather, a disgraceful capitulation following the example of Ulm! The patricians are completely disheartened, especially [Hans Welser], to whom Bullinger dedicated his [Commentary on Luke]. However, the council and the inhabitants do not want to submit. This could lead to an uprising!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] May God turn this distress into a victory! Bullinger should write what should be done in these turmoils. Frölich is powerless and can hardly endure it any longer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony has almost regained all his dominions. Landgrave Philipp of Hesse is troubled by the invasion of Maximilian of Egmont, Count of Buren, into Hesse. Due to the blocked roads, no news from the princes is currently reaching Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Frölich is trying to comfort the despondent Johannes Haller as best as he can. If the people of Augsburg were to make a godless peace with the Emperor, Frölich would be well advised to flee from Augsburg to Zurich with the Zurich pastors [Haller, Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder].</p>

      <p>Greetings and a happy new year from the supreme and only parent of all things through Jesus Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Due to the difficult times and my very sad occupations, I was unable to respond to your last letter, venerable brother Bullinger. However, I wrote in German to Lord Ambrosius and asked him to forward my letter to you, which contained our calamity. I hope you have received it. If not, know that Ulm, Memmingen, Biberach, and Kempten have completely defected from us, and we are now surrounded by enemies on all sides.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We are now considering a transaction or rather a disgraceful surrender, like the one Ulm found. Our leaders have completely lost their courage, especially the one to whom you dedicated your sacred commentary. However, the council and the people strongly refuse to submit. Hence, there is a fear that a tumult may arise from these opposing consultations.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have offered myself to the Lord, hoping for victory from these tribulations. Pray faithfully to the Lord that He does not abandon us. I also implore you by our mutual love to reveal in writing what should be done in these turmoils, which I can neither prevent nor endure for long.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Elector of Saxony has entered his territories to recover them and, as I hear, has almost regained each one. The Landgrave has a conflict with the Count of Buren, who invaded the land of the Chatti. However, I do not know what fortune he uses, as we can no longer receive any letters from our princes; all roads are so blocked!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Haller is well and very anxious. I comfort him as much as I can. If it seemed good to the Lord that I, with your preachers, should flee to Zurich when our magistrate enters into impious conditions with the Emperor (which God forbid), I would consider myself well provided for.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell and convey my greetings to all good and pious people. January 6, 1547. Yours, Georg Frölich (Laetus), etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc., former (Antistes) of the Church of Zurich, my gracious lord and brother. Zurich. Quickly.</p>
