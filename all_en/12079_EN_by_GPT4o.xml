    <p xml:id="regest1">Even though Sturm has never written to Bullinger before, he recommends the young bearer [Gerhard thom Camph], because he requested it. The [people of Zurich] should not let themselves be more upset than necessary by Luther's curse [“Short Confession”] - for the sake of the torn church. He regrets that [the Swiss Confederates] brought forth the vehement poem against Osiander; certainly, [Osiander] started the dispute, but the poet has bitten in a very painful way; one must not give the opponents any further [opportunity for attack]! He asks for a benevolent reception of his candid letter. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings most abundant.</p>
      <p>The young man wishes to be commended to you by me. I could not deny him this service, even though I have never written to you before, but I had to comply with the honorable wish of a very studious and excellent young man, whom I indeed commend to you again and again.</p>
      <p>Luther has published a very bitter curse. I ask that you do not allow yourselves to be more disturbed by such an angry speaker at this time than is fair.</p>
      <p>Dedicate this to the torn church, and let us strive, even against opposing men, to somehow restore its torn members.</p>
      <p>A vehement poem also came from you against Osiander, and I would not wish that it had been done; but he was the first to injure, yet this poet has bitten more painfully.</p>
      <p>Let us not give the enemies greater occasion than has been given so far; forgive me for writing to you more freely than I should.</p>
      <p>I do not wish to be a monitor, but a supplicant, and I beseech you to grant something. I wish and desire that you all be safe and sound, and especially your old father Pellicanus. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Straßburg, the eighth of November 1544.</p>
      <p>Sturm.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
