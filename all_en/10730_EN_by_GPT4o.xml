    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Bern have sent a messenger to the delegates of Zurich at the theologians' convention in Aarau, so that they may await the arrival of Megander; if they have not yet arrived, a new date should be set. Haller refers back to his letters from the previous day and indicates that a meeting of the Seven Places has taken place. Regarding comments by Bullinger and Megander. Whether the articles sent to him are suitable as a basis for a public confession should be left to the judgment of the upcoming convention; Bullinger's letter to Bucer [above No. 562] seems exemplary to him. Inquires about new works by Pellikan. In Bern, a dangerous agitator [Antoni Bischoff] is in custody.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote late at night about holding the convention in Aarau. We were uncertain about what should be done. We regretted that if your people undertook the dangers and inconveniences of the journey in vain, and we were absent in such an important matter. Therefore, on November 30th, we sent a messenger to Aarau, so that if your people were there, they would not leave, but wait for the swift arrival of Megander. Then, if you were not there, a new date would be set more conveniently, which the people of Basel would visit with us. What will happen, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Then, regarding the matters of Geneva that I had, I wrote them down in haste, so I never reread them. However, I believe you understood.</p>
      <p>I added, as you requested, a response about the exiles. If anything else happens in the meantime or if you want anything else, let me know.</p>
      <p>What I added about the Antronians is confidential. You can easily inquire among your people. Now, let it be, they have gathered under the burning lamp.</p>
      <p>You did not add anything about your commentaries on the remaining epistles of Paul. I have not yet seen Megander's Timothy; I do not know whether it has been printed or not.</p>
      <p>I have sent back the articles of concord. Between you and me, it would be easy to agree on these circumlocutions, since friendly charity allows whatever it can without loss of faith, but whether we are allowed to confess such concord publicly, let it be the judgment of the brothers' convention. You once wrote a letter to Bucer, of which you also sent me a copy; in it, everything is so clear and concise that I have never received anything like it from all of you. May the Lord ensure that everything is done with sincere hearts for the glory of the Lord.</p>
      <p>They say Pellican is contemplating registers in the Bible or new concordances, and then commentaries on the entire New Testament. What these will be like, if at least, let me know with a single word. I already see the diligence of your lectures. Those who do not want to learn sacred things with you are certainly foolish.</p>
      <p>I wrote about a certain little bird kept in a cage, whose song, as soon as I understand it, I will not allow you to be unaware of. One of the leaders is accused of such great sedition that if he had achieved his desire, you would have seen a remarkable change in all things. The man, if I am not mistaken, is known to you.</p>
      <p>You now see me excellently dispelling the mark of that notable laziness and sloth, which you wanted to impute to me not undeservedly.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>November 30th, 11 a.m.</p>
      <p>Yours, Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his especially beloved lord and brother.</p>
