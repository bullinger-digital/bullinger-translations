    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the news [No. 1203]; learns little new about the plague, only heard that the Bishop of M체nster has been expelled. Bedrot writes that a war against [the Protestants] is to be expected in the spring, with the confiscation of church property likely to be used as a pretext; Hedio has learned from Caesarius that a conflict over the Duchy of Guelders is brewing. In Burgundy, a new prophet is causing a great stir, criticizing the priests but defending the Mass; he is unlikely to have lasting success. The university reform is heading in the wrong direction: the university wants to bring the service of the Word under its control and is supported by Karlstadt and Wissenburg, while Gryn채us, like Myconius, is under pressure to obtain a doctorate; there is also the threat of alienation of church property in favor of the university, which Myconius cannot accept given the situation of the pastors; Bullinger should keep all this to himself, take a position on it, and, if possible, communicate the wording of the doctoral oath. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The plague keeps us so busy here that we have no concern for external matters, and friends who are abroad can only offer consolation. Therefore, everything you wrote is new to us, even about the people of M체nster; for I have heard nothing except that the bishop has been expelled again. I thank you, my dear Bullinger, for reporting these things; it is remarkable how much I desire to know such matters, even though they both cause and increase sorrow.</p>
      <p>Recently, Bedrot wrote that a war against us is feared in the spring, not indeed under the pretext of religion, but due to the unjust seizure of church property. From Lower Germany, Caesarius informed Hedio of serious disturbances expected over the Duchy of Guelders, unless God prevents it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, strange things are being reported about a new prophet in parts of Burgundy: he raises children from the dead, preaches against the lasciviousness of priests, yet extols the Mass. A huge crowd gathers around him; in one sermon alone, there were over fourteen thousand men. From what I have heard, I cannot approve of the man; however, he will not last if he is as I judge him to be.</p>
      <p>You wish to hear about the university. They have been reforming it for ten years now, and it is continually getting worse. Recently, they convened and drafted articles for the same reason, one of which attempts to subject the ministry of the Word to the university. And although they deny this vigorously, they are nevertheless convicted by the article itself. Karlstadt and Wissenburg are present, and not only do they agree, but they also urge the matter as necessary (this in your ear). Lord Gryn채us, because he is being solicited for a doctorate, is in the same situation as I am. The second article is also intolerable to me, which demands a certain annual income. It is clear that church property must make up for this deficiency, which I could bear somehow, if only the brothers were not in extreme need. You cannot believe how much effort I have expended so far in vain for their poverty; but I will not cease, since I know that what is happening is the work of Satan to expel the gospel. Here neither the plague, nor the Turk, nor the wicked consultations of the powerful against us can restrain the vain attempt of insolence, as if we have nothing else to do but concern ourselves with the pomp and titles of the university. Indeed, may it be far from me to attempt anything against this, rather I have helped as much as I could and will continue to help, so that the studies may be as excellent as possible, provided they are directed to the glory of Christ. When this is done, I will be content, but if otherwise, I would rather be expelled than endure it. I write this to you so that you may immediately tear up the letter after reading it. Therefore, what you know, I want you to be unaware of; only, respond first with what seems to you. They conceal the doctoral oath from me so much that I cannot know it; but I know it is for the confirmation of the papal kingdom. If you can demonstrate it anywhere, please do, so that I may not remain ignorant of it any longer.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your wife and children, also to Pellican, Theodor, and others. Basel, December 6, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, president of the Word among the people of Zurich, his venerable lord in the Lord.</p>
