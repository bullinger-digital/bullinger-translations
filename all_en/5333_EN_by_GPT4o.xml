      <p>God's grace through Christ Jesus, our Lord, beforehand etc.</p>
      <p>I have, dear and friendly godfather, received and understood what you have written to me about my gracious lord, Bannerlord Schmid's son, and hereupon with my lord, the city scribe Zun Kinden, personally greeted and, as much as possible, supported and promoted him, and that on your and the lord's own behalf, who has always shown much friendship and goodness to me and mine, which I should rightfully deserve, if I could. However, I find with him such a decision, firstly that he thanks the lord and also you for your trust, that you have in him, to entrust him with the son; but he indicates that it is impossible for him to accept: 1. that he may not take anyone into the chancellery without the permission of my lords; 2. that he has refused many, whether they are some of my lords here or also honorable people from foreign places, to accept their sons, against whom it would be reproachable for him if he accepted others; 3. that he is now more morose and peculiar, that he cannot tolerate the ways of the young; so not all young people can tolerate his ways; 4. that he has such a household, whether it be many children and otherwise, that he cannot accept anyone at the table; then also those who write in the chancellery, all except two boys, who are particularly related to him, live outside the house, and other similar reasons more. And it is not without; I myself recognize his ways and actions in such a way that it would not be for him to keep young people; for he is of a very withdrawn, solitary, and quiet nature and cannot tolerate any noise.</p>
      <p>So he has also, after he came into the chancellery, reformed and sorted out the same, what was unsuitable for him, and lets no one in, except those who are particularly quiet, withdrawn, simple, and discreet. I wanted to report this to you upon your earnest request, so that you may inform the lord Bannerlord; whom I hereby greet in a friendly manner. I have no certain news to write to you at the moment.</p>
      <p>We are waiting every hour for what comes from Solothurn; God grant nothing but good! Herewith, I commend the lord to grace. All good lords and friends greet you.</p>
      <p>My lord Schultheiss Steiger, Treasurer Haller and Grafenried, Venner im Hag, Lord Pfister, and others. Also greet my lords in general for me.</p>
      <p>Dated in Bern, May 20, 1562. Your ever willing servant, J[ohannes] Haller.</p>
      <p>To my friendly, beloved lord and godfather, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
