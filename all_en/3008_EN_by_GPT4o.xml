      <p>Although I do not have anything of great importance to write to you about now, my venerable and dearest brother, I did not think it should be done that a young man of such faith should come there without my letters. Moreover, it is always a pleasure for me when writing to you, as I seem to converse with you, with you, I say, such a great friend, as I truly do not know if there is anyone else, for whom nothing else is equally in my wishes than to enjoy your presence in Christ Jesus someday, by whom I greatly desire and very much hope to be continually helped by the intercessions of your Christian prayers, especially since I know they are fortunate and most effective.</p>
      <p>From Hungary, we hear that a skirmish with the Turks was fought for seven hours, that is, from the eleventh hour until the battle was soon resolved; 2000 Turks, and 600 of Ferdinand's men... If the Huserni had not fled in time, a glorious victory could have been won from the enemy that day. Among Ferdinand's men, Christoph von Bolwyl also fell, whose leg was pierced by a bullet; he was the brother of Nikolaus von Bolwyler, who for a time afflicted our miserable Konstanz in the name of Ferdinand. What will happen with the Turk, the Lord knows, whom we pray with humble vows that lighter things may happen to our Germany than it deserves.</p>
      <p>Maximilian departed with good grace from the Emperor. In Regensburg, there is still no assembly of princes; but if they convene, Albrecht of Bavaria will first propose aid against the Turk, will request a double Roman expedition for eight months, then that the controversy of religion be seriously addressed, and finally that the inequality of currency in the Roman Empire be abolished. Albrecht the Margrave demands with great persistence half of the bishoprics of Würzburg and Bamberg, will have this and nothing else, nor anything less.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write to you about new matters, although I think even this is not new to you. Regarding the Glareans, there is nothing for me to write to you, who knows everything more certainly as it happened.</p>
      <p>I greatly wonder and am much grieved that they did not show more courage and constancy in this matter. Ah Christ the Savior, how lukewarm we are in vindicating your glory, while the adversaries are so fervent and employ all machines in the subversion of piety. Let us pray to the Lord that he may kindle the hearts of our people with the flames of his spirit and grant them minds worthy of him, so that they do not hesitate to risk their affairs, life, and all for his cause. But farewell now, my esteemed and sweetest Bullinger, with your household and all your brothers, colleagues, and ministers in the Lord, whom you will greet individually on my behalf with reverence and love, commending me to their happy patronage in Christ, especially P. Partyrem, whose work I pray to God may be fortunate and auspicious for your school and church. My wife greets you and yours with Funck, Fuchs, and the other friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>On the first of September 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>I wish to commend this studious and pious young man to you diligently, if you can assist him in any way. He will return to Chur and Basel after the autumn holidays.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
