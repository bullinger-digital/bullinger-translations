    <p xml:id="regest1">Despite diligent efforts, could do little for Hartmann von Hallwyl, even though he had him further recommended by Bucer, who is still in Regensburg; however, Rudolf [Gwalther], who recently stayed in Ulm, had not yet heard of [Hallwyl]; Frecht does not write more extensively to Bullinger, as he will learn all the news from Regensburg directly through the letter bearer; may God assist His Church! Calvin arrived in Ulm on June 20th, coming from Regensburg, and reported, among other things, on the unity of the Upper German churches, the displeasure with the [Regensburg Book], and the rejection of the article on Transubstantiation. He is concerned about Bucer's overly compromising behavior, which he, as Calvin also knows, strongly advised against; due to lack of time, he cannot write more, but asked Calvin to write to Zurich, and the letter bearer will also report. Greetings. Apologizes for the hasty letter.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Most esteemed brother, I received your letter, full of all piety and humanity, here in Ulm on June 25th, and I was truly very sorry that I could not respond to your wishes in recommending the truly noble man, Mr. Hartmann von Hallwyl, as much as I wanted to, even though my recommendation and effort, which I especially owe to you, is very small. Nevertheless, I did what I could; for otherwise, I undoubtedly recommended him to all the pious and learned, and I recommended him to Bucer, who is still lingering in Regensburg. However, when our Rudolf [Gwalther] greeted and bid me farewell at that time, I asked him if he had seen that nobleman in Regensburg, and he replied that he knew nothing at all about him. It is now the eighth day since that nobleman came here and departed the next day. Moreover, suffering from a lack of time and subject matter, I could not and did not want to write anything back to you now, nor did I want to deprive this sufficiently eloquent letter bearer of his duty, who will be my living letter to you, from whom you will learn what has meanwhile been done in Regensburg. Truly, he wrote about the outcome of the assemblies, saying he rarely saw any successful one. May the Lord of peace govern and preserve His church in the peace that the world cannot give. Calvin returned here from Regensburg on June 20th and departed the next day.</p>
      <p>He reported this good news, which I was most eager to know, that the churches of Upper Germany are now more closely united than ever; for by God's perpetual grace, we unanimously disliked that imperial document and rejected the article on transubstantiation, etc.</p>
      <p>About Bucer, which also greatly troubled me, Calvin also reported that he gets along well with the other brothers in all respects, although I now suspect he had some peculiar deliberations. Calvin knows how I opportunely and importunately admonished Bucer in Regensburg, having implored him not to indulge too much in conciliations. But due to the pressure of time, I am now excluded from writing about these and other matters. I implored Calvin, since he stayed longer in Regensburg, to write to you. But this letter bearer will explain the rest to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the esteemed lords and brothers, whom our people also wish to be safe and ask to be commended to your prayers along with me.</p>
      <p>Ulm, hastily, July 2, 1541.</p>
      <p>Forgive this letter, poured out more rudely than written, which I could not reread.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, M. Frecht.</p>
      <p>To the excellently learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
