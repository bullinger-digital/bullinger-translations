      <p>Greetings. Due to the sudden change of all things here, as I was also in danger of my life and some citizens were plotting against me, I was advised by my best friends to move to Griesenberg with the consent of our council, to stay for a while with my excellent sister, until I understand what needs to be done according to the Lord's will. My brothers in the ministry also approved of this decision, and many pious people urged me to withdraw, although not as if I were leaving never to return, but as if I were visiting my true and excellent sister for the sake of duty. However, I do not see (as our people's customs are now) why I should return to a city that has collapsed so disgracefully, or why others who are not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ should linger there longer, unless perhaps the Lord, which I hardly dare to hope, restores everything beyond all our hope and expectation by some divine miracle.</p>
      <p>Your letter was sent to me in Griesenberg yesterday; I translated the unknown words for dear cousin Conrad Zwick and sent it back, as he requested from me.</p>
      <p>It is quite strange with [the one from Schwarzenburg]; he was in Constance last week, letting some strange things be known regarding the Pope, the French, and the Venetians; but what was dealt with him, I cannot know at all, as I was drawn away. Previously, even before our envoys were sent to Augsburg, he wanted to deal with my brother and the secret matters; but for some reasons, it was suspicious, so they did not want to get involved with him. It seems that not much attention was paid to his proposals now either; I would like to know what tricks he has played, as you write.</p>
      <p>Our Butler has faithfully narrated all good things to me. I owe you not only myself but also my possessions, as you have offered yourself and all your things to me more than lovingly and kindly.</p>
      <p>May the Lord repay you with the most abundant interest at the resurrection of the just! Opperus, a truly holy man, could hardly greet me in passing; I was so overwhelmed with countless business troubles. However, through him, the Lord reminded me, so that I cannot but accept what he said as if spoken by the Lord's angel. May He accompany him happily with good angels to his homeland and open a great door for him to plant and water with the increase of heavenly blessing! If he is still there, please greet him on my behalf.</p>
      <p>From our John Faber, you will learn about the Emperor and our Frecht, what has been written to our people by trustworthy sources these days. I deeply grieve for Frecht's situation. May our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he has sincerely and zealously preached to his people for so many years, strengthen him with the power of His Spirit, so that he may speak of His testimonies before kings and not be ashamed. The Emperor thinks, as is the case, that he can easily extinguish the Gospel of Christ if he gradually removes the outstanding ministers of it; but it is God's artifice to use the blood of His martyrs as the most fertile manure for the field of His church, and to turn the efforts of His enemies to the contrary.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, it is my very friendly, diligent request to make every possible effort to find out what the message from France brings to the Confederates, and what the chapters are, which place is dealing with them. Please let me know this urgently by a special message at my expense; for I am earnestly asked about it by a good friend at the WÃ¼rttemberg court. Therefore, do not let me down in this, as my trust in you stands. I think that tomorrow or Wednesday I will return to Constance, until another storm arises, although I would rather, considering the circumstances, stay completely out of it, as I do not want to be there when the priests are brought in or the Interim must be practiced. My children, God willing, should not be raised in this Sodom. God protect all the pious! I am truly in great danger in Constance; for I have been in the king's blood book for several years. The bishop of Narres also let my dear brother know in Augsburg about his and my person: if it comes to that, we will be punished for others; as it is evident that he pursues the chief preachers everywhere, although I am truly not to be counted among the prominent ones, yet I am considered so among us; moreover, I now also have great opposition in the city, which I never expected, some of whom threaten me with death. Therefore, pray earnestly and faithfully for me, that I may stay or leave according to God's will, as is fitting.</p>
      <p>Oh, that He would still look upon this matter with grace today, so that we might be rid of the priests and the Interim! How blessed we would be. Well, all things are possible for Him. To Him are entrusted time and eternity along with all yours. My dear sister sends you and your honorable dear wife all love and good, entrusting her son Walther to you for the best, so that you may also keep an eye on him and occasionally admonish him.</p>
      <p>Given in haste at Griesenberg, August 27, 1548. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable friend and brother.</p>
