      <p>Greetings. I have received your latest letters; but I have not yet seen the earlier ones.</p>
      <p>I suspected it to be so with Augustin, as you write, but I cannot quite marvel enough, if he is diligent and industrious, how he not only accumulated so much debt, but also squandered it. He told me he owes a total of 400 florins, of which he could have 300 from the sale of a house, and for the remaining 100 I pledged, leaving his furniture intact. If this is the case and he applies labor and diligence, he can be relieved. But I wish to know whether the names of the creditors exceed that number. I therefore ask you to inform me of what you can know about this matter. I do not have the means to free a man covered in debt; but with the resources that may be in my hand, if he is diligent in labor, I can greatly assist him. I could avoid these troubles; but true piety moved me to help this wretched man rather than another who is not in need. He promised to come to work three weeks after the Easter festival; if he fulfills this, it will be well for him; otherwise, he will be unfaithful to me, and I will no longer be moved by his plight.</p>
      <p>There is much talk about new matters, but little truth. There was a widespread rumor here, which you say is circulating there, that the Emperor had gone to his own; but he lives and is well and is contemplating great things. I hear he wants to make his son King of the Romans, for which purpose he has either announced or will soon announce a meeting in Augsburg. However, how he will deal with his brother is unknown. I received from Antwerp that peace between the English and the French is certainly established; I do not know the conditions. There is also some mention of holding a council; but it will be just a mention. The Pope is contemplating being affable to the Imperialists and is proceeding nicely; but neither trusts the other, and I think both kinds of people are full of deceit. I would have come to you this Easter holiday, if I had not been expecting my relatives, whose arrival is delayed longer than I thought, which is very troublesome to me. If I receive any further news, I will share it with you. Write about Augustin's affairs, as I ask of you, and remind the man to come at the appointed time. Greet all the brothers with my words.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Basel, March 12, 1550. Yours, Franz Dryander.</p>
