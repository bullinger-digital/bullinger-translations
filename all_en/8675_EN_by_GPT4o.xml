      <p>While the woman stayed here longer than I expected, I am sending you here the printed account of the Venetian victory. I also have another description, in which the prominent families of the Venetians who remained in the naval battle are listed; I will send it to you later. And regarding the 50 mules from Spain, it is as follows and is written from Augsburg: 50 mules, loaded with money, 40 with silver, 10 with gold, have arrived in France and were supposed to be delivered to the Duke of Alba. They were intercepted by the Huguenots for the king; since they transported them, they declared them at customs and everywhere as saffron; but it was money and gold. Now, as it is laid down, it is claimed that all the goods are not the king's from Spain, but rather of some merchants. How it will proceed with this, one cannot know.</p>
      <p>This is what I wanted to add to my previous writing, since the woman did not leave so quickly. Take care.</p>
      <p>All things are arranged in such a way that little peace can be expected for the coming year. God have mercy on us, etc.</p>
