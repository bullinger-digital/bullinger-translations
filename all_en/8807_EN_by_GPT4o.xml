      <p>Honorable, highly and well-learned sir, may my willing service be at your disposal at all times, etc. My recent letter I sent to you with the bookkeeper Heller along with the two copies, for which I am thankful; it was forgotten due to the reason that brother-in-law Rotmund kept them. Herewith a letter, which has come to me before this date; the good sir writes to me that he has... at Grienenbach; I would gladly have him here, if he were not already promised. Sir Johannes Kessler sends you his greetings and service; it has been reported before this date by the bailiff that unfortunately the good people cannot be helped. We have previously taken care of this; however, he wants to let them remain unforced until now, those who still remain with friendly writing. I will speak with the man known to you in the coming days; he no longer wants to be there; may God provide a good one in his place, amen. I have little news, only that some write from Augsburg that the Tartars, whom the Turk wants to place in the garrison in Hungary, are said to have been defeated by Christians. I do not believe this; as the postmaster in Augsburg also writes to me, reporting nothing of it. With that, may God the Lord along with yours be entrusted in grace, etc.</p>
      <p>Dated St. Gallen, the 10th of March, in the year 1572. Your willing servant at all times, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>Herewith a letter from the young lord of Sax, who desires it. To the honorable and well-learned sir Heinrich Bullinger the elder, the faithful servant of the Church of Christ, my esteemed beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
