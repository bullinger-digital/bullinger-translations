      <p>Greetings. I received your letters (reverend father in Christ) this evening.</p>
      <p>However, I spent the entire day gathering herbs for Mr. Gesner, so I am unable to write at length.</p>
      <p>But I have nothing to write about.</p>
      <p>The acts of the council elude us; however, I expect daily to hear what is announced by those to whom I have written about this matter. Those coming from Italy, especially from the region of Milan, all unanimously affirm that everything is calm in Milan and its surroundings. Our people from Valtellina also affirm that grain is being transported to them in large quantities across the lake. As for what is certain, the rumors are so varied that I cannot easily say what is likely. As for Vergerius, I assure you that you can be at ease.</p>
      <p>Our consuls are already informed.</p>
      <p>I congratulate you for having brought your book to completion.</p>
      <p>I know that our disputes are full of obstacles; but the outcome must be entrusted to the Lord, and the truth must not be abandoned for that reason. Today I read the tablets titled: Genealogy or Posterity of Luther, the fifth (if it pleases the gods) evangelist, etc. I do not know if you have seen it; I think it is the work of Staphylus.</p>
      <p>Lord de Rozin√ü lent it to someone among us to read. The author tries to make our cause seem odious and suspect by claiming that we do not get along well with each other; he calls those who assert that the body of Christ is deified "metamorphists"; he counts Calvin among the Manichaeans and Marcionites. These are mere slanders.</p>
      <p>I give you singular thanks for your book. I leave the rest as you request.</p>
      <p>There is absolutely nothing new.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>I pray to God that He may bless your labors and keep you and yours safe. March 2, in the year of our Lord 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his ever-honored father in Christ.</p>
