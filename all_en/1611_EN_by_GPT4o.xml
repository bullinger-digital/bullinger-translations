      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, I received your rather lengthy letter, which was brought by Guido, my messenger. I will not respond to everything; for neither is there time nor is it necessary, but to those things which are more necessary.</p>
      <p>What Galitius wrote to you, I do not know; you affirm that he conducted himself modestly. I must believe you; but I certainly know that he wrote most immodestly to others and asserted that Martinengo and I have become Anabaptists. What could be more atrocious?</p>
      <p>It is surprising that Heinrich Bullinger was not so sharp-nosed as to be able to detect in me such a grave stench, especially since he has heard and dealt with me so many times, indeed, nor has there ever been anyone in all of Switzerland or Raetia who suspected this of me, and only Galitius is endowed with such a keen intellect that he could know me. Therefore, I have decided to avoid such a dangerous judgment of the man and I will avoid it, if God wills, nor will I appear in any synod anymore.</p>
      <p>For if it were a matter of bringing a thief to the wheel and I wanted to incline towards mercy and proposed to act a little more mildly, then that good man would shout that I am a thief.</p>
      <p>The comparison fits beautifully, for he pronounced me to be an Anabaptist because I thought moderation should be used with one who was suspected of Anabaptism. Let him say that I acted imprudently, that I am a man of no counsel, and I will bear it easily; but that he wants to make me a heretic, I cannot bear. These things, which I write to you, that little man, lest I say something more serious, has defamed me as a heretic in published letters to someone among our Italians, are true, Heinrich Bullinger. See therefore, if he cherishes your Vergerius, whom you had recommended. But nothing could be more pernicious to the reputation of the synod; for almost all Italians will henceforth abstain from him. And enough of these things.</p>
      <p>The Tridentine synagogue is breathing its last, as many prudent people think. God is marvelous, who unexpectedly was present. Such a sharp contention has arisen among them that they have fought with fists; the session is postponed to Pentecost, and I hope to the Greek calends. In short: the pope has like a thrush crapped his own misfortune, who first kindled the war.</p>
      <p>You write: "If these men win, the papacy has perished throughout all of Germany;" I add: "and throughout all of Italy, and let all the people say amen."</p>
      <p>I recently traveled through the entire Valtellina Valley and sowed as much as I could; may God give the increase. The Papists bear it indignantly that I am not content to cry out against their false doctrines in my little church, but to wander far and wide, to destroy, and indeed they threaten daily; but I trust in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I still have many things and one of the greatest importance, which pertains to you; but I defer to another time and perhaps I will explain in person. For I will soon return to you, intending to go further, if God wills. Farewell and be well. Pray for me with the whole family and church. Vicosoprano, April 8, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
