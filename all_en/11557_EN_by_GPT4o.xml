    <p xml:id="regest1">Farel will report on his mission himself, for which he wants to seek support from the Zurich council; in the meantime, Bullinger should obtain the consent of St. Gallen through a messenger to Vadian. The matter is urgent; he wishes that all of Germany and all churches would join in the advocacy [for the persecuted in France]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To H. Bullinger. Greetings.</p>
      <p>You will learn from Farel himself the reason why he is coming to you. For this matter, he will need the agreement and authority of your most distinguished Council. While he is obtaining this, I ask you to ensure, by sending a messenger to Vadian in St. Gallen, that the consent of the people of St. Gallen is also obtained through your efforts. Hurry, it is necessary: you will understand this from the account he will present to you. I see nothing more wonderful or splendid than if, through the efforts of good people, the unity of all of Germany and all churches could be seen in this intercession for the brothers. Farewell in the Lord Christ, my most esteemed brother in the Lord. Greet all with honor. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To H. Bullinger, his dearest brother. In Zurich.</p>
