    <p xml:id="regest1">Promises to reciprocate his fatherly affection with obedience. Intends to personally deliver Adam Frey the booklet ["Report of the Sick"] if possible. Studies the speeches of Cicero. Johann [Wilhelm] Reiffenstein praises the friendliness of the people of Zurich. Thanks for the M체nster Bible. Platter has passed on the work of Walter [von Ch창tillon] to Gregor Mangolt; Gwalther can only send the Sedulius volume once he reaches Oporin, who will also inform him of the price of Vives' "De anima". The mediation of a proofreader position for the Englishman recommended by Bullinger was not possible. Reiffenstein asks to exchange the enclosed coins. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>I am glad that my letters were pleasing to you, dearest patron, and this has given me considerable encouragement in writing. I am immensely grateful that you instruct me to expect from you what I would from a father, and I assure you that you can expect from me what you would from a son; for you will never find me less obedient to your will (as long as God is present).</p>
      <p>I have not yet sent the booklet to Adam Frey; however, I will send it shortly, although he wishes for me to deliver it personally, which I will do if possible, so that he does not complain that I have neglected him.</p>
      <p>I am working diligently on the speeches of Cicero, as I examine them according to the principles of Greek and Latin rhetoricians and compose others based on their model. Furthermore, Johann Wilhelm Reiffenstein praises the great friendliness of the people of Zurich.</p>
      <p>I am glad that such honor has been bestowed upon both the foreigner and my most beloved friend among you.</p>
      <p>I received the M체nster Bible from Johann Butler; I thank you for the effort you expended on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Regarding Platter, you should know that I have met him; however, he has handed over the book of Walter von Ch창tillon to Gregor Mangolt. As for Sedulius, Oporin has it, and since I could not find him at home either yesterday or today (as he is entangled in very important matters), I could not send it now; but you will receive it from me as soon as another messenger is available. Then I will also inform you about the price of Vives' "De anima," as I received this from Oporin as well. As for the Englishman you wrote about earlier, I have not yet found any position for him, nor do I hope to find one; there are many proofreaders who are eager for such positions. Additionally, they are reluctant to accept those who are unknown and have never been trained in printing houses. However, if I had known about this two days earlier, Balthasar Lasius would have accepted him; but now he has a certain Frenchman.</p>
      <p>Johann Wilhelm Reiffenstein asked me to send these coins to someone who would send him batzen (Swiss coins) in exchange; for this currency is unknown here and cannot be exchanged. I ask you to assist this excellent young man with your efforts.</p>
      <p>Please convey my greetings to your mother and wife along with the entire family, and also to your brother Johann, whom I urge to write back to confirm whether he has received what I sent.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most humane patron, and continue to love me as you have begun. From the house of Myconius in Basel, April 26, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, as you know, Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed patron.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
