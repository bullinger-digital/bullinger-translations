      <p>François Hotman sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I give immense thanks for your most excellent gift, with which you recently wished to honor me, my venerable father and most esteemed teacher. If only I could in return offer something worthy to present to your eminence. I believe you have received the book of Institutions, which you lent to me.</p>
      <p>The hurried departure of the person to whom I entrusted it prevented me from being able to include my letters. However, I hope that my apology has been accepted by both you and Master Wolf, whom I wish to greet most respectfully with my words.</p>
      <p>I also hope that my letters have been delivered to you and to Master Martyr, my most esteemed parent, which I entrusted to two Italians, whom Master Zanchi said were doctors of law and were to set out to you two months ago. I suppose you have already heard that Farel and Beza have obtained permission from our senate to intervene in summoning some friendly colloquium among the Swiss and German theologians; this is now being pursued in our senate, as I hear, with the utmost zeal. Yesterday, I heard from my neighbor, whom Master Martyr knows, that King Philip has paid King Henry 60,000 crowns to allow him to have the Rhinegrave, with the agreed terms that he would not be thrown into prison nor held as a perpetual captive. The soldiers of Bouillon, having received the money, are setting out on long journeys to France to serve King Henry. Here, almost nothing else is encountered along the city's streets.</p>
      <p>Regarding the colloquium, Master Peucer writes to me that there is not much hope left, as the adversaries do not wish to break off, but rather to delay. May the Lord Jesus grant courage and strength to the theologians whom I saw there, and may He preserve you safe for His church for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>My venerable father, farewell and be well. November 19, 1557. To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most excellent theologian and most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
