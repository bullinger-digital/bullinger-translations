    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends the virtuous and faithful bearer Balthasar [Rümeli], who many years ago came to Winterthur as a poor religious refugee, where he learned the weaving trade and practiced it quite successfully, without neglecting his studies and [participation in] public sermons; when Michael Schlatter later became pastor in Wädenswil through Lüthi's [mediation], he got Balthasar [Rümeli] as a successor in the filial community of Ellikon, which otherwise regards the church of Gachnang as its mother [church]; [Rümeli] was a deacon there and served faithfully for seven years as the head of the small church; [Rümeli] himself will report on [the turn of his fate], Bullinger should help him in Christ's name. Sends greetings to Bullinger and his wife [Anna Adlischwyler], to whom he sends four roosters, as he heard that she recently went to Baden for a spa treatment, and wishes that it may be effective; Bullinger should not forget him.</p>

      <p>Although this Balthasar, whom you see in person and who delivered this letter to you, was already sufficiently recommended to you by his piety and innocence of life, most honorable sir, he believes that he can become even more commendable to you through my testimony. Therefore, I did not want to fail the man's trust, since his virtue and innocence of life deserve to be esteemed and promoted by all truly pious people. If my opinion holds less weight with you, I ask that the great trust he has in Christ, proven by many arguments, may compensate for it. He came to Winterthur many years ago as an exile for Christ, oppressed by great poverty, learned the weaving trade with us, and also practiced it afterwards, so that he could more easily provide for his daily sustenance and meet the necessities of this present life. This way of seeking sustenance was not unsuccessful for him. Meanwhile, he did not neglect his studies or public sermons, but daily stole a few hours from his craft, which he otherwise diligently practiced, to spend them partly listening to the word of the Lord and partly studying the holy scriptures. Later, when it happened that Michael Schlatter was called to Wädenswil to serve as pastor there, with my assistance, he found our Balthasar as a successor in the filial community of Ellikon, which otherwise regards the church of Gachnang as its mother church. And when this good man took on the function of deacon there, he presided over that small church for seven years and diligently and faithfully dispensed the talent entrusted to him by the Lord. How it happened that he was suddenly and unexpectedly, as far as I know, undeservedly dismissed and deprived of his benefice, he will perhaps explain better in person than I can in writing. Please, in the name of Christ, assist this good man as much as you can, not so much for my sake as for Christ's. He has always been especially dear to me for his pure simplicity and simple candor, beyond many men of his kind, and I wish him to be dear to you and your colleagues as well, among whom the Lord has certainly opened up a great hope for him; for which I pray to the immortal God again and again that he may not be disappointed.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live with your dear wife, as kind as she is chaste, to whom I send four roosters as a gift, since I hear that she recently bathed in the Swiss baths; may the immortal God make it very beneficial for her. The gift is indeed modest and of little importance if you consider the thing itself, but truly most precious if you deeply consider the spirit of the one who gave it. Farewell again, and do not let the malice or envy of any man ever erase Lüthi, who is most devoted to you, from your mind; which is so far from being the case that I fear it, as it is very far from it.</p>
      <p>The day before the calends of October in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>H. Lüthi, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and vigilant chief pastor of the people of Zurich, his dear and most esteemed brother.</p>
