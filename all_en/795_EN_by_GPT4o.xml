      <p>Strasbourg, January 6, 1550.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Letters have just arrived from England for me, dearest Bullinger, which partly announce sad news, but mostly joyful news. The sad and mournful news is about the death of Paul Fagius, who recently, on November 23, passed away. The joyful news is this: among the chief counselors of England, two Christian men have now been elected, namely the Bishop of Ely and the Marquess of Dorset.</p>
      <p>Richard and his wife are well. Punishment has been executed on the leaders of the uprising. The rumors about the Protector are false and unfounded; for he has not yet been punished.</p>
      <p>There is also a rumor here about a new uprising in England, which is false. The messenger is waiting and does not allow me to write more. I have sent all your letters to England. In the future, please write as briefly as possible; for they are sent there not without great cost. However, whatever you write to Richard, I will gladly send at my own expense. Farewell. Share this with the English, who did not have the leisure to write.</p>
      <p>Yours, Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, my gracious lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
