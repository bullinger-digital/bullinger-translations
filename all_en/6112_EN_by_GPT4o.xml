      <p>The sacramental colloquium has long been concluded; it lasted for about 10 days.</p>
      <p>The proceedings were in German, so that the princes and nobles could better understand them. On the other side was Jakob Andreae; Brenz did not open his mouth, but used the other as a kind of legal representative, himself suggesting the plans and arguments. He indeed acted boldly and confidently, but I do not know how well and how piously; let those who will someday read the acts judge about it. Our Boquinus initially began to act in Latin; but because of the princes, the language was changed.</p>
      <p>Our Olevianus succeeded for two days, then Ursinus, a distinguished theologian among us, learned and pious, a disciple of Philipp, who concluded the colloquium with such gravity, authority, piety, and modesty, that even the adversaries were astonished and did not obscurely indicate that they feared this bear.</p>
      <p>He is the one who composed that book on the supper, which I gave to you. There were two main topics of the dispute: the supper and ubiquity.</p>
      <p>The adversaries preferred to first discuss that plausible majesty of the body of Christ; ours did not refuse.</p>
      <p>But they were so received and harassed by ours in this majestic field of theirs, that they did not want/want? to descend to the other on the supper. But since only one day was spent disputing the supper, they broke off the colloquium. I hope they do not have much occasion to boast; hence I think there is such silence from yours.</p>
      <p>May God grant them a better mind.</p>
