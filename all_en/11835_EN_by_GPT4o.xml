    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the letter [No. 1777], which he received in Frankfurt. The [Cologne] Reformation draft ["Simple Consideration"] has only been completed in German, but [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] wants to publish it simultaneously in both languages. Since the arrival of Emperor [Charles V], the pressure from the city of Cologne and its clergy on the bishop is increasing, and the Bishop of Münster [Franz von Waldeck] is also encountering resistance in Osnabrück and Münster - unlike in Minden; both need intercession. Three estates [of Electoral Cologne] support the bishop, but the eight priests of the [Cathedral] chapter have no interest in a reform and influence the clergy and council, who were also incited against the bishop by letters from Pope [Paul III]; the bishop is not willing to postpone the reform any longer, although the emperor tried to dissuade him from it three times and the imperial troops caused severe damage, which the commander, the Viceroy [of Sicily, Ferrante Gonzaga], regretted; the bishop continues to appoint suitable pastors. Bucer will send Bullinger the Reformation draft as soon as he has a printed copy at hand. He praises Bullinger's defense of the doctrine of the two natures in his commentary on John, which he has not yet seen. He asks him to let the dispute over the Lord's Supper rest; only with difficulty could Philipp [Melanchthon] and others prevent the Lutheran agitators from provoking new conflicts. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your very friendly letter in Frankfurt. I thank your charity for this act of Christian communion.</p>
      <p>The book of reformation, which the Archbishop of Cologne is working on, has indeed been printed in German, but not yet in Latin. However, the good old man wishes to publish the book in both languages simultaneously. The city and clergy of Cologne, who were previously too ferocious, now, with the emperor present, are fiercely and furiously opposing the bishop, a good old man, and his pious institution most impotently. The same is done against the Bishop of Münster by the chapter and the knightly order of Osnabrück and the chapter of Münster. For he is also working on a pious reformation in his dioceses, to which only Minden has consented. He holds three bishoprics, Münster, Minden, and Osnabrück. Therefore, I ask you to assist both bishops with your prayers, both privately and also publicly in your churches.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Cologne indeed has the consent of three estates of his province: the counts, the knightly order, and the towns; however, the fourth, that is, the chapter, as they call it, of Cologne, or rather its worse part, resists so much, relying on the Cologne senate and the patrons of antichristianism at the emperor's court, that the pious and salutary effort of the good prince is gravely hindered. The chapter has eight doctors, whom they call the seven priests, who are accustomed to perform the highest sacred rites.</p>
      <p>They are burdened with priesthoods, indeed with sacrileges, and are very experienced in evil practices, therefore they dread more than death the restoration of ecclesiastical matters. They have the rest of the pseudo-clergy and the rabble of monks, which you know how great it is, bound to them, and also the senate serving their women, whom the monks lead captive at their own discretion; the rest is Paul. Hence it happens that the other canons from the princes and counts, who would gladly follow the bishop's counsel, can achieve nothing. For the Pope does not fail in his own guilt, he has strengthened the senate and clergy with letters and incited them against the bishop. He calls him a mad heresiarch and urges the chapter to regard him in his endeavors as an enemy, not as an archbishop, a title he has made himself utterly unworthy of. The old man foresaw all these impediments; but since he has hitherto waited in vain for a way to be opened for the pious restoration of the sacred ministry from so many diets and promised synods, and the time for rendering an account of his administration is pressing upon him, he did not wish to delay his duty any longer, in which he is so fixed and proceeds, that he would rather leave not only the principality but also his life, than abandon it. The emperor insisted for the third time in Bonn that he should defer his plan until the council or the diets, or until the emperor himself had examined the reformation. An army of no less than forty thousand was present, besides immense impediments; the neighboring villages were plundered, more than thirty acres of vineyards were destroyed, and more severe threats were made against the bishop and other courtiers, unless the gospel was abandoned, although the emperor's chief commander, the Viceroy of Naples, confirmed that the plundering of the villages was done against his will, the vineyards were destroyed out of necessity to secure the camp, and that it grieved both the emperor and himself, whatever damage was inflicted on the bishop. But although it was quite apparent what most of the courtiers were aiming at, what they were seeking, the bishop nevertheless persisted in his purpose and replied to the emperor that he would so temper the matter of reformation that he hoped it would be approved by God, by him, and by the estates of the empire; for he would follow nothing but the word of God. The bishop replied that even if the emperor had twice as large an army present, he would never desert the gospel of Christ, which he had embraced. Therefore, he continues to appoint suitable teachers in the places of his dominion, who with doctrine, sacraments, and all other things administer in the church. When I have obtained printed copies of the Reformation, I will send you one. Everything is instituted according to the simplicity of the gospel, so that what is done in the church with words and signs may clearly and effectively preach and commend Christ alone and excite and confirm true repentance for sins and trust in grace.</p>
      <p>Regarding the mystery you defend in your commentaries on the two natures in Christ, you do well; I have not yet seen the book. I ask you, if it may be allowed with your permission, not to repeat the dispute over the Eucharist, which has already been treated in so many books, where it is not necessary, with words that reopen old wounds. It was achieved with difficulty through Dr. Philipp and some other good men that certain instigators of Luther did not provoke new conflicts. But too many things urge us to cultivate concord sacredly with all who invoke the name of Christ. I beseech you to take this little admonition in good part, which was expressed by a not unfounded concern for maintaining peace among us. I prescribe nothing but what you yourself recognize as pleasing to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with all your fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, September 26, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, M. Heinrich Bullinger, doctor and pastor of the church of Zurich, his esteemed fellow minister and dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
