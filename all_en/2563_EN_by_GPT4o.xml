      <p>Greetings, reverend father in Christ and lord, I ask you to be of a calm mind; for all your letters have been properly delivered to me, even if sometimes later than they should have been, due to the distance of the places and my frequent and excessively troublesome travels, which I do not doubt your kindness could understand from my last letters, which I wrote on July 13, if only they were delivered. I have four letters from your kindness, namely the first, dated November 10, 1553, and also the second, dated March 2, 1554, both of which I received together with a bundle of books in Lübeck on July 12, 1554, from the honest man Hanson Offo, a citizen of Lübeck and host of Justus Glaser at the Frankfurt fairs, to which I responded the next day quite extensively and took care to send letters to my relative Laurentius Egenolphus, brother of the printer Christoph, to be delivered to your Froshover in Frankfurt through Steffan Becht of Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>I wrote to the most serene king and faithfully transmitted all your works to Kolding, where the king was then in Funen, on the same day with the public messenger of the city. However, I received the third letter, dated August 24, 1554, on the first of November of the same year, to which I thought I had sufficiently responded in my previous writing, not doubting that it had been delivered. Now I have also received the fourth, dated October 4, 1554, which was delivered to me in Hamburg on February 18, 1555, when I had returned from Holland, from which I understand differently. Therefore, I respond again to all, that your works on the Grace of God, etc., were especially pleasing to the most serene king, mainly because you correct and expunge the errors of the brethren with utmost modesty and without insults and mockery (with which the books of our people are usually adorned as with flowers), teaching salutary things, and because you made no mention at all of the sacramentarian controversy, which is more hateful to him than I would have thought, being completely ensnared by the Lutheran doctrine on that matter, and he is said to have often remarked, as friends have reported: "If only they would write such and similar books for the benefit of the Church of Christ out of a desire to quarrel," etc. He will declare his munificence towards you when he sends his legates or dispensers to Strasbourg, about which I have no doubt at all, even if I have written according to your opinion that you seek nothing of the sort, but only the increase of evangelical truth. Therefore, it would seem against decorum to me to inquire more curiously, not to say more morosely, about the royal will towards you now, lest we seem to be secretly seeking something other than what we have both testified in writing. The king is long-suffering and does not quickly judge or can be persuaded to depart from a doctrine once received; but if the very truth is ever known to him, he also defends it most sacredly. Thus, in your books too, he did not immediately acquiesce in the commendation of one or another, but also wanted to hear the judgment of his theologians from Copenhagen, who gave a good testimony. Whatever books you sent me, I donated to other excellent men in your name, not because they were not most welcome to me (for which I give great thanks), but to win favor for you and yours among others, indeed, I also purchased more, as I could, for they are rarely brought to us, which I distributed among the good and learned, seeking nothing else than a fuller understanding of the truth among our people and a somewhat better reputation of your name. I hope it will happen that our people will be somewhat milder in the future than they have been towards the afflicted exiles of England, whose remarkable patience has pricked many with compassion and made even otherwise barbarous and fierce peoples somewhat tame. And Master Paulus Noviomagus, the royal preacher, also later excused himself to me, who once, in the presence of the king and a large church, while the exiles were present, declaimed most sharply against the Anabaptists and Schwärmer (by which new but commonly used Lutheran term most people understand you), saying that he had said nothing more hateful against the exiles, but only what the circumstances of the place, which he happened to be dealing with at the time, required. Although I could have refuted many things of his, I thought it better to wink and dissimulate many things (as the Apostle Paul did with Philip, not reproaching any injury, where he had also been beaten with rods), since it seemed to me that this other Paul, led by repentance for his deed, would one day become better, also persuading the king to better things, unless my simplicity deceives me and he plays the Proteus in courtly fashion. I happened to have with me at the time in Odense, a small town in Funen, where the king was, the books of the most learned man Peter Viret on the true ministry of the word of God, sacraments, and church, as well as the origin, continuation, use, authority, and excellence of the ministry of the word and sacraments, etc., which I was going to send to Doctor Machabaeus in Copenhagen. As soon as Paulus saw them, he immediately refused to return them for the offered price, and I willingly yielded to him, also giving him your books on the Grace of God, praying that he may profit greatly from their diligent reading; for it is very important that those who are frequently in the presence of kings and princes are rightly instructed in religion, especially if they are from sacred sermons.</p>
      <p>The judgments of many are held in suspense by Philipp Melanchthon and Johannes Brenz, most illustrious men, who, if they could be won over to the Lord by you through friendly letters, then there would be less trouble with the rest. It would be very beneficial (since little is achieved by apologies) for the pious learned to meet under some pious prince to settle the internal dissensions of doctrines, which are now not small in the churches, before they are brought to a general council to be laughed at by the whole world rather than heard, with the greatest danger to religion.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, you, most illustrious men, may humbly and tirelessly petition the most serene royal majesty with letters, to be concerned about a Christian meeting of the pious learned, as the illustrious Landgrave of Hesse and some other princes of the empire once were. And if you know any suitable reasons for this matter, you can also indicate them and persuade the royal preachers and doctors with friendly letters to solicit the same with us and promote it to the best of their ability, which you can do with Lord Chancellor Johann Friis, an excellently learned man (even if he is not a doctor), yet of great authority in the whole kingdom, as it seems to me, not entirely without fruit. For these are the most frequent among all courtiers with this king, also powerful in authority, especially if a question of doctrines arises. By attempting these and similar things, you will have enough occasion and argument to refresh your memory with the royal majesty and also to win friendship for yourselves among the learned of the Danish court and academy, indeed among all who are devoted to the peace of the church. And if you achieve little with them, your effort will not be entirely without its own fruit; for perhaps other princes will be stirred up by the Lord with a certain zeal in this matter when they hear that you are seeking the most honorable and just peace and concord of the churches.</p>
      <p>And indeed this is being attempted at Nyborg with the king at my instigation (when the reverend father and lord bishop of Zealand was present) by Doctor Johannes Machabaeus, and he replied to me that the king did not dislike the plan, but said that the emperor could hardly suffice for the expenses to be borne, the cause, as it seems, either not being understood legitimately or not sufficiently considered, perhaps also because it was proposed too coldly. But many princes and many cities would have to be solicited by the king in this matter, to whom his majesty would be most dear and revered; then the hands of many (as the German proverb has it: many hands make light work) would suffice to bear the burden.</p>
      <p>This would be a royal work and truly worthy of a Christian king and also to be celebrated in eternal memory. Nor should it be so much considered how great the expense will be if this is done, as how great the confusion of the pious will be if it is not done. For it would not be necessary for learned and pious men to meet with such expense and pomp and military noise as princes are accustomed to in imperial diets, nor would this be a general meeting of all nations as in councils, but only of those who wish to have reformed churches with us.</p>
      <p>For you were once at Marburg without an intolerable expense of costs either for the princes or for yourselves.</p>
      <p>And I do not doubt that you are still willing to undertake a more difficult condition of travel, so that if our people are reluctant to come to you, you would not refuse to come to ours under the Elector Augustus or another convenient place, provided safe conduct is given and confirmed.</p>
      <p>For what was tolerable for the Landgrave (who will not deny his assistance even now), how could it be intolerable for the Elector Augustus, not to mention the king? especially in this matter with the comparison of many. For any magistrate could bear the expenses of his own people, if he would spend even half for the poor Christ, as he is accustomed to spend on things of little use.</p>
      <p>As for what you wrote in your last letter that you would prefer any grace that might be hoped for from your vigils to be converted to my benefit, otherwise you would perhaps take care of your own through another, etc., I have much gratitude for your generosity. But in this, you seem to me to estimate me according to the ingenuity of other merchants, greatly erring; for I seek nothing of the sort, and may God grant that if I have received even a single obol in this way, it may not benefit me otherwise than the gold of Toulouse or the gifts of Naaman the Syrian prince to the servant of Elisha. I have now bid farewell to the burdensome and unhappy trade, intending to devote the rest of my life to the studies of piety and awaiting the Lord's calling. Therefore, persuade yourself of better things about me and fare well in the Lord as best as possible. Doctor Johannes Machabaeus, Master Paulus Noviomagus, and Master Heinrich von Duisburg, royal preachers, greet you and your fellow believers and friends through me, as well as Doctor Peter Capitaneus and Doctor Cornelius Hamsfort, royal doctors, who commended your works together with the theologians to the king.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the most illustrious man Doctor Conrad Gesner is especially greeted by Doctor Christian Morsianus, who knows him, and then also by the royal doctors. I send you the image of the king and the arms or insignia to be prefixed or appended to your book translated into German, if you wish (for such things are loved by princes), which I think will not be displeasing to the king, so that he may also judge of the matter and your vigils by his own ingenuity without the suffrages of others. It is not worth the effort to mention our very small gift so often; I seek or desire nothing from you except that you pray for me in your churches to the Lord, that he may increase me in faith and the gifts of his spirit, so that I may finally at least designate worthy fruits of repentance and say with the holy Simeon in the concordant church of the saints: "Now, Lord, you let your servant depart in peace," etc.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, if your kindness has even a little leisure left, I would very much like to be informed by it through letters (provided my question is not too rude and unlearned), what is the certain and legitimate difference between spirit and soul, of which frequent mention is made in the Psalms and the whole scripture; for they do not always seem to be taken for the same thing, as is now commonly interpreted, since both the Paraphrast and in Romans say, as the body lives by its spirit, so the soul lives by its spirit, etc., nor does this interpretation seem suitable everywhere, which your kindness brings in the end of the first epistle to the Thessalonians. I have no news to report except sad news, if it is true, namely that the noble and excellent man Lord Johann von Lasco, to whom the Lord had granted a little rest with his people in East Frisia, is again ordered to seek new places because of the fear of the Burgundians. If you love him (as you certainly do), take care, if you can, that he may find a place of refuge either in Strasbourg or with you, if necessary.</p>
      <p>I wanted to visit him and his pious and faithful fellow believer Martin Micronius when returning from Holland, but due to the harshness of winter, I could not come to Emden because of the ice. May the Lord protect him and his people under the shadow of his wings. I do not doubt that the same will happen to those who have gone to Frankfurt to my relatives; for the world cannot bear those who have wholly and sincerely bound themselves to Christ in true religion.</p>
      <p>Learn other news from others, and fare well in the Lord with all yours. Amen. Given in Lübeck on February 22, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your devoted client, Baptist Johannes Wisamer, has subscribed.</p>
      <p>The names of the professors in Copenhagen are as follows, in case you might want to write to some of them or at least greet some in your letters for the sake of winning friendship:</p>
      <p>In theology: Reverend father and lord Doctor Peter Palladius, bishop of Zealand, Doctor Johannes Machabaeus, ordinary lecturer, especially a friend to you.</p>
      <p>In medicine: Doctor Christernius Morsianus, ordinary lecturer. Doctor Peter Capitaneus, also a royal doctor.</p>
      <p>In law: Doctor Albertus Knopperus.</p>
      <p>In the arts: Master Nicolaus Hemmingius, also a student of theology; Master Johannes Schilderup, physicist; Master Johannes Albertus, dialectician; Master Peter Parvus, rhetorician; Master Erasmus Laetus, poet; Master Johannes Monasteriensis, professor of the Greek language.</p>
      <p>Greet the friends in my name, commending myself to them greatly. What follows, a friend sent from Wittenberg.</p>
      <p>Idyll on Philomela.</p>
      <p>It was spring and, meditating lightly, I was walking by the Elbe, The mouth makes sweet sounds, which Philomela sings.</p>
      <p>As much as she excels the others in the modulation of her voice, In comparison to the others, she is usually smaller.</p>
      <p>She sits, consoled by her song, through sleepless labor, And praises God on the pleasant green branch.</p>
      <p>And as the charm of her voice begins to soothe the mind, I marvel at the clear and guileless sounds.</p>
      <p>Behold, the ugly birds made noise with their beaks, And the shrill crowd stirred my stomach.</p>
      <p>The wandering cuckoo challenges her with a contest of tongues, Illyricus Pouring out flaccid words in delirious modes.</p>
      <p>His thorn usually generates hoarse cicadas, Westphalian with his own.</p>
      <p>When he pollutes the leaves with unclean marks.</p>
      <p>The Gallic joins as a companion with a strident song, The Gallic of Regensburg.</p>
      <p>A bird indeed disturbing the peaceful quiet of the grove.</p>
      <p>And from afar, he lifts himself as an innocent enemy with wings, And when he cannot by art, he wishes to harm by war.</p>
      <p>The Hoopoe also contributes its own unclean strength, Stancarus.</p>
      <p>The Hoopoe always smelling of its own filth.</p>
      <p>Hence the Blackbird drives hot minds into quarrels, Amstorfius With his black heart, with his proud voice.</p>
      <p>You too, raging with your voice, send out a clangor, Osyna, Osiander.</p>
      <p>Who inhabits the streams sown with many fish. Who had hope for me to mend the ruin of peace, Sarcerius.</p>
      <p>Who rejoice in not tearing with their own flock: Now they burst forth hidden volumes in the middle of the circus, The crowd loves quarrels made by great men.</p>
      <p>Nor does Philomela differ with her modulating tongue, But spreads the news with a varied sound.</p>
      <p>And overcomes adverse evils with a pious heart, Loving peace, she will be despised by the common judge.</p>
      <p>While I see such things, the spectacles are completed with song, I speak. O bird, who alone pleases me, What thanks shall I pay you for such a song?</p>
      <p>May the gods protect your limbs from birdlime and snares. I will always follow you with my life, to you, lacking light, We stretch these ears. The rest of the crowd, farewell.</p>
      <p>Whom your wondrous voice does not hold with its art, To him, let the cuckoo count long times with its sound.</p>
      <p>There will be a time when the rapid dog excites the heat, Then fearing the fire, he will cover his limbs with bark.</p>
      <p>Foolish things captivate light minds, each has his own desire, Midas rejoices to have a wineskin instead of a lyre.</p>
