      <p>Greetings. Today we received your letter of piety through this messenger of yours and immediately sent the one that was owed to Mr. Steiger to him in the council and also reminded him of those things contained in my letters. He proposed to the council what seemed appropriate to him. The council writes back to yours; however, it does not seem advisable to our people to summon the cities to Aargau, but rather to wait for that common assembly that has been announced, and to entrust nothing else to the delegates except to listen and report back to their own what they have heard. From there, other assemblies will have to be announced, and the matter will be prolonged somewhat; meanwhile, many other things can be learned that perhaps are still unknown. What they are going to propose, I wrote to you yesterday through another courier who is returning to Geneva. However, the lord consul advises that you at least ensure that the people of Schaffhausen respond in the same way; our people will ensure that those in Basel are of the same opinion. Meanwhile, our people are preparing diligently, about which I wrote a few things to my brother, which, however, I would not want to be known to everyone. If only greater repentance and more fervent prayers would come, I would still have good hope in the Lord's goodness.</p>
      <p>In France, we hear that there are great rivalries and hatreds among the nobility, even among the papists. What if Abimelech and the Shechemites were to rise against each other? With Beza, I still think nothing should be done, lest he harm the good men from whom I have this information; he also harms himself and his own greatly with these words, so that our people are much more reluctant to contribute.</p>
      <p>I wrote about the rest yesterday and some other things today to my brother. Friends and all brothers, especially Steiger, greet you in return, for whom I am almost a scribe to you in this matter.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 21, 1572.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>I am returning the excerpt from the jubilee bull; we have a complete copy of it.</p>
      <p>Dear godfather, I am sending you here these ears or mountain hens for the good year. I should show myself grateful to you in many ways; yet I do not know with what. You want to be satisfied with this for now. Mr. Steiger's wine has not yet arrived; I hope he will do his best; I will help with that as much as I can.</p>
      <p>Greet for me the old Mr. Tr√ºb and his son, your son-in-law, and all your other relatives.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
