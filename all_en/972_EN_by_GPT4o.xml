      <p>From Augsburg:</p>
      <p>On July 5th, His Royal Majesty rode into Augsburg, and on July 8th, His Imperial Majesty, along with His Majesty's son, the prince, and a Moorish king with a great many people, with whom the poor man is heavily burdened, followed.</p>
      <p>The other electors and princes have gathered very slowly, so that it was believed that the majority would stay away; however, a good number have come. Some have excused their absence due to the threat of war in their lands.</p>
      <p>The old Elector of Saxony was also brought to Augsburg on a wagon under 300 arquebusiers, Spaniards, on July 8th, and is staying in his old quarters, with no more than 20 people of his old court staff with him. All bishops and princes wanted to plead for him to be released from all matters and reinstated if he would show himself willing; but he is steadfast in all matters, not budging an inch. May the Lord God confirm him in all good things. Amen.</p>
      <p>The Word of God is still preached in Augsburg as before; in the six parishes, preaching occurs daily. Additionally, His Royal Majesty also has his preacher at St. Catherine's every Sunday; he preaches without scolding, also without inciting against abuses, but remains (as the wise say) by the Word of God above all others. Otherwise, there are two monks, one in the chapter, the other at St. Moritz, who are very vehement in scolding and flattering the Lutherans; they are allowed to speak thus, etc. The common man desires nothing more than that the Word of God may remain as it is now taught; it is not known how God will arrange it.</p>
      <p>The following nine articles of His Imperial Majesty's proposition, which are then to be stately deliberated by the estates of the realm and then presented again to His Imperial Majesty for approval, were presented on July 26th. I have only been able to obtain the summaries of the presentation; I will write further later:</p>
      <p>The first article is about the council, which is to be held in Trent annually without any delay.</p>
      <p>The second is about the Interim, which was previously approved by the electors and princes, as well as other estates of the realm, but was not adhered to by either the clergy or the laity.</p>
      <p>The third concerns the reformation, which has been equally little lived by.</p>
      <p>The fourth is about the restitution of ecclesiastical goods. The fifth about the peace of the land.</p>
      <p>The sixth about the chamber court; His Majesty would like to have it maintained by all estates for life and not be changed at all, etc.</p>
      <p>The seventh about the session of the estates of the realm. The eighth about the empire's contributions, etc.</p>
      <p>The ninth about the minting regulations.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there are wondrously strange things present, and there is much work at the distaff, with great concern that much Christian blood will be shed before it is spun out. May the Lord God come to the comfort and help of His own. Dated Augsburg, July 27th.</p>
