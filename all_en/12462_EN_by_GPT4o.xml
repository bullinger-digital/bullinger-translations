    <p xml:id="regest1">Gerhard Westerburg delivered Bullinger's letter from August 1st [not received] around November 11th [1545], which clearly expresses Bullinger's friendly disposition towards thom Camph and the brothers he recommended [Gerhard Westerburg and Jan Mączyński]. As long as thom Camph lives, he wants to remain faithful to the truth and the [Zürichers], even if he would be oppressed because of it. Gerhard Westerburg, who is also a defender of the truth and the [Zürichers], has already had to endure a lot because of this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Johannes] a Lasco responded [on June 23, 1545] to [Martin] Bucer's long letter [from April 16, 1545] about the Lord's Supper. A Lasco communicated this to thom Camph in writing. May God forgive [Bucer], especially since he allowed himself to be tossed about by the wind in that doctrinal matter (to speak with Paul). After Luther's death, better things are to be expected. Since Luther fearlessly proclaimed God's grace and Christ to the world, God will have forgiven him for placing a straw roof on the foundation, which is Christ, being misled by the golden color of the straw. It is now hoped that with the help of the Zürichers, a roof made of gold can be erected that will withstand all attacks. So much for Bullinger's letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Regarding thom Camph's journey, his homeland [Friesland], and the [local] church, the following is reported: [Samuel], the son of [Konrad] Pellikan, will have reported on the journey to [Friesland]. He was accompanied by thom Camph's brother [Bernhard] to Frankfurt and entrusted there to [Christoph Froschauer]. Thom Camph himself had to hastily go to Paris, as it was learned at that time that [Enno Cirksena of Emden], a very good childhood friend, had died in Paris. Thom Camph had traveled to Germany with [Enno]; he had also lived with him for a time in Strasbourg. When thom Camph, with a companion met on the way, reached Paris, he learned that [Enno] had died six weeks earlier. He can hardly describe his grief over the loss of the virtuous and educated friend. [Enno] was blood-related to the Frisian counts and had already been appointed city prefect of [Emden]. He was the only son of [Gebbeke, née Verdeyne]. In Paris, he remained steadfast in his faith in Christ until the end and wanted nothing to do with the priest called to his bedside [...]. When [Enno's] fellow student, Josua Wyttenbach of Biel, returned to the dying man, he sent the priest away. And when [Enno] was asked if he wanted to remain in the true faith, he nodded continuously (for he could no longer speak). Thom Camph, who spent eight days in Paris, befriended Wyttenbach, who sent greetings to Bullinger. Wyttenbach had traveled with [Enno] from Strasbourg to Paris. Perhaps Bullinger will remember the deceased. His name was Enno, and he had a beard. Together with the Freiburg lecturer [Joachim] Mynsinger and [Wyttenbach], he had visited Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- From [Paris], thom Camph returned home well before November 11th [1545]. Although he fell ill with a fever afterward, he is now healthy again. He has already been called to church service several times. Yet each time it seemed to him that he was not up to the offer made to him, and that it did not come from God. However, should he receive a call in accordance with God's word, he would not fail to serve the church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The [Frisian] church is beset from all sides; Emperor [Charles V] threatens it. Even the authorities [of Friesland] fear the Emperor so much that they do not dare to come to the church's aid. Meanwhile, the sects and the "Epicureans" are thriving. A Lasco had to resign his position as superintendent because he could achieve nothing with the magistrate and did not want to expose the religion to ridicule. But as long as he is not expelled, he will continue to serve as a faithful pastor in Emden.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The bishops of Münster [Franz von Waldeck] and Cologne [Hermann von Wied] insist on their [reformation] plans. [Hermann von Wied] has already been excommunicated by Pope [Paul III], and it is expected that the Emperor will impose the imperial ban on him. And even though the coadjutor [Adolf von Schaumburg] does everything to persuade [von Wied] to resign, he is not intimidated and rather seeks the support of all the princes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Thom Camph's uncle [Johannes Schröder Mellinckhus], dean of Osnabrück and advisor to [Franz von Waldeck], sends greetings to Bullinger. He owns his commentaries on the [Pauline and canonical] letters, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Gospel of John. Greetings to [Anna, née Adlischwyler], to the whole family, and to the [colleagues]. Thom Camph commends himself to the prayers [of the Zürichers].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace in the Holy Spirit, as well as integrity of life, I wish for you, my dearest brother in Christ, from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, the only mediator and high priest seated at the right hand of the Father, to whom be praise and dominion forever. Amen. Your letters, written on August 1st, were delivered to me by Doctor Gerhard Westerburg, which were indeed very pleasing to me, because they were sent by a most learned man and a brother most dear to me, and they revealed your pious and humane spirit not only towards me but also towards the brothers I recommended; for these services, I consider and determine how much I owe you better within myself than I could ever express in words or even demonstrate in action. And if I can do nothing else, I will at least bear a grateful spirit towards you and yours, as long as I live by the grace of God. But if I cannot compete with you in benefits, I will not allow myself to be surpassed in mutual love; indeed, I cannot keep silent about this love to others, although for this reason I am rendered odious and suspect to many. I am not ashamed of you and the truth, to which I will adhere, God willing, as long as I breathe and hope; and it will remain with us, although many now try to oppress it. May you consider my spirit towards you as fair and good in the present! Doctor Gerard Westerburg is also an excellent herald of your praises and the truth, and as you know, he has endured much for this reason.</p>

      <p>You would hardly believe how steadfastly Lord a Lasco fights for the truth everywhere. He is now responding to Bucer's very long letter about the matter of the Lord's Supper. May the Lord forgive him for the inconsistency you write about in the word of the Lord. Paul says not to be tossed about by every wind of doctrine through the cunning of men. May the Lord prevent scandals among his elect! But now I hope the truth will fare better after Luther's death, which was oppressed in this part by Luther's excessive authority and prejudice; I do not doubt that this weakness has been forgiven him by Christ (whom he diligently preached and revealed again to the world). For he has concluded all under sin, that he might have mercy on all, and according to Paul's doctrine, whoever has reserved the foundation of Christ, even if he has built straw upon it, will nevertheless be saved as through fire. Therefore, since he not only had the foundation of Christ but also purified it and built upon it gold and silver, he undoubtedly now enjoys the closest fellowship with Christ. And in the meantime, I also hope that the straw, with which he wanted to cover the excellent building and structure, deceived by the color of gold thinking it to be gold, will be revealed and burned on the day of the Lord, and that the remaining work will be covered again with a golden roof by you, the co-workers of the same building, which will remain against all temptations, so that the building may persist whole and not collapse again due to the fault of the roof. This in response to your letter.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, regarding my journey, the state of the homeland and the churches with us, as well as the condition of my affairs, you may have these few things. First, I returned safe and sound from you to my homeland, as our journey was better narrated to you by Pellican's son than I could write. When I parted from Pellican's son, whom I sent back to Frankfurt with my brother, I was unexpectedly traveling to France towards Paris with as much haste as I could. For from an unexpected and uncertain report, a rumor was brought that my comrade, my dearest fellow citizen and neighbor, with whom I had devoted myself to letters from childhood and who had traveled with me to Germany and lived with me in Strasbourg, had died in Paris. Therefore, to learn about the affairs of my most integral friend, I was traveling there, and after I reached Paris with the best company I met on the way, I learned that my best friend had passed away six weeks earlier. Hence, I cannot write how great a grief arose in me, partly for my homeland, partly for my own sake. For besides being uniquely devoted to me and very dear to me, I grieve for the singular virtues that shone in him, taken from us, friends, and the homeland. For besides his erudition, he was endowed with a truly heroic spirit, so that everyone predicted something singular about him; then a lover and defender of truth and good men, against injustice and all flatterers a hater and enemy. Therefore, since he was blood-related to our comrades and had already obtained the provostship and was elected prefect of our city, what do you think he would have been able to do for the church and the homeland! Finally, he was the only son of his mother. Therefore, I was not grieving in vain and still grieve when I remember him and our sins, for which we deserved this. I rejoice again and congratulate him on this supreme happiness, that he died with true faith in Christ and a worthy confession of a Christian man, and exchanged this fragile and trouble-filled life for eternal life and eternal happiness. For he remained in the faith of Christ, whom he knew excellently, until the end and did not want any monks or priests to be summoned to him with great danger. Indeed, when they were already bringing a priest to the dying man, he turned to the wall; and when his comrades, who knew his mind excellently, returned, he sent the priest away again and, when they asked him if he wanted to persist in the true faith he had professed until then, since he could not speak, he nodded most constantly. Of which Joshua Wyttenbach, a Swiss from Biel, was a witness to me, who had traveled with him from Strasbourg to Paris, also lived together and was an inseparable companion to the dying man; who sends you many greetings. I stayed with him in the same inn for eight days, and we began to love each other mutually as brothers. You too, unless you forget, will know the deceased friend. He was with you together with Doctor Mynsinger, the lecturer from Freiburg, and another, shortly before I came to you. The young man was bearded, named Enno.</p>

      <p>From there, therefore, with God's guidance, I returned safe and sound to my homeland before Martin's Day. In the meantime, I suffered from a fever, but by God's benevolence, I was restored to my former health. I am well and live in the same state as before. I have been called once and again to the ministry of the church, but since I do not judge myself equal to it nor gather that this calling is divine from the word of the Lord, I have not yet obeyed it. However, I will not fail the church when I understand that I am called by God from the word of the Lord. You should pray to God the Father through Jesus Christ for me, that he may always be willing to be present with me by his Spirit and to complete in me, for the glory of his name and the edification of the church, what he has begun in me for his goodness because of his Son.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Pray also for our church, that the Lord may be willing to be present with his afflicted church. It is beset from all sides by waves. The Emperor threatens us. Our own authorities, who have the administration of affairs, fear the Emperor so much that they do not dare to come to the church's aid. Meanwhile, sects and Epicureans are growing, who also cause enough trouble for the church of God. Lord Johannes a Lasco has renounced the office of superintendent because he could achieve nothing with the magistrate, nor did he want to expose God's office to ridicule, nor could he allow hypocrites and evil men to preside over the church under his name. Nevertheless, he acts as a faithful pastor of the church in Emden. He will not abandon it until he sees himself deserted or expelled by the church; may the Lord avert this! He corrects what he can, having left the magistrate; for he judges that God must be obeyed rather than men.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>There is no news to write except that the Bishop of Münster and the Bishop of Cologne insist on their purpose. The Bishop of Cologne has already been excommunicated by the Pope, and execution has been entrusted to the Emperor. The coadjutor does what he can to persuade him to resign, but he neither wants to resign nor leave unless he is expelled, and in the meantime, he seeks the support of all the princes. May the Lord be with him and prolong the life of the old man. May you remember these things in your public and private prayers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>My uncle, the dean among the Osnabrückers and advisor to the Bishop of Münster, who knows you well from your books, sends you unique greetings. He has your commentaries on all the letters, on the Acts of the Apostles, and on John. Greet your most honorable wife in my name, along with the whole family, to whom I wish well, and then all the brothers who know me. May the Lord Jesus keep you all safe in his church for a long time. Commend me, a most miserable sinner, to your pious and ardent prayers. I am mindful of you before the Lord. Do not cease to pursue me with love, unworthy as I am. I will love you, God willing, as long as I live. Forgive, if anything is amiss, the haste.</p>
      <p>Osnabrück, April 7th, in the year of Christ 1546. Gerardus zum Camph, your friend and brother from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop of the church of Zürich, his friend and brother most worthy of respect.</p>
