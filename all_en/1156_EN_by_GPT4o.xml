      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I pray for a happy and prosperous year for you and yours, and for the growth of the Christian faith. Amen. My wife received a gift sent by your wife; if you intend to continue in this manner of exchanging favors, I will become a rich and distinguished merchant, to whom fortune will soon grant immense wealth; but I will cease to burden you further, lest I bring more weight than benefit.</p>
      <p>I have taken care of the letters, and I will also diligently take care of the remaining ones, having found a most faithful courier to whom the letters can be safely entrusted.</p>
      <p>You will receive news from Lord Schertlin and all the details about his condition. Advise him diligently; for he gave me letters to read, in which he advises his king on various matters currently being handled by the monarchs.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I delivered your letters to Mr. Myconius, who is gravely ill and could not read them, nor did I wish to open them. May the Lord assist him with His grace. It is remarkable that while he is ill, all matters affecting our church overwhelm us most abundantly. But more on this in due time.</p>
      <p>They say the maritime cities have 24,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry in arms, with many war instruments. May the Lord grant them strong hands, stronger hearts, and the principal spirit of the Lord, so that they may resist all the enemies of Christ, even though I am greatly terrified by how Christ does not wish to plant His gospel through arms, but through blood. Nevertheless, I hope the Lord will eventually look upon His people, most miserably afflicted and oppressed by the Roman beast.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 17, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your [Gastius].</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, his ever-honored teacher.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
