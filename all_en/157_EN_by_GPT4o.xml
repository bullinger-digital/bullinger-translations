      <p>Much grace and comfort from God through our Savior Jesus Christ. Dear lord and brother, I have received your friendly, heartfelt, and brotherly letter and thank my God, who has comforted me so well in body and soul through your service. Know that I will not abandon the churches entrusted to me with a good conscience; but if it should be otherwise, I will hold on to your comfort. What you advise about the ministry and the nature of the sacraments, you do as a brother. I have the opinion of the churches both understood and appreciated; this will be testified by my excerpts, which were proposed to me to be copied almost a decade ago. But if it is not seen otherwise by the Lord, than that it is necessary to flee to you, I will discuss these matters with you not without the joy of your spirit. Therefore, my Bullinger, there is no reason for you to doubt anything about the sincerity of my spirit. Enough about this. The affairs of the churches in Augsburg are in great danger. The printer Froschauer will explain this to you in person. The emperor wants us not only to refrain from criticizing the Interim, but also to present it to the churches as praiseworthy and beneficial to the people and to confirm it. And if he insists on this, I know I cannot accept it with a good conscience. What the imperial envoy, located in Baden, discussed in Augsburg with our mayor Balthasar Funck, the bearer of this letter will surely know. I remain with my old warning. Nothing more, than remain my old faithful friend as before and pray to God for me.</p>
      <p>I am to greet you a thousand times from my dear collaborator Bartholomeus Bertlin. My dear wife also greets you along with your spouse. Remain entrusted to God and the word of His grace always.</p>
      <p>Given on June 13, 1548, in Memmingen.</p>
      <p>Yours truly.</p>
      <p>To the dear lord and brother M. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful servant of the church in Zurich, in his own hand.</p>
