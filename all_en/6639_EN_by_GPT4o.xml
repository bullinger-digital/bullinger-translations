      <p>[...] the pope is certainly dead, not without suspicion of poison, on December 9, 1565. It is said that he left some barrels of gold to several cardinals in his will, and furthermore, he bequeathed a considerable sum to his own, whom he called to him as he was dying. Immediately after the pope's death, the Cardinal of Emden was stabbed with all his family... Three suns were seen in the Duchy of Milan on December 7. I think they should be considered among themselves."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Alps were closed due to snow. People here are transporting the snow out of the city on sleds and wagons; otherwise, no one can travel, riding is difficult... - The bishop's affair will be dealt with again on St. Paul's Day. The government in Innsbruck writes to the monastery amicably (they are trembling because of the fear of the Turks, who are said to be preparing three fleets); acknowledging that they have done nothing with the arrest, as they have been repeatedly requested by the canons. Now, however, the canons have just given the monastery a sealed confession, stating that they have not written to the government in Innsbruck about these matters, and it is now and previously found to be manifold, with which they are dealing. Chur, January 5, 1566.</p>
      <p>Nothing is more certain than the death of the pope. - With these letters written, a trusted person shows me how Mr. Batt is supposed to send an excommunication to our bishop, which he has already handed over, but the bishop has not yet been answered, etc. - Furthermore, it is known that the abbot of Pf√§fers was here these days and behaved very arrogantly and at night around 12, together with his three men, came to the bishop's castle and knocked very violently, and the bishop had to be woken up, where he said he must still see him before he leaves the castle, and spoke many defiant words and among other things, for the second time, referred to his Swiss days, item repeatedly threatened that the five places would drive him out of the castle within a month with armed hand; for they intend to install Mr. Batt with the sword. Finally, he became very drunk (as he was accustomed to drinking more) and spent the night in bed, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
