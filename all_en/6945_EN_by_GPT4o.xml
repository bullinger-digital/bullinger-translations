      <p>God be with you all. Dearly beloved son, I have received your sent memorials, and if you still have them with you, as you have listed on the note, then it is right, and I lack nothing more from the grace of God. Whatever else you lack, let me know, and it shall be provided to you. In the Acts, I have nothing beyond the first two letters; I wonder where everything has gone. Let me know which letters you have, etc. You did not write to me further about the cost of the salmon that was given to the lord; for I do not want you to suffer the loss because you did not mention it. By God's grace, things are well with us now; but Heinrich gave us a fright, for he is very ill. Doctor Wolff says it is the beginning of the plague; but by God's grace, he is now well again, and he is completely recovered. Our Josua's Hans Jacob also took to bed the day before yesterday; but I hope he is as he was before. Ulrichli and Niklaus in Josua's house were also very ill, but have recovered. Otherwise, it is very quiet. May God grant us His blessing and preserve you and your household. Greet Susanna and Elisabeth for us, the servants, Bryda, the in-laws, and your brother-in-law Vogt in Rinow. All our people greet you.</p>
      <p>Dated Tuesday after Martin's Day 1566.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>I have now opened the spleen veins on Saturday; it has become somewhat milder, but I am not yet completely free of it. May God do according to His will. Michel Schwytzer in the peat has taken to bed, is very ill. Also, Mr. Hans Rudolf Stumpf in Kilchberg; but he is improving. The good, pious Waser, the barber in Niederdorf, has also died these days; it is a great loss, etc.</p>
      <p>To my dearly beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, preacher in Berg.</p>
