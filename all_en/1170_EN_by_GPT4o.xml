      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote to your piety, most esteemed and dearest brother Calvin, through Galeatius of Milan. I have no doubt that my letters have reached you. Meanwhile, I received letters from England from the most distinguished man, Mr. John a Lasco, a man most devoted to you and very friendly to us. [Letters dated London, January 7]. I gather briefly what he writes. He approves of our Consensus and hopes that more will subscribe to it daily. He adds that by the grace of God and the most serene king, a German and French church has been established in London, with temples given to them, two ministers assigned to each, and now even an Italian church is being established. They also record in a catalog those who subscribe to their confession of faith. He sent us several copies of the confession, and among other things, he writes verbatim: I am sending you several copies of our confession so that you may be acquainted with the reasons for our doctrine.</p>
      <p>However, I wish that one copy be sent to our Mr. Calvin from you, to whom we otherwise wish all our matters to be approved, and that his ministry here be commended to the Lord in prayer. This he says: and with his own hand, he inscribed your name in the book destined for you. The same again: We have already felt the efforts of Satan trying to disturb our institution from all sides, so much so that the matter almost looked towards a schism of the churches. But the Lord has now somewhat restrained his fury, and we hope for better things in the future. This he says. We approve of everything in this booklet: however, we would wish that what was inserted about the private use of the sacrament be omitted, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we will now try to have our Consensus printed here. So if it seems convenient to you, make sure it is also printed with you. For we do not think that our printer will deny us his service here.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, we have nothing else, except that the Emperor and his people are dealing with nothing but wars. It is uncertain whom he will attack. Some think he will descend through Austria into Hungary, others into Piedmont. I do not think he will involve himself in a new war with the Danish and Saxon wars not yet finished. There are more rumors about him than I can or wish to write. You have enough certain information, I believe, from Mr. Jacob of Burgundy, to whom I ask you to commend me.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Zurich, February 4, 1551. All the brothers greet you. Greet for us the brothers, especially Mr. Farel, Gallas, and all others.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. John Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his venerable lord and dearest brother in Christ. Geneva.</p>
