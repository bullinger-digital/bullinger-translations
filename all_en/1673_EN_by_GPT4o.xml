      <p>Having been informed by Johannes Byrkmann that couriers are being sent there, I immediately wrote this something or other. First, I cannot quite figure out what has distracted you from the duty of writing to the prince and has so long delayed you from remembering your most friendly acquaintances. For how can I persuade myself that the letters from our prince's court have not been delivered to you, when I know that I have copied them not just once or twice, but six times, and have given them to no one whose name was not well known to you, and even the couriers themselves had benefits and profits in delivering the letters. But perhaps they were sent by you, but were either neglected, opened, or entirely intercepted on the way. If that is the case, I would like your dignity to see to whom you entrusted them to be delivered to us. Certainly, we have not heard a word from you for an interval of six months; it is so far from us receiving any letters. Therefore, I am tormented and complain miserably, yet I do not have enough clarity about whom to complain. Your constant dedication to me and your judgment in all matters make me think that nothing is done by you either rashly or unjustly.</p>
      <p>Again, such unusual and prolonged silence, especially in such significant matters of writing to princely men, greatly pricks and distresses my mind, lest something more serious has happened either to you, so that you cannot write, or to our affairs, so that you do not wish to at all. The Duke of Northumberland is eager to fulfill and satisfy all his expectations of you and your promise; my prince has long begun to wonder greatly that he receives no response from you, especially from a man so eloquent and always diligent in writing. Therefore, for the sake of your honor and my faith, I would like you to write to those princely men as soon and as diligently as possible; indeed, good men will not at all allow me to excuse you further. I ask you as much as I can that you do this. Here, Peter Martyr wishes to send you many greetings from me. Farewell, most learned and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Oxford, July 7, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your disciple and most constant son in Christ, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
