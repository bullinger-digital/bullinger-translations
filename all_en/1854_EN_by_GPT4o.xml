      <p>S. We are finally sending you those decisions of ours, about which we have written to you before. All the brothers ask you to kindly read them, and not only that, but also to correct, change, and act in all these matters as befits a father. For we recognize and readily accept you as more perceptive than us and to whom the Lord has given far greater wisdom than to many others. Do not believe that we have established more decrees than necessary, or that many things have been set out more elaborately or curiously than needed. Know that we have often been tempted by visitors, especially by some Italians who are very particular, who are pleased with almost nothing unless it is rare or at least deviates from common use or certainly originated from themselves. They are closer to us than to you, and we have to deal with them daily, indeed often have to contend with them, even if we do not speak of everything. For we know some Italians who are also sound in faith, quiet, and tranquil; but here we complain about disturbed minds. They all confess to believing whatever is contained in the Holy Scriptures, so much so that you would say there is no need for these decrees or any other clearer words. But when examined more accurately and attentively, they are found to be either completely troublesome and absurd or infected with pestilent doctrines, continually spewing out some absurd and horrendous paradoxes, minds reeking of corruption and distortion. One does not want to confess the Holy Trinity; another does not dare to affirm that Christ is God equal to the Father. This one affirms that we are saved by the grace of God, therefore there was no need for Christ's descent to earth for us nor for his body and blood, since the whole work of our salvation is to be ascribed to the grace of God alone; another, distinguishing more acutely, says that we are not saved by the body of Christ suffering for us, but by the pain he felt in the body.</p>
      <p>Some constantly affirm that evil and wickedness come from God himself, the source of all, and that God himself rejoices in wicked deeds no less than in good ones and those done with virtue and goodness, which they argue and dispute everywhere. Some mouths speak of nothing but predestination; this one is saved, even if he does all evil, while that one cannot but be damned, no matter what he believes or even if he does all good. There have been those who said there is no hell, even if punishments are established for the wicked, and that there is no one in heaven except that thief mentioned in the Gospel of Luke.</p>
      <p>It did not shame a certain Calabrian to dispute such things in public at a convened assembly in Engadin. There are not lacking today among those who are preachers who reluctantly accept the Lord's Day; there are those who vehemently abhor our articles on baptism and do not want to accept them. Certainly, they cannot be brought by us to use the form of baptism that we or you use in your church; but each of them has his own way of baptizing, which he follows to the great scandal of the laity, as they say. Some do not want to be in our fellowship and chapter, lest they seem to accept our faith and these decisions. We also have among us preachers who have never seen any school and know nothing in good letters except to read in Italian, and they do not understand a word of Latin or German.</p>
      <p>Those who favor them shout that the apostles were also unlearned and ignorant, as Luke testifies in the Acts of the Apostles, and that the spirit is required for one to teach well, not the letter, which the apostle says kills. And not to go through everything: you can hardly believe how each one coming to us brings something new with him to commend and make himself conspicuous, and almost each one offers us his own confession, which we should approve and accept, sometimes written in new, ambiguous, captious words and generally not sufficiently trustworthy. Therefore, since such people have often come to us, it seemed good to write down our faith and decrees briefly, so that those who come to us from elsewhere may hear our faith and the reasons for each of our decrees, and what we require from them if they wish to be received into our fellowship. Take this also: the magistrate in our Confederation is not of one faith; this had to be kept in mind when establishing these things, lest we give any handle for calumniating or raging to those who pursue us and ours with hatred. Therefore, for your faith and integrity, read and correct these things. However, do not send the booklet back to us until we have requested it from you by a sure messenger after eight or fifteen days. In the meantime, we ask you to write something back with this very messenger, so that we may be sure that these things of ours have been delivered to you. We wrote to you 15 days ago; we do not know whether the letters have been delivered to you. We asked you to write to us secretly about what kind of man Joachim Gachlinger is; for he boasts of being one of yours and having acted as a preacher in Kempten; he came here not many days ago. Excuse the prolixity; we could not help but write these things to you and pour our cares into your bosom as into that of a most trusted advisor. No news is brought here at all. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most excellent man, together with the other most learned and best men there, and do not cease to love us in return. Given at Chur, on the 22nd of April, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander and Philippus Gallicius, instructed by the brothers preaching Christ in the Confederation.</p>
      <p>We have received the letters sent by you, and please send these, if you can conveniently, to Lord Nikolaus Bern.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Johannes Comander, Philippus Gallicius 1553.</p>
