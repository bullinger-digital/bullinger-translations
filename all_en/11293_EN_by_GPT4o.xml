    <p xml:id="regest1">He is displeased that two of his letters did not reach Bullinger, as he does not want to appear negligent towards him; Bullinger's letter and gift have pleased him. The book sent [“De origine erroris”] serves the Christian truth greatly; however, the addition of an index would have been useful. The Protestant defense preparations are legitimate in view of the opponent's armaments; nevertheless, he thanks Bullinger for his warnings and the reminder of the failure of the Swiss Reformed. A turning point is expected in Frankfurt, but the imperial envoy [Johann von Weeze] has not yet taken a position on the demanded peace and is trying to make the members of the alliance compliant with all tricks; the people of Konstanz will not deviate from the pure doctrine. The envoys of the English king [Henry VIII] in Frankfurt [Christopher Mont and Thomas Paynell] are to ensure that scholars are sent to England for discussions on the implementation of the Reformation; there is much speculation about the king's stance. He hopes that, contrary to Bullinger's fears, they will be spared from the wrath of God. Greetings. He has passed on the excerpt from the letter of Johannes Heß to [Johannes] Zwick, who will write to him.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>It truly troubles me, my dearest and most esteemed brother in the Lord, that two of my letters were either intercepted by deceit or not delivered to you due to the negligence of the messengers, as you have written. Worse still, I have completely forgotten to whom I entrusted those earlier letters for delivery to you; for the later messenger, the servant of the printer, I might someday encounter by chance and demand an explanation from him. It is indeed most distressing that due to either this treachery or negligence, I could be suspected by you of neglecting my duty, which I utterly detest, especially since I am eager to prove my diligence and dedication to you more than to anyone else, as you have deservedly earned my gratitude in many ways. Your recent sweet letter, accompanied by a delightful and truly worthy gift, abundantly excuses your not having written for some time. I see it as a beautiful compensation for whatever I might have previously missed, and I wish that someday I may be able to reciprocate and demonstrate a grateful and appreciative heart for all your kindnesses; nothing is more desired in my prayers. Meanwhile, I pray to the Lord that He may graciously bestow upon you from His treasury of riches whatever will be to your benefit, until I too may have the opportunity to show some token of a grateful heart.</p>
      <p>The books you sent are as learned as they are well-suited for refuting the shameless lies of our adversaries and asserting the purity of truth and religion. They are also very delightful due to the variety of topics, especially since you have so wisely moderated everything that you have neither omitted anything required by the breadth of the subject nor burdened the reader with excessive length, which often creeps into such writings. Thus, you have truly earned great merit from the entire Christian republic, as no good person fails to see what you aim for, the great labors you have undertaken, and the efforts that book has cost you. One thing, however, an index, if I am not mistaken, should have been added to this great variety of topics, which could have made the already excellent work even more complete and commendable; but perhaps the printers reserve this for the final edition, to enjoy a new gain.</p>
      <p>There is no reason for our people to be greatly troubled at this time. They will not provoke anyone first; but to prepare for defense against the efforts of our adversaries, no sensible person, I think, will blame them. They are recruiting soldiers everywhere, gathering forces, and preparing everything so that even a blind person can see what they are planning against us. What then should our people do? Should they lie back and sleep securely in both ears amidst such vigilance of the enemy, especially since, even if they neglect nothing, they will not be able, if you judge by human standards, to fight on equal terms with this enemy, who is far superior to us in numbers, power, and the very sinews of war, not to mention experience in fighting? So far, my dear Bullinger, from wanting to take up arms and provoke those whom they would most wish to pursue peace; for unless help comes from you and your side, our forces will be lost. I nonetheless thank you for your pious concern, by which you wish to admonish our people by your example not to raise their crests nor trust in the alliance and the flesh, since this turned out so badly for your people. Our people desire nothing more than peace, provided it can be consistent with Christ, even if it must be obtained under unjust conditions and at the cost of all other things.</p>
      <p>We are now awaiting the outcome of the Frankfurt assembly, which many fear will be tragic. The designated bishop of Constance, the emperor's envoy, has not yet responded to our request for peace, and it is thought that he cannot respond to what is necessary for a solid peace. Meanwhile, the slippery and cunning man has decided to negotiate a general reconciliation of religion, trying everything to delay our people's exit with various hindrances and to soften and break them with his marvelous tricks and flattery, intending to mix light with darkness, falsehood with truth, Christ with Belial. My people of Constance firmly resolve to lose their possessions, life, and everything sooner than to deviate even a hair's breadth from the purity of the religion they have once accepted, and may Christ grant them to maintain this spirit perpetually.</p>
      <p>The King of England also has his envoys there, through whom he requests that some learned and pious men be sent to England to discuss the proper establishment of religion. If he does this with as good an intention as he does honestly, I have no doubt that he will eventually realize he has acted successfully. However, many speak much about this king, and they suspect even more than they are willing to say.</p>
      <p>We must pray with humble supplications to the Lord that, relying on His protection alone, we may be secure and safe, no matter how the dice of such great efforts may fall, so that it may not result in any harm to us. Indeed, all these things, which you truly and gravely gather as evidence of our remarkable and almost lamentable ingratitude, terrify me—and who would not?—and they most certainly portend the wrath of God hanging over our heads. Yet I come to hope that our days will be closed in peace due to many outstandingly good and pious people, and that these evils are reserved for the increasingly impious posterity, which does not know the Lord and His works that He has done with us, and we see that not much time remains before this entire generation of ours is gathered to its fathers. Meanwhile, we will urge repentance and produce fruits worthy of it, and we will perform our duty so diligently that those who perish will clearly understand that they perish by their own fault. What you write about certain princes and preachers, I wish you did not write so truly, as you do with great sorrow. But their judgment remains, and I very much hope that the Lord will not involve us with them. But indeed, whatever good we hope for amidst so many and such great evils, we desire to be obtained through your prayers and those of your entire church.</p>
      <p>All of our people eagerly send their greetings to you in their own words, especially those in Zurich, and my brother Thomas with his sister and my wife, who also send their most heartfelt greetings and wish you well in the Lord with all their hearts. Commend me to the most learned and excellent men Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and others who assist the Christian and literary republic there, and also to your consul Röst. Farewell, my soul, and as you always affirm that you are entirely ours, so persuade yourself that there is nothing in life more delightful to us than your sincere love, nothing more important. May Christ grant that, as we write this from the heart, we may also have the opportunity to clearly demonstrate it in reality through some occasion.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Constance, April 7, 1539.</p>
      <p>I have delivered the fragment from Johannes Heß's letter that you sent to our Zwick, who immediately recognized the name of his old friend with joy and promised to write to him soon and send the letter through you again.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere pastor of the church in Zurich, his dearest friend. Zürich.</p>
