      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>The one who delivers my letter to you is a citizen of Schaffhausen, born of a not insignificant family, who wishes to fulfill the duty of a scribe. Therefore, whatever advice and assistance you provide to him, consider it as given to me. As for the matters that concern us, or rather Christ, you will understand them when I come in person.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Schaffhausen, March 6, 1533.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished in piety and learning Heinrich Bullinger, proclaiming the Gospel of Christ in Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
