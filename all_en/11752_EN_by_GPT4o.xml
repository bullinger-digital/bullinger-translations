    <p xml:id="regest1">Has forwarded the resolution [“The commendable city of Zurich's order and recognition against harmful wars and marauding”] to [Hans] Welser. May Christ keep the princes, who are ready for the extreme, in check, so that Germany does not end up being ruled by the Turks! [Peter] Kolin and the others, whom the Lord has called to Himself, are blessed. Greetings. Sends a fitting German pasquinade [“Teutscher Pasqillus”]; may God have mercy on Germany! The appearance of the Bible [“Biblia sacrosancta”] is eagerly awaited. Further greetings.</p>

      <p>Dear Bullinger, I have ensured that the example of your plebiscite is soon delivered to Hans Welser in Augsburg, and I am very grateful to you for this, my venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>May Christ, the Prince of Peace, restrain the bloody minds of our princes! However, the minds of these monarchs now seem to be so committed that each appears ready to attempt the extreme, and this to the great applause of the enemy of the cross of Christ, the Turk, who indeed, unless we approach our affairs differently, will soon take possession of all of Germany.</p>
      <p>Oh, three and four times blessed are those whom the Lord calls early to Himself, and oh truly blessed is Peter Kolin, and blessed are the other excellent and most learned men, whom we see by the singular grace of the heavenly Father exempted from these most atrocious evils of all, which threaten the world, who with such a hardened mind resist the Lord urging them to repentance, as if deliberately, with hands and feet, they will pay the penalty more severely. May the Lord, having mercy on us, count us among His small flock of chosen sons! Commend us, my venerable and more than dearest Bullinger, most diligently to Him with our entire church.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellican, Theodor, Megander, and especially Gwalther, our chief friend, giving him my most ample thanks for his most delightful letters, to which I am responding shortly.</p>
      <p>I am indeed hurrying now to describe to you the German pasquinade, if perhaps you have not yet received it from elsewhere, so that you may clearly understand from it how everyone seems to have their wits about them. Nor does he, in my judgment, miss the mark by much. May the Lord have mercy on our most miserable Germany, which, unless the solid repentance anticipates the sentence of the angry judge, we will soon see in a most deplorable state.</p>
      <p>Your labor on the Bible, about which you write, is awaited with great desire by many and great people, which may the Lord ensure is completed successfully to the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you, especially my brother; my wife and I send our respectful greetings to your wife and children. December 23, 1542.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
