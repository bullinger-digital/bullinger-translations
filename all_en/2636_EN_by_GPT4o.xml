      <p>Although I do not think it is unknown to you that Queen Mary of England has perished along with her offspring, I nevertheless did not want to omit writing to you. However, I have not yet heard anything about what has been done after her departure; I hope, however, that the gospel will be restored there shortly. The King of Navarre is not dead, but he has been very ill. The Bishop of Vienne preached the gospel so purely and openly in his diocese that he did not hesitate to call the mass an abomination. The King of France ordered him to come to him to give an account of his doctrine. I therefore commend him to you, that you may pray to the Almighty Lord for him. I write nothing to you about the enemies of the truth, who are always plotting something new against Mr. Calvin, because you know enough about it. May Almighty God make all things turn to His glory. Farewell, most sincere minister of God. If I can learn anything else new, I will inform you. Meanwhile, I have written this to you hastily from Bern on the day after the Ascension of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Séchelles.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
