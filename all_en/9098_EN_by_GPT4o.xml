      <p>Greetings. I have seen what you sent to me through our Julius, most esteemed and dearest lord and godfather Froschauer, the writings of Mr. Illyricus on original sin. I do not respond to them because I have already discussed this matter very extensively in my Decades, Decade 3, Sermon 10, which you printed, and it seems he only wants to be informed if I have expressed my opinion on it more extensively elsewhere; he therefore has what he requested there. Furthermore, I do not respond for the main reason that I absolutely do not want to get involved in their quarrels; I sincerely hate disputes. I sincerely pray to our Lord God that He may grant them calm minds, free from the passions of anger and love of strife, so that they may teach what is beneficial, simple, and true for the churches of Christ the Lord, peacefully, modestly, and with united minds and voices, and thus remove the offenses of the good and the rejoicing of our common enemies, which arise from the discord and quarrels of those teaching the gospel, and let sincere truth triumph and our Lord Jesus Christ be glorified. To whom be glory forever and ever.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the Lord bless you and keep you from all evil. Zurich, 13th of November, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
