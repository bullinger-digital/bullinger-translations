      <p>I am sending this personal messenger only to ask you, Heinrich Bullinger, to inform Mr. Gribaldi, who will soon be traveling through Zürich, to stay there until I can speak with him, and assure him that I will be there by the 15th of May at the latest. Indeed, I not only ask you, but also the honorable Mr. Consul on behalf of our councilors, to ensure that what I request is done. Inform all the hosts that if such a person arrives, they should report to you, so that you can indicate what we are requesting.</p>
      <p>I will undoubtedly be there myself. You will hear that I am being called to Prussia (for a time), you will hear that the bean is being ground on other heads than those of the Lutherans at the diets, that these will be free, others will suffer persecution (at least in words). I will bring the gloss, although I think you understand well enough. But I will bring everything correctly in the end. I bid your three sons-in-law and the other brothers, as well as the English and the Locarnese, to be well; for I hear that the number of the sons of God and the exiles has increased. The Duke is still in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Stuttgart, 27th of April, 1555.</p>
      <p>Write what is new there about the new antichrist. We hear about the Holy Cross, who will give the cross to many; there is no man more hostile to the gospel in the world, believe me; he dictated a brief, where we are called worse than the Turks.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
