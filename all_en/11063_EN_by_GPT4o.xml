    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer has invited him to a meeting in Isny to find out what he is being accused of; if Zwick follows the invitation, he wants to ask him what he thinks has been done wrong so far and what order he would give to the churches. Inquires whether Bullinger and Pellikan consider midwife baptism to be valid. Ambrosius [Blarer] has reported in Konstanz on the state of the Reformation in the Duchy [of WÃ¼rttemberg]; the progress is pleasing, although there are still shortcomings. Further details can be reported by Mayor [Thomas Blarer]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Bucer is calling me to Isny, dearest Bullinger; I am still deliberating whether I should comply. May the Lord grant what is beneficial. He absolutely wants to know from me in person what those serious sins are for which he is condemned; he especially complains that he is condemned by you and us. I will give no account for you. For myself, I will give the account that I can, sincerely and simply. I have decided to first ask him directly what those errors are, whether from the beginning or during the progress of the gospel, committed by the more learned; because one should have acted differently towards him. Secondly, in what order and with what rites he believes the churches should be established. From these, we will easily, I believe, discern his mind. When I return, I will inform you of what has been done between us, if indeed I go.</p>
      <p>I would like to know one thing from you and from Pellikan, whether you recognize the baptism by midwives as true baptism. For those who consider it true think that in Christ there is neither male nor female. Therefore, Mary was the messenger of the resurrection. If, therefore, the duty of teaching was entrusted by Christ himself to a woman, why would not also the duty of baptizing be entrusted? But I will hear what you have to say to such sophistries.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius was with us for a few days, who outlined for us the course of religion in the domain of the Duke, and such that thanks should be given to the Lord, although some things are still desired. But how many heads of families are there in whom you do not desire something; what then is desired in a prince, indeed what is desired in us ministers?</p>
      <p>If there is anything else you wish to know, you have our most learned and piety-loving mayor, whom I commend to you and Pellikan. I commend you and your families to Christ, in whom farewell, my dear ones.</p>
      <p>July 15, 1537.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed brother.</p>
