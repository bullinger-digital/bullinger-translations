      <p>C[aelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I thought I would return within two days; the Lord decided otherwise. I have not yet been able to retrieve my daughter; but it is determined not to leave until I have received her, and I hope the Lord will finally grant a happy outcome to this pious wish of mine, which I do not doubt can be achieved especially through your prayers to God the Father. As for the rest, dearest brother, I do not want to hide from you the disturbance or rather the temptation of this Italian church, which is all the more serious and dangerous as it was stirred up by someone from whom it was least expected. I write this not without great sorrow; yet, so that we may receive some advice from you, who can, and whom we know to care for the welfare of our churches no less than for your own, as far as possible, I do not hesitate to disclose it to you. Vergerius has returned from Brenz (you understand what I mean) and brought with him a confession published in the name of the prince, converted by him and with the doctrine of the Eucharist approved, and he also published a small catechism of Brenz, also converted by him, in which these words are found: The body of Christ is presented in the bread itself and the blood in the wine. He titled the catechism "Foundation of Christian Doctrine for Valtellina." I think you may have caught wind of this or even, given his confidence, he may have sent you some copies. This church has never seen anything more disgraceful. He wanted to spread those books through these churches; he was prohibited. He sent many copies to Italy against the will of all of us; he even dares to say openly that these things do not displease you, my brother, mentioning your name. These few things for now, we will discuss more in person, God willing; for the messenger was almost leaving as I was writing. I expect from this same messenger your letters, which will console us and especially Augustin, the good old man, who sends you and your church many greetings and commends himself and his church to your prayers.</p>
      <p>The book I left with you, if you have read it, you can give to this messenger. Farewell in the Lord, brother. Chiavenna, August 22, 1553.</p>
      <p>Our Paul greets you.</p>
