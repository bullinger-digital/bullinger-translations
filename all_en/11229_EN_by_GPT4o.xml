    <p xml:id="regest1">The first of Bullinger's two letters should silence the "Eutychians" [followers of Schwenckfeld] with its scholarship and piety, if they were not so unteachable. Schwenckfeld adheres to his doctrine of the uncreated nature of the glorified Christ, although numerous Church Fathers, besides Augustine and Chrysostom, have expressed their views on this matter, most notably Jerome in the Ephesians commentary and [Ambrosiaster] in the Philippians commentary. Frecht has a counter-writing ready and further accuses Schwenckfeld of casting the proclamation through the external word, as well as the preachers and their office, in a bad light. The Moldavian Voivode [Petru Rareș] is said to have driven out the Turks; King [Ferdinand I] has not yet sent any troops, while Emperor [Charles V] has relocated a small Spanish garrison to Buda. The Zurich messenger will continue to Regensburg, Linz, and Vienna; the route is said to be safe. According to Veit Dietrich, [Joachim II, Elector of Brandenburg] and [Albert, Duke in Prussia] tried to dissuade Luther from writing against [Cardinal Albrecht], Archbishop of Mainz; a booklet by Anton Schönitz against the Archbishop has been published. Thanks for Bullinger's advice and sends greetings. Must leave it to him to review this letter for errors.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Our bookseller returned one of your letters, and your messenger, who is about to leave for the king, delivered another in recent days; nothing could have been more pleasing to me. For the earlier letters exude such learned piety and a pious adherence to sound doctrine that the Eutychian heretics have not a single point left to refute. Although the Catholics, when they wish to silence them, often achieve confusion rather than complete victory; so persistent is the heretical and verbose obstinacy in remaining true to itself.</p>
      <p>You will recognize this from the following: Schwenckfeld, moved by open scripture, indeed admits that there are two distinct and unconfused natures in one supposition. He does not deny that Christ is truly a man in glory, but he denies that this man, having completed the course of earthly dispensation, is a creature, not even a heavenly one. And when it is objected: "Then humanity has ceased," he retorts that it has not ceased. When pressed: "That humanity in Christ is either creator or creature, because nothing mediates between these two, even if Peter Abelard once posited something in between," he immediately evades this, as if this principle flows from the judgment of reason and philosophy. Thus, he attributes everything to faith, just as he was urged in the sacramental contention that we should believe everything. However, when the object of faith is required and the open word of God is demanded, I do not know what scripture passages he brings forth. He is entirely occupied with listing the inconveniences, nearly 15, that follow if you hold that Christ, even now in glory, is both a true man and a creature. Furthermore, he brings forth some opinions of the ancients, but in my judgment, they are distorted; for besides Augustine and Chrysostom, I can cite a hundred other Church Fathers who testify in plain words that Christ as a man is a creature. I remain silent about the entire school of scholastic theologians. Nothing is clearer than Jerome on the 2nd chapter of Ephesians, and Ambrose on Philippians 2. Schwenckfeld distinguishes the state of earthly dispensation and seems to tacitly concede that Christ was indeed a creature then, but now in the state of glory, not at all. He repeatedly insists that Christ, according to the whole person, is the Son of God, not only according to the flesh the son of David, and from this, he concludes that those who do not confess Christ as a man to be the Son of God are close to the Nestorian doctrine. However, a sound understanding could also grant that Christ, conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin, is a man and, according to human nature, the Son of God, according to what Paul cites in Acts 13 from the psalm: "Today," namely from the resurrection, "I have begotten you." For Schwenckfeld uses this passage to argue that as a man, he is the Son of God, therefore not a creature. But this good man sophisticates here, as in this whole cause, if I am not mistaken, he commits the fallacy of non-cause as cause. However, since I have not yet sent Schwenckfeld the refutation I have in hand, but will soon send it and await his opinion on it, I cannot now, especially being busy and hindered by the excessive haste of the messenger departing for Constance, write much. He also argues about the external word, that it is not the word of God, and that a wicked person cannot teach the word and administer the sacraments. He slanders us for teaching faith without works. He tries to make our calling and economy odious and suspect because the fruits do not follow the preached Lutheran or Zwinglian gospel. But I desist.</p>
      <p>What should I write about the Turkish incursions, when nothing certain is reported? This one constant rumor is spread that the Moldavian Voivode, neighboring the Jazyges, has driven out the Turk, whose army consists of 100,000. The king, as this swift evil spreads, has sent no garrisons to Moldavia so far. The Emperor is said to have sent some Spaniards to Buda as a garrison. The Moldavians are reported to be of present mind and to be preparing everything against the Turk, and that successfully, which I hope will be lasting.</p>
      <p>Your messenger will travel from here by boat to Regensburg and from there to Linz and Vienna. Eight days ago, the king was said to have been in Linz. The journey is not so beset by marauding soldiers as to be unsafe, as our butchers, going and returning to both Pannonias for the sake of trading cattle, report.</p>
      <p>Besides, I have nothing new. From Nuremberg, Veit Dietrich, the preacher of St. Sebald, wrote that Joachim, the Elector's son, the successor of the Margrave, sent a delegation to Luther with a complaint, then the Prussian Margrave sent a supplication, asking Luther to remain silent in the case against the Archbishop of Mainz. But nothing is heard of what Luther replied. Most conjecture that he will persist in his opinion and depict the Archbishop of Mainz in his colors. A booklet written and published by a certain Anton Schönitz against the Archbishop exists.</p>
      <p>I beg you to consider this letter, poured out rather than written, with goodwill. I am most grateful to you for your faithful and learned advice. All my fellow ministers with me wish you and your esteemed colleagues, especially Master Pellican and Leo, well. Pray for the church and us. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, in Ulm, Swabia, October 8, 1538. Frecht.</p>
      <p>It was not possible to reread. Therefore, apply the Aristarchus' mark.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, Evangelist and most faithful teacher of the Church of Zurich, my venerable lord and brother. Zurich.</p>
