      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, from Plançon, Greetings. I cannot express in words how much I owe you, most excellent sir; for besides the kindness and benevolence you have shown me, you also treated me with a splendid and loving hospitality at your home, and, which I consider a great favor, you gave me books to use. To further demonstrate your goodwill towards me, you even revealed your treasures, that is, the books you wrote and the entire method of your studies. However, since it is an old saying that one should wish to owe much to those to whom one owes much, I will ask that you also bestow this favor upon me: to assist the bearer of this letter, who is an excellent man and very devoted to you, should he need your help. He has brought with him two young men of excellent character, the sons of Silvarus of Lyon. Since he is a good man and a great lover of purer religion, and because I have praised your republic to him greatly, he preferred to send his children to you rather than anywhere else in all of France. For he does not reject the doctrine that is illuminated by the light of the gospel. Would that I could have returned to you myself, as I intended! Believe me, no land has seemed more like my true homeland than the region of Zürich; nowhere else in the world would I rather be.</p>
      <p>France now seems distasteful and displeasing to me. May the Heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, grant me liberation from this Babylonian captivity and Egyptian servitude, amen. If you have received any letters from Master Florian, it would be most welcome if you could write to me about where he is now and where he will be in the future. I pray to God the Father, most learned man, that through Jesus Christ, our Lord, He may keep you safe for His church for as long as possible. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Lyon, October 13, 1549.</p>
      <p>To Master Bullinger, most illustrious man, Antistes of the Church of Zürich and chief ecclesiastic.</p>
