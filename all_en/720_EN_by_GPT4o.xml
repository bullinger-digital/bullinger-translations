      <p>There are many things, dearest Bullinger in Christ, that rightly draw me to venerate you; namely, your singular learning and piety, which are widely known to almost the entire Christian world; the many and magnificent monuments of your genius, which have everywhere most splendidly illustrated the glory of God. But although these are great, they are common and tend to move individuals less: however, this aspect of your humanity, with which you have recently treated me, has struck my mind much more deeply, because you have deemed me worthy to be gifted with your most learned letters and a truly precious little book. For in it shine not earthly but heavenly gems; which do not flatter these eyes, but affect the mind with wondrous delight. Therefore, I give you immense thanks, and I pray to the best and greatest God, that He may preserve you and those like you, the most solid pillars of His church, safe for a very long time. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From the King's court in Westminster, 22nd October 1549. Yours most devotedly, RICHARD COX.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cox, Englishman.</p>
