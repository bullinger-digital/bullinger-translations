      <p>God be with you! I wrote to you last Monday.</p>
      <p>Siderhar has not come to me, and I don't know what is going on, except that Captain Dionysius from Schaffhausen has returned home from the camp in France, wanting to fulfill his duties and take on soldiers. This is forbidden by the authorities, and it is also strictly forbidden for all their people that no one should go at this time. They have also sent a messenger to France to call back their people who are still there with the troops in France. As I have informed you before, my lords here and those in Bern strictly forbid their people from joining this campaign. And although the French have set a date for September 26 in Solothurn, the day will actually take place in Baden on September 29. May God grant that it ends well; for I am displeased with the affairs of our Confederation.</p>
      <p>I fear it won't be long before we are also punished. May God have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>God be with you. In haste and with great urgency.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, September 24, 1568.</p>

      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, my dear brother.</p>
