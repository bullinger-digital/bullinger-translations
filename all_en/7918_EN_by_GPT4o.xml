      <p>S. D. I received your letter, most illustrious man and reverend father in Christ, with the greatest joy of heart, and we all rejoice in the Lord that the Lord is gradually restoring you from your long illness to health, hoping in the same Lord for your complete recovery soon. We have understood your and the censors' opinion on amending the catechism. As for the first line, we have inserted the word you advised; then we changed the term "ketzer" to "sectler," which is similarly disyllabic and does not displease Mr. Wolff. We recall that the word "ketzer" among us signifies not only someone stubbornly adhering to a cursed error but also someone polluted by the most vile lust, and therefore it is more abominable in our regions than in many others.</p>
      <p>As for the word "pope" in the penultimate song, we prefer to omit the whole rather than change the name of the pope and leave it to the Turk; the main reasons are that they seem less rightly separated, whom the scripture joins. Then, because it might seem to many that we want to flatter the Babylonian harlot; for the same happened to the Nurembergers in many reformed churches of Germany, who changed the words "and defend from the pope's and Turk's murder" to "and defend from the devil's lie and murder" during the Interim, from which a pasquinade spread everywhere sang: "Nuremberg had wit, both shoulders shrugged." Therefore, since this song is solemnly sung in all the more famous churches of Germany, we prefer, as I said, to omit it from our catechetical songs rather than insert it altered, lest what is already written happens to us from the malevolent. Since it is short and previously found in the booklet of Psalms printed by Mr. Froschauer, any church that wishes to sing it can obtain it from there. It might also be conveniently omitted for this reason, lest the whole catechism be snatched from the hands of some weak ones because of this word; for the catechism should be a simple doctrine of truth. We do not wish to have the catechism printed in Latin at this time until our schools have examined it. We thought you would understand this from our previous silence. I write this hastily, so forgive my haste.</p>
      <p>The brothers send their greetings to you. You will greet on our behalf the most illustrious men Mr. Gwalther and Mr. Wolff and all the brothers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on July 7, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>You will encourage Mr. Froschauer to have the catechism printed soon for the sake of the youth.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and in every kind of learning and virtue most adorned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my most revered father in Christ.</p>
