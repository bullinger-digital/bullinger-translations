      <p>Many greetings in the Lord. As my son Barnabas Hilles informed the beloved brother in Christ, Julius Sancterentianus, through his letters dated the 26th of November last, most esteemed lord and friend; I myself received your letters, written on the 27th of August last, here in London through the learned and pious young man Heinrich Butler. After one or two weeks, after I received the aforementioned letters, I arranged for him to ride with faithful companions to a certain Dunstan Felton, the son of the late Lord Johannes Butler, to a certain English village called Chilton, in the county of Suffolk. From there, I received letters from the aforementioned Heinrich, written from the house of his aunt, a very pious widow. I will also most diligently take care of all those matters which you wished to be executed through your aforementioned letters. Certain letters, which Lord Christopher Froschouer handed over to my aforementioned son Barnabas in Frankfurt, I sent through a faithful messenger to the aforementioned Heinrich Butler on the 26th of November.</p>
      <p>My son Barnabas Hilles also received from the aforementioned Lord Froschouer, along with the aforementioned letters, four German books, which he ensured were faithfully delivered to those to whom they were addressed. My wife and I are immensely grateful to you for sending us two of those books as a gift.</p>
      <p>I am indeed sorry that you had not yet fully recovered from your illness when you wrote your aforementioned letters to me. However, I hope that by this day you are much better, which God may grant.</p>
      <p>I have not recently received any letters from our bishops or lords residing here in England to be forwarded to you. However, if I receive any letters for that purpose in the future, I will ensure they are sent to you with the utmost diligence. Lord Edmund Grindall, who is now, as you have heard, the Archbishop of York, remains continuously around York or in the city of York itself (as I hear). However, I believe he will soon come here to London, as almost all the other bishops will come; because now, by royal command, a famous council of all England has been convened, which is commonly called a parliament among us: but among you, if I remember correctly, it is called an imperial diet in Latin, and in German, Reichstag. Lord Edwin Sandys, the bishop who was recently of Worcester, is now our Bishop of London; however, he is not very well known to me, except by face: as almost all the other bishops are almost unknown to me, except for the most learned and most humane, indeed rather divine bishop, Lord Jewel of Salisbury. For I fear (although I have never experienced it myself) that some of them (as the most learned Jerome wrote about some bishops of his time), as if placed in some lofty watchtower, scarcely deign to see and speak to their fellow servants. Lord Cox, Bishop of Ely, your friend, who married the young widow of Lord Doctor Turner, the physician, a year ago, is still alive and, by the grace of God, is well.</p>
      <p>But his predecessor, Lord Thirlby, who was Bishop of Ely during the reign of Queen Mary here, and lived at the house of the most reverend Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury, (but detained in his house), because of his protestation of papist doctrine, died recently six or seven months ago at Lambeth in the palace of the said Archbishop of Canterbury. However, some of the other bishops or prelates, who were restricted in their freedom because of their obstinacy, are still alive: but they have hardly suffered any torment, except perhaps some sadness of mind because of the desired freedom and restrained license of speaking ill and doing harm. Of all these, Nicholas Heath, who was Archbishop of York under Queen Mary, was a less severe man, and therefore perhaps found greater favor with our most serene Queen Elizabeth: for he has no other prison than his own house in the countryside, situated in a quite comfortable and healthy place.</p>
      <p>Here among us, by the grace of God, all is peaceful in the church and the state. May the Lord grant this to us for a long time. I also hear that the King of France prudently maintains that peace, which you wrote to me had been concluded: and I rejoice greatly and give the greatest thanks to God, that in the conclusion of that peace, the safety of the faithful was sufficiently provided for, as you wrote and we now see. However, I am very sorry that that pestilent sect of the Arians is reviving in many places outside of Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, when the Lord Jesus comes to judgment, will he find faith on earth? I pray you will deign to greet the aforementioned Julius Sancterentianus in my name and that of my wife. Between our most serene Queen and the Duke of Alva, the matter of the release of persons and goods or merchandise detained or arrested for two years is not yet well settled. However, although there is not yet a matter of agreement, there is some hope. But concerning future trade, such as was continued for several, indeed many, years between the Kings of England and the Archdukes of Austria and Burgundy, there remains, as far as I can see or conjecture, no matter or even hope. On the third day of this month, another papist, or, as he seemed to himself, a great Catholic, by the name of Boxall, who was the chief secretary of the aforementioned Queen Mary, died; a man very continent (as he presented himself) and humane; who also lived for several years in the house of the most reverend Archbishop of Canterbury, desiring the freedom to go where he wished.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus preserve you and yours forever. London, the 8th day of March, in the year of our salvation 1570, according to the reckoning of the Anglican Church.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Richard Hilles.</p>
