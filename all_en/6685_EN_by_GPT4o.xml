      <p>God with us. Your letter, honorable lord and beloved brother, was delivered to me yesterday by Jeremiah von Gachnang. I immediately read it to all our fellow brothers; thereafter, we informed all our lords, and indeed, they were all greatly rejoiced and praised God in heaven, praying that He may eternally preserve our union through His grace. We thank you, Lord Steiger and the other lords, who have worked faithfully in this matter; may God be your eternal reward. And although the first batch of Latin was already printed under our name alone, 1500 sheets were ordered to be set aside for the Froschauer printers and to print the first anew, so that it may serve all who wish to join us. The very first sheet, in which the preface stands or will stand and the title, is being spared until the end, for it seemed good to us, now that we are united, Zurich, Bern, Biel, that Lord Rudolf Walther rides to Schaffhausen and then to Basel, to present the exposition to the ministers, or that you and we unite with them. We have good hope from Schaffhausen; if Basel does not want to, they cannot later say that we despised them and did not deal brotherly with them. Tomorrow he rides to Schaffhausen, and we will proceed no less, even if the Baselers do not want to. He should also go to Mulhouse. Meanwhile, we intend to go here to St. Gallen and to Chur. Praying to God that He may truly help us to come to the unity that will be beneficial to us and our descendants, especially now that many sects are emerging through curious men. We must spare no effort, labor, or cost. You have received the preface, as I hope, from Küngsfelden along with my letter; I hope it will not displease you. We will write to Heidelberg as soon as possible about how it went; for in our last letter we informed them and promised to report further what answer you would give, also informing them that we would not conclude the printing until we have yours, which is most important to us. We intend to arrange the title as follows: "CONFESSION</p>
      <p>And a brief and simple exposition of the orthodox faith and doctrines of the sincere Christian religion, published by the ministers N. in this, to testify to all the faithful that they stand in the unity of the true and ancient Church of Christ and do not spread any new or erroneous doctrines, and therefore have no fellowship with any sects or heresies, published at this time, so that all pious people may judge and evaluate it." There, if it pleases you, instead of "N." one might insert: "of the Helvetic churches", or: "by the ministers of the churches of Zurich, Bern, Biel", and those who will be with us, or that the specification is omitted and only "of the Helvetic churches" is set, and finally, on the preface, it is set: "Ministers of the churches in Helvetia: Zurich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, Chur, St. Gallen, Biel, and Mulhouse" etc. We are willing, since the preface cannot fill the sheet, to first set the imperial law from the Code, who are Catholics and who are heretics, then set the symbol of Damasus, since the imperial law refers to the faith of Damasus, then the table of contents; thus the sheet will be filled.</p>
      <p>As for the article that your lords erred with the vases, as you know, we have gladly omitted and erased the entire passage to please you, instead setting chapter 27 on rites and ceremonies on the words of Socrates as follows: "Thus he. And we today, having diverse rites in the celebration of the Lord's Supper in our churches, do not differ in faith, nor is the unity and fellowship of our churches thereby broken. Indeed, the churches have always used freedom in such rites, as in means." We could not fully address the issue of bad ministers because of the Donatists and Anabaptists, but we have replaced "bad and lying" with "bad and sinner" and removed "lying", hoping you are satisfied with everything as we are with you. May God grant His grace in the future. Whatever comes next and unfolds, we will inform you at the first opportunity. Greet sincerely Lord Steiger, Lord city clerk, the lords treasurers, young Nicholas, my Zähender, all dear lords and good brothers and your household. Above all, I ask you for God's sake and for the sake of our love and friendship, to write everything completely and accurately to our lord and brother Beza and greet him sincerely. It is not possible for me in this multifaceted matter to write to him myself. Excuse me. Yet it will be more acceptable to him that it is from you and from me. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, February 13, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
