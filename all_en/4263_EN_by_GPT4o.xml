      <p>Greetings. Most humane man, I also sent with the printer the confession of Lord Tilemann Heshusius; it was printed in Nuremberg; here I found it for sale in Frankfurt at the printer who published it, and when I read it, I told the printer why he had omitted some things and why he had not printed it more correctly. He replied: "Did I not print it as I should have?" I answered: "No, because the name of Michael Diller, the court preacher, is erased and omitted." "Oh," he said, "do not touch my anointed ones. Diller is a court preacher." I asked whether he had deleted Diller's name with Tilemann's consent; he replied that the copy was given to him not by Tilemann, but by Pesold, the Nuremberg preacher. Tilemann also omitted the word "mundtlich" and replaced it with "wesentlich". Hence, most excellent man, I conclude that if it was allowed for the adversary doctor to change and diminish the confession, it will also be free for me to augment and clarify my confession, which is brief. And since, as you will see, I am counted among you, I ask again and again, when it will not be safe to stay here and from my affairs, that you assist me in your vicinity; I will fulfill my duty with the strength granted by God. Farewell and please keep me recommended to you.</p>
      <p>Given in Frankfurt on the 10th of April in the year 60. Your dignity's most observant Wilhelm Klebitz.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord.</p>
