    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should not doubt his esteem; he has only expressed his regret to Vogler [Hans the Elder?] about Bullinger's estrangement from Bucer, which is so deep that even Vadian's efforts for a reconciliation between Bullinger and the Bernese pastors [Sebastian Meyer and Peter Kunz] remained hopeless; in view of Bullinger's last letter, he loses confidence that Bucer will ever again enjoy his former esteem. He has received all borrowed books back intact. Emperor [Charles V] has appointed three participants for discussions in Regensburg: on the Protestant side Philipp [Melanchthon], [Martin] Bucer, and [Johannes] Pistorius, on the Catholic side [Johannes] Eck, [Johannes] Gropper, and Julius Pflug; Bullinger will be informed in more detail based on Kaufmann's letters as soon as the city messenger [from Regensburg] is back. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Most learned Bullinger, there is no need for you to fear any contempt from me, as if any suspicion of it has ever entered my mind, since I am so convinced by so many arguments that no one among our friends holds me in higher regard, not only respected but almost revered, than you yourself, whom I have long ago chosen for the most just reasons to be honored and respected by me. Nor was I hinting anything of the sort to Vogler; rather, I was indicating that this one thing is very distressing to me and the reason why I often grieve alone, because I see you so estranged from Bucer that you seem unwilling to accept even me, whom you uniquely love and respect, as an intermediary. This indeed has dashed all my hopes of restoring sincere harmony between you and your colleagues and the Bernese ministers, which I have been striving for with many letters to you, as you know, with their goodwill and humanity. However, your latest letters have made me despair, unless divine intervention allows Bucer to be restored to your former favor. But more on this another time. Know that I have received the borrowed books back intact and exactly as I sent them. From Regensburg, there is nothing new, except that the Emperor has appointed six men from both sides to initiate concord. From our side, Philipp [Melanchthon], Bucer, and Pistorius have been chosen, with great caution to retain the truth in all things, and from the other side, two obstinate ones, Eck and Gropper, and the third, Julius Pflug, whose fairness and integrity are commended. We are waiting for the sworn messenger of our city; when he returns, I will inform you of everything based on the merchants' letters, which insinuate everything about the matters. Farewell and convey my greetings to your esteemed colleagues in my name. St. Gallen, the day after the Kalends of May, in the year 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most revered bishop of the illustrious church of Zurich.</p>
