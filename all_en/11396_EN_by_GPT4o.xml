    <p xml:id="regest1">Although they do not know each other personally, Bullinger has become close to him through his writings, which masterfully convey the pure teachings of Christ. He recommends a pious Englishman [...], who is somewhat proficient in the three classical languages and intends to teach in his homeland one day; this man wishes to study in Zurich for a few months and work as a private tutor.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace in Christ Jesus, our God and Savior. Although, according to the external man, you are unknown to me and I to you, most honorable Bullinger, yet according to the internal conversation of true life and pure doctrine, you have been very familiarly known to me for many years. For I make use of your work and your ministry in often explaining the Holy Scriptures. I frequently hear you speaking to me as a teacher through your books, and in you, I hear Christ himself. Such is the power of pure doctrine, which springs from the source of truth, which is Christ, that it binds even the most unknown and those separated by great distances with the closest bonds of Christian love and in a certain way unites them.</p>
      <p>Since this is the case, I know you will interpret it in the best way, that I interrupt your holy labors for a moment to recommend to you the bearer of this letter. To put it briefly, he is a Briton by nationality, very devoted to true religion, and he travels not for vain ostentation, but to learn those things which he may later teach among his own people. For he desires to be a useful vessel in the house of the Lord. He has tasted the three principal languages quite successfully. He has heard that the study of the Holy Scriptures flourishes among you, with a certain explanation of the principal languages being preserved. Therefore, he wishes to stay there for a few months to learn what he lacks in himself. Hence, I beseech your love to kindly receive him, as you are accustomed to do with such good men, and to obtain for him some position of teaching privately the children of some of the wealthier citizens of your city, so that he may not be a burden to anyone. You will hear the rest from him. He has conducted himself here for some time honorably and frugally. Whatever benefits you bestow upon him, you know you bestow upon Christ himself.</p>
      <p>If I can serve you or yours in any way in return, behold, I offer myself to you as your most obedient servant and brother in Christ. You will commend me to the holy prayers of your colleagues and brothers, especially to Mr. Pellican, Leo Jud, Bibliander, Megander, etc. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given at Marburg, January 29, 1540.</p>
      <p>With all my heart, yours most devotedly, Gerhard Geldenhauer Noviomagus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant doctor and pastor of the Church of Zurich, my uniquely esteemed lord and teacher. Zurich.</p>
