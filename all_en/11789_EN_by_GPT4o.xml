    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger may be content with this letter; Blarer was busy all day; his arm is stronger again, but now he has to catch up on everything he neglected the whole month. There was nothing new to report; he sends what he received today and the day before yesterday, and continues to strive for information exchange. Greetings, especially to Gwalther, to whom he has not been able to write yet.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my soul.</p>
      <p>I implore you by our Lord Jesus Christ to consider this letter favorably. I was so occupied the entire day that I have no strength left to prove my spirit to you. My arm is indeed stronger now. But now, whether I like it or not, I am forced to make up for the great trouble I neglected the whole month.</p>
      <p>There was nothing new to write; otherwise, I would have fulfilled my duty by the hand of others. I am sending what I received today and the day before yesterday, and I will diligently ensure that you do not remain unaware of what I know.</p>
      <p>Commend us to the Lord and to friends. Farewell again and again with your whole household, which the Lord may continually build. Especially, you will greet my dear Gwalther most dutifully, to whom I absolutely should have written; but no opportunity was given at all. May 5, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
