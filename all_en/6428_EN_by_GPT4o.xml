      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, dear brother, and eagerly await the comic conclusion of your tragedy. May the Lord grant you peace.</p>
      <p>Mr. MÃ¼llner himself will write to you, I believe.</p>
      <p>He said: "If I had known beforehand that he would give me this wine, I would not have asked him for it." etc. I have nothing else to write at the moment.</p>
      <p>You have Beza's letters here; send them back to me.</p>
      <p>Greet the most honorable Mr. Legate, to whom I write nothing, so as not to double his troubles; I know he is working, afflicted, and distressed. He has dealings with such people with whom it is not easy to transact conveniently.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Many letters have now been written by me to Frankfurt and are being written; therefore, I am brief.</p>
      <p>Froschauer left yesterday well-laden with my letters; tomorrow other merchants of ours will follow. I am still writing more even to Heidelberg; therefore, I will include yours with mine and hand them over to those departing tomorrow morning at dusk.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 30, 1565. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
