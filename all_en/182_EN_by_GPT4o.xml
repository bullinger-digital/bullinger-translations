      <p>I received your letter, my venerable Bullinger, along with the advice of our Brentius. Now there is no reason why I can or should write more, since you are about to hear in person from Musculus, a brother revered and most dear for many reasons, explaining all those evils by which the churches of Christ are now afflicted. I would certainly commend him to you and your fellow ministers and indeed to your people, if he were not already well known to you by the renown of his name and beloved for his faith towards Christ and His church.</p>
      <p>You will find in this man, when you look more deeply, an education and piety that are by no means common. I beseech you, for my sake as well, to do him this service, that he may obtain, through your kindness, a faithful companion for his journey, who will lead him to Basel; for he is hastening there for not insignificant reasons, especially to call his most pious wife with nine children from Augsburg, where they are in great danger, to himself. Your people are more familiar with this journey than ours; otherwise, we would have provided the excellent man with companions.</p>
      <p>As for the companion, I find no one here from Ötingen who knows what kind of man he is, except that my Conrad Zwicker affirms he has heard more than once that he is a very good man. Doctor Mezler, a canon, has been elected as bishop, who in previous years was the chancellor of the bishop and sometimes also the vicar. The canons now care only for this, that they have a leader who is well-versed in the bad arts of practice, otherwise they would never allow a man of obscure family to be greeted as their bishop.</p>
      <p>For us, that we may be constant, I ask, beseech, and implore you, if ever before much, now more than ever, to pray constantly, not less for the people of Lindau, who have offered themselves entirely to the Lord as a holy, living, and most acceptable sacrifice, whose example I wish the people of Strasbourg and ours would equally imitate. Ah, ah, how dreadful are the judgments of the Lord, how this vile and treacherous defection of many breaks my spirit, which, I greatly fear, portends extreme evils for our Germany. May the Lord keep some remnants for Himself, in which He may declare the power of His arm to the world. Curio will present to you the response of the people of Lindau for you to read. The rest, our Musculus will tell you, whom you may happily enjoy in Christ. Farewell. July 4, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers and friends most reverently and lovingly, along with your household.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you, especially Conrad Zwicker.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zürich.</p>
