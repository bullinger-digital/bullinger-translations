      <p>Greetings. I am aware that it is bothersome for you, amidst your many occupations, to read letters that are empty of useful matters. However, I cannot refrain from sending you some letters through acquaintances. Therefore, when Albert was sent there for the sake of visiting France, along with a person very close to me, Luca Ramminger, who was once my student and companion, I could not restrain myself from showing you that I remember you and, if nothing else, to certainly write that I have nothing to write and that my affairs are in a not too bad state considering the circumstances of the times and conditions. The theologians from Saxony left the Aldenburg convention with more embittered spirits than when they arrived, yet Jacob Andreae is working hard on reconciling some issues by writing certain articles on controversial matters, which both parties might approve. There are various and uncertain rumors about the Bipontine, and there are those who fear for him not so much from the French but from some others who are absent and coveting his domain and might attack it if things go badly in France. Since these matters are more known to you than to me (for you have many prominent men who write these things to you), I will stop and ask you to forgive me and to cherish my spirit towards you.</p>
      <p>If I receive anything from Mr. Haller*, I will make sure it is delivered to you. Meanwhile, farewell and do not hesitate to make prayers for me and mine.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, June 4, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Matthias Schenck.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zürich, dear and foremost friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
