    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to a letter from Stiltz to Enzlin, Bullinger demonstrates that the gift of the Holy Spirit cannot be limited to the Church Fathers, but is granted to Christians at all times, including the present, and argues against the Erasmian doctrine of free will.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>It cannot be expressed how much your letter delighted me, partly because it came from a parent, and partly because it breathed the great benevolence of your father towards me. It seemed only harsher in this part, where you attribute the spirit to the fathers in such a way that you leave almost nothing for the most deplorable men of our age. For you thunder that it is hardly credible that the fathers, celebrated for their antiquity and sanctity, lacked the spirit, by which they could have discerned the doctrines that are now pronounced as if from the tripod. Go therefore, if you are ignorant, to Augustine himself and inquire whether antiquity or the sanctity of the saints makes doctrine more weighty!</p>
      <p>He will indeed teach in the letter to Jerome, almost the last, that these confer nothing, indeed that what does not have authority from the scriptures is to be execrated, to which Cyprian also subscribes in his letters. So now I will not mention that Augustine does not want to be believed unless he supports it with scriptures, as he erred not in one place; the testimonies are in the preface to the 3rd book "On the Trinity", to Casulanus, Fortunatus, and Vincentius. Will the Holy Spirit then be bound to the fathers and reveal everything to everyone at one time? Therefore, where will we twist the words of Christ: "I will be with you until the end of the age" [Mt 28:20]? Why did Christ not immediately shine upon the world at the first promise? Surely God is unjust, who led the children of Israel out of Egyptian captivity, but did not lead the fathers. Was this done because the tenor of the divine oracle, the testimony of divine will, so disposed it? Why then do we not see that our captivity, according to the prophecies of the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, ought to be such as, alas, we have seen the most deplorable mortals under the most impious reign of the Antichrist? Indeed, since Moses and Paul leave prophecy free for all, who has so wiped away all shame as to forbid anyone to prophesy? Meanwhile, we also think that spirits must be tested, as John and Paul command, and here we know for certain that the word of God is our touchstone, so that nothing can escape us by God, for it is the lamp of our feet and silver refined seven times, an infallible and eternal rule. Hence there is no need to fear that the most wicked enemy of men will intrude and impose upon us under the guise of piety. "The anointing will teach all things" [1 John 2:27], faith and charity will judge all things. You see Augustine "In John Tractates" 16 and 18, and Tertullian in "The Prescription of Heretics".</p>
      <p>Now, as for the fact that I treated Erasmus's booklet, titled "A Discussion on Free Will", somewhat uncivilly, it is surprising how much you take it badly; but we do not recant because of this, indeed we do not yield even a straw. For it is not only impious but also a blasphemous booklet, contrary to almost all Erasmus's writings, so now I will not mention how inept, impotent, and flaccid it is, in which no pious person ever praised anything except the artifice. But in such a controversy, a theologian, not a little rhetorician, would have been better; for what has piety to do with Erasmus's epicheiremas? What with the infinite places treated sinisterly? There is little difference between him who brings forth nothing from the scriptures and him who brings forth, but brings forth in such a way that he cares more for number than for energy. But when some Gordian knot presents itself, good God, how miserably the poor little Erasmus twists himself, how beautifully he assumes the form of Proteus, how childishly he fixes and refixes everything! Did we not also shake out the same epiphonema of Origen and others who sing the same tune? Therefore, the place in Romans 9 should have been broken not by the sayings and doctrines of the fathers, but by the collation of the scriptures. We are Christians, we fight with the scriptures, not with the doctrines of the fathers. Nor do I deny it; he adduces some places, but all of the same kind. Some sophist would reject the begging of the question, and shall we listen to a coxcomb in so grave a matter? Briefly: if there is providence, there is no free will; for otherwise, providence would not be providence. If, moreover, there is free will, then there is no providence; for otherwise, free will would not be free will. Let Augustine and Boethius twist themselves here, although he retracted his in later books, yet he will dissipate these things only at the Greek calends.</p>
      <p>Consider these things of ours kindly, for zeal for the law of God excites me to this fervor. For it cannot be said how much the impious sentiment of free will detracts from the divine nature and energy. I venerate, admire, and adore Erasmus otherwise as the father of the fatherland, the prince of eloquence, the patron of good letters, the fountain of humanity, and the restorer of languages after Reuchlin, but in divine letters, I judge him a wise man of the world. What they think about true religion, the "doctor of the Gentiles" [1 Tim 2:7] and the "chosen vessel" [Acts 9:15] Paul taught on the frontispiece of his letter, which he dedicated to the church of the Corinthians. What if your Erasmus, another Demosthenes, were to labor in the defense of truth not otherwise than he did of old, when he had to speak against the legates of the Milesians for the Athenian republic? Nor is it surprising, since the Holy Spirit predicted through the mouth of the prophet that the hearts of the wise would be blinded by gifts.</p>
      <p>I pray to God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, that he may lead the erring back to the way of truth and guide you especially by his way, that in one church we may truly acknowledge one God; by whose benefit we are created, fed, and redeemed, we shall be resurrected on that last day by the life-giving spirit, to whom be glory forever.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, beloved parent, embrace Christ the Son of God and love me as you are accustomed.</p>
      <p>From Hausen am Albis, across the ZÃ¼rich mountain, January 21, in the year of the world's redemption 1526.</p>
