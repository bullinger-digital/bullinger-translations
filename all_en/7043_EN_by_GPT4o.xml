      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Weidner, faithful minister of the church in Danzig, my esteemed lord and dearest brother, from H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greetings. In the year of our Lord 1565, in the month of April, I received the letters written by you, esteemed lord and dearest brother, and I replied to them.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, I sent to you from Frankfurt the books and booklets I had published, once and again, including my Homilies on the Prophet Daniel with the epitome of times, and later I sent to you the Confession of Faith and Doctrine of the Swiss and Genevan Churches.</p>
      <p>I wrote and sent at least three letters to you. However, since those first ones, I have received no more from you, nor do I know whether you have received the books I sent to you as a gift. Indeed, I doubt whether you are alive or have passed on to the Lord. Certainly, I will not cease from the duty of writing until I hear that you have migrated to the heavens, or I receive even a small letter from you. I have always discussed all my affairs in those letters I sent to you, and now my status is the same as it was when I wrote to you during the autumn fair in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>The plague has completely ceased, but we are oppressed by the high cost of provisions. In these days, rumors of war have begun to spread. Some say that the army, which is known to be gathering in Italy under the auspices of the Pope and the King of Spain, is intended to march against the Bernese and us. Others affirm that those legions are being conscripted against Flanders and Brabant, so that, once these are subdued, they may also attack and compel other evangelical princes and cities of Germany to accept the decrees of the Council of Trent. There are also those who say that the Turk is preparing and will invade Italy in the spring, and thus soldiers and cavalry are being prepared against Turkish incursions. - What will happen, time will tell. We trust in the Lord and pray, may your will be done, whether it wishes us to be conquered or to conquer; we are his, both living and dead. As I promised in the Preface to Daniel, I have now, with God's help, published 190 Homilies on the most excellent prophet, written by me. I pray to God to bless my labors and that they may be fruitful for the church. Certainly, I have prepared these with great effort and I thank God, who has deemed my work worthy in this matter. To you, my dearest friend, I send a copy and I pray that you consider this gift kindly, that you commend me to God in your prayers and at least write something to me when you have the opportunity.</p>
      <p>Greet the most distinguished man, Mr. Andreas, most kindly from me. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 5, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
