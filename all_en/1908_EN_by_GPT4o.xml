      <p>Greetings. I wish indeed, most distinguished man, that from my previous letters, which I had sent to gain your goodwill, you could have as easily perceived how much I have always valued your dignity and authority, as I had poured out that letter from the heart of your observant one. Embrace, as I have long done for you, both absent and unknown, with your usual and innate candor; for you are not of such a nature that you would want to reject someone who greatly honors and reveres you, or to dismiss those who are connected to you by paternal ties, or, when you cannot have a person eager for you as a familiar in person, you would not want to embrace his spirit, however unknown, with your mind and thought. Words indeed are not enough to explain to you how much it matters to me to renew the acquaintance and alliance once made through my late parent, and to retain it intact as it was passed on to me. Therefore, if those letters have perhaps not been delivered to you, I earnestly ask again and again that you attribute this to the friendship that still exists between you and my father, so that, even if your acquaintance with me first arose from small beginnings, your goodwill towards me may be strengthened and established by that incredible love with which you pursue my parent. Regarding the boy about whom I recently wrote to you about sending to your city, necessity demands that I refresh your memory, or, if you have not yet received my letters, I beg you to easily agree to my request.</p>
      <p>We have decided to send a noble young man from Bavaria there, so that he may build some education upon the foundations of good disciplines, which he has scarcely laid correctly, and so that from a tender age he may imbibe the true worship of God, and therefore be less in the sight of his compatriots, who perhaps would hold him in contempt for that reason, we have chosen your city of Zürich as the most suitable among many. Whether he should bring a teacher with him to be instructed by, or whether he could find public or private ones there under whom he might make progress, I recently consulted you in more detail. Therefore, you would do a most gracious thing if you would add to your merits towards us by informing us without delay about all these matters, which you can infer we desire from you. We would like a host who would both oversee him and provide sustenance for his maintenance. I therefore ask you in the greatest manner not to refuse to take on this care and to consider that whatever you contribute to this matter, you are contributing to the most grateful people. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, June 23, 1553. Augsburg, Swabia. My parent sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Entirely devoted to your kindness, Raphael Seiler, son of Geryon.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, foremost professor of theology, his lord and teacher, to be honored with utmost faith and respect.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
