      <p>To the most excellent men Wolfgang Rüpplin, Peter Simler, and Andreas Hofmann, and the other brothers, Heinrich Bullinger wishes grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have finally completed, most excellent men, those books on the prophet which I have inscribed and which you have demanded with such insistence. If I have accomplished what you expected, I am glad. But if I have not exactly met everyone's expectations, what else can they do but consider our work favorably? For they know well how reluctantly I undertook this task and how persistently I referred it to more learned men for consultation, indeed, that I was compelled to write more by their insistence than by my own rashness. Now, when they see that I have accomplished what was possible amidst great turmoil of affairs, in the shortest time, and indeed in the very beginning of sacred literature, surely they will attribute any shortcomings to their insistence, not to me, if they find anything worthy of revision or correction. We still refer them to the teachings of more learned men, if there are any who handle the whole matter with writings. For we offer nothing but modest contributions; partly translated here from other authors, partly from what we have achieved through long practice of reading, writing, and handling. And those things which we once observed in sacred reading, we have here condensed, so that you might call it an introduction or elementary prophetic work rather than a prophet. However the matter stands, what we have written, we dedicate to the name of you all for no other reason than to promote your studies, if it can be done in any way.</p>
      <p>May the God of knowledge, understanding, and all virtue open your eyes in His law, so that you may seek Him with a pure heart, true love, and unfeigned faith [1 Tim 1:5]. So be it!</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>From our common retreat in Kappel, the day before the calends of September in the year 1525.</p>
