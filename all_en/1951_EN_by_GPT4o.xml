      <p> Greetings. Since our Lycosthenes has been absent for four days now and is not expected to return for several more days, having been called by his sick father with all his family, I dared to open your letters addressed to him, especially since I understood from this young man that you are very eager for a response from Lycosthenes himself. Therefore, when I came across the letters of the Bishop of Bayonne and understood that you wished them to be sent back to you, I decided to transcribe them so that I could give them to our returning Lycosthenes immediately. For, although you have otherwise urged him not to share them with any mortal, I ask you, my dear Bullinger, not to be offended that they have been read and transcribed by me, whom you can truly consider as half of Lycosthenes' soul, and never think that they will be shared by me with anyone except our Lycosthenes alone. As for the catalog of recent events, I was glad to learn of it, although I otherwise live so securely in all things that I never understand anything of all that happens here and there and everywhere, and I remain perpetually at home, deaf to all rumors, and fully engaged in my typographic occupations, so much so that if any storm or shipwreck threatens, I not only do not go out to watch, but I act so securely that even storms about to overwhelm me do not frighten me. So, as far as this part is concerned, Lycosthenes alone, who is accustomed to visit me every day when he is at home, serves as my ears and eyes alone. But I cease, for I do not have time. I would gladly write something back to you, except that I might justly seem like a pumice stone wanting to supply water to the sea. Therefore, I beg you, my dear Bullinger, forgive our occupations and do not attribute to curiosity the fact that I dared to open the letters written to Lycosthenes; I thought they contained something else, which perhaps you would want to be taken care of immediately by Lycosthenes, and in his absence, I hoped to be able to attend to it in your favor, and certainly, whatever it might have been, I would have done it gladly in your and his name. </p>
      <p> Otherwise, for the fact that you greet me so dutifully and kindly now and almost always in your letters to him and sometimes even gift me with your booklets, I give great thanks and wish that an opportunity may be given to me someday to declare my feelings towards you in return. I am sending a booklet by Engelbert on the end and origin of the Roman Empire, but such as could have been written at the time when Engelbert lived. However, the times are now very different, which can be considered as commentaries on the former. But I cease. Farewell and pray to the Lord for me. Basel, August 6, 1553. </p>
      <p> Johannes Oporinus, yours sincerely. </p>
      <p> Give my warmest regards to D. Pellicanus in my name, and excuse the fact that I have not written back to him either; there was not enough time. I will take care, as much as I can, that the oration of our Theodor to the princes of Germany can be printed; but I wish it had been sent sooner; for I am so occupied with completing some things already begun that I do not know where to turn. The importunity and wickedness of the workers and the shortness of the time remaining until the upcoming fair add to this. But the Lord, I hope, will be with us. Farewell again and again, my dear Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the best and most learned man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, his master and friend, especially esteemed. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
