      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Here, this pitiable old man is caring for his son at home (whom you know as Johannes Gingi), who has been struck down by paralysis, while in the meantime, he is being required to fulfill the duty of teaching. However, since he is not unaware of how important it is to have someone to oversee his affairs, he has entrusted this difficult task to no one more quickly than to you, most learned Zwingli, because you, with your vigilant care for the churches, are both able and willing to assist. For there are many among you who are suitable for these matters. We therefore beseech you to devote yourself to us, and especially to the sheep of Christ in this matter, and finally to consider our boldness kindly, with which we dare to disturb your more serious studies. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>November 24, 1529.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger</p>
      <p>To Huldrych Zwingli, dearest brother.</p>
