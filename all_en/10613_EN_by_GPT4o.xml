    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends Johannes Lang as an honest and faithfully concerned shepherd for his congregation for the parish [Veltheim] located near Winterthur. He has negotiated with Theodor [Bibliander] about his Greek textbook, but asks Bullinger to persuade the printer - who is apparently out for profit - to publish the work.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The opportunity to send you a letter was provided by Johannes Lang, undoubtedly so busy that he scarcely has the leisure to read it. But to return to the matter at hand. There is a place near the walls of Winterthur where an evangelist is desired. Johannes Lang has been summoned by some people, so that if he is approved by you and those like you, he may be appointed to this preaching function. Since this must be done properly, that is, no one should be appointed to this teaching office unless he has first lived and spent time in such a way that he is well-regarded, I will describe him as I have experienced him so far. He has taught and preached, and lived in such a manner that no word, no speech unworthy of that man has reached my ears. To me, he is considered a harmless and innocent man, so that no one should or could doubt his integrity. He does not seem to me to be as concerned about himself and his own affairs (God forbid) as he is about his sheep entrusted to his faith, whose care our Lord Christ wanted to be the first priority. To make this recommendation more ample and effective among all preachers of the word, they know the voice of the Lord spoken to Peter, commending the flock of all his sheep: "Peter," he said, "if you love me, feed my sheep" [John 21:15-17], as if our Lord were saying: There will be no regard for my sheep among those who do not love God. Therefore, if it seems good to the Lord that he be appointed by you as censors of this order, we all pray with common wishes that he and others preaching the gospel in the Tigurine field may win as many brothers as possible for our Lord Christ, so that when this life is over, we may shine in heaven like stars, as many as we will have instructed others in righteousness.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have discussed the Grammar with Theodor [Bibliander]. If you can, I ask you to remind the printer to publish it; but your printer, like others of this order, seeks profit in printing; when no hope of profit appears, they work for no one.</p>
      <p>Love me, as you do. Farewell with your most praiseworthy family, whom you should greet most dutifully, including Pellican and others.</p>
      <p>April 18, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Ludwig Lopadius.</p>
      <p>To the man of distinguished piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend.</p>
