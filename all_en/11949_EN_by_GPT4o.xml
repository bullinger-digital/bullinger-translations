    <p xml:id="regest1">In the wake of the Reformation and partly following the example of Zürich and other cities, they have founded a school in place of the monastery, but are finding it difficult to find local teachers. Therefore, they request to borrow their compatriot Johannes Pontisella as a schoolmaster for one to three years at Pentecost.</p>

      <p>Our friendly greetings beforehand, along with what we wish for love, honor, and good, well-learned, worthy, honorable, and wise, dear gentlemen.</p>
      <p>As everyone knows and it is evident, that God the Lord, out of His grace, has allowed His eternal word to be brought forth and proclaimed almost throughout the entire world, and the sound of it has resounded, through which, as it has also come to us, we have been informed, learned, and God the Lord has granted us so much grace, that many human inventions, ordinances, and good opinions, used in the service of God (in which also the monastery and monk's work were found useless), have fallen away, primarily moved and partly taken as an example from you and other honorable cities, instead of the monastery work, open schools have been established, and thereby the youth are instructed in good arts and manners, to the praise of God and the honor, benefit, and good of the common land, which we have been striving for a year, two or three, and are entirely determined to continue to open (promote) and not let go, but in this matter, we lack workers (as in such and also in the harvest of God, reapers and workers are sought by us), we are caused by the previous well-demonstrated friendships, shown by you, to ask you very diligently, if you would help us with a suitable and learned man, as a schoolmaster, and that he might reach us by next Pentecost (if possible). And especially, since our compatriots might be more acceptable to us than others, we earnestly request and diligently desire, that you would lend us ours, who is now yours, Johannes Pontisella, for one year, two or three, as you please. In good hope, we will also find ours in the meantime, who may be of service to us here. We also intend to ensure that (as we hope) we will be found grateful to you and him. We confidently rely on such friendship and other things from you, in the hope that you will comply with our necessary request. We ask you very diligently, for the sake of grace, to be obliged to do so.</p>
      <p>Dated and sealed with the common God's house's own seal on the 28th day of April in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>The council and assembly of the common God's house, now gathered in Chur.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, worthy, and honorable gentlemen, the leaders and servants of the holy gospel and word of God of the church community chapter in Zürich, our dear lords and good friends.</p>
