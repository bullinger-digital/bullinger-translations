    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to Bullinger's inquiry concerning the duties of the authorities in religious matters. The protection and support of the true doctrine of faith should be ensured by the authorities, who, as a Christian entity through which Christ rules, are best equipped for this task. Against those who hinder the sound doctrine of the Gospel, the council should proceed with punishments by the power of the law. The Acts of the Apostles and the letters of Paul provide evidence supporting this view. It is the duty of the clergy to remind the authorities of their task or, if necessary, to call them to order. Bucer laments the negligence of the Strasbourg council towards the Anabaptists. The example of the Bohemian Brethren, who are able to enforce strict discipline in matters of faith without the help of the authorities, does not count as an argument against his view according to Bucer.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You ask too much of me, if you consider my ability, which is hardly sufficient for my will. I am currently occupied with many matters of no small importance. However, if I do not fully meet your expectations, it will be a consolation that you yourself are sufficient for this. But to the point. The difference between Christians is most certainly judged by what we consider Christ to be for us. For He must live in us. Now Christ has been made for us not only as our savior but also as the restorer of all things that in any way benefit the human race. Therefore, He did not abolish what is of nature or of the law, but He made it so that both could be used beneficially. The magistrate in any republic is both of nature and of the law. Therefore, he is not abolished by the gospel, but restored, not only so that Christians may observe and honor him more religiously, but also, if any of them are called to hold the office of magistrate, they may hold it more sacredly. And so, as it is his duty to restrain evils that can be recognized by man, without distinction, so he will most severely restrain those sins against religion, by which souls are led away from Christ. But he will punish men according to the measure of their perverse will. For he who, being mad, kills many, is not killed in return. For there is no full will while reason is impeded. Therefore, he will be more lenient with those who sin out of simple error, but he will still restrain them, lest they harm the Lord's flock unwittingly. He is the shepherd and protector of this flock, because he is [!] bearing the office of Christ. For to Him the Father has given all power in heaven and on earth and has set Him above all principalities, powers, and authorities [Eph 1, 21]. The kingdom of Christ is in the spirit, but not in a way that is hidden, but that is exercised everywhere in promoting the benefits of men, both private and public, for the fulfillment of the law is in the love of neighbor. And what is more sacred, what is more beneficial to human affairs than the legitimate administration of the republic? Who has not recognized, both among the pagans and the saints, that a good prince, a religious magistrate, is the image of God? Therefore, as a Christian accomplishes all things that are beneficial, that bring utility to men, when called to them, most perfectly, who does not see that a Christian magistrate will most severely restrain all evils and most persistently promote all goods, with greater care and zeal, the more harmful the evils or the more excellent the goods? But nothing is more pernicious than those things that hinder religion, just as nothing is as salutary as restoring religion, which is done when the doctrine from which faith arises is rightly taught and, so that it may be heard religiously, all are invited, and no one is called away or hindered from it. It is indeed the primary power in the republic to ensure that in public, piety is taught, that all are attracted to this doctrine, that there are no stumbling blocks from which anyone might be led away from it. The magistrate bears this power. What is it to rule? Is it not, as far as possible, to direct the actions of all whom you govern to the end of the good, which the republic seeks? No one rules more perfectly than a Christian, because Christ lives and rules in him. And shall we exempt from the magistrate's authority that action in which the entire salvation and the greatest ruin of the republic are involved, namely, the doctrine of faith? Paul subjects every soul to the magistrate. Chrysostom, interpreting this passage, says: "Even if you are an apostle, if an evangelist." He testifies that the care of good things and the repulsion of evils is simply entrusted to him by divine authority. By what reasoning will we dare to withdraw from the magistrate's providence the good things, whose care is of the utmost necessity, and the evils, than which nothing can be equally harmful to the republic, namely, those that concern religion? "Because religion consists of the spirit." Was it not the same before? Surely God always required faith, which is nothing but spirit, from His people. By this alone were His people, Heb. 11. Nevertheless, it was capital to introduce superstition, to contradict sound doctrine, by the law given by the Lord, who abominates everything where faith is lacking. We are not another people, because we are grafted into the natural olive tree, although we ought to be greater and more mature in spirit. But however spiritual we may be, are not the Galatians today also led away from the gospel? Does not the pestilential doctrine now also spread like cancer? Is there not today in those places where piety and all things of human life are more rightly held, where the magistrate takes care of religion? Compare yourselves and the Immontans. You desire many things among you. The magistrate does not watch everywhere sufficiently. Yet how golden are your ways compared to their morals? Here the magistrate, softened by old leniency and overwhelmed by a crowd of affairs and even sinners, acts more remissly in the cause of religion than in Constance. Hence, good God, what diversity I see among us. The law does not benefit the just alone, it is necessary for the wicked, very useful for the mediocre. The things of Christ consist in the spirit, but here it cannot thrive unless the contumacy of the flesh is repressed. This is indeed repressed by the authority of good laws and the severe command of the magistrate. The law is still set against everything "that is contrary to sound doctrine" 1 Timoth. 1 [10]. The law not only commands and prohibits but also punishes. The magistrate is the minister of the law, therefore it is his duty to enact laws that promote religion, that is, the doctrine of religion, and to punish those who oppose it, stumbling blocks no less of false doctrine than of depraved life. In sum, Christ diminishes nothing that is useful to men, but perfects it, therefore also the magistrate. Therefore, when Christians hold this office, they will both procure good things better and repel evils more securely, and the first things are those that pertain to religion. For where piety is not taught or what is taught piously is held in no esteem, no evil does not reign. For there Satan prevails, just as Christ, where His laws prevail. The law is not abolished for those who admit anything that is contrary to the gospel. It dictates penalties for those who teach impiously and contradict the sound doctrine administered by the priests. Therefore, the magistrate should execute these laws. What do those who seek the authority of the word of God through Satan object to this? "The Christian people are spontaneous and spiritual." So were the ancients, whoever believed in God. "But we are more. Therefore, let not spurs be applied to those who run willingly, but let those be removed that hinder them from running willingly." It will be from the word that you will want willingly. Therefore, it must be ensured that it is preached to you purely and with authority, and therefore those who attempt otherwise must be restrained. "Christ and the apostles handed down nothing of the sort" - frankly, they testify that they establish the law, that is, the doctrine of good things handed down through Moses. Paul testifies to instruct for salvation. "Christ taught nothing but faith and love, did not touch on individual duties." Paul, having established churches, touched on those duties that were in the churches. John advised and persuaded Herod of many things, whom when he had killed, Christ rightly did not want to preach to the malicious fox. The magistrates of the Jews had not yet been moved to believe in Him. What then would He have commanded them concerning duties? Paul addressed Sergius and Agrippa in this way, admonished Ananias the priest to make a good judgment according to the law, so that you can easily see how diligently he would have admonished about everything if he had magistrates listening to him. But what need is there for words? Both refer to the law, it is not abrogated except in ceremonies, which were that middle wall by which the Jews were separated from the Gentiles, and the shadows of Christ. The magistrate is now a useful gift of God. Now the freedom of the law is only for those who willingly do the law. Therefore, since the law must be received in all things that are contrary to the gospel, it will not be allowed to permit bad doctrine to spread with impunity. And what kind of reasoning is "There is no command in the gospels or the apostle about this, therefore it does not suit us"? Peter killed those who lied to the Holy Spirit, Paul handed over those who barked against the gospel to Satan, from which Elimas was immediately made blind. If it now suits the evangelical spirit to punish in this extraordinary way, it will also be allowed in the ordinary way. For this spirit does not admit in any way what does not suit itself. This same spirit also acts in the Christian magistrate, while he uses the usual instruments of punishment, as it acted in Peter and Paul using unusual ones, namely words alone. To kill is to kill, to afflict with blindness and diseases is what is said, by whatever means, by whatever instrument. "But the apostles did not use common instruments." Nor should you, if you bear only the office of the word as they did. But as you concede that those who are called to the medical office do well when they heal with ordinary means, even if the apostles would accomplish it by the word, so acknowledge that magistrates also do well when they punish adversaries of sound doctrine with the instruments of their vocation, namely the sword, just as the apostles with their own, namely words. "But ministers of the spirit should not exhort to this." Why so? Does the spirit of Christ fulfill all offices? Does it matter for human salvation as much that magistrates take care that the simple hearts are not seduced from Christ by pestilential doctrine, as that servants serve with good faith, which Paul thought should be admonished, because he had servants in his churches, he did not have magistrates? Certainly, either the function of the magistrate in impious doctrine must be impious or it must be carried out from the spirit of Christ, by which the sons of God are led. If we now admit that it is a holy work and therefore of the spirit of Christ alone, surely the minister of the spirit will teach this and exhort to this.</p>
      <p>But here it must be observed that this evil has something peculiar. Some harm by being occupied with simple error without malice. With these, it must be dealt with as with the insane. These, even if they cause much harm, even with slaughter and arson, are not killed, but they are bound so that they may no longer harm. So it must be done with most heretics. Impious doctrine must simply be warded off, men punished according to the measure of their malice. But often, because of the ignorance of men, the truths cannot be fully explained, always considering what edifies. Our affairs should be such that we are all one body, which Christ governs. Hence it was the duty of the ministers of the word to impel each member to its use, and more diligently those whose offices are of greater importance. But Satan, who omits nothing to dissolve this structure of the body of Christ, has made it so that if you admonish the magistrate of his duty everywhere, you do not always benefit the church. Therefore, the dispenser of the word must be prudent, to say everything in place and in a way that brings fruit. Then it must be remembered that the offices of the word and the sword are distinct, each having its operation of the spirit. Hence it will always be the duty of the ministers of the word to show the magistrate the end of his actions, to which he should go, what to aim for, namely, that the subjects may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all piety and honesty, also, if he deviates from this end, to admonish, but how he may reach his end in individual matters, this must be left to his spirit, which, however, must always be aided by the commendation of the end and prayers, as in the present case. Some Anabaptist is raging against the church. The magistrate is inactive, either because he does not think this is his duty or is otherwise negligent. Here, first, the enemy of truth must be declared before the church by the word of God, people must be diligently called away from him, then the magistrate must be admonished to have greater care for his flock and not allow wolves to rage thus; evils must be warded off from him, men saved as much as possible. But in what way he should restrain such a one, I think this should now be left to his spirit, this always being inculcated, that such a pest must be restrained. It is our duty to seek the soul first and to show the general reasons for duties. It is also objected that no one should be compelled to faith, that faith cannot be governed by the sword. These are true, but they are said to no purpose. We do not want to promote faith, but the doctrine of faith, so we do not want to restrain perfidy, but blasphemies. Faith and perfidy are matters of the heart, which no man can judge. Judgments must be made from words and deeds, and those so evident that they can be proven by witnesses, which are made by men.</p>
      <p>My Bullinger, I have experienced from these spirits, who want to remove the magistrate from the cause of religion, that I am most certain in our Lord Jesus Christ that they are truly satellites of Satan doing this, so that, with the society of the church disturbed and the authority of the word undermined, he may recover his kingdom and make our latter state worse than the former.</p>
      <p>It somewhat troubles some good people that the zeal of the magistrate in the cause of religion has not turned out well among you. But that certainly does not come from the fact that they cared for religion, but because they either did not care sincerely or not in a just manner. I confess and have confessed before that we here feared lest more should be sought from many than any external profession of the gospel, which would be a political gospel, than the faith of the gospel. Not only private individuals but also magistrates willing to promote the gospel must strive greatly to ensure that the gospel is recognized as the doctrine of salvation, seeking nothing but the salvation of men.</p>
      <p>Then it also moves that among the Moravians, the cause of Christ is better without the help of the magistrate than among us, where we employ the magistrate's help. Those whom this argument impels, I wish they had seen them in person. Church discipline is very effective, but undoubtedly they would find them to be men. Then, since the kingdom of Christ must be defended to the ends of the earth and the gospel preached to every creature, I do not know how this separation can stand. But suppose it is so, that everything is right among them: Will you make this your cause, because their magistrates are evil, that is, they do not do their duty and prove themselves liars in that they pray: "Thy kingdom come" [Mt. 6, 10]? God forbid. The grace of God is the cause, which has established such discipline among them. Now the grace of God is not hindered by grace among us, but by sins. What they do rightly is by the grace of the magistrates. This is what we lack, church discipline, from which our laziness, not the magistrate, hinders us. Who prevents you from doing everything that the Moravians do? Since I remembered the Moravians, know that they wrote that they do not recognize your edition of their booklet but the Wittenberg edition; the interpreter of your edition has erred. Let the more perfect join, let them attract others. Truly, truly, Satan seeks monasteries, seeks Pharisees. But we are so constituted that what we sin by our laziness, we always cast the blame on others, and we are especially born to want to consult matters with ordinances, when we ought to have done so with faith and diligence.</p>
      <p>I am very busy. Now I cannot say more, and fewer words were enough for you who only seek what I think here and on what I rely. For I also wish that whoever explains his opinion to me would also explain on what he bases it, and what he answers to objections. Thus, at last, it is clear what the mind thinks in any matter, what the faith is. You have what I could give now. If you desire anything, I will give it another time. But you, my Bullinger, do the same and make us aware of your opinion here and on what it is based. The Lord has given us a concordant spirit in other matters, I wish to see if also here. It cannot be said how you have approved yourself to the people of Constance for the same concord. They praise you so effusively for this as well as for your other virtues. I am very glad that your affairs are going well. Let us not cease. The Lord will be with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, October 29, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>I could not paint better. I had it copied, but the messenger could not wait. I beg you, return this letter to me with the next messenger.</p>
