      <p>May the grace of Christ be with you. Let our Hospinianus serve as the letter, my dear Bullinger, pious and esteemed brother in Christ. Without a doubt, he will faithfully convey all our matters to you. Even if I tried to write more, I cannot, as I have been suffering severely from erysipelas for almost eight days now, so much so that I can only move from my bed with the help of a staff, etc. I consider this illness, if it pleases the divine will, to be potentially fatal to me at some point; it troubles me so severely, inconveniently, and frequently. May the Lord's will be done. Hospinianus will inform you about how our neighbors in Kaisersberg are proceeding with the Monasterians in the valley of St. Gregory. Baron von Rappoltstein is consulting with the Prince of Montbéliard, seeking advice on how to respond to the adversaries in Ensisheim, etc. Farewell in Christ Jesus. Pray to God for me through Jesus Christ, amen. Greet all the brothers by name.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, June 4, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours most sincerely, Erb.</p>
      <p>Dear Mr. Bullinger, please assist Hospinianus with about 10 agendas, so that we can communicate them to the reborn churches and be in agreement in the administration of the sacraments, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, especially in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, esteemed brother.</p>
