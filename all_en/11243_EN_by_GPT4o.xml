    <p xml:id="regest1">Uses the passage of the Zurich messenger to write. According to [Jakob] Bedrot, Bucer negotiated with Anabaptists in Hesse, then traveled to Luther and will return to Marburg on November 25th to participate in the [Ziegenhain] Synod. The English King [Henry VIII] is said to have ordered all monasteries to be demolished and the bones of Thomas Becket to be publicly burned. The imposition of the ban over Minden has greatly angered Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony and Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse. Still knows nothing certain about the dispute between Nuremberg and Margrave [Georg] of Brandenburg. [Cheireddin] Barbarossa has driven Andrea Doria and the Venetians into flight, and Moldavia is said to have been completely taken by the Turks. Although the decision in the matter of Schwenckfeld and Franck has been postponed, Frecht hopes for the victory of truth, as Schwenckfeld, probably under the influence of the godless Michael Servetus, wants to prove the uncreated nature of Christ's human nature and accuses Oecolampadius and Zwingli of Nestorianism; Frecht combats Schwenckfeld's fallacy that Christ, as a whole person conceived by the Holy Spirit, is the Son of God and therefore not created, with the Bible and with patristic commentaries such as that of Chrysostom on the Gospel of John and that of Jerome on the Epistle to the Ephesians and expects Melanchthon's support. Greetings. Requests a reply and sends greetings to the young Englishman [John Butler?].</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I did not want to send back your messenger returning from Austria to you without my letters, even though I do not have anything readily available that is worthy of your knowledge. But if I have anything, I fear it may be old news by the time it reaches you.</p>
      <p>Jakob Bedrot wrote from Strasbourg these days that Bucer, called by the most pious Prince of Hesse, negotiated with the Anabaptists, of whom Hesse has not a few from the remnants of MÃ¼nster, and after the matter was settled, he went to Luther, and from there he will return to Marburg on St. Catherine's Day, where by the prince's order he will attend the synod to be held there.</p>
      <p>Then from England, it was reported that the king ordered all monasteries to be leveled to the ground and the bones of Thomas Becket to be publicly exhumed and burned as those of a seditious and heretical man; a strange change, that those who were once considered saints are now deemed heretics, and those who were recently heretics are now considered saints.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we will console ourselves in the Lord, hoping that even on this occasion those who consider us the most heretical may finally soften, as the imperial chamber's judgment recently set an example by proscribing the evangelical city of Minden by ban. What audacity, as our Bucer is said to have written to Strasbourg, has greatly angered both the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse. What will be the end of such great confidence? Therefore, it is not surprising if what many good men predict for the stiff-necked people of the pope and the rather secure evangelical people finally results in an outcome worthy of the acts.</p>
      <p>But about these things, when our Bucer returns home, you will be able to have more certain information, which the Lord may grant.</p>
      <p>Regarding the tumultuous affair of the Nurembergers and the Margrave of Brandenburg, I can write nothing certain now; for our envoys, who have been absent for over a month, have not yet returned. However, the rumor is that the soldiers are being dismissed and that this tumult among the neighbors is to be consigned to the grave, even though many predict this fire, which ought to burn, for the evangelicals, if there has been collusion with the Nurembergers.</p>
      <p>About the Turks, there is absolutely nothing certain. Perhaps the bearer of these letters, who was in Vienna, will tell something. From Augsburg, Mercury brings news of his own, for what do our merchants not write, even things to be proscribed. Now the Turkish pirate Barbarossa has forced Andrea Doria, the imperial commander, and the Venetians to retreat. It is now said that the Turk has subjugated all of Moldavia. But these are mercurial matters; some good people say that the emperor is entirely in arms so that the Turk may finally feel that Charles wants to attack not the Lutherans, but the Constantinopolitans. But enough about these things.</p>
      <p>The public and political and ecclesiastical matters would be well if we finally lived according to the gospel, preaching repentance and faith. The sectarians, as they teach other things, begin to raise their crests from indulgence; for the case of Schwenckfeld (who is staying today with his host, our consul) and Franck has been postponed for further investigation. In this labor, however, I am striving for the truth to finally prevail. Therefore, you will pray, my Bullinger, to the Lord, that we may once sing a pious encomium, for I see that Schwenckfeld wants to prove by all means, perhaps from the impious Michael Servetus, that Christ according to humanity is not to be believed to be a creature. Schwenckfeld, as I suspect, dares to accuse Oecolampadius and Zwingli, fathers of holy memory, of the crime of Nestorianism. For he thinks, if it pleases the gods, that the pneumatic chrestologus divides the person in Christ if we confess Christ as a man to be a creature in a catholic manner.</p>
      <p>Indeed, he seems to be so insane as to deny the lineaments of the members in the body of Christ. Thus Satan strives to glorify Christ, when through his apostles he wants to deny that he, as a man conceived by the Holy Spirit and as a man the Son of God, is a creature. This, however, was told to me today by someone who spent time with Schwenckfeld, who proposed to him the annotations of Oecolampadius on the first chapter of the Gospel of John, which he himself rejected as Nestorian. For he always relies on this argument: According to the whole person, Christ conceived by the Holy Spirit is the Son of God, therefore not a creature; for the name of creature is servile, which conflicts with Christ as a man more than diametrically. For Christ as a man is Lord, therefore not a creature. To this fallacy, I oppose scripture and the ancients. For Chrysostom in the first chapter of John, homily 2, refers Christ constituted as Lord by the Father to the reason of a creature, and Jerome clearly testifies this in the second chapter of Ephesians.</p>
      <p>But I do not want to make you, otherwise occupied, more occupied with these matters. Indeed, you will have me perpetually bound as a client to you, who have faithfully assisted me in this cause. Melanchthon, to whom I wrote about this matter two months ago, will, as I hope, send his support with our Bucer. This war is common; for Schwenckfeld devotes all curses to those who hold that the man Christ as a man is a creature. This spirit also has other perverse doctrines, about which more another time.</p>
      <p>These things fell from me, very busy and now about to go to the sermon and declaim, which you will consider favorably for your remarkable humanity. Farewell well with the lords and brothers, Mr. Pellican, Leo, Megander, Bibliander, and the rest who love us. November 24, 1538, in Ulm of the Swabians.</p>
      <p>Martin Frecht.</p>
      <p>As usual, may you deign to have this faithful messenger commended with your lords and, if possible, write back in time, and bid the young Englishman greet from me. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the excellently pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, his superior in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
