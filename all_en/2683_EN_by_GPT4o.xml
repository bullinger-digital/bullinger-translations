      <p>S. My most esteemed Bullinger, I am greatly concerned that the papist factions of the Swiss, who have begun to hope for the recovery of our people, that is, to draw them into their own votes, may achieve their aim, and that we may fail in our own desire. This is because the senate has once clearly declared that unless the request for the customary oath formula, given to the evangelical cities, can be obtained from you and the Bernese with grace, they will consent to the papists, after it has been made free for them and their citizens to swear as they please. But they also urge us to put some delay on this excellent and necessary work for the sacred sermons, and to cease from criticizing, as we have begun. This matter has struck us deeply, as we fear this great deflection, devised by the cunning of the ancient deceiver, will lead to a more serious ruin of piety. We consider it no less than a bloody crime, which we do not cease to accumulate through this new one, and the Lord, by just permission, punishes us, so that we incline more blindly each day towards the destruction of such a great light of the word. Nevertheless, we will perform our duty and frankly show the leaders themselves first, and then the senate, how much offense to the Lord, scandal to all churches, grief to the pious, and how pernicious an example against the profession of received evangelical piety and common baptism these things will be, if what has been decreed is carried out in action. We will urge them, as befits a prudent magistrate, to consider more rightly such a momentous matter with themselves, and to strive to approve themselves to God rather than to men, especially those so hostile to sincere religion. I wanted you, my dearest brother, to know this, so that you may first assist us with your prayers, lest our efforts be in vain, which we cannot and should not interrupt, not only privately within walls, but, if nothing is achieved there, also publicly before the church, regardless of the indignation that may follow against us, because we have thus freed our consciences. Then, so that you may more ardently press your people, so that either the oath may be suspended or any other way may be found to prevent such a great evil. I am sending the history of Polish affairs, and since I have only this copy, as another could not be transcribed, I ask you to return it. I will write at the first opportunity, where it is stuck in the diets. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. Basel, the last day of July, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, while the remaining peace concerning religion has not been unhappily established, it is stuck on the point that the chosen ones, the "UÃŸschutz," have declared that those who wish to leave one side and adhere to the other religious profession may do so with their reputation and revenues intact. While the princes have simply approved this, the bishops except themselves to the extent that those who renounce papism and embrace the gospel may indeed keep their reputation, but they lose their revenues and their administration. The princes persist, wanting equality to be maintained on both sides, and they understand that if this point is obtained, it will immediately give a great accession to the gospel, but they fear it will soon be joined with their own ruin. Therefore, they oppose with all their might, aided by the cunning of some jurists, so that it is to be feared that all efforts may come to nothing and tumults may follow.</p>
      <p>May the Lord restrain the plans of the wicked and mercifully propagate His kingdom.</p>
