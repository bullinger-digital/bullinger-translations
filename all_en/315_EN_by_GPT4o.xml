      <p>S. P. Without a doubt, dearest lord, you are wondering why I am not replying to you through Curio or Naogeorgus. Therefore, I will now explain the reasons: Curio, having received a response from the consul, hurried his departure so much that I could not write, especially since I was also detained by other matters; Naogeorgus, on the other hand, left as untimely as he conducted all his affairs. He came to me on October 20th; he had stayed at a public inn. I did not want to leave him there; however, I had difficulty bringing him to my house.</p>
      <p>I was discussing and conversing with him about various matters, diligently inquiring about the state of his affairs, promising all my efforts, and indicating to him that the highest class of our school was vacant; I could easily arrange for him to be appointed to this position (since he seemed to desire an academic rather than an ecclesiastical function).</p>
      <p>In the meantime, however, I sensed that he was of a completely doubtful mind and had not yet fully decided with himself what he would do, whether he wanted to come to these regions or not, and whether he would accept a position with us. He always lamented changing his place, leaving Swabia; he thought he could still obtain quite favorable conditions there, that he had some promises from Fugger and other wealthy individuals who wanted to entrust their children to him for private instruction, and that he could still live safely in Kaufbeuren, though outside the ministry.</p>
      <p>I also sensed that he was entirely contemplating a defection from the ministry and rather wanted to engage in some kind of business or devote himself to civil law and legal actions. In short, he seemed to me to be so distracted that he had no certain plan for his affairs. I advised him to consider everything that he would have to endure later with the persecution growing more severe, rather than the favorable condition he might now obtain, and I omitted nothing by which I thought I could persuade him to apply his mind to us, casting aside all ambiguity. But he, always the same, did not want me to say anything to the senate about him.</p>
      <p>However, I did not do this. I spoke to D. Jodocus and other friends, invited many good men to a gathering, and so that they could speak to him about this matter. I also consulted our chief scribe and other senatorial men. They all advised that he should stay here and that I should inform the senate of his arrival; however, they advised me to delay for a few days until the consuls and quaestor Haller returned; for they were all absent at that time. But I could not extract anything certain from him.</p>
      <p>Finally, it came to this, that he proposed these conditions to me, which if I could obtain, he would accept the position: 1. that he be allowed to remain in Kaufbeuren until the Feast of the Purification; he could not come before then; 2. that a position be assigned to him for a certain number of years; 3. that all expenses for transporting his belongings be paid to him, and some such things. I indeed promised my efforts, but I warned that I would have difficulty obtaining them; for the school could not remain vacant for so long. However, I asked him to delay for a few days, as the chief scribe had advised, until the consuls returned. But I do not know what came to his mind again; he denied everything again; he said he would go to Kaufbeuren, did not want to wait long for this or another, nor could he come before the next spring.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it would be in vain if the school could not remain vacant for so long. When I saw that he could not be retained at all, I still asked him to wait at least one more day for the sake of friends, who would gladly have shown him hospitality; I also promised to arrange for him to have travel expenses from the lords. I hoped I had at least obtained this from him, and with this hope, I went to bed on the night of October 21st. The next morning, at the break of dawn, he regretted the matter again; he got up and, despite my dissuasion, left, asking only that I handle his case with the senate myself and write to him if I achieved anything.</p>
      <p>Thus, his business was conducted. I wanted to write to you through him, asking him to delay for a while. But he said he would not return to Zurich, but would go straight through Baden to Constance. I could not sufficiently marvel at such obstinacy; I am ashamed now to have indicated his cause and presence to the senators; since he could not wait for a decision, they might have seemed to be deceived. He also wanted to take his booklet on ecclesiastical doctrines with him; but I managed, with many entreaties, to have him leave it with me. Thus, he departed.</p>
      <p>As for Curio's business, without a doubt, he himself has reported to you; he has been accepted, provided he brings some public testimonies of his conduct. As soon as a position becomes vacant, it will be granted to him. I cannot promote him to our city's school, because he seems somewhat lighter than this position requires, and I would make both him and myself odious by this action. Let him wait for my letters; I will call him as soon as it seems convenient, and I will not forget him. Blaurer has diligently recommended him to me; he also recommends another named Meister, whom I have not yet seen.</p>
      <p>I notice you are concerned about your Vocabulary; that it is taking so long with the printer. Certainly, this is also troublesome to me; I urge him as much as I can, and I correct it finally; but I do not achieve as much as I would like, that we had left the booklet to be printed by Froschauer. I now finally realize how sordid a printer Apiarius is; but since he has already completed half, I cannot retract it.</p>
      <p>Let the poor man finish it, if he can gain any profit from it. If he finishes it before I depart to you, I will bring some copies with me.</p>
      <p>Although he has seen the ecclesiastical doctrines, I do not want to entrust them to him for printing; I will say that Naogeorgus took them with him, and I will bring them to Zurich with me, so that they may be printed there.</p>
      <p>I cannot respond about Musculus now; this matter will be pending until I come myself.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, October 21st, Fleckenstein from Lucerne, a messenger from Unterwalden, one from Solothurn, and one from Fribourg came in the name of the seven places Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug, Fribourg, and Solothurn, who met at Beckenried, came before the council on Monday, and presented that they finally desired an understanding regarding what they should expect from my lords concerning religion, whether they would submit to the future council and conform to other people's religion, and with many words admonished how good and proper it would be; it might also preserve the confederation better, etc. Regarding Savoy, they made no mention other than with veiled words, nor did they mention the alliance. No decision was made for them, as my lords, the foremost, were not here; they wanted to give them an answer at a later date.</p>
      <p>Thereupon they requested that the great council, councilors, and citizens be assembled. This happened yesterday on Tuesday, but no other answer was given than before, with which they were dissatisfied, and they hurried away to Solothurn.</p>
      <p>They now want to go to Basel, then to Schaffhausen, and then to Zurich to hear what each place is inclined to do. I fear there is something sinister behind it. They have probably arranged for a special embassy to be sent to each place, so that this proposal should be presented on the same day in the four places Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen; but after their departure, it was learned that they were all riding to Solothurn and Basel.</p>
      <p>They also presented these articles among others: 1. they highly excused themselves, saying that it was falsely and untruthfully alleged against them that they were taking money and gladly destroying the Confederation; this would not be found to be true; 2. that all slanderous words against them should be stopped and forbidden, both against the preachers by name and other persons; 3. if it should happen that any potentate, prince, or state should have a claim against the common Confederates or a particular place, whether they would not allow friendly and good negotiations or at least let such matters be settled; it is believed that this refers mainly to Savoy, and also to the bishop, prelates, and priests regarding restitution. However, they have pushed for this article about the council, and that they want to clarify themselves like other common estates of the German nation. Something great and serious is at hand. May Almighty God give us steadfastness in His word! I wanted to inform you of this hastily through this messenger; for if this one had not come to hand, I would have sent my own messenger, in case the message had not yet reached you, so that no one would be caught unawares. I think my lords will also send a messenger themselves; but if this does not happen, I ask that you ensure that our people are also written to and that a common response is deliberated; for if nothing happens, it will go for us as it did for the imperial cities.</p>
      <p>My lords (I do not know what they are sensing) have sent both debtors and some banners to Savoy, especially to Yverdon, to better inspect and fortify it for the attack, which is why they have not been at home at this time. I ask you, as soon as possible, to write to me how things stand with you, whether they have come there and what was answered to them. Whatever else happens here, I will also inform you at all times. With this, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>I wish your entire household well. My family and D. Claudius a Senarcles, my table companion, greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 24, 1548.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>As I have just finished writing the letter, the standard-bearer in the Hague and my lord's city scribe come to me, asking me to urgently see to this own messenger and prepare him day and night at their expense to you and ask that you inform us how things stand with you, and assist with my lords of Zurich, that no final answer be given to the messengers when they come, but that a meeting be held first to deliberate on a common response. Therefore, do your best and send the messenger soon, so that he may be back here by Sunday at the latest.</p>
      <p>Given in haste on October 24th around 3 in the afternoon. It is thought that they will also ride to Mulhouse and St. Gallen; if you know anything, let us know, also what else is happening. Everyone is asked. I also ask you to inform young Thomas Wirtz that his boy is with me again, fresh and healthy, and lacks nothing more, so that he may be without worry.</p>
