      <p>Greetings. Lelius was with us. Since he fondly remembered you as an admirer of your name, I could not let him leave me without sending my letters to you. However, nothing comes to mind to write to you except that I strongly wish for you all to be in good health and to meditate on those things that pertain to the glorification of God the Father in the Messiah Son and to the edification of the church in this revelation of the holy gospel. In which, just as it was necessary for the builders to carry in one hand the tools of the trade and in the other a sword against the enemies of the gospel to restore the temple of the heavenly Jerusalem, so too did the Jews once carry in the repair of the mystical temple and Jerusalem, now redeemed from Babylonian captivity. [I ask]? [...] the figure of that Babylonian exile, which the antichrist, the king of Babylon, imposes on us, has been experienced by the elect of God for several centuries and is still being experienced, but with the hope of the wretched captivity being dissolved for the kingdom of Christ to be spread far and wide across the world. You, a man of outstanding learning and piety, Bullinger, farewell and keep Lelius, our mutual friend, in your commendation and love Borrhaus, as you are accustomed. I wish all the learned men with you to be very well in my name. Basel, the first of June.</p>
      <p>Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, a dear friend and brother in the Lord.</p>
