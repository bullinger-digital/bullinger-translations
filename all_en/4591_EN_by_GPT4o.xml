      <p>Greetings. After the other one, to whom I gave letters, departs, the relative and agent of Consul Tscharner, as they call him, will set out; for he is in that work. Therefore, if you write anything and wish it to be delivered to me as quickly as possible, give it to him; for he is a horseman and known to Mr. Funck, whose help you can use in this matter.</p>
      <p>But know this: there are 6 war councils arranged; however, since it is not necessary, the consul does not describe them, and with this, in my opinion, they are making the matter very easy. Therefore, if you might sense where it would lead, you could write about it, so that we can start preparing something.</p>
      <p>This very quickly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Fabricius.</p>
      <p>As soon as the consul describes the war councils (but this happens when it is believed that goodwill does not help with the 5 places), they will start preparing. Our consul is not a soldier, and the other military men are impatient with this delay.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and patron.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
