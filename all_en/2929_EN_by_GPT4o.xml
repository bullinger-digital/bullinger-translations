      <p>The grace of God, my willing service, and all good things beforehand, my dear lord and fellow brother in Christ, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Your letter of March 6th, along with your booklet "The Sum of True Religion," reached me on the 29th; I express to you, dear lord, heartfelt thanks for this good deed in Christ our Savior; I stand ready to serve you, where I can, to earn it.</p>
      <p>I have read it thoroughly, find it entirely Christian and well composed, as Christ left it to the apostles and has come to us in these last times by grace, and in Him alone is the truth. For God the Lord did not die in vain and redeemed us from hell, so that no one should presume to set themselves in His place, to pervert and use the gospel for dominion, land, people, wealth, good living, and pleasure, to surpass the honor of the world, as the Pope and his followers do, who are never satisfied, but those who in these last times accept Christ, have grace, believe His word, openly confess it, and are persecuted for it.</p>
      <p>Herewith, if you have not yet received it, is a response from Johannes Pollicarius, preacher in Wei√üenfels in Saxony, a response to a booklet that a bishop had published, though without setting a name, so that one would not have to consult about it. You will find with what cunning they proceed and how the truth of Christ is denied; for these people, the priests, want to maintain their pleasure and Satan's kingdom by force. If Brother Ambrosius Blorer, our dear fellow brother in Christ, desires it, please send it to him as well.</p>
      <p>Further, you have here a copy of how our bishop in Augsburg justifies himself to the Elector, that he has done nothing against Christ in Rome, is innocent, but loves his holy father, has a good faith, and receives an annual income of many thousand guilders from it.</p>
      <p>Now no more. May God grant that Christ will preserve His holy gospel with us until the end of the world and thereafter grant us eternal life, amen.</p>
      <p>Dated Augsburg, May 21, 1556.</p>
      <p>My lords have accepted 8 foot soldiers, fearing that what happened before might happen to them; but at this time, we will not need them.</p>
      <p>Your willing fellow brother in Christ, Hans Welser.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, to be delivered by hand.</p>
