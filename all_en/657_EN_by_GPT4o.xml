      <p>Greetings through Christ. I have transcribed your most useful notes on the two books of Samuel with the haste that I could manage, and I am sending them back to your kindness through this faithful young man, with good faith, as I hope. If only some opportunity for reciprocation of this not-to-be-regretted favor were given to me. But Jesus Christ, our savior, will repay your arduous and holy labors in the church of the faithful on the appointed day. I am greatly pleased that you are willing to share with me what you have on the books of Kings for me to transcribe; you will receive them sooner than you think.</p>
      <p>Farewell hastily. May our Lord through Christ our savior keep you perpetually safe in his church, and may you remember us and the magistrate in your intimate prayers, so that they do not lose the virtue of constancy in the service of the bloodthirsty, who daily assail the senate with the most frequent letters, but may they steadfastly balance the judgments. Greet all the pious and truly learned brothers, especially Gwalther and Theodor.</p>
      <p>Given on the 25th of August in the year 49.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Linggi, your most obedient in all things.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and upright man Heinrich Bullinger, the supreme and most vigilant pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich and his dearest brother in Christ.</p>
