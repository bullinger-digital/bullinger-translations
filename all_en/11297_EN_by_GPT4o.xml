    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not write everything in the last letter [No. 1248]. Requests the sending of Bullinger's "Report of the Sick" for Adam Frey and praises his patience and piety. He himself suffers from weak eyesight. Assures that he does not want to neglect his calling to theology, but at the moment he is mainly occupied with mathematics, Cicero, the Epistle to the Romans, and Livy; moving to Paris seems impossible to him, but due to the support from Otto Werdmüller, he is happy to stay in Basel. The Basel theologians have probably not yet read Bullinger's book ["De origine erroris"]; they are involved in a dispute over the university, which threatens to further weaken the Basel school. According to Bucer's communication, an 18-month standstill has been agreed upon in Frankfurt, but there is no agreement on the conditions; the recruitment of troops in the Netherlands, according to Gwalther's assumption, is directed against King Henry VIII and reveals the true intentions of the Emperor. Shares significant documents found with the Brunswick chancellor Stephan Schmidt. Reminds of his request [for a Latin Bible].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, my esteemed patron, I sent you a letter through a certain bookseller who claimed to reside in Zurich; I hope it was delivered to you by him. At that time, I did not write everything I wanted nor as I wished, but only as much as the moment allowed. Therefore, I am compelled to trouble you again with my letters.</p>
      <p>During this Lenten season, Adam Frey from Zurich was with us, having been brought to Basel by his doctor so that the discomfort of this time would not harm him, and he stayed with us until the Easter festival. When he happened to see me passing by from a window, he called out to me, recognizing me. So, I went up. He received me with the greatest joy and treated me most kindly; for during all the time he was in Basel, he had not encountered any of the Zurich people. He earnestly requested me to greet you on his behalf and to ask you to send the booklet you wrote in the mother tongue about the care of the sick to me, so that I may forward it to him. I would have bought it in Basel, but I did not find it for sale. I hope, however, that you will not fail this excellent, pious, and most honorable citizen. Indeed, when I consider the severity of his illness and his admirable patience, I am often led to great admiration. Nor is his mind untouched by religion, as anyone could see during the Easter festival; for, lest he seem to have little regard for piety, he arranged to be carried into the temple.</p>
      <p>I easily obtained from Myconius that he would also make him a participant in the Lord's Supper. I also ask you again, most kind teacher, to add encouragement to his patience and piety by sending that booklet; it is amazing to say how much he rejoices over the letters you recently sent him.</p>
      <p>As for the state of my affairs, it is quite satisfactory, except that I have been somewhat tormented by eye pains; but the pain has subsided, although my vision remains greatly weakened. But since this is the end that awaits students, I bear it with equanimity.</p>
      <p>In the letters sent through Froschauer, you seem to outline my calling somewhat, namely the ministry of the divine word, which I both embrace and most earnestly wish to be able to fulfill someday. I am far from being ensnared by the love of disciplines to the point of spurning that most sacred study of theology. However, I think it would not be useless for me or others if I spend some time on the knowledge of arts and disciplines. For these studies (as far as I can judge) are such that they harm those who linger too long on them, but sometimes neglect those who neglect them, not without great harm. I am particularly drawn to the study of mathematics above other arts because the precepts of this art seem to be most conveniently applicable not only to itself but also to others; then there is no other art that more clearly conveys the power of demonstration and the formation of judgment. Meanwhile, I read Cicero's speeches and examine them according to the precepts of Hermogenes (which Grynaeus professes) and Aristotle; I also practice style with a fictitious argument. In sacred studies, I read the Epistle to the Romans, which I also read in Strasbourg before. I do not neglect the reading of Livy when leisure permits. You now have the scope of my studies; if you wish anything to be changed or if the plan does not please you, indicate what you wish to be amended. I will ensure that I am not considered disobedient. All hope of seeing Paris has vanished, as I hear there is such a scarcity of things there that even Melchior has to think about some condition. But as long as I have Otto Werdmüller with me, I do not wish to leave Basel; for he assists my studies here as much as he can.</p>
      <p>I cannot know what the people of Basel think of your recently published book, but I suppose they have not yet read it, being preoccupied with other matters. There are great disputes and animosities here between Mr. Myconius and Carolstadt, as the former seems to oppose the university, while the latter rather inconveniently defends the school's interests. However, neither wants to appear to oppose the university; yet they foster factions in the meantime.</p>
      <p>I do not yet see an end; they themselves will see what they are doing. I think they will face the most severe judgment of God, those who oppose the institution of schools.</p>
      <p>I fear that while they fight over the school, they will soon be without any school at all. Indeed, it has now come to the point that for an entire year, no Latin lecture has been held in Basel. We were expecting Otto to read Cicero's speeches; but some demon, I do not know who, has disrupted the best plan. I congratulate God and you greatly, for I hear that you are progressing vigorously in the institution of the school. May God grant a successful outcome.</p>
      <p>Bucer wrote from Frankfurt about the steadfastness, indeed obstinacy, of the orator who acts on behalf of the emperor, who intends not to yield a hair's breadth from his plan. They are negotiating a truce; both sides have agreed on an 18-month truce, but they cannot agree on the conditions. Meanwhile, large troops are being recruited in the Netherlands, apparently against King Henry VIII, and the emperor hopes to gain victory over the Germans as well once he has subdued him. But the God of hosts will scatter the wicked plans of the most impious prince. We now clearly see that all the delay the emperor has had in attacking the pious was not due to a pious judgment, but rather a sign of sought-after opportunity.</p>
      <p>I am sending you here the leaves of the Sibyl, that is, some very obscure letters that were found with the chancellor of Brunswick. More plans are not written in these, because he had to expedite in person what was necessary.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write. Please consider my words with fairness and kindness and send what I requested through Quirinus, I beseech you. Greet your wife and mother and the whole family in my name. Farewell, dearest father, and always keep me commended to your faith.</p>
      <p>In Basel, on the Ides of April 1539.</p>
      <p>Your most observant R. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron and lord.</p>
