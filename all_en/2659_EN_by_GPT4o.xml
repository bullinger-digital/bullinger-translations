      <p>C[oelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I could not let our Laelius and Doctor Martin go, dearest brother Bullinger, without sending my letters to you, even though they did not bring any of yours to me. What do I say, they brought, indeed not even anyone else has delivered any of your letters to me for almost two years. I know you are occupied with various and very important, indeed also very useful matters; but I also know your diligence in writing, if you pursue someone with love, which I myself have experienced for many years. Shall I say that I am not loved by you?</p>
      <p>I certainly do not think that you have ceased to love so suddenly for no significant reason. Shall I say that you have either forgotten me or disdain me? When I have never known anyone more mindful of friends or more light-hearted and pleasant than you? What then shall I say? That malicious and venomous tongues have had some influence over you? You who know that the law in friendship is that a friend should neither delight in bringing accusations nor believe those that are offered, which two things pertain to the constancy and perpetuity of friendship. Since I think none of these things of you, what then should I think is the reason why, even when kindly and moderately prompted by me, you have not written even a single letter or greeted me in word over so many intervals of time? It will be your duty of piety, goodness, humanity, and I add also benevolence, to write whatever it is, and to remove this scruple, which now torments and turns within my breast, from me, who loves and cherishes you as no one else. Farewell with your entire holy family, wife, children, sons-in-law, and relatives. I greet in my name those learned brothers who are certainly most dear to me. You will hear about our affairs from Laelius. My whole household greets you in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, 19th of June, 1555.</p>
      <p>Forgive my negligence in writing, which is known to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
