    <p xml:id="regest1">Confirms the delivery of the letter from Zurich to Constance by [Johannes Winz√ºrn] and promises a response. Asks Bullinger to ensure that the council - as he and [Johannes] Haab have recently suggested to him - simply awards the interest [owed by Hans Konrad Escher to the cathedral chapter] to the city of Constance, without conducting a sensational legal proceeding; assures Bullinger of the friendship of the people of Constance. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The parish priest of Wening has delivered to me the letters from your council addressed to ours. You will receive news within two days about what our council decides in this matter. I just wanted to let you know that they have been delivered; they were delivered as soon as he came to us. In the meantime, he made a journey elsewhere; upon his return, he reminded us whether anything should be replied; for I had requested this from him.</p>
      <p>If you can do anything in this matter - for it is more serious than one might think due to the precedent it sets - if you can do anything with decorum, I ask you to do so, remembering my plea, which I recently poured out to you and Haab in Zurich. For if the people of Zurich were willing to pay this interest to our republic, they could achieve it with far less trouble and without burdening the adversary with a senate decree as much as with a legal sentence. For such a sentence imposed on the canons would be more difficult and even more hostile; for it is neither feasible nor in our expectation that the Zurich senate intends to burden us and condemn us in judgment. What frightens us is that these matters are being pursued through judgments and controversies without any cause, which have not proceeded in this way in the reborn centuries nor could be done by the people of Zurich, especially if the matters were conducted with friends. I believe no one doubts our friendship.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed Bullinger, and love me. I wish you to do nothing here except what you consider proper and beneficial.</p>
      <p>November 16, 1537.</p>
      <p>Greet Leo, Theodor, and all the brothers in my words.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of evangelical truth in Zurich, his singular lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
