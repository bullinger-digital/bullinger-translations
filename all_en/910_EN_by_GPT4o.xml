      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you. That you have not received any letters from me for several months regarding our affairs and the state of the church, dearest in Christ Bullinger, I hope to excuse with these brief words, etc. During the winter months, being in poor health, I was constantly confined to my bed and rarely went out in public unless supported by a cane. Now, in the springtime, when I hoped for better health, the swelling of my feet, pains, and erysipelas have tormented me as if they were allied enemies, which, in addition to the ailments of old age, have gravely afflicted me. I am now, by the grace of God, somewhat better; but my feet and the foundations of my body bear the sixty-year-old weight, though reduced and exhausted, with great difficulty, so that I advance to the house of the Lord at a tortoise's pace.</p>
      <p>I pray daily with Brother Clausen: O God, take me from myself and give me wholly to you. May the Lord's will be done. Amen.</p>
      <p>The churches are doing quite well in that we have not conceded anything to the adversaries, who are always eager to change something new. There are those in the duchy who threaten destruction unless we admit one or two intermissions; but we pass by their threats with a deaf ear, and so far they have changed nothing, with our prince also steadfastly resisting. The greater part of the church, having been admonished by us, are more frequent in sermons and prayers on the appointed days.</p>
      <p>Indeed, some, of whom there was no hope of repentance, lament the calamity of the pious, striving for innocence of life; the faint-hearted, who, out of fear of the Emperor, almost despaired of the truth of Christ, are now returning and somewhat recovering. Therefore, I beseech you and your fellow ministers in Christ Jesus our Savior, pray unceasingly for us, that our faith may not fail and that the more we are attacked by adversaries, the more steadfast we may be. Certainly, that cunning Satan is plotting against the glory of Christ among us with marvelous schemes, about which it would be too long to write.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg is wavering, and the brothers do not agree among themselves; we have often admonished them to concord; but each one finds his own way beautiful.</p>
      <p>I fear, lest the obstinacy of false brothers leads to ruin, which God forbid, etc. The Emperor is expected in Augsburg, as you know; but those who come to us from where he is now think that it will never happen; he is so heavily burdened. We must pray to God that He not only enlightens him but also those who hold power with him, with His usual mercy, and reveals Christ, the goal of salvation, etc. Farewell in Christ, esteemed brother, and greet Gwalther, Bibliander, Pellican, and all the brothers in our name. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, May 23, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant theologian and churchman of Zurich, always to be esteemed as a brother in Christ, etc.</p>
