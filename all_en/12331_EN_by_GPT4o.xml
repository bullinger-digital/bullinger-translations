    <p xml:id="regest1">Who could dislike the well-founded opinion that speaks against alliances with antichristian bishops and prelates? Bullinger, on the other hand, thought in his own brief opinion [No. 2269] of a city that would like to ally with the Confederates but is prevented from doing so because not all Confederates have yet turned to the Gospel. Bullinger would very much welcome it if some more would join the Confederation. He sends back the opinion transmitted by Blarer with thanks. - Bullinger requests further news. - The return of the messengers sent to Marchese [del Vasto, Alfonso d'Avalos] is expected; Bullinger will further inform Blarer in this regard. - Bullinger fears a terrible fate for Germany. - The bearer of the letter is Johannes Haller, who was sent to Augsburg and is distinguished by restraint and scholarship. Blarer should explain to him the customs of the Augsburg church and later advise him by letter if needed. - Greetings, also to [Thomas Blarer], [Konrad] Zwick, and [Jakob] Funcklin. [Haller] will report further. - [P.S.:] [Haller] has as travel companions Huldrych Zwingli the Younger, who is very much like his father, and [Hans Wilpert Zoller the Younger]. Both want to visit the most famous Swabian cities. - Hopefully, [Philipp von] Hessen will not fare like Ahab, who, after releasing the Ben-Hadad he had captured, was foretold of his own downfall [1 Kings 20:42].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Who could dislike that most exact judgment against forming alliances with antichristian bishops and prelates? I fully agree with it. It is supported by solid scriptural testimonies, the clearest examples from scripture, and plainly evident reasons. Furthermore, it prudently considers everything that should and usually comes into such consultation, according to the place, time, and persons involved. As for my brief writing, I indeed did not consider bishops or prelates, but rather the Swiss, as I now openly confess the truth. I hoped that some city would enter into an alliance with those who have largely given their name to the Gospel, of whom the smallest part, although they have not yet received the Gospel, do not persecute it. This is what I was aiming at. I would have written something entirely different if I had known the question was about bishops. But enough of this. You know how sincerely I wish for some to be more closely united with us. I return the consultation, for which I give great thanks. I pray, however, that you deal with me with your usual faithfulness, especially in these dangerous times, and do not cease, but write very frequently. You see how diligent and persistent I am in the most important matters.</p>
      <p>We are expecting the envoys sent to the Margrave; when they return, you will know what response the beast has given.</p>
      <p>Come, let us pray constantly to the Lord. I seem to see great evils threatening Germany. A truly penitent life joined with prayers will bring us much peace.</p>
      <p>The one who offers this to you, Johannes Haller, is the one sent to Augsburg. I pray, my brother, that you treat him as you would treat me. He is a man of the most modest and peaceful nature, learned in Greek and Latin, sufficiently practiced in letters and the ability to preach. It will benefit him greatly if you also instruct him, depict the customs of that church. If he writes to you from Augsburg, consult faithfully and respond diligently. But here I know you will fulfill the duty of a friend excellently, not only for my sake but more for the glory of the Lord and the benefit of the church.</p>
      <p>[May the Lord] Jesus [preserve] you with your whole house and city. [Greetings] to brother [Thomas] Blarer, [Konrad] Zwick, [Jakob] Funcklin, and the other good men. The messenger will explain more. ZÃ¼rich, November 10, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger. He has as a travel companion Huldrych Zwingli the Younger, the legitimate son of the pious memory Zwingli, who, as you see, resembles his father in every way. He will return with the courier. He is now going to see or visit those famous cities of Swabia. I commend him to you for the sake of his excellent parent.</p>
      <p>Let us pray, my brother, that it does not happen to [Philipp von] Hessen, the most excellent prince, as it did to Ahab, who, because he spared Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, captured in war, heard from the divine prophet: "Because you have let go of a man worthy of death, your life shall be for his life" [1 Kings 20:42], etc. If you can, urge this word so that it reaches the ears of the prince; I will do the same.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious man Ambrosius Blarer, the most faithful bishop of the church of Constance, his brother in the Lord, always to be honored. Constance.</p>
