      <p>Bartolomeus Stiltz from Schaffhausen in Maggenau in Toggenburg has been expelled by the bailiff: 1. because he baptized his child himself, as he could not have anyone else do it; 2. because he said to a herdsman, who said: "I want to make a journey to Einsiedeln, I know well that it is not right" etc. (said): "Woe to you, that you sin knowingly"; 3. a woman, who knelt with the papists on the graves, was warned, when she went to the church to pray, not to strengthen the superstition; finally said: "I cannot tolerate the superstitious, idolatrous behavior" etc. around Pentecost.</p>
