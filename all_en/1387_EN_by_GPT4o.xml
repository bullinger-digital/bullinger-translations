      <p>Greetings. The letters I sent last were assigned to Pellican's son, but when they reached Master Chunhard's house, he had left; thus it happened that they remained with others on the journey for so long.</p>
      <p>Our situation remains the same. From the consul, I have gathered enough to know that they do not entirely dismiss it, because they see the same happening with others. They sent me letters to read from the King of France, in which he excuses himself for not coming to the council, not for any other reason than that the Pope has closed all the roads to Parma due to the war.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the council cannot indeed be called general, and what is decided there can be rejected without hesitation, and it is established in favor of a few princes who intend to seek their own interests from it, not those of the Catholic Church. Meanwhile, he adds: he writes these things not as an enemy of the church, to which he is favorable and for which he bears the name of the Most Christian, which he strives to retain by all means, but because the stated reasons delay him, etc. Hence, our people also seem somewhat moved to be less friendly to the papal institution. A certain great man said he sees the current council's effort as futile, but with peace restored with the French, everything will then be accomplished seriously and with great benefit to the church.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, priests, monks, and laymen gathered at a frequent feast in Almerswil (for it was the anniversary of the abbots and monks who died there). They began to lament their state, especially that the Emperor, acting in Augsburg, did not suppress the clamor of the Lutheran preachers, who had never been more vehement; they were unaware of his intentions; it was also clear that this sect was now so entrenched and had grown so tough that after his death it could not be eradicated, and thus their state was doomed henceforth. They celebrated the feast not very cheerfully until they reached the third cup; then, having forgotten all sorrow, they revived.</p>
      <p>Finally, rumors of the Turkish fleet are flying around us, although not very clearly. However, because it has progressed thus far with everyone silent, I have come to the conclusion that the matter is fabricated. Another rumor came that it is so close to Vienna that in a few days it could, if it wished, reach there.</p>
      <p>While these things were being narrated, a certain Imperial doctor added that it was certain: the Turk is moved by the movement of the French and vice versa, and nothing is more certain than this; for those two are colluding. Here another said: "In Switzerland, I hear nothing about this; but to speak the truth: would it be surprising if the king colluded with him in such necessity, after others have repelled the Turk with great money for several years now, just so they could ravage through Germany at will, and they still do and will not cease until they have achieved their desires.</p>
      <p>Moreover, letters came from Italy to our Coelius: the Emperor promised by agreement to the Pope that he would capture all who come from Italy into his hands for Lutheranism and subject them to due punishment. The Magdeburg war still continues, and a new rumor spreads about a conflict between Brunswick and Denmark over the bishopric of Bremen. Farewell with all your family and brothers.</p>
      <p>From Basel, from my bed, August 28, 1551. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
      <p>"The latest from D. Oswald Myconius."</p>
