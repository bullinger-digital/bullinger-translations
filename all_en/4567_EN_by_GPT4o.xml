      <p>Greetings. I briefly respond to your last letter, venerable brother, because our best friend Johannes Linerus came to me while I was hurrying to dine, worn out by many troubles, and he said he was being urged by his companions to leave early tomorrow morning. Our Beza will summarize the main points of his mission.</p>
      <p>Those whom we wished to be safe did not allow themselves to be advised, even though we labored not so much for their sake as for the whole church. The King of Navarre, as I wrote to you, voluntarily implored my faith and very kindly requested that Beza be sent to him; if he had suffered rejection, how great would have been the outcry of all the pious: that it was our fault that everything did not succeed happily! Not only our timidity but also perfidy and cruelty would have been accused. Beza performed not only faithfully but with incredible constancy what he ought to have done.</p>
      <p>Plans have changed a hundred times; finally, what everyone sees happened, that the King of Navarre and his brother wanted to perish. If we had been trusted, not a drop of blood would have been shed, and they would have easily settled.</p>
      <p>We have always taken care of this.</p>
      <p>Now utter despair has disheartened minds, because soldiers are ravaging everywhere just as in hostile territory, and yet our neighbors, who were the instigators of sedition, now turn the blame on us. But I will leave them aside for now.</p>
      <p>As for your request that I send you Philipp's letters, where he openly declares that he agrees with us, three reasons prevent me from doing so; for they are not many and are written in such a way that you would recognize that he has entrusted to my bosom things that could be eluded by others who are not friends to either, and by others who are less familiar, they would hardly be understood. Consideration must also be given to the dead man, whose reputation would be somewhat diminished by what he wrote to me. There are also other things mixed in, which would be honorable for me to make public, but would be subject to the detractions of Flacius and the like.</p>
      <p>However, when your letter was delivered to me, half of the response was already completed, in which it seemed necessary to refute Heshusius not so much by plan as by some unknown impulse. Such is the indignity that would provoke even stones.</p>
      <p>It is still troublesome for us that the people of Glarus remain in suspense. But the pride of Moab will crush itself, and certainly God will cast down these Cyclopes, so that they, plotting destruction for others, devote themselves to it. Let them hang; we stand on our foundation.</p>
      <p>Regarding the disturbances in France, I refrain from writing anything uncertain. Something soon.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man and brother to be cherished from the heart. I wish Master Peter Martyr, Master Galtherus, and other fellow ministers to be safe. May the Lord protect, govern, and bless you all.</p>
      <p>We are in such peril every moment that many despair, many are anxious, others laugh. Therefore, we commend ourselves to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Geneva, the day before the Nones of December 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, a friend and brother most dear to me. In Zürich.</p>
