      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote about other matters; now I have only this to say, that not only Ferdinand, but even the Emperor himself seems to have despaired of overthrowing the gospel of Christ. We have it on good authority that he has decided to completely resign the scepters and crown of the empire to Ferdinand, provided the princes agree and wish to ratify the proposal, for which purpose they are said to be about to convene. It is said that he has testified that he has done his utmost to resolve the religious controversies, but since his will and efforts have been in vain, he, weary with years and ailments, will henceforth leave everything to the Lord God and the ruler of Germany and will look after his own peace.</p>
      <p>It is reported that Spain greatly requires his presence due to the death of his mother, with whom he has hitherto shared the administration of the kingdom, so that he may fully assume the scepters, perhaps for the sake of his son; for it is said that he himself is contemplating a monastic life in a certain monastery of the Order of St. Jerome in Castile. Meanwhile, Ferdinand has lost great hope, as the infant of Spain was to succeed in the kingdom if Charles's death had preceded his mother's. The Duke of Savoy will act as vicar in Germany for Maria, the Emperor's sister, who will also accompany her brother to Spain. Philip is said to be residing not in England, but somewhere in Brabant. I hope the Emperor's abdication will lead to peace in Germany and the growth of the gospel; may we use this good not to foster carnal security and the pursuit of disputes, but to truly build up mutual piety and charity. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all your people. Basel, November 21, 1555.</p>
