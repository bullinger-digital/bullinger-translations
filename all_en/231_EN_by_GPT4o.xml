      <p>S. D. I send you the letters of our most united brother Blaurer along with the other news you shared with us. I am keeping Musculus' explanation with me (as you wrote). I truly thank you greatly for your labors and for the exceptional dedication and goodwill, which you never cease to show towards us. At present, I have nothing to write, except what I wish to communicate to you in secret; for I would not want anyone to know that I am conveying these things to you.</p>
      <p>First: As I, as you piously advised, urged some leading men of our city, Nägelin, the treasurer, Grafenried, and Hagius, etc., to console the people of Constance with some writing, if not with action, and to show themselves as brothers to those in such great need, etc., and added that my lords in Zürich would do the same and have not yet recalled their soldiers (if they had any there) from Constance; the Zürichers wish that they would also act, so that they alone would not seem to disturb this source, I received some grim responses from some. They said they had also sent an envoy to Thurgau and the other Cantons; they also disliked that the Five Cantons had consulted on this secretly; it seemed to them that this would entangle the people of Constance more than help them; however, they had instructed their envoy to act prudently, whatever he thought would be beneficial for the people of Constance; meanwhile, they had also written to the Zürichers to console the people of Constance in their own and their name; for they were ready to face any danger for them; they were surprised, however, if the Zürichers were so willing to help those whom they understood to be slower in this matter and too much inclined to the votes of the Five Cantons.</p>
      <p>They responded to me in such a manner (but used veiled words). Meanwhile, I wondered what this was, where they got it from, since I understood differently from your letters. Finally, I secretly learned from a good man that our envoys, who were at the recent assembly in Baden, had declared before the entire senate that they did not know how ready the Zürichers were to help the people of Constance, since their consul Habius had first given the advice in Baden that all Swiss soldiers, as many as were in Constance, should be recalled and no one should involve themselves in this matter unless perhaps the enemy entered our borders and territories. Our Cantons immediately subscribed to this advice with great applause. Therefore, this recall of soldiers, and the insistence of Fleckenstein and others, should be attributed more to the Zürichers than to any others. They were therefore surprised if they were so prompt in helping them otherwise. From this, I understood what suspicion lay beneath; but since he told me this in secret, I entrust it to your discretion, so that you can use it with your prudence, omitting my name. I see there is some internal discord between these cities, which we should strive to calm and settle, as much as is in our power, rather than inflame further.</p>
      <p>I also wish that we, who stand on the side of the gospel, would come together and deliberate on what should be done in this matter; but I fear that each of our cities might lean too much towards the adversaries in hatred of the other. When they understand this, they conceive a stronger spirit and strength to act against us. If we abandon the people of Constance without our help, counsel, consolation, and aid, I see destruction threatening us in two ways: first, because they are our brothers, for whom even our soul should be laid down; this is what Christianity teaches, and we know that whatever they suffer now, they suffer for the confession of faith alone, since in all other matters they have agreed with the Emperor; from this indeed courage should be conceived. - "and we know courage should be conceived". Secondly, if the Emperor subdues that city, we will see what kind of neighbor we will have, and in the end, with everything lost, we will lament our foolishness, and this is what human reason itself dictates." and this - reason". I would not want us to act imprudently here, to rashly plunge into war, but not to withhold from them this aid, which we could provide them without occasion for war.</p>
      <p>For I only fear that with such a great disaster, although victory would be theirs, the spirits of the citizens would be so dismayed that they would think of peace at any cost, especially when they see our help, on which they had always hoped well, being withdrawn from them.</p>
      <p>How much this will inconvenience us, time will tell. For them, it would certainly be better to move far away with their city and homeland burned, wherever God would lead them, than now, after they have so angered the Emperor, to surrender to his will. They have persevered so far; but if they want to be safe, they must persevere to the end. I do not doubt that the Lord will give the Emperor other matters to attend to, so that they, if they only persevere, will have the best peace. Here, the greatest men suspect from many conjectures that the Emperor is going to attack the French. Even if this does not happen and he attacks us, let the people of Constance be freed with us or, if they must perish, let them perish with us and allow life to be taken from them rather than faith.</p>
      <p>There are also some good and wise men here who, while great concern is being shown for the people of Constance, are considering many and various plans. There are those who wish Schertli to be among them and secretly have selected soldiers from Zürich and Bern, with the French providing pay. Then there are those who advise other things. It is certainly best for them to hope in the Lord, as they have done so far, and for them to live or die rather than accept that impiety. For us, it would certainly be best if we would listen to either piety or reason itself advising us, not to abandon them; for our help could be most beneficial and honorable for them and for us.</p>
      <p>The second thing I have is this: I hear rumors being spread here by some trustworthy men that a Zürich envoy (who he was, I do not know) has already prescribed the form of the oath to the new officials at Lovers and Lucerne in a papal manner, binding them not only by the one God but also by the saints. And there are those here who were present and heard it with great disturbance.</p>
      <p>Oh, if it is true, how we sin against God himself by falling into such impiety, and also how much of a stumbling block we give to our adversaries, who are confirmed in their impiety by our inconsistency. I would like to know who that envoy was and whether he did this on his own or by the order of the lords.</p>
      <p>I also hear frequently here that the inhabitants of our Bernese territory are very ready for arms, but not so that war would be undertaken either against our confederate Cantons or without them against the Emperor, so that there is also considerable danger in their loyalty if we happen to disagree again.</p>
      <p>From all this, I gather that the time of our visitation is at hand and that the Lord has already taken up the winnowing fan, by which he will separate the chaff from the wheat. May the Lord grant that we conquer with unshaken faith and possess our souls in our homeland. Amen.</p>
      <p>Ismael, who brings this to you, was with us; he wished to obtain pardon for his offense from the schoolmasters, but he has not yet been able to. However, he has been given hope that he will obtain it if, after some time, he returns with a testimony from you about his studies and conversion of life.</p>
      <p>If he is worthy, give him at least such a testimony as he is worthy of. Farewell in the Lord Jesus; may he keep you safe for a long time for his church! Greet all the brothers, your wife, and children from me and my wife, Musculus too, if he has reached you. All our brothers also pray for your health. We still need one deacon here; what if we did something for Rasdorffer? I will tell Valentinus the composer to come as soon as the feast of St. Bartholomew has passed; let him come recommended by you and prepared for any examination. The position will soon be vacant, not indeed very splendid, but one that will give him hope for greater things. I wrote everything in haste, so forgive me, I pray.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 17, 1548.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, forever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the Zürich church, his lord and forever to be honored compatriot.</p>
