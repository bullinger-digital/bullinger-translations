      <p>I recently forgot to include in the packet I sent to you the preface I mentioned in my letters. Therefore, I am now sending it with the supplement, that is, with the booklet itself, intending to add Eber's book, unless I feared burdening the courier. I am working and striving as much as I can to send the response to the Brentanus to the Leipzig fair.</p>
      <p>The plague continues to rage in Lyon.</p>
      <p>I entrust to you the matter of the alliance.</p>
      <p>A rumor has arisen here that there is a call to arms there. May the Lord grant that we soon hear better news and that the good may enjoy holy peace with that ferocity subdued.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe with all your colleagues.</p>
      <p>Here with us, by God's grace, whatever plague there was is now almost quelled. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Geneva, August 30.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>I received your last letter on this same day along with one additional page of your book; but you did not send the first part of it.</p>
