      <p>Greetings. I received your letters sent through the noble Poles and also others sent through Albert of Austria on the same day; we did what we could for each. There has not yet been a response to the letters from the Poles; however, I hope it will be done soon.</p>
      <p>Albert is still lingering here, and I do not know when he will depart; I have helped him as much as I could, but he has not been received. He does not know where to turn; perhaps he will return to you if he can find a position among the Thurgauers, Toggenburgers, Glarus people, or the Rhaetians. As for our affairs, everything is now more peaceful by the grace of the Lord than it was a few days ago; it seemed like it might have been something. But the army that had gathered around Lyon has moved away; it is said that everything will be directed towards England and Scotland. Meanwhile, we hear that many ships of the king from Spain have been captured at sea by the Turks and taken away with great loss of people and goods. No one has been sent to Geneva; they have also never requested it; they are so well disposed towards my lords that I fear they will not take anyone else there but ours.</p>
      <p>However, the day before yesterday they sent an embassy here, always bringing new matters that no one can settle. May God grant that it will be better one day and soon.</p>
      <p>As for the situation in France, I believe you have understood it from Hans Liner of St. Gallen, who, when he was here these days, said he was going to you in Zurich directly. My lords held a meeting with Freiburg and Valais regarding the Savoyard affairs, which have been clarified on all sides, to commit goods and blood to my lords. Consequently, those from Freiburg made an expedition 4000 strong, although we do not greatly rely on the help of the unbelievers. There has been some unrest in Valais.</p>
      <p>In Sion, the schoolmaster on Easter day (as I think) sang psalms in the church publicly with his students in the presence of the bishop, who did nothing against it, but considered it a childish matter; however, some unruly priests have stirred up the Goms district (which is the highest in the land); they have risen with the unleavened bread (which was abolished by the Confederates years ago) and wanted to come down. But they have been told so much by the other districts that they stayed at home.</p>
      <p>The knowledge of Christ is growing among them by God's grace. As for further matters, you will learn from Mr. Niklaus von Diesbach and Mr. Simon Wurstenberger (who is appointed in Mr. Ambrosius' place at the court to ride to the Confederates); they have departed today. However, consider well, depending on the condition of the road, they may come to Zurich last; for they intend to go from there to the annual account in Baden. They ride to several places, and my lord treasurer Dillger and lord Venner Manuel to the others; what they accomplish, you will understand from them; I do not need to recommend them to you. Mr. von Diesbach still intends to bring you here once more.</p>
      <p>May God will it to happen.</p>
      <p>Regarding the death of Consul Wattenwyl, you have already learned from my brother.</p>
      <p>My mother is returning to you, through whom I send this to you; I commend her to you. Musculus greets you, whom I also think will send you letters along with a copy of his works. Farewell and give my regards to all yours in my name.</p>
      <p>My father-in-law, Haller, Hagius, and many others greet you. Bern, June 5, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
