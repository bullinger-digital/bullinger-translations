      <p>Greetings. Upon reading your letter, most kind brother, delivered by my relative, I find you always consistent with yourself, who do not cease to urge the brothers with encouragement to remember their ministry and continue to work faithfully in the vineyard of the Lord. I truly hope that our Concius will not fail in his duty; I likewise, according to the condition of my age, will contribute as much effort as I can for the common good.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I know you, dearest Bullinger, to sympathize with the adversities of all friends, and I am not excluded from the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, with tears flowing, I am compelled to report my misfortune: on the last day of December, when my eldest son wished to ride from Zuoz to Chur, alas, what a sorrow! he was suffocated by an avalanche on the Albula Pass, which he had to cross.</p>
      <p>With what weapons and sorrows my heart, as well as those of all my family, has been pierced, you yourself can judge. However, having gathered the strength of my spirit, it was scarcely possible to bear this fatal evil, according to the flesh I say, with appropriate patience; yet by collecting myself, I find I should not oppose divine decree and providence. If we have received good from the hand of the Lord, why should we wish to lament adversities more than is right? Therefore, I pray without ceasing to the Lord, that He may strengthen and increase the spirit of patience in me, and I earnestly beseech you to do this for my sake.</p>
      <p>On another matter, Friedrich Salis, the bearer of this letter, my son-in-law, has deliberately brought his son, my grandson, whom we love dearly, to Zürich for the development of his character. We desire to place him with some good man, who is able to nurture our little one as needed and also act as a guide in morals and literary education; indeed, you will find the young man quite well-mannered, honest, and truthful.</p>
      <p>You have embraced many of our countrymen at my request, and you have contributed greatly to their advancement with their benefit, which is why I earnestly ask you to take this dearest grandson into your protection, and to choose a lover of virtues with whom he may be placed. If you lend your assistance, there is nothing left to be done for the help of the son.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, my brother, for not ceasing to trouble you in your studies and various affairs; your kindness has encouraged me to do so. If I could serve you in any way, I would do it wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet all the ministers and your family in my name. From Zuoz, on the Ides of January 1557.</p>
      <p>Your friend from the heart, Johannes Travers.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor and most kind lord Heinrich Bullinger, learned and pious ecclesiastic of Zürich, my most esteemed friend and brother.</p>
