    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian cannot resist bothering or even delighting the very busy Bullinger not only (as so often) with serious matters but also with entertaining news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Recently, someone [N.N.] has written the tragedy [«Passio. How the Most Serene Highborn Prince and Lord, Lord Johann Friedrich Duke of Saxony [...] Was Waged War Upon and Captured by Emperor Charles the Fifth [...]»] about the captivity [of Johann Friedrich I, Elector of Saxony,] and the defeat of all [Schmalkaldic] cities in the form of a passion story of the Elector and for this has twisted the Passion of Christ in a verbose and disgraceful manner. And there is nothing that displeases Vadian more than seeing how these satirical writings disfigure and publicly mock such a holy and truly divine matter in such a vile way. He prefers those poets who compile Christian poems based on [ancient-pagan] works (although Jerome himself repeatedly condemned [such works]) much more than those who do not shy away from misusing the Holy Scripture for worldly (albeit memorable) events in an offensive manner. The one who urged Vadian to read the piece thus aroused his anger. Vadian sends Bullinger the writing so that he can see for himself what madness is allowed in this terrible time. The other writings that Vadian sends along are worth reading. They express a certain sympathy and also openly admonish the more than tyrannical cunning to which [Emperor Charles V] tends, who, in his own judgment, is subject only to God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Last week, Charles V granted fiefs on a large stage at the Augsburg wine market. Duke Maurice of Saxony was ceremoniously awarded the electoral dignity and with the [blood] banner [the blood jurisdiction].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Almost all the princes are still [in Augsburg] and are holding council. The [representatives] of the imperial cities are not to be considered in this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Charles V is said to have instructed his sergeants and soldiers to report all those who have insulted Lazarus von Schwendi after hearing the last words of Sebastian Vogelsberger before his execution. Thus, they can be punished in body and goods.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">The executioner [N.N.] is credibly reported to have publicly threatened all sympathizers of France after the beheading of the three men [Vogelsberger, Jakob Mantel, and Wolf Thomas]: If they do not watch out, the same punishment will befall them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">The French King Henry II should therefore be careful! For many do not doubt that the Emperor will command him not only in his own name but in the name of all the princes to return the lands on both sides of the [Alps] to Duke Charles III of Savoy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Bullinger will also [still] see that far-reaching plans for the reintegration of the Confederation into the Empire were made at the Imperial Diet. Oh, may this turn out for the good and harm not the Confederates but the originators of such plans!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Vadian assumes that [the Emperor] will entirely present his resolutions as those of the imperial estates. And one will have to voluntarily submit to these if one does not want to fall into imperial disgrace. And no one [from the imperial estates] (who are so honest!) admits that this approach is directed against the [evangelical, not yet reconciled with the Emperor] imperial cities and the Confederates!</p>

      <p>Greetings. I cannot help myself, esteemed Bullinger, from bothering you, even when you are very busy, not only with serious matters (as I often do), but also with entertaining news and trifles, whether they delight or burden you, I do not know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Recently, someone turned that tragedy of the Saxon captivity and the calamity of all the cities into a passion story of the Elector and misused the history of Christ's passion for this purpose, twisting it very cleverly and shrewdly. But nothing displeases me more than seeing those satirical writings defile and almost openly mock such a holy and truly divine matter with such vile and affected sentiments. I much prefer those who compile centos from the fables of poets, subscribing to our religion (although Jerome condemns them somewhere), than those who do not hesitate to misuse that heavenly eloquence for profane matters, however memorable, not without great scandal. Therefore, the one who urged me to read that play only filled me with much bitterness. And indeed, I wanted to send it to you, so that you yourself might consider how great the freedom to act insanely is in these most ulcerated times. The other writings I send are not as unworthy of being read. For they contain something of commiseration and, besides more than tyrannical cunning, openly warn where the mind of him who is only one step below Jove in his own judgment tends, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Last week, the Imperial Majesty held a grand ceremony on a large stage at the Augsburg wine market and, among other things, ceremoniously awarded Duke Maurice of Saxony the electoral dignity with much pomp and a large banner.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The princes are still almost all together, and they are all going to council alone. No one from the cities is to be seen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>And it is said that the Emperor has instructed his sergeants and all the soldiers in Augsburg to report all those who, after hearing the words of Vogelsberger at his departure, would speak to diminish his honor, so that they can be punished in body and goods as appropriate.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>As the executioner beheaded the three men, etc., he is credibly reported to have publicly declared that all those who are French should watch out: for as it went with them, so it will go with others too.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Therefore, let the Frenchman see to his own safety. For there are many who do not doubt that the Emperor will prescribe a certain and severe law for him (not only in his own name but in the name of all the princes), especially concerning the lands on both sides of the mountains to be returned to the Duke of Savoy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>And you will see that not insignificant plans for bringing us into order were also made at the Imperial Diet. May they turn out well, and not rebound on us, but on the heads of the authors!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Everything will be presented and offered under the common hat, etc., to the estates of the Empire with the addition: if one does not want to be compelled to act accordingly, one would rather be left out. Now the Emperor will be willing to grant all graces, insofar as we will be submissive to lay upon our necks what has been decided with all the estates of the Empire, etc., and to obey him, etc. No one, a truly honest fellow, lets it be noticed that the play is directed against the cities and the Swiss.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Lift up your heads, therefore, and farewell in the Lord. St. Gallen, February 25, 1548.</p>
      <p>Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the City of Zurich, etc.</p>
