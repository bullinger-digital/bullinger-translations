      <p> S. The same well, most esteemed father, which I recently sent in German, today I receive in Latin words from Mr. Lentulus and send to you through a certain person from Logarn. Mr. Lentulus is gravely ill with gout and expresses immense gratitude to you in my presence for your honorable judgment and testimony regarding his booklet. He sends it again to Mr. Gwalther, so that he may also read and judge it before sending it to Geneva for printing. He adds these new things in my presence, which he did not write to me himself, but dictated: it is uncertain whether John of Austria will leave Italy for Spain or not; the Pope has given him a rose, which he usually enchants during Lent, as they call it. No one now doubts the peace of the Venetians with the Turk; the Turk is preparing a huge fleet very swiftly. </p>
      <p> Chur, Raetia, 1574, April 17. Your most devoted Tobias Egli. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Bullinger, pastor at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich. </p>
