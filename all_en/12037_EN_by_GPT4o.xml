    <p xml:id="regest1">[Gilbert Cousins] brother [Antonius or Hugo] was [in Basel], but did not leave a letter for Bullinger. Gast believes that the previously Osiander-friendly [Thomas] Venatorius is the author of the "Speculum [Osiandri]"; but perhaps also the city clerk [Georg Frölich] of Augsburg. There is hardly any news about Emperor [Charles V] and the French [King Francis I]; [the Basel mercenaries] are sending home the money they collected during the war and write about a find of over 80,000 golden pennies near Troyes, some of which Gast saw; the Emperor is allegedly looking for escape routes or simulating an escape; Count Wilhelm von Fürstenberg was captured at Verenae [September 1] in the river [Marne], along with two mounted companions [...]; he was brought before the King, who ordered him to be taken before the parliamentarians in Paris; some of the [Swiss] mercenaries have died, some are very ill; they have plenty of food but suffer from the heat; from a messenger who arrived yesterday [...], Gast learned that the Spanish monk [Pedro de Soto] sent by the Emperor to the French camp is negotiating for peace. Has not yet seen the [“Geographia universalis”] of Ptolemy edited by [Sebastian] Münster, but heard that Münster wants to add some things and correct others in the work published by Heinrich Petri; Gast wants to send the book after Petri's return. Cellarius [Martin Borrhaus] has been elected by the deputies as a theology [professor]; the [University of Basel] tried in vain to reverse this; [Oswald] Myconius also voted for him, but probably not wholeheartedly, as he had hopes for this position himself; Lepusculus [Sebastian Häslin] was also misled by false hope and even promised to accept the doctorate if he were given the teaching position; what if [Borrhaus] spreads his doctrines on baptism and Jewish redemption? But Gast does not interfere. In the village of Houssen near Colmar, an alcohol-dependent pastor misbehaved at a public banquet and came to death, partly through violent intervention by peasants. In Blotzheim near Basel, a gambler pierced a bystander who accused him of cheating with a sword; he will be sentenced next week. Gast will send the book list later. Luther is very displeased with the confession of the Cologne [Arch-] Bishop [Hermann von Wied]; he is said to have complained to Melanchthon about the article on the Lord's Supper; Luther believes that the [Swiss churches] understand nothing; he also mistreated the Zurich publications beautifully in his preface to the German New Testament! Greetings. Bullinger should inquire about news regarding the Cologne Bishop, [King Henry VIII], and other matters from Albert Hardenberg, who will visit [Zurich] after visiting the brothers in Bern; the [Zurichers] should receive this outstanding man well. Greetings. A messenger [...] delivered a letter from Strasbourg to the [Basel] council today, which undoubtedly contains news about the war events.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Our cousin's brother was with us these days, but he did not bring any letters for you.</p>
      <p>Who the author of the "Speculum" is, I am completely ignorant. I suspect it is Venatorius. It must have been the author to whom Hosdichanders was very well known or bound by some familiarity for a time and now alienated. A poem was sent to us from Augsburg; few copies were printed and sent to Augsburg. What if the city clerk of Augsburg (but I say this in your ear) was the author or received the poem from someone in Nuremberg and sent it to us? I do not know more about this matter.</p>
      <p>We hear little about the Emperor's and the French army. Our men send a large amount of money to their wives, which they collected in this war. They wrote that they found a huge treasure of gold when they camped near Troyes in the open field, more than 80,000 golden pennies, where one is worth 4 guilders. I saw one or two, but I could not recognize the characters. Our men were lured by this bait. They say the Emperor is constantly seeking escape routes or pretending to flee so that he can eventually crush the pursuing French. Duke Wilhelm von Fürstenberg was captured in the river with two horsemen on the day of Verena; he was dragged through the entire Swiss army, almost lifeless from the fear he had conceived, I do not know for what crime committed against the French, then led to the king, who did not want to speak to him, finally ordered to be taken to Paris to the parliamentarians. We will soon know what they want to decide about him. Some of our soldiers have died, some are very sick; they have an abundance of food and drink and endure intolerable heat. From a messenger who arrived yesterday, I received that a black monk - I suspect a Spanish bishop - is in the French army sent by the Emperor to try to establish a peace treaty. May the Lord grant success to such a necessary matter!</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen Ptolemy's "Geographia universalis" by Münster, but I heard from Heinrich Petri that the book was sold out, and Münster wants to keep the same order, add many things, and remove some that crept in even against his will; if, however, it is wrong to wait for that time, I will send the book to Heinrich Petri when he returns from the fair. For his wife does not know at what price the book is sold.</p>
      <p>But hey, Cellarius - perhaps you know the man better than I do - has been elected as a theology lecturer by the deputies, two of whom are related to him by blood because of the wife he recently married. Our academy tried to make this decision void, but labored in vain. Myconius gave him the vote, nor do I believe that he did it from the heart; for he himself aspired to this lecture. Lepusculus was also deceived by false hope, who promised to assume the title of doctor if the sacred lecture were given to him. What if this man now began to spread his doctrines about baptism, about the salvation of the Jews, etc.? I will be a spectator of these things; for all these were done without my knowledge, nor is there a need to call me into counsel, even if often a gardener speaks opportunely. Our deputies and primary brothers have enough prudence. Nor should it be overlooked: In the village of Houssen (a mile from Colmar), there was a priest very addicted to wine, who once acted as a preacher in the land of the Bernese; but what crime he planned, that he defected from the gospel, I do not know; at a public banquet, he soiled his boots, the peasants took that filth and put it in his mouth, then threw him down the steps; some say that without anyone forcing him, he threw himself down and died the next day. Thus the Lord punishes our sins.</p>
      <p>In the village of Blotzheim, half a mile from Basel, a gambler pierced a bystander with a sword because he said he was playing falsely; he was captured and will be judged this coming week.</p>
      <p>I will send the list of books later when I see what kind of books our booksellers bring from the fair.</p>
      <p>I know this, that Luther is very displeased with the confession of the Bishop of Cologne and complained to Melanchthon about the article on the Lord's Supper. See with what spirit Luther is affected towards us and our churches; he thinks we are stumps and stones, as if we understand nothing except what he prescribes or commands, as he did beautifully in the preface to the German New Testament, criticizing the books published in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Farewell and forgive my talkativeness. Greet Mr. Theodor with the other brothers and your wife.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 19, 1544. Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Ask Dr. Albert Hardenberg from Friesland about the Bishop of Cologne, the Englishman, and some other matters, who will visit your church after visiting the brothers in Bern. He is an excellent man, who, I believe, was sent by his bishop to explore what our faith, freedom, and ceremonies are, indeed to observe with what concord we preach Christ to the people.</p>
      <p>You will undoubtedly treat him with your usual kindness. Farewell again and again. Quickly. Give my best regards to Dr. Frisius, Pellican, and Gwalther.</p>
      <p>A messenger came today from Strasbourg, delivered letters to the senate; I do not know what they contain. Undoubtedly, he brought news about these war movements.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, his perpetual teacher to be honored. Zurich.</p>
