      <p>Greetings. Your letter, reverend father in Christ, written last week, was delivered to me after our people had already departed. Since your letter mentions the council, you should know that we have been informed by Mr. Julius, the papal legate from Milan, that he will also appear at the upcoming assembly here in Chur with mandates, which you see transcribed here; someone translated it from Latin into German, but very poorly; you will read and return it. We know they spare neither expenses nor efforts; but He lives, who promised to be with His own until the end of the world.</p>
      <p>Regarding your latest letter, I want you to know that there are some disturbances in the church of Clavenna, about whose authors we receive completely different reports. Some accuse the old man, while others, in turn, accuse others.</p>
      <p>The matter will be discussed at our next synod. We are deeply saddened that the exiles do not agree among themselves, especially in such troubled times. What do you think would happen if they were in power? Surely they would overthrow the churches with their ambition. Hercules from Salices himself complains to us a lot and says that the old man does not want to relent in his strictness, but he places more blame on his colleague; for there are those in the church who are not so perceptive, who are ready to submit to the Apostles' Creed and Scripture, who abhor Servetus and Arius, yet the ministers are not satisfied with them. Others accuse Michael Angelo and the minister of Plurien; there are those who suspect something in them, as if they are conniving with Servetianism. But we have known them as different people so far and cannot condemn them in the said matter. It is a troublesome matter.</p>
      <p>We have summoned both parties to the synod to hear everything. Vergerius knew about this in TÃ¼bingen before we did, and he also wrote to Mr. Philipp, but the people of Clavenna did not say a word to us about this; what I write, we have from the reports of others, etc. Regarding political matters, I have nothing to advise, but I dislike what has been done; but whether it is advisable for your council to intervene in political matters with our people, I cannot easily say; no more than it would be advisable for our people to prescribe to yours what they should decide with the people of Lucerne in political matters. It is to be feared that our people would not take it well and would be angry with the exiles of Clavenna for calling upon a foreign authority; for one could well consider where it comes from.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, the good people might endure for a while until things get a little better; for in this matter they have not only the papists in Clavenna against them but also the evangelicals of the same place. So one might postpone the matter until the next assembly day and then appear again. They have imposed a tax of 100 guilders annually on one; if someone has little, he gives as much as he can.</p>
      <p>And when I wanted to speak well of them to trusted persons, I was told that it is not unreasonable; for the strangers in Clavenna have the best trades in their hands, and the people of Clavenna can no longer provide for them. Also, I was told that if one considers it rightly, every citizen here in Chur must give as much, tax and guard money. Therefore, I fear that one will not achieve much with a push, especially since the majority of the commissioners are evangelical, and if we, the preachers, interfere so boldly in political matters, we might not get anywhere with others either.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you might write to Mr. Francisco in a friendly manner (but not as if from me; for they are very suspicious), that you do not consider it good that a council of the city of Zurich is consulted about this; for in such matters, which do not concern faith, they do not burden themselves with foreign authorities. You should write to me, however, that I should insist with trusted people if something could be achieved; but if there is no progress, they should take this burden upon themselves for a while in the name of God, considering that the pope is otherwise plotting how to drive them out of Valtellina; also, that the times are dangerous and will soon become either better or much worse. This is what I would advise; now you act according to your wisdom.</p>
      <p>However, I do not want any of them to know that I have written this to you; but Mr. Philipp is of the same opinion as I am.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious and revered father in Christ, with all your people, as happily and for as long as possible. Chur, May 12, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>The bishop's matter occupies us greatly; soon it will be seen who is bishop or barber. Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his much-honored lord and patron. Zurich to H. Bullinger.</p>
