    <p xml:id="regest1">Wants to enclose the recently forgotten opinions [of Bullinger and Pellikan]. Confidentially sends a letter from Bucer. Thomas [Blarer] negotiated with Bucer at Ambrosius [Blarer] [in Tübingen], who regrets having disturbed the people of Konstanz but does not see the danger; Zwick fears an encouragement of Schwenckfeld and an influx for the Münster [Anabaptists]. Wishes to send the opinions of Bullinger and Pellikan to Ambrosius [Blarer]; recommends also sending them to Bucer without mentioning the people of Konstanz, and to inform him of the concerns of the people of Zurich. Apologizes for the poor copy of Bucer's letter. Requests to be kept informed in the future. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>Once again, my dearest brother Bullinger, you experience how dull and forgetful my nature is: for why did I so confidently write recently that I would send you the opinions, when I kept them at home? Therefore, if you wish, accuse me of lying, although I will excuse the lie with ignorance, which is innate to me, a wretched man. But now I am ready with what I promised recently, unless I forget again to add the opinions to the letters. To prevent this, I will tie a knot in my nose.</p>
      <p>Then I send you Bucer's earlier response to us, but you know under what condition, namely in good faith. For no one else should read it, since not everyone is of the same mind, and the tempers of some should not be further provoked. It would be better to invent something to appease them. Therefore, not everyone is cautious in writing letters to friends. Hence, even the most odious things are mixed in, which should only be poured out into one's bosom.</p>
      <p>Our Thomas caught Bucer with Ambrosius. He dealt with him extensively and vigorously. In one word, I will say what response he brought us: Bucer regrets only that we people of Konstanz are so offended by his advice. But whether the good man is convinced that such efforts are dangerous and not very solid, I do not understand. He certainly thinks he has given nothing alien to scripture. But what can I say? The summary of the articles is being circulated in print. Some flatter, some gnash their teeth, and there is no one who does not accuse us of utmost levity. The sects will be greatly strengthened; Schwenckfeld will grow a double heart, if indeed many will not also join the Münsterites.</p>
      <p>Your advice, together with Pellikan's, is greatly pleasing to all of us. If I had not done something ungrateful to you, I would certainly have sent it to Ambrosius, but I did not want to do so without permission. We would truly wish that you also write to Bucer that the matter is being pursued by your people because of the advice given to the French, so that the good man does not think that these things are disapproved of only by us people of Konstanz. Care must be taken that nothing in your letters - which we think should be written in a common name - could lead him to suspect our warning. All mention of our letters, indeed of our name, should be avoided. Your opinions could also be sent, so that he might better understand your stance on these concords, and thus perhaps proceed less in his course. We hope you will do so.</p>
      <p>The response I am sending, copied by the boys, is poorly coherent, but the letters A B C etc. will indicate the order. You will also forgive other errors, for I have neither reread it nor compared it with the original. You will easily grasp the meaning.</p>
      <p>Whatever good comes to you for refuting this concord, be sure not to keep it from me.</p>
      <p>May the Savior keep you with your whole family and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>27th of September, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours and again yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed brother.</p>
