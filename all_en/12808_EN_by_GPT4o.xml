    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller suffers from not receiving a response from Bullinger, especially since he is eagerly awaiting his advice due to his troubled situation. Perhaps their letters are being intercepted. He wrote on December 26 [correct: 27], 1546 [HBBW XVIII, No. 2726], as well as on January 7 [No. 2744] and probably also on January 9 [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In the meantime, his fears have come true. As a result of promises from Anton Fugger, the Augsburg Great Council agreed on January 15 to reach an understanding with Emperor Charles V, on the condition that religion and freedom remain untouched. The next day, the council dispatched envoys (including Fugger) to the Emperor. Many Augsburgers from the common people, who were initially against it, were beguiled by the council's sugar-coated justifications. They do not realize that by doing so, they are betraying their allies and submitting to the champion [Charles V] of the [papal] Antichrist, fully aware that the Emperor has always emphasized in previous peace agreements that the reconciled cities could only practice their religion until the general council had decided on the disputed religious issues. But since the council is already meeting in Trent, such peace will be short-lived!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Such peace means the abandonment of eternal salvation and the renunciation of the proclamation of the Gospel. But everyone fears for their material well-being and the loss of their possessions in the imperial territories. They do not want to suffer for Christ. Some influential Augsburgers, including (according to a report by Georg Frölich) even a previously steadfast mayor [Jakob Herbrot?], openly say that they do not want to bring their relatives to beggary because of the princes [Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Philipp of Hesse] and the preachers! They assure the people and the pastors that they would continue to protect the Gospel, but do not realize that the Emperor is fighting it! They are blinded, especially since they know why the war was undertaken, namely not against some disobedient princes, as the Emperor claims, but to eradicate the Lutheran sect, as the apostolic envoy [Girolamo Franco] revealed at the Diet of Baden [on August 9, 1546]! To best implement his plan, the Emperor plays the allies against each other. Once he has seized them, the council will apply for the excommunication of the Protestants and commission the Emperor with the implementation of the decision. Therefore, it is clear that those who advocate submission to the son of the Antichrist are completely dazzled!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Augsburg pastors have timely and candidly warned the proponents of peace with the Emperor. When they began to think of reconciliation, they asked the pastors not to be so vehement, as they would do nothing against the religion and freedom of the fatherland. Now that they have decided on this peace, they forbid all pastors from speaking against the peace in public or private to avoid causing unrest!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Zurich pastors in Augsburg [Haller, Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] unanimously replied to the proponents of peace that they have never objected to an honorable and godly peace and never would. But given the changed situation, they feel compelled by faith and conscience to inform their authorities in Zurich. And since they were sent by them, they will also follow their instructions. Georg Frölich advised them to give this response. Subsequently, they wrote [on January 18, 1547] to the Zurich council and the mayors Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater, explaining the reasons why they can no longer stay in Augsburg and support their recall.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Haller is reluctant to leave the Augsburg church. However, it is not possible for him to serve a church that submits to the church of the Antichrist. Wolfgang Musculus will also leave as soon as he learns more about the peace conditions. Frölich advises the Zurich pastors to leave Augsburg early enough, as he knows very well that the proponents of peace will not oppose any of the conditions set by the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Frölich also plans to leave Augsburg. However, he has not yet been able to obtain his release. He asked Haller to recommend him to Bullinger and to inform him (which he told no one but Haller) that he is not involved in the negotiations with the Emperor. The city authorities have brought in one of the chief secretaries for this and imposed a duty of silence on him. One can well imagine what is being concocted there! Frölich is currently trying to recover his money invested with a company. He plans to go to Zurich or Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Haller does not know what will become of him if Frölich, his patron, is no longer there. Actually, he does not wish to leave Augsburg, but he must because the local population does not remain with Christ and the Christian [Schmalkaldic] alliance. As a Helvetian, he cannot submit to the Emperor, as a Christian not to the Antichrist, and as a free man not to servitude, according to Christ's words "Beware of men!" [Mt 10, 17].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Therefore, Bullinger should persuade the Zurich councilors to recall him and his Zurich colleagues! They are still ready to serve Christ's church. They do not avoid the cross, but those who do not want to bear it, who make pacts with the Antichrist, and who leave the Christian community. Other Augsburgers also see through the situation and will leave the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot were re-elected as mayors; however, they differ greatly in their relationship to God and Mammon!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The Turkish Sultan Suleiman is said to be in great armor. It is also said that during the French conquest of Genoa, the capital of Liguria, the city captain Andrea Doria was killed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] About three or four months ago, the Savoyard Claude [d’Aliod] (called Hydroander) came to Augsburg and secretly spread his heretical Arian doctrine. He betrayed himself by presenting a document to the council in which he claimed to be a prophet of the undivided God and assured that the Augsburgers, with his doctrine, could triumph over all enemies and sects, and even lead Jews and Mohammedans to the true faith. The Augsburg pastors summoned this blasphemer of Christ and the Holy Spirit, interrogated him, and reported him to the council, which ordered him to leave the city immediately. Since he did not comply with the order, he was imprisoned along with some of his followers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Otherwise, there is nothing to report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Bullinger should respond soon and advocate with the Zurich council to write back to the Zurich pastors working in Augsburg (and not just the Augsburg council) as soon as possible. Haller knows that the latter will not want to let the Zurichers go because they fear the talk of the people. However, this will not prevent the Zurich pastors from leaving Augsburg if their authorities recall them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Greetings, also to Anna [née Adlischwyler] and the children. Greetings also from Bernardino Ochino, who recommends himself to Bullinger in these troubles and asks for his advice. Furthermore, Bullinger should excuse Haller's hasty writing!</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. That you do not reply to all my letters, dearest father, and do not advise in such urgent necessities, I do not so much wonder as I grieve. For I fear that the letters are being intercepted. I wrote on December 26 of the previous year, January 7, and, unless I am mistaken, also on January 9, in all of which I urge you to advise what should be done in the present state of affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>But while you delay, the matter has come to this, as we sensed in time, that our recent great council, as they call it, unanimously decided, due to Fugger's promises, to make a pact with the Emperor, if at least they can secure religion and freedom from him. This was decided on January 15. The next day, they immediately sent envoys (among whom was Fugger himself) to the Emperor as supplicants, asking him to receive them kindly and promise peace. Although this matter was initially very opposed by many citizens, especially the common people, they are all now led by such colored arguments that they do not see how treacherously they abandon their other allies; how impiously they submit themselves to the champion of the Antichrist, whom they now trust, although they know that no other cities have been received by the Emperor, except with the condition that nothing will be attempted in religion until the general council. Since it is already convened in Trent, it is easy to see how long we will have peace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Therefore, it is clearer than light that under this peace we lose eternal peace and the salutary announcement of this peace. The good smell of profit drives everyone mad. They fear that their goods, which they have under the Emperor's control, will be confiscated and that they will be forced to suffer for Christ. Some great men openly say that they do not want to expose themselves and their own to poverty because of these princes and even their preachers; a voice which d. Laetus says he heard freely from the consul, who has hitherto shown himself strong. We see, therefore, what the outcome of the matter will be. They promise the people much, as well as us; how steadfastly they will preserve and defend the Gospel whenever the Emperor tries to take it from them; and the foolish people do not see that he is now doing nothing else! They know what he is planning, why the war was undertaken, and that from the beginning of this war he pretended other causes, saying he was waging war only against disobedient princes, although the papal legate at Baden openly revealed that it was undertaken to eradicate the Lutheran sect. How can he uproot that luxuriant crop of the Gospel more conveniently than by dividing the allies? Then, having subjected each one to himself, he can use them as he wishes. Therefore, I beseech you, why does the Council of Trent aim its bow, unless to immediately shoot the decree of excommunication at us, once we are subjected, and commend its execution to the Emperor? Therefore, I see that those who now advise the church to submit to the son of the Antichrist are given over to a perverse sense.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We have warned them with the utmost constancy and free speech in time, so that they sometimes called us, when this matter was first conceived by them, asking us not to be so vehement (as if we suspected them of evil); that they would do nothing at all against the religion, safety, and freedom of the fatherland. But now, after those mountains have labored and their plan has come to light, they have now more openly forbidden us all to speak anything against the peace either publicly or privately, lest we spread the seeds of sedition.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>We Zurichers responded with one voice that we would not speak against peace, which can consist with God and honesty, nor have we ever spoken. But since we see the present change of affairs, we are compelled by the necessity of faith and conscience to inform our lords in Zurich, in whose hands our calling rests. Whatever they command and advise us, we will do. This advice was suggested by d. Laetus. Therefore, we write to the lords consuls and the senate, explaining the main reasons why it will not be advisable for us or the church to remain here longer. We ask to be recalled.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Reluctantly, I leave the church, but in this church, I cannot serve, which submits itself to the church of the Antichrist, especially since I know what great dangers threaten us all from this. Musculus himself will also leave as soon as he hears the conditions of peace. D. Laetus advised that we should look out for ourselves in time. For he knows that they will not refuse any conditions, whatever they may be, which the Emperor prescribes to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>He himself is also preparing to leave. He was to depart today, but he has not yet been able to obtain permission from the lords. He anxiously asked me to commend his business to you. He also ordered me to write to you (which he revealed only to me) that this whole business of making peace with the Emperor was done secretly and that the lords had brought in a certain other chief scribe for this matter and bound him by oath not to say anything about this to Laetus or others. Therefore, it is easy to estimate what kind of snake lies hidden in this grass. He sought permission, but has not yet obtained it. However, I know he will not stay. He is seeking how he can safely recover his assets, which he has with usurious societies. He will head to Zurich or Constance.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>With that patron lost, how could I remain? I would have stayed and never desired to leave, as long as they wanted to stand united with Christ and the Christian alliance. But after they treacherously defect from the allies, for which they will one day pay dearly, since I am a Helvetian, I do not want to submit to the Emperor, as a Christian, I cannot submit to the Antichrist, and as a free man, I cannot submit to servitude. I will follow Christ, who says: "Beware of men."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Therefore, most excellent man, I ask your excellency to urge this matter of ours with the most honorable senate of the city of Zurich, that we may be recalled. We will be ready, as before, so also in the future, to serve the Lord and the church, as much as the Lord will give us of His spirit. We do not flee the cross, but those who do not want to bear the cross for Christ. We do not leave the faithful, but the treacherous; not Christians, but those submitting to the Antichrist, having left the fellowship and society of Christians. The cause is honest and holy. Provided that you do not wish to fail us! We do not do this alone. Many other citizens, as many as perceive the deceit that lies beneath, will also leave.</p>

      <p>Welser and Herbrot were again elected to the consulship. They cannot serve God and Mammon at the same time. This cause makes them so varied.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The Turk is said to be in great preparation. It is also reported that Genoa, the metropolis of Liguria, has been captured by the French, with the governor of that city, Andrea Doria, being killed.</p>

    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>About 3 or 4 months ago, that Claude of Savoy, called Hydroander, came to Augsburg and secretly had his listeners. He sowed the Arian heresy among many. Finally, he revealed himself by offering a document to the senate, in which he says he is a prophet of the most high undivided God, sent to this city to save it with his doctrine; which if they receive, they will overcome all enemies, and all sects, even Jews and Mohammedans, can be brought back to the truth of faith, and that God will accomplish this through him. We called the man, not so much foolish as blasphemous against the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit, heard him. We reported what we heard to the lords, who immediately ordered him to leave, but with him nevertheless remaining, they threw him and some of his listeners and followers into chains.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Besides, I have nothing to write that is worth mentioning.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I commend myself to you, my father. Please write back soon and ensure with the senate that they also write to us (not only to the lords). For I know they will not willingly let us go, not out of love for us, but because of the clamor of the people. But if we are recalled, neither their sweet nor harsh words will move us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Farewell with your dearest wife and children. Greet the lords, fathers, and brothers all and individually. Our brothers greet you, even Bernardino, who also commends himself to you in these troubles; he asks for your advice. In Augsburg, hastily, as the erasures show. Forgive, please. January 19, 1547. Yours most devotedly, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most dear lord and father. Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
