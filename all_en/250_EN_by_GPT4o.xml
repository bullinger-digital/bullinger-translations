      <p>Greetings. You indeed take too much effort for us, for which I give you immense thanks, because I can do nothing else. I desired to know about the people of Konstanz, what you wrote. Some rumors have been spread; but I attributed nothing to them. And I have often been asked about Frecht; but I could not respond, for I knew nothing. Now I know everything; if only they were happier. But this is the will of the Lord and our ingratitude, because of which God can hardly wish us well, although in the meantime He does wish well, which He proves by deed and fact, and that is for the sake of the soundness of doctrine, about which I have no doubt. I have heard nothing from England for quite some time. Strasbourg is still strong; but the fall of Konstanz has greatly terrified many; for good men know among whom they are, although it is said that not a few are migrating from the city. Sturm is counted among those who patched together the Interim; for I saw a catalog where his name was written at the end. A charioteer came from Antwerp, and a public notary from Cologne of our city; they said with one voice that they had heard nothing of the army of Buren nor seen a soldier anywhere; yet it is certain that the Emperor has sent cannons and cannonballs to Speyer and up to fifty wagons loaded with gunpowder and more are still expected.</p>
      <p>These things frighten me less; but what is told about those who ought to be ours frightens me, and after I believe what you say about them, I am indeed in this to be of help to them, so that we too may be harassed by the Emperor's Interim at some point.</p>
      <p>But here, what do you think will happen to us, who do not know how to perform the Mass? Undoubtedly, graver things will be prepared for us; for we cannot accept even that Interim, and in the meantime, we have taught the gospel and administered the sacraments. But come now, if the Lord wills it so, who will resist His will?</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is nothing else for us to do henceforth, except to put on sackcloth and continually invoke the Lord, that He may have mercy on us, grant us constancy, and allow us to overcome all through patience.</p>
      <p>Here I do not know what hope sustains me; I am entirely expecting help from above, whatever it may be; for it stands firm in my mind that the Lord will soon teach that the word we preach is His and will vindicate it.</p>
      <p>A messenger from Wittenberg was here these days; he told of the constancy of the whole nation against the Interim, which I marveled at. He also added about the maritime cities, as he thought he would not be deserted by their help, whatever might happen in the end.</p>
      <p>August, the brother of Maurice, is said to have married the daughter of the King of Denmark; wise men predict that something will be done in the marriage for the cause of Christ.</p>
      <p>Let the Swiss see to the Emperor's plan concerning Geneva. If he has Konstanz in his power, then Geneva too, it will be over for them. Therefore, it is good to trust in the Lord, not in men, so that comfort is certain for the pious, even while men perish.</p>
      <p>Of our own, I know not even a little; they do everything secretly from us, and I do not ask, especially while I fear I will hear nothing good. There are many who desire the Interim, especially so that they are no longer forced to hear our cries; yet I still hope for all good things from the senate.</p>
      <p>About other matters, at another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, joyful and strong with the brothers; for the Lord stands by us.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, the last day of August in the year 1548. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Gastius has your previous letters; he himself read what you desire about Cicero.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of Christ, brother and venerable lord in Christ.</p>
