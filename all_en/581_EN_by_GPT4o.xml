      <p>Greetings and Peace. Your letters were most welcome to me, my Lord Bullinger. If ever I can serve you or yours with my duties, you will find me ready. I will show your letters to our most reverend and offer them to him in the name of your service. I will take care of your letters to Herr Florian, who was still in Frankfurt six days ago; with God's favor, I will find him in Cologne. I spoke with Doctor Christoph Mont, who lives in Strasbourg near the Carmelites, about procuring books; you can entrust everything to him; he is sincere and honest and will transmit them in good faith; for he is a commissioner and a confidant of the King of England. He greeted your lordship a few days ago through Herr Johann Butler, the Englishman, who is with you in Zürich; he desires your friendship and acquaintance.</p>
      <p>I ask, my Lord Bullinger, that your lordship would inform Herr Christoph Froschauer to prepare everything necessary for printing the Bible, and that he should not communicate to anyone his intention to print the Bible, and if he can have a diligent English reader, that he should spare neither expense nor money, so that it may finally come forth to the glory of God in the most corrected form. Your lordship can influence Herr Butler, so that he may assist with his diligence and work for the honor of God and love of the homeland. Doctor Christoph Mont and Herr Butler send their greetings to your lordship. Please greet on my behalf Herr Pellican, Herr Gesner, Herr Gwalter, your son-in-law Herr Zwingli, and Herr Froschauer. I awaited in vain Herr Pellican's letters to Gerard Veltwyck. I commend myself to your prayers to the Lord. Farewell in Christ with all yours.</p>
      <p>Your Johann Birckmann wrote.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and well-read man, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
