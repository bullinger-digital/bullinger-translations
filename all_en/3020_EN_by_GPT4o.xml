      <p>S. The elegant precept is that Ciceronian one regarding the duty of foreigners and residents, that they should not engage in anything beyond their own business and should not inquire into others' affairs, and should be the least curious in another's republic. I am among those, as I am still considered a new man and a newcomer, although I do not consider the Zurich republic to be foreign to me, I have accustomed myself to voluntarily avoid involving myself in public affairs as a private citizen. However, it seemed appropriate, most illustrious Bullinger, since it is not possible to be present in person due to leisure, to declare to you by letter the concern that the frivolity of the lives of certain evangelists in the Thurgau province brings to me, as it is a great offense to both our churches and the papist ones. Since this happens with impunity and without the restraint of inquisitors and censures, it seems to me that a suitable opportunity has now been presented to the Zurich magistrates to assist this neglected part with more mature counsel.</p>
      <p>For you undoubtedly remember the recent novelty of a certain Tuggian prefect [Greek] who undertook a mission among the Thurgau people on behalf of the Five Cantons regarding the restoration of the ornaments of temples and shrines and other goods, which they call sacred, which they alone, and with our Zurich people being disregarded, I think they will not be able to obtain either from the laws of the latest peace or by the right and custom of a social lord. Yet they are acting separately for their religion in general with the followers of both professions. Therefore, it seems that a sufficiently large window is open for our people, so that what has been neglected so far from this part at least may receive due attention regarding those who dishonor the name of the gospel and its simple doctrine with depravity and insolence of manners. And the beginning of this matter could be made through a mission or letter sent from the city to towns and villages, which at the same time strengthens the hesitant and doubtful minds of the subjects towards the pursuit of that piety, which they hold undoubted from the recitation, which was recently made individually throughout the entire province of the twelve articles of the Christian faith, the Decalogue, and the prayer, which we call the Lord's, as it was dictated to us from the mouth of Christ the Lord, which is used by all the Swiss together and commonly, and thus the highest and non-controversial reason for piety. But to other things, either superfluous or abusive and contrary, let those who do not wish not be compelled, it has been done by divine gift, and although it happened through the work and intervention of the Zurich people, yet the Zurich lords do not take anything from this part for themselves nor seek anything else, except that they pay the due thanks to God, and that they consider it should be asked from the best and greatest preserver with prayers that these things may be long-lasting for them, established in the confidence of salvation. Such an attempt would indeed have been made for the part of the Swiss.</p>
      <p>But if it seems to anyone that such a mission or writing is odious, it will be expedient to perhaps summon the ministers of the gospel from Thurgau to Zurich, from whom the common people may perceive everywhere that the Zurich lords are not lacking to their subjects responding to them in the worship of religion, and that if the other party urges the unwilling to restore ceremonies or their instruments, they should be ordered to make indications of this matter, but also that the authors of scandals and bad life should not be passed over in silence by the fellow ministers, so that they may be corrected by the means of the mission or even removed. But this action seems more dangerous because of the excessive license of the prefects towards the evangelists, and there is fear that if they report anything to the people about these decrees of the senate, they may be misrepresented by lies, which for the sake of avoiding cannot be perverted at all, which are issued with carefully considered letters. Indeed, lest I seem to want to prescribe what I advise, it is enough to indicate in passing the opportunity arising for our care of removing the offenses of the better churches, to which care this should be next for the prefects of a good republic, so that they may obtain their favor with the common people of the territory, no less than we see them protecting those who in the aforementioned mission boasted that they had long ago spared their rebellious subjects with some unknown special indulgence, so that they would not take action against their disobedience, which mention, since it is odious and contrary to the laws of the Capellana peace, will be followed by a not inconvenient admonition of the pious and solid benefit of the Zurich people, which the common people enjoy to this day of open and light and evangelical freedom. In which, as in external goods, there is no greater given under the sun to men. But that grace should be owed to God, not to us, it is beneficial to repeat this strong hand of the Lord and this outstretched arm, by which we have escaped Egyptian servitude, whenever it is given, in memory among those who are in danger of forgetfulness. Therefore, these things, which occurred to me, not out of curiosity, but arising from the matter and pertaining to our more favorable republic of Christ, I did not want to conceal my thoughts and desire from you. I could have done this more briefly, if your candor and equanimity, indeed your judgment, which will easily discern and moderate, if anything of this business seems to be attempted with the nobles; if not, you will still turn this simple and liberal writing to good account.</p>
      <p>May the divine goodness of Christ preserve you, my honorable Bullinger, and your fellow ministers for us as long as possible in safety.</p>
      <p>On my estate near the native city, 10th of the calends of October 1556. Your Thomas Blaurer.</p>
      <p>After I had written the letter to you in autumn, I held it back thinking to discuss these things with you more fully in person. However, having returned home, I began to suffer from a stomach ailment. Finally, it seemed appropriate to send the letter with a messenger, not as a necessary admonition to you, whom I know has not escaped any such concerns, but to testify, as I said, to my concern and now more so, because having sold my estate in Kempten in the summer, I intend to move to Thurgau, if it seems so to the Lord of affairs, to whom I ask you to commend me and mine with prayers. 25th of November.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the Christian republic in the city of Zurich, his dear and esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
