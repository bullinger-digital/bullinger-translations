      <p>Greetings. In my last letter to you, dear brother, I wrote that the wife of our dear Gwalther, our dearest sister, was gravely ill. I now inform you that she, in the most sincere faith, at the beginning of the 14th day of this month, between 2 and 3, gave her spirit back to God and departed from here with the greatest and most admirable joy, to the greatest sorrow of us all.</p>
      <p>Gwalther indeed bears this calamity with a very strong spirit, but he is so stunned and unlike himself that I greatly fear for him. Therefore, pray to the Lord that He does not destroy a useful instrument of the church and spares the pious.</p>
      <p>From Geneva, our Beza writes that the state of the church in France is not in a good place. Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to thwart the bloodthirsty plans of the robbers.</p>
      <p>In England and Scotland, there are great tumults; Satan is therefore stirring up new tragedies. May the Lord crush him! He writes more to me; however, I do not have the leisure to write more to you.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, it is written to me that the imperial diet has been proclaimed and will be held in Augsburg on the calends of January.</p>
      <p>From Vienna, it is written to me from the court that there has been a long effort to restore peace between the emperor and the Turk, but with no successful outcome, the armies have been led into winter quarters.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is a great scarcity and dearness of things in France, England, Lower Germany, and here too, grain is sold at a very high price; therefore, these are the last times, etc.</p>
      <p>I will write more copiously at another time, when grief has disturbed me less. Otherwise, from Vienna, I received a most beautiful writing from a certain great man against Illyricus on the sacramental cause for us; this matter greatly consoles me, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with all our friends, whom you will greet, including the honorable councilors.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 16th of November, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful and most vigilant pastor of the church of Chur, my esteemed and dearest lord and brother. Chur.</p>
