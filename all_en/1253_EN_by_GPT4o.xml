      <p>Greetings. When your last letter was brought here recently, I was away from the city. I had gone with Farel to Orbe to settle some matters with him concerning his church. My absence was the reason I could not offer any service to the good man who brought your letters, whom you recommended to me in your letters. Felix is now staying with Scorus, an excellent and very learned man, my neighbor. This makes me more hopeful about his studies. Wherever I see that my efforts might be useful, I will not allow anything to be lacking from me, which indeed can be done, as you ask of me, nor should you think you need any excuse with me if you more freely, as you see fit, request my efforts, but be assured that I take it as a certain monument and testimony of the silent friendship and goodwill established and confirmed between us, whenever you request some service from me. I would indeed have wished recently to have had a more pleasing subject to write to you about; but my faith, which I owe to you and the church, compelled me to do so. Now, however, we are again forced to write to you about more troublesome matters concerning some of your beneficiaries and church alumni, who have caused us great offenses, about which I will write less, because I believe you will understand the rest more fully from the common letters of my colleagues and professors. Would that Johannes Hala, as he came here as a companion to Josua Pistoris, had always joined himself as a companion in studies and an imitator of morals to that good young man. I wrote not long ago about Josua, which I do not think you were displeased to hear. But you must expect a far different testimony from us about Hala, who seems to have undertaken a contest, as if by profession, against those excellent gifts and virtues that Paul requires from those who are to be appointed to the ministry of the church, so that he might not seem to have left anything undone worthy of such a holy office. And would that we did not miss in him the faith and integrity that are scarcely missed even from a pagan man, ignorant of God, yet not entirely barbaric, but somewhat tinged with the color of honesty and humanity. I am silent about his drunkenness, for which he is very ill-reputed, I am silent about the manual weapon, which he was once caught carrying while wandering through the city at night, and the prostitute, which he hid in the lodging of the Bernese beneficiaries, about which more will be written to you. But although these are very serious, nothing moves me more than his treachery towards a certain host of his, whose household he so disturbed that he could have provided just cause for divorce or certainly a very serious and dangerous dissension between husband and wife, unless the Lord had intervened. He is a man given to his belly, shameless, a liar, caught in many very serious lies and crimes, nor does he seem to care much for the warnings of those whom he ought to have greatly revered. These things may perhaps seem very harsh to you; but he is worthy of a harsher accusation. I do not doubt that he lies much to you; but we speak of things discovered and detected. However, I refrain from recounting the whole story for the sake of modesty, and so as not to harm the reputation of the family of those whom he has greatly wronged. I only add that in my judgment nothing is more advisable than that he be immediately recalled from here and receive from you the praise and reward he deserves. Certainly, if we had many such scholars, they would impose great hindrances on our ministry and inflict a disgraceful mark of infamy on honest studies. I do not doubt that these things will grieve you greatly; but such is the fate of the church and of all of us. If one has disappointed your expectations, let the studies of others, who have shown themselves worthy of you and us, cheer you. There is one to whom the company of Hala has been of little benefit; another is a studious and good young man, in my judgment.</p>
      <p>I write more freely to you about all these matters because I have often learned from experience how necessary it is for us to know the character of those who are to be appointed to the church, so that hands are not laid on anyone rashly and plagues are not imposed on the church instead of pastors. In this matter, we did not want to disappoint your expectations of us, especially since we see that our faith, freedom, and candor are approved by you. But enough of this.</p>
      <p>I recently received a copy of the Consensus published by you, which you sent to me, for which I am very grateful. Around the same time, it was printed in Geneva in Latin and French types.</p>
      <p>I hope it will be very beneficial to the church. I do not think you doubt what I think of it, and how much I approve of it.</p>
      <p>The church in Geneva is doing well. The plague greatly disturbs our people and has greatly disrupted our schools, although it has not yet raged more violently. But the fear of our people in such calamities is remarkable, which hinders our ministry with various difficulties. But we cannot remove this fear from them.</p>
      <p>You will hear more fully about the state of all of us from this messenger, a man very fond of us and a very good man, whose business and the boys he is about to entrust to your discipline, I strongly urge you to have commended.</p>
      <p>We suspect the same about the plans of the Emperor and the Pope as you write. For what should we expect from those men?</p>
      <p>However, no preparation of his seems apparent. What will happen is in the hand of the Lord, who can scatter the councils and plans of the impious. You rightly advise that we must fight against such enemies with earnest prayers. May the Lord supply us all with the spirit of faith, courage, and constancy. My brothers and fellow ministers greet you and all your colleagues and fellow ministers most respectfully. I greeted Beza in your name, as you ordered.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for a long time for his church! These things are written in haste. Farewell. Lausanne, April 25, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent servant of Jesus Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zürich church, brother and most esteemed fellow minister. In Zürich.</p>
