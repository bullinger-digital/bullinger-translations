    <p xml:id="regest1">Received the book and requests the return of the booklet on the Concordat trade. Has received the 4 Schillings and 15 Batzen; will settle the remaining debt of 10 Schillings from his own pocket if necessary. Will share news from England as soon as possible. Regarding Reichenau, nothing has been decided yet, although the [Constance] canons are pressing; ZÃ¼rich and others are resisting. The Emperor [Charles V] was in Paris and is now in Flanders; the Protestants are likely to be subdued more by cunning than by force. When Bullinger visits [Bubikon], he does not want Stumpf to gather the pastors; he simply wishes to escape the hustle and bustle [of the city]. Stumpf can have the lute pieces collected. Has not had to write in such a time crunch for months.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>I have received the book back from Brother Wolff; I request, if it is not inconvenient for you, that you also send me the booklet soon, which I lent you on the Concordat trade, etc.</p>
      <p>The 4 Schillings have also been received, as well as the 15 Batzen. The remaining debt is still 10 Schillings; you need not worry about it. If I receive something here, I will give it; if not, I will pay it from my own pocket. And no one should be further troubled.</p>
      <p>As soon as I have certain news from England, I will share it with you. Nothing has been decided yet regarding Reichenau; the canons of Constance would like it, but my lords and others are resisting.</p>
      <p>The Emperor [Charles V] has been in Paris and is now in Flanders. Much pomp is being displayed. I fear that our people will be more hindered by cunning than forced by the sword. In this way, they will be more easily overcome than by force. Our people intend to be honest and brave. May God grant grace.</p>
      <p>When I come up to you, I do not wish for any gathering or disturbance or expenses that the brothers have with me; I would rather stay at home. If I come to you, it would be more to escape the hustle and bustle and to enjoy myself with you, one or two at most, etc.</p>
      <p>You should be certain about the pieces for the lute. Occasionally send someone here within 8 days to inquire, etc.</p>
      <p>I have written in such great discomfort, as I have not had for several months. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, H. B.</p>
      <p>To his Stumpf.</p>
