      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Johannes a Lasco, our superintendent, would have gladly written to you, my most esteemed lord, about all the matters occurring here, if the burden of affairs in which he is involved had not prevented him. Therefore, he wished that I write somewhat more detailed letters in his name about everything, which I have diligently undertaken to do, as is fitting. I do not doubt that you have heard about the captivity of the Duke of Somerset, his wife, and many other nobles. The cause of this is variously spread; however, I understand from trustworthy men that it was because he conspired against some of the councilors, which is a capital offense. For the royal council, after the first captivity of the Duke of Somerset, enacted a law for their firmer union that anyone from the royal council who secretly plotted against any councilor would perish by hanging like a thief. Since Somerset was said to have sinned in this way, he was captured on the sixteenth of October, and the next day his wife and many nobles, who were thought to be aware of this conspiracy, were also captured. On the first of December, the case of the Duke of Somerset was conducted in Westminster Hall from early morning until evening. He could not be accused of any royal treason and is said to have refuted all accusations bravely and prudently. However, since he could not clear himself of a certain conspiracy against some councilors, he was sentenced to hanging according to the law even enacted by Somerset himself. But on January 22, he was beheaded with great lamentation from the people: then on February 26, for the same cause, two knights were hanged, and two others were beheaded. I fear the same fate for the wife of Somerset, as she is said to be a great part of all the evil. We must pray to the Lord that all things may turn to His glory and that He may preserve His church in these tumults.</p>
      <p>We have great hope for the reformation of the church and state in this parliament, for eight pious bishops have been appointed for the reformation of the church, among whom is Mr. Hooper, eight doctors of theology, among whom is Mr. Johannes a Lasco, a man fearless in the business of piety, and Mr. Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>So far, things have gone quite well, and if the Bishop of London and the Bishop of Ely did not obstruct with their human reasons, I think the matter would have progressed further; but I hope they will achieve nothing. For the King is very eager for purity and urges serious reformation, and those who are most authoritative in the royal council seek the same. Mr. Hooper's authority in the royal council grows greater by the day, from which I hope the greatest benefit will come to the church. The works of our foreign church, under Mr. a Lasco, our most vigilant superintendent, are succeeding most happily (thanks be to the Lord). We must pray to the Lord that He may complete what He has begun and that He may wish to protect all His churches, which Satan does not cease to attack with marvelous arts. But it is well that he is defeated and bound by Christ the Lord, who may deliver you from the midst of warlike tumults, so that you may not suffer any harm because of the nearby evil. Farewell, my lord, and may God continue to enlighten you with His spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p>Deign to greet in our name all my esteemed teachers, Mr. Pellicanus, Bibliander, and Gesner. London, March 9, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant Antistes, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
