      <p> I have received an excerpt in haste of the response given by the electors and princes, etc., to His Imperial Majesty on September 26 regarding the important article; I truly had to let it go immediately and could not copy it, except only as much as the electors and princes, along with other estates, desire that His Imperial Majesty should pursue the agreed council in such a manner and advance the matters so that it will be arranged according to the decision made at the recent Diet held here in Augsburg, which the estates are willing to expect. </p>
      <p> However, some electors are of the opinion that, to prevent all sorts of confusion, His Imperial Majesty should be reminded to ensure that the points previously decided in the Council of Trent are not considered as definitively decided, but should be reconsidered and discussed thoroughly anew, and thus this word "continuation" should be clarified in its proper form. It is also reported by the chancellor of Mainz before His Imperial Majesty why the Interim could not be implemented in many places, and also why the spiritual reformation could not be fully executed, with some very mocking and ridiculous remarks, such as when he speaks of the clergy, that they set a bad example for others with their frivolous and scandalous lives. Doctor Alber responded on their behalf, wishing that God would forbid such things, that it should be truthfully said of the clergy in general that they set a bad example with their extravagant lives, etc.; perhaps some among them might be found who did not conduct themselves according to the reformation, etc. Also, the exempt clergy do not want to be visited or reformed by the ordinaries, because they are highly endowed and privileged by the Pope; they say it would be unjust to them if they were to be reformed in such a manner. There is much to this matter. What His Imperial Majesty further responded and how everything was concluded, I have not yet heard; but the spiritual princes are also deliberating, and another day is set for the future Feast of the Three Kings. </p>
      <p> To his Bullinger. </p>
