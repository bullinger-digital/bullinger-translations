    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] From Augsburg, it was written that the French envoy [Charles de Brissac] was gifted 1500 crowns by Emperor Charles V and was sent off, riding back to Basel. Bullinger should investigate whether the relationship between the Emperor and France is really as good as claimed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] According to another report from Augsburg, the Emperor is said to have ridden to Munich under the pretext of hunting. The true reason is his illness. He resembles a living corpse. His doctors are at a loss and believe it would be better if he dies in Munich rather than in Augsburg, especially since his death can be concealed longer there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It is said that all the electors, except Maurice of Saxony, have left the search for a solution to the religious matter to the Emperor. Blarer will soon find out if this is true.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] His brother-in-law [Stephan Schäffer] wrote from Esslingen that on September 19, 700 Dutch riders destined for Augsburg rode through the city, another troop of riders moved into the Remstal, and a third to Schwäbisch Hall and Dinkelsbühl. Everything is intended for the Emperor. There is also repeated talk of an advance by the Emperor against Konstanz and the Confederation. This is also evident from other letters. Hopefully, it is not true!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Some people from Konstanz were informed by letter that new unrest had broken out in Bohemia. Even the Emperor found the punishments imposed by King Ferdinand so cruel that he wrote him a letter about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Martin Bucer reports of a possible wintering of the Emperor in Strasbourg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blarer has not yet received the letter [No. 3014] that Bullinger mentioned in his last letter [No. 3019]. He does not know why Johannes Gisling has not yet delivered it. However, he has also not heard that Gisling has returned from Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Blarer does not know what should happen to the still imprisoned Spaniard [...]. As far as he knows, apart from his reckless offense, he has done nothing that would deserve the death penalty, which the Spaniard also emphasizes. He always attributes his outrageous act to drunkenness. Blarer only heard that Jakob Zorn ran up with many others. He has never heard of a glorious brave act by a single person. However, he must admit that he has not been particularly interested in the matter. He also does not want to dispute Jakob Zorn's bravery if he indeed dared, as an unarmed Swiss, to snatch the reins from an armed and rapidly galloping Spaniard!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Blarer thanks for the copy of the excerpts from the long pasquinade [...]. This is also available in Konstanz. The people of Konstanz have truly become the laughingstock of their neighbors! They deserve it, however, since they have not taken the Gospel seriously. May the Lord take this disgrace away from all those who come to their senses again!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Just now, at dinner time, another letter from Bullinger [not received] arrived with the defense speech [“Contra scandala ex bello infeliciter gesto oborta Apologia”] and the description of the Glarus celestial phenomenon. How should Blarer thank him for this? According to Bullinger's wish, he will forward these documents to Vadian as soon as he has read them. Should he or any colleague receive an interpretation of the vision, he will share it. Hopefully, this phenomenon is a good omen! Bullinger should pray for the people of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Blarer concludes here, as he still has to write to Augsburg and Isny.</p>

      <p>It is written from Augsburg that the French envoy was very well received by the Emperor and was honored with 1500 crowns, after which he rode back to Basel. Dear friend, please investigate whether there truly is a good relationship between the Emperor and the French, as is claimed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It is also written from Augsburg that the Emperor rode to Munich under the pretense of wanting to hunt. However, it is believed that he was taken there due to illness, as he resembles no living person: he is nothing but a living corpse, and the doctors are quite despondent about him. They believe it would be better for him to die in Munich than in Augsburg, for many reasons, especially so that it can be kept secret longer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>All the electors are said to have left the religious matter to the Emperor, except for Duke Maurice. He does not want to do so. But I will soon find out what is true about this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>My brother-in-law from Esslingen writes that on September 19, more than 700 Dutch horses passed through Esslingen to Augsburg, another group of Dutch horses moved up the Remstal, and yet another group towards Hall and Dinkelsbühl, all for the Emperor. There is constant talk among them that the Emperor wants to attack Konstanz along with the Swiss. This is also written to us from other places. But we hope entirely in God that there is nothing to it. Amen. Amen!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It has also been written to some here that there is new unrest in Bohemia, and the king has acted so cruelly that the Emperor himself was greatly displeased and wrote to him about it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Bucer wrote to me from Strasbourg that it is said and believed that the Emperor wants to winter with them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The things you mentioned in your last letter, I have not yet received. I do not know what is delaying Johannes Gisling from delivering it, although I have also not heard from anyone whether he has returned from Zurich.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Spaniard is still held in chains. I do not know what will become of him, nor have I heard that he has confessed to anything deserving of death, apart from that reckless act. Whatever he did here, he consistently blames on drunkenness. I heard that Jakob Zorn ran up with many others. I have not heard of any singular act of bravery by the man, although I have not worked very diligently to find out. However, I will not begrudge good Jakob this praise of bravery if he indeed dared, as an unarmed Swiss, to snatch the reins from an armed Spaniard on a very fast horse.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>We thank you very much for the fragments from the long pasquinade you described. We have truly become a reproach to our neighbors, a mockery and ridicule to those around us. But we deserve it, for we have treated the true and serious Gospel of Christ as a game. May the Lord take away our disgrace as we maturely repent!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Now, at dinner, another letter from you has arrived with the apologetic speech and the vision of Glarus, for which I can never thank you enough. I will send it to our Vadian as soon as I have read it, as you request. If any interpretation of that vision is revealed to me or any of ours, I will not hide it from you. May it portend something good for us! Pray for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I must now write to Augsburg and Isny, so I cannot add anything further. September 29, 1547.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere bishop of the Zurichers, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
