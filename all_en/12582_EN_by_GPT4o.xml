    <p xml:id="regest1">With great concern, Bullinger learns that the surgeon Jakob Ruf has been called to Blarer. Blarer should take good care of himself and pray, which Bullinger will also do for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In his condition, Blarer should no longer write letters to Bullinger. However, he could report through [Jakob] Funcklin if there is something important.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger has received Blarer's last two letters [No. 2522 and No. 2530].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- His commentary on Luke is taking up a lot of his time, so he must be brief with everything else. He will write the letter to the Swiss mercenaries later. If Blarer agrees, Bullinger will dedicate his commentary to all the mayors and the entire council of the city of Augsburg. He hopes to be able to write the dedication during the next week. [Hans] Welser's weakness troubles him greatly. Hopefully, he will recover!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- He will report on the Diet of Baden as soon as he is informed about it. The [Schmalkaldic War] worries everyone. May God turn everything for the better and also let Blarer recover!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings to [Thomas Blarer] and [Konrad Zwick].</p>

      <p>Greetings. With the greatest sorrow, I hear, most esteemed brother in the Lord, that Jakob, our surgeon, has been called to you; from which I easily infer that your affairs are not in the best condition. I sincerely pray to the Lord, and will not cease to pray, that He may restore you to His church and to all of us in good health! My dearest brother, take care of yourself. Do not rashly expose yourself to any danger, I implore you again and again! Consult diligently with the best advisors about what needs to be done. Pray to the Lord above all. He is the healer of our souls and bodies. He never abandons those who trust in His protection. O happy the messenger who will announce that you have been restored to us! May the Lord Jesus have mercy on you and keep you safe!</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Furthermore, I do not ask you to write anything to me, even though I miss your letters greatly. I do not want you to aggravate or bring on your illness with work. If only you would write through Funcklin, our beloved brother, if you thought anything was worth the effort. But I do not wish to be a burden to you here either.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have received your last letters along with others written before them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>My work on Luke is pressing me and keeps me so occupied that I must be brief in everything else. Not even now is it possible to send the letter to the Swiss soldiers. I will send others. Unless you think otherwise, I will dedicate my work on Luke to the mayors and the entire council of the city of Augsburg. God willing, I will write the preface next week. I am very troubled by the illness that has befallen our Welser. May he recover again!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I have some information from the Diet of Baden. However, I will write everything once I have learned all with certainty. The German war keeps us very anxious. May the Lord turn everything for the better. May He restore you to us in good health.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell, my dearest brother, along with the most distinguished men, your brother and cousin. Farewell again and again. August 14, at 8 in the afternoon, 1546. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his incomparable brother. In Constance.</p>
