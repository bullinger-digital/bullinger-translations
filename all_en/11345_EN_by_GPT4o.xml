    <p xml:id="regest1">[Christoph Froschauer] sends Vadian a few copies of the newly printed book [„Orthodoxa et erudita D. Joachim Vadiani... epistola“]; Bullinger thanks him for his benevolent cooperation. Vadian's conflict [with Appenzell] will be negotiated [at the Diet] in Baden. [Hans] Vogler writes from Riquewihr that Georg [of Württemberg] has removed images and altars in his county and established schools. Hopes that the rumor, according to which King [Henry VIII] of England has fallen away from the Gospel due to a marriage and alliance with Emperor Charles [V], is not true; will report on the matter as soon as the letters and the young man he expects from England have arrived.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Your book has been printed, most learned Vadian, as you see; for the printer sends a few copies. I truly give the greatest thanks for your efforts and dedication. I believe I am fortunate to have been the author of a great good for the scholars through you. May the Lord repay you; for you bestow such great benefits upon me that I cannot repay them myself. Meanwhile, I will be entirely yours. Your matter will be taken care of in Baden. Otherwise, I have nothing to write, except that Vogler now writes from Riquewihr that Prince Georg in recent days has completely removed idols and mass altars in his county and has established several schools, etc.; for which I think thanks should be given to the Lord. Furthermore, there is a rumor that the King of England has defected from the Gospel and returned to his vomit, and this because of some marriage and an alliance with Emperor Charles. May the Lord ensure that the rumor has not brought the truth. I am expecting letters and a young man from England. When he arrives, I will write everything. Farewell with your family. August 26, in the year 1539. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his most esteemed Lord Joachim Vadian, his own.</p>
