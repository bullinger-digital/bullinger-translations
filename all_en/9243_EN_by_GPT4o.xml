      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you, most pious father, these days. Now, therefore, I have nothing, except that this Lord Gracilis, the faithful guardian and tutor of the sons of the late admiral, has come to you. He himself will explain why he does this and what he is going to request from your magistrate; you will indeed understand from this note of Lord Steiger and the letters of the Coligny brothers given to me, which I send enclosed with these and I beg that, when you have used them, you return them to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell. March 12, 1573.</p>
      <p>Yours in all things, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
