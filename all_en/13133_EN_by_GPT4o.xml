    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The letter delivered here has just arrived, and Blarer was instructed to forward it to Bullinger. Blarer includes another letter with this one, which is so important that he decided to send both letters to Bullinger with his own messenger [...] because he thinks their contents are of interest to the people of Zurich. Bullinger should send the second letter back with the bearer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Today he will likely have received Blarer's letter [No. 3083 from November 23].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He prays earnestly for the people of Konstanz.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother, this letter, having just arrived at this hour and instructed to send it to you, along with the other letter which I am sending to you herewith, is so important, as you have perceived, that I wanted to send it to you with my own messenger, as I am concerned that there might be something contained within that is necessary to know. Therefore, please take it in good faith. I have truly done it with the best intentions, and please send the other letter back to me without delay.</p>
