      <p>Greetings. I have had nothing worth mentioning for some time, so I have written little or nothing; now I resume the duty of writing, not because I have anything necessary to recount, but because I did not want to remain silent any longer. It is reported from the Netherlands for certain that Lord de Thermes, Marshal of France (that is, the greater salt, that is, of the court) and Lieutenant of Calais, with 3,000 cavalry and 9,000 infantry, set out against Philip and first occupied several noble places in Flanders, among which was Dunkirk, a very fortified port.</p>
      <p>However, as he advanced to occupy Gravelines, it is said that on the way, with an army of about 9,000, Philip's leaders, Lord de Binicourt and Count of Egmont, confronted him, and indeed, having been lured by the opportunity of the place, the French attacked the army first at noon on the day of St. Margaret, and the battle was fought for a long time with uncertain outcome, finally the victory inclined to the Burgundian or Philippian side; therefore, Lord de Thermes was captured along with many other leaders, the bronze cannons and all the baggage were captured, the cavalry and infantry were captured and 48 standards were reported taken, about 4,000 were killed in the battle; however, the garrisons placed in Dunkirk, 4 standards, when they learned that their army had been routed, thought of fleeing, but were intercepted and slaughtered in the middle of the journey.</p>
      <p>These things, I say, and such are written and spoken of as certain. It is added that Lord de Guise, having gathered a large army of French, Swiss, Germans, and Italians, left Lorraine and Luxembourg in haste to France, to confront the victorious army. For a large number of cavalry and infantry from Philip's side flocked to the victorious army of Belgians, English, Spaniards, Neapolitans, Bohemians, Germans, and even Getae or Hungarians.</p>
      <p>It is said that on both sides the preparations are very great, so that in our memory no greater number of men has been seen. And now perhaps the camps are not far from sight. What will happen, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>The Philippians are said to be very eager for battle, the Frenchman does not want to risk all his affairs on an uncertain battle. I pray the Lord to turn everything to the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Take care, I beg you, to deliver the letters enclosed herewith promptly, well, and diligently. Greet in my name Lord Philipp, the other fellow ministers, the lords consuls, and all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 12, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Johannes Fabricius, minister of the Church of Chur, my godfather and dearest brother. H. Hansen Schmid, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
