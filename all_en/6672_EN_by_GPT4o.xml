      <p>Honorable lord and father, I wrote to you recently in great haste, as I do now. The summary is this: The envoys of the seven cantons have spoken defiantly and concluded their speech with this: one should well remember what has always happened to those who opposed the councils, especially how it fared for those who did not submit to the Council of Constance. You see where this is heading: namely, that they want to subject us to the Council of Trent. But many evangelicals (if it pleases the gods) do not understand this, and there are those who have barely managed to bring their patrons to this point by soliciting them day and night; thus, they are not obscurely heading towards their own ruin. I wish there were no citizens of Chur among them! The Gotteshaus (House of God) has given a firm response. In response, the envoys of the seven cantons agreed to make a treaty, and when things did not proceed according to their wishes, the envoys of the seven cantons managed to persuade the other two leagues, after much lengthy negotiation, to set a law for the Gotteshaus from the two leagues. And since there was no more than one meeting and the envoys of the other leagues had no command from the communities regarding these matters, and the other two leagues had nothing to say to the bishopric, the people of the Gotteshaus opposed the law, and the matter, as I suspect, will come back to the communities anew. The intrigues are strong. If this is advised to the five cantons, the gospel in the leagues will soon have leave, as it otherwise clings as best it can. Whatever happens, I console myself that I have acted with a good conscience in all this. And if at the beginning the Salisian had been removed by force, it would not have happened without bloodshed and the downfall of this city, which I have avoided with God's help. And if we have people who, with force, bring about their own ruin, then God's will be done. I have long said that God will punish us; but I did not know the manner. Now it is beginning to unfold nicely. Jost Tschudi has here uttered many intolerable words against our religion. He is said to have called our faith a "women's faith." The emperor has written to the Gotteshaus and calls the Gotteshaus his subjects and wants the lords of the Gotteshaus to recognize the envoys as their lords. If this comes before the communities, a new fire will start. May God have mercy on us and not give us according to our deserts. The enemies of religion are most fervent, we are most lukewarm. This is sudden.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, in the year 1566.</p>
