      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Here, in good faith, I send you the outcome of our Diet. Due to a shortage of couriers, I could not send it sooner, nor did I have the leisure to describe everything in order; therefore, kindly bear with this confused writing. You can easily make sense of it, as you are quite astute and not lacking in judgment. But please return these documents to me through this courier; I have no other copy. There is no need to write anything to Vadian, as he has everything from me. Aren't our adversaries trying remarkably hard to impose on us with so many delays? Perhaps in the end, the Lord will not forsake us, so that we may be freed from these impostors at some point. May it happen soon, O God!</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is nothing else to write. You can share the gist of the matter with Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Megander, and Sertorius. Do not cease to love us. Farewell with your wife, mother, and children. August 11, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Froschauer produces paper that is fine and very clean; I see this from your and Vadian's letters. Therefore, I would like you to send me a few sheets, so I can see what it is like.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius sends you his most earnest greetings along with the brothers. To Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
