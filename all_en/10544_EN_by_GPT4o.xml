    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer will report on the goodwill of the people of Zurich; their absence [from the meeting in Konstanz] has been understood. Warns against mutual alienation due to the issue of the Lord's Supper and against mistrust of Bucer. After Luther demanded nothing more than a confession to the sacramental union of the body of Christ with the bread, Bucer, after hearing [the representatives of Swabian cities and churches], met with Philipp [Melanchthon] at the invitation of the Landgrave of Hesse; Melanchthon approved Bucer's "Ad Monasterienses" and is now working to gain Luther's approval. At the suggestion of the Landgrave, [in the formula of agreement] only Augsburg is explicitly mentioned, as it is particularly suspected of heresy, especially by the Elector [of Saxony], since it has so far been unwilling to join the confession of less significant cities. Since only moderate demands are now being made, there is now a good prospect for concord. All this should also be communicated to Bullinger's colleagues. In the meantime, Bucer will have returned to Strasbourg via Frankfurt. Zwick asks for more information about Bullinger's concerns regarding Geneva, for suggestions on suitable teachers for [Württemberg] monasteries, for his opinion on Ambrosius Blarer's defense writing, and to inquire with [Werner] Steiner about rumors concerning [Heinrich] Schönbrunner. He has not yet received his letter against the Arians back and would like to borrow Bullinger's excerpts on heretics. Thanks for the cheese; greetings.</p>

      <p>Salvation through Christ.</p>
      <p>What you recently wrote to me, dearest Bullinger, I will ensure that the excellent man Bucer knows, so that he understands how favorably disposed you and yours are towards us. All good people have accepted your absence, although they would have preferred a personal meeting, especially since your people came here not without effort and expense; but I do not doubt there were uncommon reasons for which you can excuse yourselves. Indeed, there is no need for an excuse. No one loves you, dearest brothers in the Lord, any less because of this occasion.</p>
      <p>Only take care, venerable Bullinger, that nothing alienates your minds from ours. This is what Satan aims for. And why? Since he suspects or senses that the long-standing and almost deadly discord over the sacrament might be mended, and that without offense to the word of God, he tries in two thousand cunning ways to prepare a new one, so that, having reconciled with Luther, we might find you perhaps unfavorably disposed. It is indeed the devil's work when one kindles in the heart a crooked view of another. And now there are those who miserably disparage our congregation, as if we have done this one thing to burden the church with new and papal traditions, to renew the tyranny of the Antichrist, and they sprinkle us with not a few stains of this kind. From this first arise evil suspicions, then hatreds, and what each individual does for his own inclinations, this is attributed to all or many, after it has begun to be written and rewritten in offended minds privately. Finally, we mix our emotions even in public writings, so that not even the most learned annotations on sacred scripture are safe from such trifles. Hence the impotence of minds is revealed, an occasion is given to drive a nail with a nail. The church of Christ, which should be built up in unanimity, is destroyed by private and public dissensions. Finally, what is most miserable of all, we betray ourselves to posterity, leaving even an example of contention. Therefore, make an effort, holy brother, that no root of bitterness sprouts up against Bucer or the other brothers.</p>
      <p>What was done in the congregation with us, you know from the letters of the brothers, namely nothing else, but to compare how much they differ from Luther. Whatever Bucer did with ours, the same did Philipp with his. Luther, too, having become more peaceful, demands nothing else from us than that we confess that the body of Christ is truly presented to the faithful soul with the external signs, declaring that he feels nothing about a personal, real, or natural, but only a sacramental union of the body with the bread, and we accepted this long ago. Having understood our position, Bucer went away, called by Catto, where he also found Philipp. Philipp fully accepted the moderation and explanation made by Bucer to the people of Münster, which, if I am not mistaken, I heard was also approved by you. Now Philipp will act with Luther, so that he too may accept this.</p>
      <p>Moreover, beyond all hope, the matter has succeeded happily. For Satan aimed to make us suspect to certain princes, especially the most illustrious prince elector, as sacramentarian heretics, so that he would not enter into a concord with our cities, and hence arose that very small and commendable zeal for concord, namely of Bucer and Philipp. For they tried to root out these suspicions and this source of evil from the mind of the prince and to avert the efforts of the enemies. Now the advice and authority of the more than illustrious prince Landgrave has been added, since it seemed to him that only the Augsburgers should be mentioned, because we have long been recognized as concordant, while he, namely the Saxon, accepted our position at Augsburg and later our confession at Schweinfurt. Therefore, that most noble mind - which may the Lord keep unharmed for a long time - did not think it should be conceded that something did not agree among us, as indeed it agrees in all respects, except that some stick on the modes of speaking. But since the Augsburgers were particularly defamed with the elector, they must now have something special, since they previously wanted to be above it, that they would make their confession with other cities of lesser esteem than they. And so God can deal with people. When one does not want to do what one should and could, one must do it afterwards and sometimes with mockery.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the Landgrave prince, Philipp, and Bucer demand nothing from us than that we persevere in their moderation towards the people of Münster, provided it is free for each to explain in his own church for edification. Nor is anything demanded from the Augsburgers than that they confess the true presentation of the true Christ through the ministry. And never was there greater hope for pure concord. Pray to the Lord, my brother, with all the brothers, that the Lord may promote this matter with His spirit, and that for His name's sake. Let it be, let it be!</p>
      <p>What I write to you, I would also like to be written to Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and the other excellent lords and brothers. Forgive me, however, that I write such bad things; I have less talent for anything else.</p>
      <p>I hope Bucer has already returned home; for he wrote to us from Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Regarding the tragedy with the Bernese and Genevans and the imperialists, which you suspect, I do not quite understand. Explain to me briefly what betrayals you fear.</p>
      <p>If there are men - especially celibates or at least without children - who could lecture in the monasteries, let me know; but they must be pious and learned, who by doctrine and example of life could root out the ingrained religion from minds.</p>
      <p>Mangold sends Ambrosius's apology to you; I await your judgment. Strange things are said here about Schönbrunner in Zug. Ask Steiner if there is anything to it, and earnestly greet Steiner for me, also the Steiner woman who bathes with us, and all her people. I am still obliged to pay all respects.</p>
      <p>You have not yet returned my Arian letter. I saw some excerpts about heretics with you; I would like you to give them to me. I will return them with the next messenger I find.</p>
      <p>By the way, I almost forgot about the cheese! I thank you so much for the ointment for plastering. There are now good little ropes and broad ones, but they taste better before you put them on. I should not have sent the sack back empty, but I have nothing now, so I thank you for your kindness, and greet your young and old mistress for me, also your children, and may God protect, guard, and shield you with His grace.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, president of the church of Zurich, lord and brother to be revered.</p>
