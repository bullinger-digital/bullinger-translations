      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, my willing service to you, etc. in advance. Herewith you are to receive the new tidings, for which my honorable lords, I with them, express the highest thanks: always ready to serve us. News is of little use to me at this time, except that the abbot intends to punish his poor subjects, who are burdened with poverty, by forcing them to confession, to mass, to the sacrament. A Roschacher has become a citizen here, a Rietman; he has left from there in time. The bow is about to be overdrawn. May God grant that it breaks soon, if it is not against His holy will. Amen.</p>
      <p>With request, my dutiful greetings and all to Master Thoma, Mr. Walther, and others. Our dear Mr. Johannes Kessler, city scribe, Mr. Bernhart, Mr. Davit Wetter, send you their Christian greetings. May God be gracious with us all; may He keep you in His grace. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant at all times, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, faithful servant of the church in Zurich, my honorable beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
