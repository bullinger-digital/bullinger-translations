    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger praises him undeservedly, yet this serves as an incentive for him; with his comforting letter and the provision of books, he proves himself to be a faithful shepherd of the [Christ's] flock. Altieri intends, as suggested by Bullinger, to address his future book requests to [Konrad?] Gessner. He thanks for the admonition of the bookseller [Maturinus Virginius?], which - at least for the time being - shows effect; his delivery of Bibles as well as Bullinger's commentaries was indeed inadequate, yet Altieri has offered him support out of compassion. He thanks for a book gift from Bullinger [“De origine erroris”?] and is ready to procure books from Venice for him upon request; he sends him warming spices and offers his services. Greetings, especially from the imprisoned brothers [Baldo Lupetino and Pietro Speziale?]; a letter from Bullinger would mean a lot to them.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Although I have long known your singular modesty and integrity of mind, your most elegant letter, which I recently received, has revealed you to me in such a way that I have no doubt that you are the man who is proclaimed by all and most revered. For although you attribute to me qualities that I do not possess, even though I greatly wish it were as you say, perhaps he who granted you greater things will not be mistaken. You have indeed acted out of excessive charity, or because you do not see those things in me that can rightly be criticized, and there are many, or because certain sparks of spirit, which you have long conceived from my letters about myself, seem too ample to you, so that you think they are some kind of light, when they are almost nothing. For our Christ is so small and so infantile that you could recognize his voice as similar to a wailing or babbling. But you, as a sincere minister of Christ, are eager for him to grow and become stronger in us, cleverly used that little flattery to inflame us and, as if with a certain spur, to impel us to more eagerly pursue the study of utmost piety; for virtue, as they say, grows when praised, especially when it is done by a praised man. As for those things which are divinely granted to you above all others and are easily at hand, you almost entirely overlook them, either because you are not aware of them yourself, so you have entrusted that task to others, or, what is more true, you have so humbled yourself that you do not seem to exalt yourself even a little against the greatness and excellence of the gifts, not unaware of how dangerous it is to deal with matters of faith for those who have not yet received the spirit of sobriety. But whatever it is, it will not be absurd if the eye sometimes says to the feet: "How beautiful are my feet," and the feet in turn respond to the eye: "How bright and clear is my eye," yet in such a way that neither the eye nor the feet rightly glory in themselves, but in the Lord, who made both. For such exhortations are very useful and most necessary in the church of God, if they are offered and made mutually and without deceit by brothers. This has been done by you quite accurately, for you have not only brought us great consolation by writing, but by sending books here, you have greatly aided our weakness against the kingdom of the antichrist, which threatens its own destruction. Therefore, we give eternal thanks to God and the Father, who has placed such men in his republic, by whose utmost diligence and vigilant care his flock is rightly fed and avenged and protected against the savagery of wolves.</p>
      <p>As for the books, there is no need for us to trouble you in this matter, since our most excellent and kind [Konrad] Gessner, as you write, has voluntarily undertaken this task for us; we will use his services quite familiarly in the future, where needed. You have acted quite prudently regarding the bookseller, for you have admonished him of his impropriety and treachery, which he used to employ with us in selling books; he has become a little more accommodating, but it is to be feared, lest like a dog to its vomit. You know how reluctantly we shed the old man, under whom we were sold into sin. I am displeased that he only approaches us when he has done more than enough for others who are not faithful. He had promised to give me three Bibles, which I had received for the brothers; he only gave two and your commentaries in fragments, when we desired more and complete ones. But I took pity on him both because he is poor and also because he is too imprudent. I offered him my effort and support, which will not be lacking in any matter where it can be of use.</p>
      <p>Your book, which has been most pleasing to me, I will keep as long as I live, as a monument of your utmost love towards me. I am sorry, however, that I have nothing that you too could keep as some testimony, which would be lasting, of my incredible respect towards you; for I do not know in what I might gratify you. But if among these books, which are available here, any please you, write, I beg you, as soon as possible, which ones you would like, so that we can send them to you. But lest I seem entirely ungrateful in the meantime, I send a bag full of spices; for I think you are delighted by such things because of the great cold. In other matters, if I can provide anything for you or our most loving brothers who are there, I will not refuse anything that I know will be most pleasing to you.</p>
      <p>My lord greets you again and again, as do the other brothers no less, especially those who are with us imprisoned for Christ. You will greatly alleviate their troubles if you write from time to time, whenever you have some leisure. Greet all the saints of the Zurich church and yourself especially, and love us in the Lord, in whom you can do all things, and may you live long and happily.</p>
      <p>Given in Venice, on the eighth day before the Ides of December 1543. Your most observant</p>
      <p>Baldassare Altieri.</p>
      <p>To the lord of utmost piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, lord and brother in Christ, to be uniquely observed. Zurich.</p>
