      <p>Tell, my dear relative, to the most distinguished man, Mr. Bellevre, the ambassador and envoy of the King of France, that although I have recently refrained from approaching him for certain reasons, nevertheless, I am his friend and a far more faithful and sincere supporter of the Kingdom of France than all his pensioners.</p>
      <p>They now see, if they wish their homeland to be safe and the glory of the French kingdom, the oldest and most flourishing of all kingdoms, to remain intact, that during this interregnum, the Spaniards should not penetrate deeper into the innermost parts of the French kingdom than anyone would believe. The Spaniards have notable friends in France itself, even among those they call spiritual. It is written from Italy that some French prefer a Spanish king over any other prince of royal blood. Remember what I told you, which was also written from Milan about the Duke of Savoy, who is entirely dependent on the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>The Pope would prefer, if the Spanish crown cannot be placed on France, to transfer it to him for many reasons. Therefore, the Spaniards and the Savoyards are insinuating themselves into the Grisons and the Five Cantons; they entirely wish to drive the French from the position they have held among the Swiss. To what end, I ask? Whoever does not see this, sees nothing. If the French are wise, they will unite more closely. They have a Polish king, and as far as I understand, the Huguenots do not abhor him; they will obey and serve him faithfully, provided he liberates the captives and grants them freedom of religion, which will not be difficult for him.</p>
      <p>With that peace made, France will flourish again; the plotters and enemies will achieve nothing. But if the king listens to the Roman pontiff and his emissary, Cardinal Lorraine, believe me, he will soon see, which God forbid, the downfall of the French kingdom.</p>
      <p>May the Lord open the eyes of those who need to see and, with God's help, preserve the kingdom, etc. You will add more, which you have heard from me.</p>
      <p>You know my hand.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Georg Keller, doctor of medicine, my most beloved relative.</p>
