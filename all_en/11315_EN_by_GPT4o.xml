    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for the boldness of bothering him again with a letter; does not know if his first letter, which was prompted by Grynäus, has arrived. Recommends a fellow believer [Jean Ribit?], who stayed for a few months as a boarder with Konrad [Geßner] [in Lausanne]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace! Although I am aware that my letters are unworthy to appear before learned men, and are of such a nature that they bring more tedium and annoyance than pleasure or delight to the reader, I could not restrain myself from writing to you again, relying on your kindness, which makes me think that even when I abuse it, I will easily find pardon with you. First, Grynaeus prompted me, an unknown man, to dare to address you, a man most learned in every way. Therefore, attribute this fault to him, who persuaded me to do it more often, even though you do not particularly need these greetings. Nevertheless, I complied, hoping that you would not refuse to admit me, a mere goose among swans, into the number of your friends, or at least allow me to cling to some part. I am uncertain whether my letters have reached you; however, I am convinced that you are of such a nature and candor that you will accept everything in the best part and will consider it kindly, even if something imprudent has slipped from us. Furthermore, the reason that now compels me to address you again, perhaps at an inopportune time, is as follows.</p>
      <p>This pious brother lived with us for several months, becoming very well acquainted, especially with Konrad, with whom he lived. When he announced that he would be traveling to you, having found a convenient opportunity, I could not let it pass without giving him some letters to you. He is truly a man worthy of being recommended by the testimony of all good people, although he does not need commendatory letters, as he will abundantly commend himself to all good people, nor do you need a recommender to introduce him into your friendship, as you are accustomed to having all who sincerely profess themselves disciples of Christ as highly recommended on your own accord. Nevertheless, the matter itself partly compelled me to testify to my affection for the pious brother, and partly to renew or at least initiate and stimulate our friendship. He is an eyewitness and earwitness of the state of our affairs, and if there is anything you wish to know, he will report it abundantly. Certainly, you have never seen anything more gentle and modest, or more alien to pride. I am very pleased with those natures in which, along with holy learning, shines the image of Christian innocence and simplicity. All the brothers who are with us greet you. I beg you not to hesitate to convey my greetings to D. Pellican, Bibliander, Megander, Leo, and the other brothers in my name. Farewell. Lausanne, May 15, 1539. Yours sincerely, Pierre Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most singularly learned and pious D. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant churchman of Zurich.</p>
