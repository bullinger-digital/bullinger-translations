      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Here, there is a very famous rumor about some kind of concord among your citizens and thus a consensus in the gospel forever, but a new war against the Five Cantons is said to be brewing, which is expected to break out soon with the approach of spring. This is something I would not wish for at this time, given the current delicate and weak state of affairs. We have seen a fight against the enemy of God before. Why, I ask, should we strive to provoke Mars again, so uncertain, so dangerous, so alien to Christian gentleness? However, I greatly hope that the messenger who spread this rumor is false, since you, as a leader of the word, pursue the cause of peace with such spirit.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have not yet heard anything about your agreement with the people of Bern, which could not be more beneficial. I beg you, through this good man, to inform me how public matters, especially those concerning religion, stand, and meanwhile urge and stimulate everyone to consider their hearth and home, as they say, so that they may finally abandon their stubbornness. This unfortunate war ended most disastrously. One blames another for the cause, and yet we all, to a man, have deserved this disaster through our own admissions. Why do we not collectively meditate on correcting what we have done wrong through repentance? Many things have remained hidden, and it is not expedient for them to be brought to light through mutual reproaches. I rejoice that your church has been seen by me, considered and understood more closely. For as far as learning is concerned, what, I ask, should I require? As for piety, why should I doubt that it will strike deeper roots day by day? This will happen through your ministry, my brother. You bear the greatest burden, namely the salvation of the Christian republic of such great dominion. For you would govern the religion of private individuals with less danger. Here it is necessary to be cautious, lest the magistrates do either too much or nothing at all concerning the matters of the kingdom of Christ. But these things are known to you.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I am eager to know whether the senators have relieved the parish priests of the necessity of waging war. For what does an apostolic man have in common with arms? It should be considered with what affections the zeal for war imbues the ministry of the spirit, then how it discredits it among the common people, and finally, that widows and orphans at home need a comforter, and indeed there are more souls left at home than those who have rushed to the sudden tumult of war. The parish priest has taken their care upon himself. I omit that there is little room for a tranquil spirit among arms, but an open field for exhorting to repentance those who, frightened by fear, have remained at home. We, ministers of the spirit, grow through the arts of peace, not through unusual stratagems, which are excellently employed by the worst of men. I write these things so that you may weigh them in the balance of judgment. For I hope the people of Bern have accepted these good counsels. Greet all friends in order as if I were listing their names; for I would rather be found grateful in deeds than in words.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, March 5, 1532.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Köpffel.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zürich, his friend and brother. Zürich.</p>
