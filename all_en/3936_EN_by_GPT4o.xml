      <p>Grace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>If we did not know your disposition, Bullinger, we might perhaps trouble you with many words regarding any students, especially the pupils of our church. But now, since you have shown yourself as a father to our compatriots, we ask that you also support this bearer of our letter with the same care as you do the others. He is of noble and pious lineage, and we do not doubt that during the years he spent in Strasbourg devoted to his studies, he was diligent enough, as his testimonial letters attest.</p>
      <p>Now, by the order of the school authorities, he is traveling to you to study sacred letters. If you keep him with the other compatriots under strict discipline, you will do something most pleasing to the school authorities and gratifying to God. The letters you sent us to forward to Tübingen, along with those you sent to Jakob, we finally managed to send there on the 25th of this month through that student who accompanied Mr. Gessner; we could not do it sooner.</p>
      <p>We could not do it sooner, nor was it our fault that they were not delivered there long ago.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to Mr. Martyr, Bibliander, and Gwalther in my name.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for His church for a long time, brother and esteemed lord in Christ. My fellow ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, in the year of the world's redemption 1559, on the 6th day before the calends of May.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent in piety, candor, and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the city of Zürich, his esteemed brother and lord. Zürich.</p>
