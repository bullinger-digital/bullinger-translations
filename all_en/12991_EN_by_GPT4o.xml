    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger should excuse that Haller is writing again. Since he loves Bullinger so much, he allows himself some liberties.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Today he was once again with Hans Welser and is now fully informed about the decision of the Augsburg authorities. They have decided to send him back to Zurich because they were requested to do so by the Zurich council, in case they could not grant Haller protection. However, he is not to leave immediately but should pretend to stay in Augsburg to thwart any potential attack plan during the journey home (since the whole city is already talking about the impending departure)! He is to set off only in a month. He fully agreed to this plan. Welser also said he did not want Haller to be there in three months, especially since the people of Augsburg would no longer be their own masters. However, Haller offered to stay longer if necessary, to which Welser remarked: If the Great Council of Zurich agrees.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Recently, a priest [...] tried to seduce a woman [...], with whom he is quartered, with flattery and money for intercourse. She attacked him, slapped him in the face, ran away, and told everyone about it. In this way, God reveals the depravity of these good-for-nothings!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Written on July 5, immediately before the departure of the messenger [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] On the advice of his wife [Elsbeth, n√©e Kambli], Haller requests the following: Since his departure is a decided matter (unless something intervenes), Bullinger should find him suitable accommodation, as he does not want to be a burden to the [Kambli] family or other people for long with his children [Agnes and Johannes d.J.]. The rental and moving dates in Zurich fall on the equinox. Therefore, he does not need to ask Bullinger to find him a new position as well.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I write again. Forgive my importunity. I love you so much that I think I can take any liberty with you.</p>

      <p>Today I was once again with Hans Welser and have fully learned what their decision is. Since the Zurich authorities have written to send me back (unless they can provide secure protection), they have decided to do so. However, to avoid being exposed or endangered on the journey, now (since the rumor is spreading throughout the city that I am about to leave) they want me to pretend to stay. Thus, they will let me go within a month. I will gladly comply with this plan. Welser confessed everything to me and among other things, he said: "I would not want you, my dear Haller, to be here in 3 months. We are captives, no longer masters of our own fate," etc. For I promised that if they needed my services in the future, I would not refuse them, provided the Great Council of Zurich consents - to which he added these remarks, etc.</p>

      <p>Something happened again yesterday that I will add here: A certain priest, having been quartered with a woman, tried to seduce her with money for intercourse, having first flattered her greatly. But she attacked him, struck him in the face with her fists, fled, and exposed the priest's disgrace to the whole city. Thus, the Lord exposes the wickedness of these scoundrels by catching them in their own crimes.</p>

      <p>July 5, as the messenger was about to depart.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Meanwhile, I would also like to ask you, since my return is certain unless God or fate intervenes, to find me some suitable accommodation. I cannot be a burden to my family or others for long with my children. I know that rentals and relocations usually occur around the next equinox. Therefore, at my wife's suggestion, I wanted to ask you this. I do not ask about the conditions, because I know it is not necessary to ask you here.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my uniquely esteemed lord. M. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
