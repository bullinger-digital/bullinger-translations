    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Blarer is still in Griesenberg with his sister [Barbara], whose husband [Heinrich von Ulm] passed away on November 14th in blessed trust in Christ. Blarer will return to [Constance] within the next two days. Therefore, Bullinger should not be surprised if he does not receive any news from him; however, he will be kept informed by [the Zurich councilors]. As soon as Blarer is back home, he will report diligently again, unless Bullinger receives more detailed news from his [authorities]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Bullinger should pray for Blarer and his grieving sister. She asks Bullinger to admonish Jakob Röist [the husband of her niece Barbara] not to deviate from the ways of his father [Diethelm]. It is heard that Jakob is being led astray from the right path by bad company. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Blarer has conveyed Bullinger's request [for better remuneration] from [Hans Rudolf] Lavater's son [Wolfgang] to K[onrad] Zwick and has reminded him of it in writing once more. If only Bullinger had mentioned this earlier, before Zwick's departure to Ulm! It would have been easier to negotiate face to face. </p>

      <p>Greetings, my venerable and dearest brother. I am still in Griesenberg with my excellent sister, but now a most sorrowful widow, whose husband Heinrich, three days ago, relying on firm faith in Christ, happily entered the promised inheritance in heaven. I will return home to Constance tomorrow or the day after; I thought it necessary to inform you of this so that you are not surprised that I have not written to you about new matters in these days, although your people are keeping you informed. Once I return home, I will diligently ensure that you are not more active in writing to me than I am to you, unless your own affairs provide you with more material to write about.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Make sure to commend me diligently to Christ. My sister, deeply afflicted by her husband's death, commends herself to your holy prayers and earnestly asks that you be a diligent advisor to Jakob Röist, so that he does not deviate from the character of his excellent father. For we hear that he is being led astray by the company of some rather unworthy men from the path he embarked on since childhood. Therefore, it would be in his best interest to be brought back to the right path as soon as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding what you asked about Lavater's son, I have dutifully acted with C[onrad] Zwick, my friend, whom I have also reminded in writing again, so that he does not let it slip his mind. And if only you had reminded me of this a little earlier, that is, before Conrad Zwick recently departed for Ulm! For he could have handled this matter much more successfully in person.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger, and respectfully and lovingly greet your household with all the brothers and friends. Griesenberg, November 16, 1546. Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the people of Zurich, an incomparable friend.</p>
