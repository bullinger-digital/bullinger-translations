      <p>Even if I had nothing new to write to you, most illustrious man, nevertheless, I did not allow Froschauer, who brought your most friendly letters, to leave without my letters. I have written, however, that your recent letters to the Count of WÃ¼rttemberg, along with the packet, have been well taken care of, and there is no doubt that he has already received everything through his people. It is a well-known rumor that the Margrave of Brandenburg has defected to Emperor Charles from the French, but on what terms, it is not yet known to us. I hear that some cardinals and princes are intervening and thinking about making peace between the French and the Emperor, but there will never be peace for the impious. We have received letters these days from the brothers in Augsburg, who write that they are bravely preaching the gospel, not even mentioning that new destruction of the Reformation instituted by Charles four years ago against the open word of God. They also assert that Prince of Mansfeld has occupied almost the entire Duchy of Brunswick and has plundered I don't know how many bishoprics; but I do not yet give credence to the rumors until I hear similar things from others as well. You will receive the rest from Froschauer and other Zurichers who have attended our fairs, whom you will have as the equivalent of a lengthy letter. The wife of Myconius, of pious memory, also died on November 3rd, and many are continually seized and taken from us by the plague here. We hope for better things with the approaching winter solstice.</p>
      <p>But let the good will of the Lord be done. Farewell. Basel, November 8, 1552.</p>
      <p>Marcus Bersius and Oporinus also send their greetings to you. Yours, Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable lord and friend.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
