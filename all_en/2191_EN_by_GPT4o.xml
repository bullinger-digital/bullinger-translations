      <p>Greetings. The messenger did not come to me until he was just about to leave. Therefore, I cannot write everything I would like through him. However, I received your letters and give you immense thanks for your holy work concerning the Grace of God. I have two copies of the Acts against Servetus, one of which belongs to you, and the other to Mr. Gwalther. But I could not burden him with these. I will send them shortly through Wittenbach's nephew, who is setting out to stay with you and Mr. Gwalther. I am called away to a certain wedding. Therefore, I cannot write more now. I always commend myself to you. Farewell with all your family. Given in Bern on February 19, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
