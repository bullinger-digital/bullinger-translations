    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not doubt that Bullinger is well informed about the events in Württemberg, but still wants to write to him, as so many different and inappropriate things are happening. Sends a copy of a letter from Blarer addressed to Frecht, in which Blarer explains how an agreement with Schnepf was reached with the help of the Marburg Formula. However, Euander cannot see that an agreement between Zwingli and Luther was reached in Marburg based on this formula, and suspects that for those unfamiliar with the matter, the contradictions are being glossed over with words. The copy of a letter from Bucer addressed to Frecht shows that he is convinced that the Lutherans made more concessions with the formula than Blarer. For Euander, it is unacceptable to deviate from the truth out of consideration for someone else's impudence. From the partial copy of a letter from Philipp Melanchthon to Bucer, one can discern the interest in a concord. Peter Buffler has learned about the articles of the Peace of Kaaden, from which Euander quotes the prohibition of the Sacramentarians. It is not surprising, therefore, that the duchy is being reformed according to the Augsburg Confession, but it is painful, as Zwingli has refuted Luther's doctrine of the Lord's Supper. News. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Although I do not doubt that you, most excellent man, are more clearly and precisely informed about all that is happening everywhere than you need to be by my writings, nevertheless, since so many different and, in my judgment, unworthy things happen daily, I cannot help but write them to you and at the same time inquire what you think about them. First of all, I will recount what recently happened between Schnepf and Blarer in Stuttgart and how they have now come to an agreement. But to pursue everything more conveniently and to deviate less from the truth, we send the letters of Blarer himself, in which he himself informed the preacher of Ulm about that matter, and then the Ulm preacher sent here the autograph of Blarer himself, transcribed verbatim by our Friccius. Thus, the letter written by Blarer himself, which was delivered to Ulm on August 26, read as follows:</p>
      <p>«Blarer to his Frechtio, greetings. Know that in that discussion Schnepf and I completely opposed each other diametrically and I could not in any way subscribe to his opinion. He kept insisting to me "carnally and corporally". Then, when I had more fully explained to the prince how important it was for peace to be made between us, he again, having called Schnepf, did much so that we might understand each other in such a way that we would come to one opinion. After a long contention, when by chance I had with me a certain note offered to us by the Lutherans at Marburg, which read: "We confess that by virtue of these words: 'This is my body, this is my blood', the body and blood of Christ are truly, that is, essentially and substantially, but not qualitatively or quantitatively or locally, present and given in the supper", Schnepf said he could agree with me if I granted this. Whereupon I immediately said: "I do not refuse anything, provided you do not burden me with those recent adverbs 'fleshly, bodily'." When he promised this, the prince immediately said: "I will be a witness," filled with great joy in the meantime. You see, therefore, Christian brother, that I have given nothing alien to the opinion of our people. "Substantially" was previously in the apology of the Saxon confession, which our people also accepted, and I also openly testified that I would not bear it if either Schnepf or anyone else said that I had departed even a hair's breadth, as they say, from that opinion which I taught in all the churches where God used my ministry. Moreover, the prince himself forbade that either of us should spread the rumor that the other had recanted, but that we should affirm what had been agreed between us. However, a few days later, the prince ordered that we should prescribe the Saxon confession to the parish teachers to be held in the churches in turn. Schnepf most solemnly promised to do this. Therefore, Christian brother, be of a calm mind. Farewell.»</p>
      <p>This is, most sincere man, the letter of Blarer delivered to Frechtio in Ulm on August 26, faithfully transcribed, in which I see Blarer congratulating himself that he has given nothing except what others had previously given. But I do not see whether Zwingli ever conceded these things, since after that journey he and Luther did not agree more than before. Indeed, Luther openly professed that he could agree with these enthusiasts no less than before. Or, if they have conceded "substantively and essentially", which indeed would not bind the very quantity of Christ's body here, but nevertheless cast some kind of smoke over the less experienced, I do not clearly see what they want to prove with this expression "truly", except that I suspect they are deliberately playing with the wrappings of words so as not to appear to yield. But you will easily judge these things through your singular perspicacity of mind.</p>
      <p>Now, receive what Bucer wrote to the same Frechtio of Ulm about the future concord between us on August 27:</p>
      <p>«Bucer to his Frechtio, greetings. Philip today gave a very clear hope of solid concord. Therefore, there is no reason to despair about the duchy of Württemberg and to let the other smokes vanish again with the recantation. Certainly, they concede more of their own when they concede "not qualitatively, not quantitatively, not locally" than we give by "essentially and substantially". For who among us has not always confessed that Christ himself is presented to us, that is, according to essence and substance, but indeed not in the manner of this world, therefore not carnally, etc.? Let us be strong and tolerant. The Lord will temper this paroxysm of the church. In Strasbourg.»</p>
      <p>Bucer sincerely, as always, but not gravely enough in my judgment, said that they conceded more than we did, as if it were necessary to concede the truth because of someone else's importunity or as if it were enough to concede many things to those people unless you completely subscribe to them and descend into their opinion. But why do I continually smear my trifles with those letters, why not rather append the letter in which Philip raised Bucer to that hope of future concord?</p>
      <p>«Philip to Bucer, greetings. What you write, that we must strive for concord between us, indeed recently we discussed this matter with our prince. But I expect the Landgrave to come to us shortly, as I hope. And if he does not come, I will write to him my thoughts, which I will share with you sometime. For indeed I desire nothing more than that the great scandal of dissension between us may someday be removed, which you know how much it hinders the course of the gospel. You see me not fighting against you. But I hope others will also become milder. May Christ look upon the church and restore to us holy and pious concord!»</p>
      <p>This is what I had, most sincere man, to commit to you in writing at present. But what I still hold more secretly and more to be concealed than the Eleusinian mysteries, I will also pour into your bosom, so that you may better consult and provide for your affairs. This was recently whispered in my ear, not without pain, by a citizen of the highest nobility, besides our preacher, on the condition that I communicate it neither in writing nor in words to anyone except those whom I know to contain it faithfully and who can somehow consult on the matters. But it is such that Buffler has obtained, at great expense and with wonderful arts, the titles of the newly struck treaty between Ferdinand and the Duke of Württemberg, in which, besides other things which he did not tell me, this is also included: "The Duke of Württemberg shall also leave all, whether spiritual or secular, unmolested by war and let them remain in their faith and being, and he shall neither protect nor shield the Sacramentarians and Anabaptists in his principality against the royal majesty, who will have an open hand against them." If these things are as he reported - and I do not doubt they are true - it is not surprising that the duchy is now being reformed according to the Saxon confession. However, it is greatly to be lamented by all, since our Zwingli refutes almost the entire confession of Luther in a certain refutation, to which he gave the title: "That these words, this is my body, etc.", and it must be attacked with no less effort than papism. Then, who they call "Sacramentarians" and where those invented words come from, will easily be guessed by him who knows that the Duke of Saxony was not the last among those peace arbitrators.</p>
      <p>Farewell and let me know by letter what you think about the present state of affairs or what you have learned, so that if Blarer has acted well and Zwingli has also conceded that earlier and the state of all other matters is well, I may cease to be anxious, if not, I may not torment myself in vain, since I cannot amend it.</p>
      <p>Greet in my words Pellican, the most upright man and my best godfather, Heinrich Utinger, the singular patron of all scholars, Theodor, the great ornament of our college, and, if I dare impose more on you, also Leon, a man, however great he is, divine and learned. I also greatly wish your family well.</p>
      <p>Isny, August 29. Benedictus Euander.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief evangelist of Zurich, his most revered lord.</p>
