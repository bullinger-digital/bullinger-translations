    <p xml:id="regest1">[The people of Zürich] regret Luther's aggressive [„Short Confession“]: on one hand, the weak are offended by the disunity among the supporters of the Gospel, and on the other hand, the peace efforts of the Landgrave [Philipp] and other princes are nullified. The people of Zürich would have remained silent if Luther had not condemned and reviled them as heretics. Their response, the [„True Confession“], was composed with the knowledge of the mayors [Johann Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab] and the councilors of Zürich; they cannot understand Luther's behavior, especially since the Zürich church adheres to apostolic doctrine. - They are now sending the Landgrave a copy of this response because he is mentioned in it in connection with the Marburg [Colloquy of 1529]. - He should not prohibit this response and Zürich publications in his territories, just as the people of Zürich allow Luther's books and [those of his followers] to be read. Everyone should be able to ascertain that the [Swiss churches] do not correspond to Luther's portrayal. - The Landgrave should send one of the enclosed copies [of this response] to Elector [Johann Friedrich I.] of Saxony and Duke Moritz [of Saxony] and ask them not to condemn [the Swiss] without hearing them. - Furthermore, he should take up the cause of the people of Zürich, who have been unjustly condemned by Luther; God will surely reward him for this.</p>

      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince and most gracious lord, our humble and willing service, along with the offering of all good things, is always ready for your princely grace from us.</p>
      <p>We regret that Dr. Martin Luther has written so fiercely against us without our deserving or being guilty of it, and has published it in print. This is especially regrettable for the sake of the simple, weak Christians who are not a little offended and scandalized by it, as we, who preach one Lord Christ from one Gospel, stand in such a long-lasting conflict with others over His holy sign and sacrament. We also regret not a little that your princely grace and other pious Christian princes, lords, estates, and cities have not been able to bring about friendly dealings and peace with Dr. Luther, as he, after a long silence, has renewed the offensive dispute against us without just cause.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we would have preferred to keep peace and remain silent as we have done so far, enduring much and long, yes, more than perhaps good. But since our patience and silence have not brought about anything with Dr. Luther, other than that he condemns us as heretics in his confession, disparages and dishonors our ancestors, honorable Christians, and our churches in faith and honor, as his writing clearly shows, we could no longer and further proceed for the sake of honor, duty, and office. Therefore, we have not acted for ourselves, but with the foreknowledge and consent of our gracious lords and superior mayors and councilors, who, along with all believers among us, have received and borne a particularly great burden from such disgraceful slander and scolding of Luther, both of the dead and the living, since many believe that even if the churches among us and we, their servants, had some deficiency in the matter of the sacrament, Luther should not have so completely poured them and us out, especially at this time, when those unfavorable to the truth are bringing forth all their strength to condemn and suppress the evangelical truth. But if we are teaching and holding rightly and in conformity with the first apostolic holy church, Dr. Luther should even less tear himself away from us and create a division in the church without necessity.</p>
      <p>Since then your princely grace is also mentioned in our response, where we speak of the colloquy at Marburg, we humbly send your princely grace our response and confession with the most humble, friendly request that your princely grace may receive it in good from us, your very favorable and willing servants, and, if at all possible due to the many and great affairs, also willingly read it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we ask your princely grace to graciously intervene for the sake of God and His holy word, so that our confession and response, along with our other books, are not prohibited in your princely grace's principality, and we are thus condemned unheard and innocent. Our gracious lords and superiors allow all and every one of Luther's books, as well as other writings of our opponents, to be sold and bought in their cities, counties, towns, and lands. We also admonish everyone to read them; for it is only fair that both sides are heard and no one is suppressed unheard. In this, we trust God and His clear, eternal truth, that all believers will clearly and precisely find that neither our churches nor we are such condemned people as Dr. Luther would like to portray us to the entire Christendom. May God forgive him.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we also ask your princely grace to once again consider God, the truth, and our innocence, and to kindly intercede with the Elector of Saxony, as well as with your princely grace's son-in-law, Duke Moritz, our most gracious lords, so that their princely graces do not allow our writings to be prohibited and condemned in their princely graces' principalities without hearing us. We have also enclosed some booklets here, which may be handed over to their princely graces, if it is not contrary to your princely grace.</p>
      <p>Most gracious prince and lord, may your princely grace take our important concern to heart, considering that it is about our pious, believing churches, about honorable, God-fearing and learned deceased, and about our honor and good name, yes, also about the truth, since Dr. Luther writes us off as unrepentant condemned heretics, whose fellowship and writings all believers should avoid, whereas we are from the heart enemies of all heresy and desire to remain with Christian truth in the fellowship of all true believers. We also hope in God, our Lord, that if your princely grace graciously accepts and hears our request and humble writing, the Almighty will also accept and hear your princely grace's request and desire, as He has clearly spoken in the holy Gospel, that whoever offers a cup of cold water to one of His servants will not go unrewarded. If we can then show our gratitude to your princely grace with humble, willing services, we would at all times show ourselves completely humble and willing. May God, our heavenly Father, faithfully and always keep your princely grace, along with all your dependents, under His protection through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.</p>
      <p>Given in Zürich in the Confederation, on the 12th day of March in the year 1545. Your princely grace's humble servants, pastors, preachers, readers of the holy scripture, and common servants of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious, high-born prince and lord, Lord Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, Dietz, Ziegenhain, and Nidda, our most gracious lord.</p>
