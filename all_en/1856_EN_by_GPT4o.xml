      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, most excellent man, which were brought by two young candidates of medicine recommended to me by you. Lord Pierre Mégret and I had placed them with a certain doctor, a pious and learned man, and an agreement had already been made regarding the price, namely forty sols (a type of currency) per person per year. But because the agreement was made in the absence and without the knowledge of his wife (who here generally commands their husbands), the doctor wrote to me three or four hours later that he had calculated the expenses for their maintenance and found that the sum of the price did not match the sum of the expenses, and therefore he decided not to take them into his house unless each paid fifty or at least 47. Upon hearing this, the servitude to the wife immediately became apparent, and I lamented the misery and inconsistency of the otherwise good man. However, after consulting together and voting, we decided it was best to rent a room for a month where they could buy their own food daily, until a suitable host for their studies could be found at leisure, and so it was done. Furthermore, with exhortations, admonitions, advice, and finally, if the situation requires (which I do not expect), with rebukes, I will not fail them, as a concerned father should; for your urgent arguments, which clearly show how much effort I will put into this matter, have added quite a spur to one already running. For who in their right mind would not consider themselves fortunate to have in their power the means to bind such great heroes to themselves and make them from strangers into the most friendly and favorable allies? Therefore, most esteemed man, there is no reason for you to abandon the good hope you have conceived of me; for I will give my utmost effort, if it is possible, to exceed what you have hoped of me, nor do I doubt in return, indeed I am fully convinced that if the occasion ever arises, I will return the greatest gratitude to you. Please convey my warmest regards to Mr. Lavater, your son-in-law, and the other professors of your college and ministers of the church. Farewell, most distinguished man.</p>
      <p>Paris, the day before the Kalends of May 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Martin Betschart of Switzerland.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
