      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you. In Basel, at the house of Miconius, on the 7th of June, returning from the Leukerbad in Valais, I received your letter, which was written on the 11th of May, from which I understood your constant zeal, care, and diligence towards us and our church. Your Christian consolation was especially pleasing to me, as well as the word of exhortation for perpetual constancy in the very afflicted matters of the church. Pray to our Lord Jesus Christ, as you undoubtedly do, that we may not falter in times of tribulation. For we need the spirit of fortitude, which the Father will not deny to those who pray, etc.</p>
      <p>It is difficult to briefly recount the dangers the church of Christ faced on the 3rd and 4th of May. All of us who were ministers of this church were dismissed by the envoys of the senior duke because we did not want to be Imperialists, but Christians, rejecting, and if it had been allowed, vehemently opposing the most impious doctrine of the Interim. And after we had long contended for the solid truth of Christ, finally, to drive out one nail with another, we did not appeal to the Emperor, but to our prince; for we were called and appointed by him, not by the duke, whom I thought was in Basel. They agreed.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the next day, Nicolaus Regius and I, on behalf of the brothers, took on the mission (delegation) and came to Basel; but our prince had left three days earlier with his whole family to the baths, as I mentioned.</p>
      <p>We followed through the Solothurn and Bern regions, then through the snowy Alps to the hot springs and those goitrous people, who had erected their chimera, and having found the prince, we explained the cause and danger of the church with the utmost diligence. He very solemnly affirmed that he did not know of it and had never agreed with his brother, etc. It was deliberated and consulted for five days; finally, the spirit of God moved him to send letters to the nobles and leaders of our region, ordering them to restore everything and allow us to perform our duties as usual. What he wrote to his brother about this matter, I do not know. We are certain that there are various practices of the adversaries, so that we may again be punished and banished as rebels. We are now in that state. What will happen, time will tell. We continue, however, to exhort the good and pious to constancy and repentance, lest the work of the Lord be abandoned, etc. Our neighbors in Ensisheim are enlisting soldiers, whom they certainly think will occupy our territory.</p>
      <p>There are many among them who wish me well and who, having some influence among them, daily advise either to flee or to transfer my treasure, still unburied, to safer places; but I am not a wolf before the cry, etc. I am in the hand of the Lord; He will warn me in time if it is for my good and that of His church, etc.</p>
      <p>There would be much more to write; but there is no time now. I will give you the whole tragedy another time. These two men, Vitus Sacellius and Erasmus, who are exiled for Christ, will tell you word for word about our affairs, the Duchy, the people of Strasbourg, and what the people of Magdeburg, the Saxons, and the other maritime cities are doing. It would be superfluous to commend them to you; for Vitus will be commended by his piety, learning, longevity, constancy, and the very cross he bears. Oh my Bullinger, how deplorably and poorly life is lived in most churches that have heard Christ for many years. It is greatly to be feared, unless God preserves them with His usual mercy, that they may be involved in their former errors due to impenitence.</p>
      <p>I have received and have two Decades of your sermons and give you immortal thanks, and if I ever survive and am able, I will repay with a greater benefit; if not, there is one in heaven who will repay. I will await the rest, so that I may compile them into one book.</p>
      <p>Descending through Aargau, we wished to visit you, Nicolaus and I; but we had to hurry home, lest the Interims build nests in our churches. We returned very tired and exhausted on the 7th of June, etc. Greet especially your family, whom I will see someday, if God grants it, our brother Gualther, the encomiast of the Antichrist, and the old man Pellican from the old man Erb, Gerold, all the good ones, etc.</p>
      <p>Hastily in Riquewihr on the 6th of the Ides of July 1549. Yours sincerely, Erb.</p>
      <p>Pray diligently to the Lord for us, that the faith of Christ may not fail among us, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, theologian and churchman of ZÃ¼rich, brother in Christ, always to be honored.</p>
