    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] When Myconius complained to Konrad [Wolfhart] about Bullinger's silence, he learned that Bullinger and Konrad Pellikan had traveled to a bath. May this spa treatment have done Bullinger good, so that he can serve the church for a long time!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Meanwhile, Myconius missed Bullinger's letters very much, as he had no one left to enlighten him when terrible news arrived from all sides.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Johannes Haller also informed Myconius about the dire situation in Augsburg. He also received a letter from his brother Wolfgang, through which he learned that Johannes was preaching the Gospel in Augsburg under great danger. The imperial colonel Bernhard von Schaumburg finds his sermons rebellious and wants to eliminate him. Why don't the people of Zurich call him back before something happens to him? The authorities, who are striving to reintroduce the papacy in Augsburg, will hardly protect him! Poor Augsburg, poor Swabia, and poor Confederates if Emperor Charles V continues like this! Hopefully, he will die before he can attack the latter!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Myconius often gets upset about the emperor's successes. He already knows that the Lord will protect his church, but he does not understand God's plans! Either he wants to withdraw his word from those who have proven ungrateful; or he has already chosen his own through the proclamation of the word; or he does not want this conflict to be decided by weapons, so that the honor due to him is not given to humans; or the pastors have not proclaimed his word correctly? Whatever the case, his will be done! In these times, no one can fathom his plans. There is nothing left but to expect everything from him, to implore him, and to be obedient. Whoever does this will not harm his soul, even if he must die.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger should know that Francisco de Enzinas is a most blameless person, who, however, speaks his mind freely. If he wrote something about [Valérand Poullain] [with No. 2898], it was because he had good reason to do so, and Bullinger would come to the same conclusion if [Poullain] lived near him! This [Poullain] has many good sides. That is why Myconius also became fond of him. Yet he is somehow sly and reckless, so that Myconius finds him less and less likable over time. He has brought great shame upon himself, and it could have been worse if some [marriage judges] had not acted against him in a Christian rather than a legal manner. If he does not get a grip on himself, he will cause himself even more harm, even wishing he had never been in Basel! Enzinas wanted to warn Bullinger about [Poullain] with his candid letter. He also deceived John Hooper, which Myconius regrets all the more, as he greatly appreciates this learned and pious man. In Basel, he left a lasting impression together with his inspiring wife [Anne t’Serclaes]. May the Lord bless their marriage! Bullinger should greet both from Myconius and his wife [Margret] and excuse the sharpness of Enzinas' writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Verified news: Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony has been captured, as has Ernst III of Brunswick-Grubenhagen. The Elector was injured on the left cheek by the lance of a hussar [Josef Luka]. His three sons [Johann Friedrich II the Middle, Johann Wilhelm I, and Johann Friedrich III the Younger] are unharmed and are assembling an army of at least 26,000, if not 30,000 men in Gotha.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] It is also certain that the emperor, who is trying with all his might to capture Wittenberg, has already been repelled three times, suffering heavy losses. The enemy has cut off the city's water supply. Although the besieged are in great fear, they would rather die for Christ than surrender disgracefully or be defeated by the emperor. It is also verified that King Christian of Denmark and the Hanseatic cities are rushing to Wittenberg with united forces. Troops from Magdeburg are also coming to their aid.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bremen is no longer under siege. It is certain that Landgrave Philipp of Hesse is gathering an army (which Bullinger also reported [in No. 2903]). He is said to be already on his way against some bishops. Therefore, the Bishop of Würzburg, Melchior Zobel, summoned his nobility and the entire region. On the way home from Speyer [to Reichenweier], Matthias Erb encountered over four hundred soldiers, all heading towards the Landgrave. It has often been claimed, and just yesterday again, that the Elector is free again. How do such contradictory reports come about?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings, also to the family and colleagues.</p>

      <p>Greetings. May the bath benefit you for the health of your body, so that you may serve the church of the Lord for a long time! I was unaware that you had gone to bathe until I complained to Master Konrad [Wolfhart] about your silence, and he informed me that you had gone with Konrad Pellikan to bathe.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, so many astonishing things have been reported back and forth that I have greatly missed you, as your letters have always confirmed me more than those of others.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Johannes Haller writes to me with great lamentation about his situation, and most recently his brother Wolfgang informed me that he is living and teaching Christ in Augsburg under great danger. For the highest captain there said: "This young man preaches seditiously, therefore he must be removed!" Why then do you not recall him in time, before he suffers harm? He must be recalled entirely, unless the magistrates wish to protect him; which is, however, as far from happening as it is near that everything papistic will be restored. O miserable Augsburg! O miserable Swabia! But also, O miserable us, if the emperor continues as he has begun! Although I hope he will perish before he can go against us or be able to go.</p>

      <p>Several times here I am gravely offended. Although it cannot be doubted that the Lord will protect the church, yet when I see the course of imperial success (although in truth it is misfortune), I am accustomed to hesitate about what God has in mind. For either he is about to take away his word from us as unworthy due to our ingratitude, or he has already gathered those who are his through the same, or he does not want anything to be settled here by arms, lest his glory be attributed to men, or the word given mercifully to those in charge is not rightly dispensed. But come now, whatever it is, let him do what is good in his sight! For the times are such that man cannot judge them. Therefore, while we do not know the counsels of the Lord, it is necessary that we depend entirely on him and pray faithfully and continually that he does not abandon us, and walk in his ways and above all fear him. Thus, if we do this, no one will harm our souls even if our bodies perish.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>About Francisco de Enzinas, I would like you to know that he is a very upright man, but meanwhile also very free in speaking and writing. He wrote certain things about a certain person truly, which I would say you would experience, if he lived closer to us than to you. He has many good qualities, for which I love him. He also has some kind of cunning (which seems imprudent to me), because of which he becomes less valuable to me day by day. He has thrown himself into great disgrace with that imprudent cunning and would have thrown himself into greater, unless some had wanted to act against him more Christianly than legally, although, unless he goes against it rightly, it may happen that he will still immerse himself in many evils so that he could wish he had never seen Basel. If Enzinas wrote more freely to you against this person, know that it was done for this reason, lest he could deceive you with a flattering appearance or through another. For the same happened to John Hooper; about which I have often complained much to myself. For I love and venerate him for his doctrine and piety, such as I have never experienced in my life towards me! Recently, while he was here, he showed himself in such a way with his wife not so much consenting as impelling, that I cannot forget them as long as I live. May the Lord bless their marriage and protect and defend them. This I sincerely wish for both the husband and the very pious wife, whose memory will be eternal with me in the Lord. I would like you to convey many good wishes to them from me and my wife and have Enzinas excused for his sharpness.</p>

      <p>News too certain! The Elector has been captured and with him Ernst of Brunswick! He was wounded by a hussar's lance driven through his left cheek. All three of his sons are safe, now gathering an army in Gotha, where nearly 30,000, at least 26,000 men have already assembled.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The emperor is attacking Wittenberg with all his might. He has already been repelled three times with great loss to his own. This is certain. The water flowing through the town has been intercepted by the enemy. The besieged are in extreme distress, yet they would rather die honorably and for the glory of Christ than surrender disgracefully or live sorrowfully for the name of the emperor. It is also certain about the King of Denmark and the maritime cities, that with great reinforcements joined, they are hastening to Wittenberg. Troops from Magdeburg are similarly joining them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Bremen is freed from all siege. The Landgrave is certainly gathering an army, which you also wrote. They say he is already on the way against some bishops and has called his nobility and stirred up the whole region. On the way back from Speyer, more than four hundred soldiers met Erb, all heading towards the Landgrave. I have received so many reports about the Elector being freed and so certainly even yesterday, that I wonder where such diversity of reports arises from.</p>

      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your household and with all the brothers. In Basel, on the day of Urban in the year 1547. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of Christ, brother and lord in the Lord, revered by him. In Zurich.</p>
