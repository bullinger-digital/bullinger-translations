      <p>I have received your letters of your kindness regarding the Archbishop of Canterbury and also about greeting the Travers family; I have forwarded them to Mr. Travers the elder, knowing that I am doing him a favor, as he is now burdened with old age.</p>
      <p>For although he manages sufficiently at home and in his village what is necessary, he does not progress elsewhere or very rarely. Our Comander is now quite well, even if not with the strength he had a few months ago; nevertheless, he ascends the pulpit in his usual manner. - In our Confederations, the churches persist in the profession of faith; the number of those giving their names to Christ increases daily, thanks be to God. You have long known how great the sedition was during the Easter holidays in the Valtellina, through the Italians themselves who wrote there. The monk, at whose instigation those disturbances were stirred, offered himself to dispute and to prove by the holy scriptures that all who do not want the mass are most diabolical heretics and that the women of those who have ever celebrated the mass cannot be legitimate wives, but worse and more disgraceful than any harlots; also some other things of this kind, especially that the Three Confederations listen to heretical preachers. Our Confederations, gathered here these days, sent to the administrators we have in the Valtellina, to bring the monk here, to Chur I mean, to give an account of his words. The time was announced for the Chur fair, and it was announced for the same time ain bytag. I believe the monk will come accompanied by other men of his kind, I mean some very cunning hooded ones; for our bishop told me that he was sent by some cardinal.</p>
      <p>Some do not want to believe that he will come here, but that he will consult for himself by fleeing. Wealthy men have promised that he will dispute for him; if he comes, there will be something for us to do. - The brothers in the Valtellina had arranged a legation to your most illustrious senate to obtain that they would ask our Confederations for themselves; I dissuaded them and ordered the messenger to resist and be quiet: that the Zurichers are already burdened with envy and that as soon as they write to them, they will be asked to write to the contrary and the Five Parts; that our lords would not be pleased if they sensed that help was being sought elsewhere, as the necessity is not yet so great. Thus, I resisted so that I might refer the matter to you. Write to me freely about this matter in your usual manner. Know this: this business is being conducted with great care and yet more secretly. - Many soldiers pass through here with enough money. In Lake Como, three ships loaded with soldiers were sunk, and they were all drowned. From Italy, we hear nothing about our legates, except what we heard a few weeks ago, already worn out. Our people are very indignant about our member from the Grey Confederation, who went to Rome. We hear that the Turk is heading for Hungary. Besides this, we hear no news. - While I was writing these last words, a man came to me bringing your letters, always most welcome to me as ever.</p>
      <p>What you write is true; it came late. To all these things, most esteemed man, be careful not to always write neither to me nor to others; but keep yourself whole and healthy, so that you can write to us and to the whole world, as you have often done. I do not wish to write now about your Summa and Apologetic response, as I have been quite lengthy.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Jesus and do not cease to love your Philippus. From Chur, on the 11th day of May in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Gallicius.</p>
