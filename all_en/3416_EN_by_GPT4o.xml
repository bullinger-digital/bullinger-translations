      <p>S. Your letters were most welcome to me, my most distinguished Bullinger.</p>
      <p>From them, no less than from all others, I clearly understand your desire not only to increase our friendship but also to extend it for all time; to achieve this, I will exert every effort as much as I can. The only thing that weighs on me is that I am not given the means to somehow repay your kindnesses. For you have honored me so often with your most welcome writings, and I have nothing to write except my desire and effort to deserve well of you, yet I will strive to appear grateful to you someday.</p>
      <p>What you write about Swiss (Helvetian) concord is sweeter to me than Hylaean honey; for I know how much the enemies of Germany, and indeed the pseudo-Germans themselves, promise themselves profit from your discord. I say the same about the friendship of the Genevans, which may the Lord confirm.</p>
      <p>That boastful Bolviler (likely a reference to a person causing trouble) is worthy of this description: there are many such troublemakers. I have long known the mind of our Philip; it can hardly be said how unjustly he is treated by those to whom he has rendered many benefits; he has certainly nourished many whelps until now. The Duke of Bavaria was holding a diet (assembly) at Landshut, which was to be undertaken very unfortunately.</p>
      <p>Our Faber wanted to play the role of Parasceve (a preparatory day, often referring to Friday). The nobles are eagerly seeking the gospel with the most ardent prayers.</p>
      <p>The electors will meet in Ulm; King Ferdinand will also come to them immediately after the Christmas holidays. There are many things to write to you; but it was not possible, I will write soon about what is to be hoped from these assemblies. Farewell, my Bullinger, and love your Gereon.</p>
      <p>My son is performing his duties well; he will feel my kindness towards him more every day. In Augsburg, most swiftly, November 26, in the year etc. 57.</p>
      <p>Your Gereon.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
