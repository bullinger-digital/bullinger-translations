      <p>Greetings. I send back to you, beloved brother, the document that was shared with me, and I thank you very much for it. I had seen it before; for the treasurer showed me such an example.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that everything turns out well and that He keeps us in peace. They certainly affirm that peace has been made in France and that the entire army has left La Rochelle safely. Peace was made and concluded on July 6th; on July 9th, Duke Anjou departed with the cavalry; on July 12th, the Swiss departed for Aquitaine. From the Netherlands, I can tell you nothing certain; some say Haarlem has been captured, others deny it.</p>
      <p>On Monday, we received certain news and many letters from Poland and Krakow, the metropolis of the nation, about the election of Duke Anjou as king and about the conditions and oath prescribed to him. We have been sent extensive writings about this whole matter. He has indeed been accepted, but so that he brings nothing new to the kingdom, does not touch the privileges, swears to defend them sacredly, and will not pursue anyone with hatred because of religion, etc. I pray that you consider these brief notes kindly. Oppressed by business, I have barely managed to send this to you.</p>
      <p>Greet all our people and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 14, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your H[einrich] B[ullinger]. To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear lord and good friend. Chur.</p>
