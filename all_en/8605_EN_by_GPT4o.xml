      <p>Greetings. Although I greatly wished to visit you, I was prevented by the harshness of the fever and partly by the weather; however, the fever, by the grace of God, was driven away by fasting. I received letters from Geneva and part of my book, which I am not sending because you will return to us within a day or two. I am sending you and yours a small gift, which I ask you to kindly accept; for you know this: in gifts, the intention is the best part. I am completely unaware of what is truly happening; for in these 15 days, I have never left the house. I hope to be in better health henceforth, since I have been freed from the fever. The rest we will discuss in person. Greet everyone; I pray for good health for you all.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, July 6.</p>
      <p>The boy announced his departure only when he was already prepared for the journey. My family sends their regards to you.</p>
      <p>My son sends you a letter that could make even the dead laugh; it would be the best medicine for the melancholic.</p>
      <p>Your Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed father.</p>
