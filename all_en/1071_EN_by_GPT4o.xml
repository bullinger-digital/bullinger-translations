      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I received the letter given on the 24th day of October on the 4th day of November, and if it had reached me an hour later, it would have been a great inconvenience for us. The mayor and I have collected the money on behalf of Tito and are sending you 8 guilders, as the currency and gold are current with us.</p>
      <p>Pay the women and the baker and thank them on our behalf for their friendly assistance. If there is anything left over, send it back home to Tito in Zeringen. My lord mayor and I thank you for your diligent work; if we can earn such from you, we will be diligently ready. Regarding my daughter, do as you have written to me, and greet Franz and his household for me. I have sent Sara to school mostly so that she can learn to write. May God be with you and your household. Dated in Chur, 4th of November 1550. Your willing Lucius Heim, mayor of Chur, Johann Comander, pastor.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his lord and special friend.</p>
