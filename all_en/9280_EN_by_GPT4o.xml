      <p>Greetings. I received your letter yesterday after lunch, most esteemed lord and godfather, which was all the more welcome to us the longer we had been expecting it; for we were wondering why nothing was being written either by you or by your magistrate to ours about the affairs of the Rhaetians; for the beginnings of those seemed quite serious and tumultuous. Meanwhile, that sudden and rather long silence gave rise to various thoughts for us. We are therefore glad that we now understand from your letter that they have laid down their arms and are now acting more peacefully. However, we are surprised that in the meantime they are also sending a banner to the king, whose confederation they seemed more likely to abandon. As for these and other news that you sent at the same time, I sent them all to Mr. Steiger, who does not want to return them until he has presented them to the senate today. Therefore, I am not sending any of these to you now. However, he greets you and is glad that his wine is finally proceeding towards Glarus.</p>
      <p>I am finally sending you the promised Problems of our Aretio. I would have gladly sent them sooner; but I was first lacking copies, and later there were no messengers.</p>
      <p>I have added another copy for Mr. Gwalther, which you will present to him. I corrected your copy according to the author's corrections as much as I could; for our printer in Lausanne was not very diligent in correcting and was perhaps hindered in many places by the author's poor handwriting. I think, therefore, that I have rendered you a not ungrateful service by correcting this. The other copy, which I am sending to Mr. Gwalther, is uncorrected; however, it can easily be corrected to match yours in an hour or two. Please consider it kindly; I cannot send you anything of my own, so I am sending something of another's. I would have also sent a copy to Mr. Simler, if I did not think that the author himself would send him one due to the familiarity between them. I also wish to hear your judgments on these matters. I am also sending you a bundle of letters that I received a few days ago from Mr. Beza, in which I believe you will find Portus's response to Carpentarius's letter. We have no other news from France except what I understand from yours is also known among you, namely that the siege of Lanserre has been lifted, the people of La Rochelle are conducting themselves bravely, Aumale has been killed, and the king's illegitimate son Tavannes has died. It was also reported that Condé the younger had his leg pierced by a bullet; but I give no credence to this. They say the people of La Rochelle lack nothing more than wood, because in the nearby places and islands the forests have been greatly cut down by previous wars. From the Netherlands, the death of Alba is again confirmed; they say, however, that his death was concealed for two whole months, so that all services were rendered as if he were alive. It is indeed strange that he descended to the realm of Ceres by such a dry death, not usually sparing the skin unless that leech full of blood. Nothing else comes to mind now, except that I wrote some things about the private affairs of our republic to my brother, from whom you will learn them.</p>
      <p>All those to whom you recently sent booklets greet you and thank you. I am not writing to Mr. Gwalther; you will greet him for me and also all of yours. Bern, April 9, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
