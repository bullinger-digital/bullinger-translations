      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc. Our greetings beforehand, well-learned, dear friend. We have now received various reports that those from Constance have surrendered into the king's hands under severe conditions (though doubtful). Since we believe that you have good knowledge of this, we graciously request you to write to us about it in detail, without doubt, if they had followed their favorable timing, their situation would have been better.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we hear that the envoys of the four cities are to come together; in this, you should earnestly and zealously exhort the people in prayer so that a Christian reconciliation may proceed; for, if it goes well for you, your brethren, and all beloved by God, we would gladly hear it. We have graciously wished to request you with our writing this time.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, the 3rd of November in the year 1548. G[eorg], C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich, to be delivered.</p>
