      <p>Most illustrious and learned Lord Bullinger, dear friend and brother in Christ. We do not doubt the importance of your role in the universal church of God, and your affection and inclination towards our Polish and Lithuanian churches, which were planted by the holy man of God, John a Lasco, through the word of God. We are certain that you have received great sorrow from the untimely accusation or condemnation by the most illustrious man, Doctor Calvin, which he expressed in the preliminary letter of the Acts of the Apostles dedicated to us, concerning the distinguished man, Doctor Georg Blandrata, archpriest of the churches of Lesser Poland, and our dear private friend and godfather. If we were to pursue each matter in writing, the disturbances, reproaches, and scandals that our church has suffered from the professed enemies of God and the gospel of Jesus Christ would exhaust our time and speech. However, since we are already occupied with the governance of public affairs concerning the republic, due to the offices we hold in this republic under our most serene king, and now with military matters against the barbaric cruelty of the Muscovites to be repelled by our neighboring and allied Livonians, we will address this matter more briefly and succinctly to your excellence. For the merits of the entire present case, partly from the speech of this servant of ours and the learned and pious minister of the word of God, Martin Czechowicz, whom we are sending expressly to your excellence and to Doctor Calvin himself, and partly from letters written here and there by churches and learned men, as well as from the very process of purification and confessions of Doctor Georg Blandrata, your excellence will abundantly understand, and what roles and burdens have been imposed on us in pacifying this matter for the Polish and Lithuanian church, a burden indeed not at all equal to our strength, unless either the singular kindness of God or the pious cooperation of excellent and learned men, members of Jesus Christ, assists us. Since among the other members of great and distinguished men in the church of God, your excellence is adorned with singular gifts, we have thought it best to refer this entire matter to you, with whom both we and Doctor Calvin himself have solid friendships and mutual benevolence, and we have deemed it right to choose and appoint you in the Lord as the organ of mediation between both the persons themselves and the cause and reconciliation of the churches. Two things seem to us to be especially considered in this whole controversy.</p>
      <p>First, that the virulent opinions and disease of the man, which Doctor Georg Blandrata is thought to harbor internally, and Doctor Calvin, be uncovered, so that the church of God may cautiously guard against them. Secondly, that a true method of peace and concord be established both among the principal persons themselves and between our churches and yours. For we leave it to your excellence to consider, among other things in this matter, that nothing would be more pleasing and desirable to these churches than for peace to flourish and silence to be imposed, as your excellence will easily judge from their letters, of which my servant here has copies. Therefore, all your efforts, plans, and endeavors must be directed towards healing the inflicted wound and, with pacified minds, if any scruple or controversy remains in doctrine, resolving it with the collected opinions and intercessions of learned men, with the utmost tranquility of the church and mutual reconciliation. For the church of God has enough offenses from elsewhere, enough of its own afflictions and hardships, especially in our northern regions, where the diseased and ulcerous Lazarus lies afflicted before the doors of the rich pontiffs, the sworn vassals of the pope. These indeed, seizing even the slightest opportunity, do not cease to presume dire and atrocious things against us. From this contention of two most ardent minds, especially since they are considered principal members of our churches, it cannot be said how much they have sullied, diminished, and defamed the gospel before my most serene king: and this would be with greater scandal unless these controversies were entirely buried between them. We are as certain about Doctor Blandrata as we are about anything, that he is not of such a mind as to wish to disturb the church of God with recriminations. Provided that Doctor Calvin has the same zeal: otherwise, we fear that he may hear things that do not please him very much. We earnestly hope that the Lord, in his mercy, will avert this sad and mournful omen with all the affection of our heart and mind. Finally, regarding the matter of this controversy, we do not wish to conceal from your excellence that Doctor Blandrata has complained to us about your excellence, that you were unwilling to hear him in this cause and to seek pious, useful, and salutary conditions of peace with Doctor Calvin, so much so that he was compelled to refer this matter to the church of the Italians in Zurich, and to complain about your excellence there, and to leave this same thing attested in his public letters. The rest of the matters to be understood in this whole affair, your excellence will understand exactly and abundantly from this servant of ours, whom we commend to you as of the best, as it is said, quality, and we sincerely wish that your excellence may enjoy firm and lasting health and all happiness. We send to your excellence through this same servant of ours a small northern gift of a fur from the backs of panthers, as well as a linen cloth or towel for wiping the hands of the labor and work of our dearest wife, a gift indeed of little value, but if you consider not so much the gift itself as the mind of the giver, you will judge it not to be alien from the love and benevolence with which we embrace your excellence. Given in Vilnius, July 14, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>Your excellence's good friend and brother in Christ, Nikolaus Radziwill, by the grace of God Duke in Olyka and Nieswiez, Lord in Kleczko, Palatine of Vilnius, Grand Marshal of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and Archchancellor of Brest, Rawa, Borisov, and in great Schawle, general captain, etc., by his own hand.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of Zurich in Switzerland, incomparable defender and advocate of the purer religion, dear and esteemed friend and brother in Christ, most dear and respected by us.</p>
