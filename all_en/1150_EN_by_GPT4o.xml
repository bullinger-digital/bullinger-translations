      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I am sending you the letters sent by Lord Vergerio, esteemed man. Recently, I also sent several with booklets; I wish to know if everything has been delivered. You also mention in your letters whether I have delivered your letters to Vergerio; I believe I have diligently carried out everything and have neglected nothing at all. I wish to be informed about what you have done with Franz regarding my daughter, so that I may deliberate on what I will do next.</p>
      <p>In place of the late Lord Blasius, our senate has decided to call upon Lord Philipp Gallicius; for necessity demands that we have someone skilled in languages because of the people of Clavenna and the inhabitants of the Valtellina. Many things are being reported here about the Emperor and the maritime cities, but they are uncertain.</p>
      <p>If you have any certain information, please be so kind as to write to me. From Italy, I have nothing at all worthy of writing. Farewell. January 10, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
