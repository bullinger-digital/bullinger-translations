    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's written statement [not received], that the Diet in Baden would begin on June 28, is incorrect. Rather, it is scheduled for July 5. As envoys to the Diet, [Johannes] Haab and [Itelhans] Thumysen have just been appointed in Zürich. Both are well-disposed towards Konstanz. Bullinger is confident. Blarer should pray that the [Schmalkaldic League] be brave. After all, the Spaniards are only human. Since Bullinger also wrote to Augsburg that the Diet would take place on June 28, Blarer should inform [Georg] Frölich of the correct date.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- When [Johann von Weeze], Bishop [of Konstanz], was staying in Unterwalden, a drunken vagabond accused him [...] of fraud. When the Bishop heard of this, he filed a complaint. During his imprisonment in Schwyz, the vagabond said that he did not accuse the Bishop of fraud regarding his faith, but because of his whoring, whereupon he was released.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Dear sir and brother, I made an error regarding the Diet in Baden, as I wrote that it would begin on the upcoming Monday, June 28.</p>
      <p>That is not the case. It will begin on the Monday after the Feast of the Visitation of Mary, which is July 5, the Monday after Ulrich's Day. Today, envoys have been appointed: Mayor Haab and Mr. Thumysen. They both wish you well. I hear so much that I trust the matter well. No more, as they are brave men, praying to God. All virtue and victory come from the heavens. The Spanish weaklings have as soft books as we do, etc. However, since I also wrote to Augsburg that the Diet would begin in Baden on June 28, my request is that you correct this through your writing to Laetus.</p>

      <p>When the Bishop of Lundis was in Unterwalden, a drunken vagabond spoke: the bishop goes around with fraud. With this, he traveled to Schwyz. The bishop received the report and filed a complaint. In Schwyz, he was taken into custody. The poor fellow said: "I do not say that his faith is fraud, but that he goes around with fraud because of his whoring." Thereupon, he was released, and the bishop's whoring was left as fraud, etc.</p>
      <p>God be with you! June 26, 1546.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, most vigilant bishop of the church of Constance, his esteemed lord. Constance.</p>
