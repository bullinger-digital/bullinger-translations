      <p>S. I received your letters from Urdorf, dearest lord and godfather, and I give you great thanks, that even while you are there, you do not cease to break your necessary leisure for the sake of our friendship. May the Lord grant that you return from there much refreshed in body and spirit to your holy studies! Here, I have bathed at home in the heat for a day or two and driven away the winter itch of the skin.</p>
      <p>I have little news of recent events, and perhaps they are already known to you; nevertheless, I will share them with you, in case you do not have them: Schertli has written to my lords, likewise to Musculus, they have taken Haguenau, retreating humbly.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg does not want to let their people into the city, and they act rightly, but they allow the king's provisions and other things to enter. However, Bollweiler has hired three murderers against him, one of whom was captured and beheaded and quartered in the camp before Haguenau; the other two have also been reported. Mecardus has moved from there to Augsburg.</p>
      <p>These days, some soldiers have returned, who went there with Schertli, whom I have heard myself; they speak of great scarcity in the camp, so much so that 300 soldiers left together. The French are ruining everything in the land; not a day goes by without someone being hanged; yet it helps nothing. How the messengers were heard and the Alsace was found, you have surely learned.</p>
      <p>Mayor Herbrot has sent a servant here. He says that Maurice returned to Augsburg on May 5; the war is starting again; his nobility is unwilling that he does not move to Innsbruck. The people have plundered everything around Augsburg. The princes still call the emperor their most gracious lord and imperial majesty; the emperor laughs in his fist at this, etc.</p>
      <p>Musculus and Blaurer have been written to in Augsburg. What Blaurer has answered, I do not know. Musculus is written to poorly, namely, they are inclined to arrange their churches in all things according to the Saxon way, asking him to come or, if he does not want to, to send them other good men. That is?] probably means staying here. My lords have advised against it; the woman has vexed him badly; they would like to go out. But as it seems, I think he will be happy and they too, that they stay with us. This week he had a young son; as fast as the little heap diminishes, it always increases again.</p>
      <p>Two Jacob brothers, who passed through here, coming from Compostela, claim that the common talk in Spain is that the emperor is dead, and the white Moors are invading the land with great force, so that all of Spain is exceedingly restless.</p>
      <p>This is what I have for now; I await what you will give us when you return to Zurich. Farewell. May Zwingli be safe, and all who are with you.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 19, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and venerable godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich or Urdorf.</p>
