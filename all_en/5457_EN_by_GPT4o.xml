      <p>Greetings. I am compelled by the request of those who do not heed my advice to trouble you, venerable brother. A certain good man from Milan has been thrown into prison because he spoke too freely against the impiety of the papacy. He is indeed a Burgundian, but he has long lived in this city and conducts business in Italy.</p>
      <p>Our senate was indeed prepared to intercede on his behalf; but because their letters would have been held in derision, they refrained. I gave advice, which his friends rejected; for they thought that if the four Swiss cities, which profess the pure doctrine of the gospel, interceded for him, the Milanese would hardly dare to do anything. Yet I fear that the authority of your people in this matter will also be slight and of almost no consequence. However, since the cause itself deserves uncommon commendation, I ask you again and again to assist the messenger in obtaining letters with whatever faith and diligence you can. Farewell, most illustrious and honorable brother.</p>
      <p>May the Lord guide you with His spirit, sustain you with strength, and keep you safe! Geneva, 9th of September, 1562. Yours, Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, brother and esteemed colleague.</p>
