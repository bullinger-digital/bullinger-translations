    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for their friendly letters and shares their wish that after his return [from Gorze or Strasbourg] the word of God may continue to bear fruit in Metz, but in particular, Emperor [Charles V] opposes this, not only in Metz but also in the domain of the Cologne [Arch-]Bishop [Hermann von Wied] - however, he resolutely holds on to his plan, together with the preachers left there by Bucer -; the Bishop of Münster [Franz von Waldeck] is also said to have been put under pressure; the persecution of believers, wars, and the raging of the Pope and Turks move us to prayer. Farel wants to show his love to Bullinger and Bibliander, wishes them growing success in spreading the [evangelical] doctrine, and praises their contribution to the training of clergy; may God complete his work with them! Greetings, also to Megander, Pellikan, and Gwalther as well as from [Mathurin] Cordier. Thomas [de la Planche, known as Barbarin] reported pleasing news yesterday about the condition and development of the Zurich congregations; may God let them become a model for others! The brothers [in Neuenburg] return their greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God. How dear I am to both of you is abundantly shown by the letters you recently sent to me, most illustrious men.</p>
      <p>Indeed, this affection is not ordinary, which compels you, amidst so many occupations and more serious matters in which you are wholly engaged, to write to me. I should be suffused with shame that I dare to interrupt your course, so useful to all, with my trifles. But what should I do when I receive such friendly letters? Can I contain the fire with which my heart has long burned for you, when new fuel is always being added? You love me in the Lord, and you rejoice that I have returned safely, and you piously ask that, which I desire more than life, the word may be preserved, grow, and bear much fruit among the Mediomatrices: which all ought rightly to demand with great prayers, since innumerable people are bent on utterly overthrowing the word, and if the reports are true, Caesar especially, and not only there, but also in the domain of the Archbishop of Cologne. Although the pious old man is most savagely harassed by many, he has nevertheless decided to lose both his principality and his life rather than desist from such a pious undertaking, which he laments having begun so late, and whatever is said or done, he always proceeds with those preachers left by Bucer in six towns and several other places. Letters are also said to have been sent to the Bishop of Münster to desist from the word. The slaughter of the pious is happening, and more dreadful edicts are issued everywhere by those who both worship the beast and hand over the power they have to it. All these things, along with what we see in the greatest wars and the savagery with which the Pope and the Turkish enemy are carried, should especially move us to more ardent prayers.</p>
      <p>But where am I carried away? I would wish that I might someday be given the opportunity to testify to my love for you.</p>
      <p>May that Savior, who through you, acting at home, makes it so that those who are far away hear you piously and holily discussing matters of salvation, also make it so that you always accomplish it more purely and with greater fruit, so that I myself, with others, may be a partaker of the fruit and, rejoicing with you, may be able to congratulate more and more on the glory of Christ and the kingdom being more widely propagated. What gratitude will the parents of those young men who are there with you express to you: indeed, the pastors who here have declared themselves more as fathers, almost forcibly extorting that they be trained there, so that they may finally serve the gospel? For we foresee a marvelous barbarism unless it is countered.</p>
      <p>Parents are negligent, and there are wicked ones who, ceasing voluntarily from such a pious work, call them away, but although they try to harm the churches in this way and others.</p>
      <p>For hardly anyone would believe what those who are accustomed always to devise some evil in their cells attempt.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the churches here are beginning to be better formed, and there seems to be a greater inclination to prayer. We greatly rejoice that everything there is progressing to perfection in a favorable course. May He who began His work in you complete it and keep you long for the edification of all. Farewell, and continue to embrace so amicably the one you began to protect long ago, which you indeed do. Your fellow ministers send greetings to you and to all, which we also heartily wish to Megander, Pellikan, Gwalther, and all the rest.</p>
      <p>Cordier sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, our fellow minister Thomas, who returned from you, filled us all with great joy, reporting what he saw and heard there about the holy order and progress in your holy assemblies. We all desire both perseverance and increase in all good, and may your light so shine before all, that not only may they celebrate the name of the Lord but also imitate and be provoked to better things. The brothers greet you again and again and do so most dutifully. Farewell most excellently. Neuenburg, September 5, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Farel.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men, Heinrich Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander, distinguished lights of the Zurich church, with the highest piety and learning, in Zurich.</p>
