      <p>Greetings. Since I saw you, most honorable man, which I was allowed to do only once many years ago, your kindness and affection have so impressed themselves upon my mind that no forgetfulness can ever erase them. For I was received so well along with Mr. Calvin, whom I was accompanying at the time, and so aided by your consolation and advice, as well as that of your colleagues, that I always acknowledge I owe you much. The cause which we were then advocating for the Waldensian churches before your pious and reverend council, you promoted in such a way that you easily showed how deeply you were affected by those dire and bloody persecutions which our people endured for the name of Christ, and you ensured that they were relieved by your letters. Since that time, various troubles have afflicted me, and I have rarely had the opportunity to express my gratitude towards you. Now, however, having returned or rather been expelled from France, I thought it necessary to do so and to fulfill my duty in some part. For a certain opportune occasion seemed to present itself to send you a copy of Irenaeus, on which we have worked during this leisure time according to the advice of our brother Mr. Beza. I ask that this may be a testimony of my goodwill towards you.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I seek your judgment, unless it is troublesome, so that you may write what you think of our undertaking in dealing with the books of the ancients, and what you desire, and assist us with your advice. For both I and Beza, if the Lord wills, have the intention to treat those eminent doctors in such a way that we may benefit many, and harm none except those who willingly misuse them.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man. May the Lord keep you safe for a long time and continually bless your labors. I wish your colleagues, especially Mr. Gwalther, well.</p>
      <p>Geneva, February 27, 1570.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Nicolas Des Gallars.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, father and colleague, whom I hold in the highest regard.</p>
      <p>The Irenaeus of Mr. Nicolas Des Gallars and my response, March 1570.</p>
