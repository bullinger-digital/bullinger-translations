      <p>Strasbourg, 14th February.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Although you, most learned man, may not have the time to linger over my trifles, since these letters (which I received from the brothers in Frankfurt) had to be wrapped in paper, I wanted this empty paper, at least as a token of my duty towards you, to convey my greetings to you. Your discourse has long been circulated among the English as an Englishman, certainly not ungrateful to the English, as I hear. The afflicted flock of Christ still suffers miserable persecution; for on the 27th of January, in London, seven were consumed by fire, and on the same day in Canterbury, five. This is the power of darkness. Heath of York holds the office of chancellor. White of Lincoln is now made bishop of Winchester. Penelope, languishing, awaits the return of her Ulysses; he, however, celebrates the orgies of Bacchus in Antwerp, having obtained the dukedom as a fortunate acquisition. Uncertain reports are made about the truce between Philip and the French, but dreadful ones about his dances, nocturnal revelries, and the abduction of maidens, to which he now devotes himself entirely in Antwerp. God, the judge and avenger, will come at last, to whom you should extend your supplicant hands for England to the point of weariness, like Moses. Farewell, most excellent father. Please greet the most excellent and also most loving lord of the English, Gualter. May God, the best and greatest, repay you all. I now have in hand his Antichrist, so that the English may see the epitome of that book greeting the pope in English.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell and live most happily in Christ. Yours, Thomas Sampson.</p>
      <p>If Mr. Gualter has anything else that could be inserted into our work on the Antichrist to promote it, he would do a most pleasing thing and most useful to our church if he would send it to me; if not, I will publish his Antichrist, as it is, albeit a little more concisely, with God's favor. Farewell for the third time. Hastily.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
