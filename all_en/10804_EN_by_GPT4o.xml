    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the offer of friendship conveyed through Megander; their alliance of friends should serve Christ and the Church. He has described his difficult situation in two letters to Theodor [Bibliander] and also sent a mourning poem on the death of Berchtold [Haller] and Franz [Kolb], but has not received a response, which is why he now turns to Bullinger to seek advice from him and his colleagues. The duty of preaching substitution imposed on him during the appointment of [Simon] Sulzer has become a burden, as he had to stand in for [Kolb], [Haller], [Peter] Kun, and Megander. Since the council did not want to relieve him, he requested time to consider, but fears further difficulties in the event of the appointment of Sebastian [Meyer] and Markus [Bertschi], which is why he is considering resigning at Pentecost and wants to know if he can expect a position in Zurich. The Bernese are preparing a move to Chillon Castle. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Health and a tranquil conscience through Christ, our Savior.</p>
      <p>Megander has shown me one or two letters to read, full of the greatest kindness and love towards me. In one of them, you ask that Megander make a pact of friendship with you under these conditions, so that each of you brings mutual friends with him. I would be lost if anything more pleasing could have happened. For you are asking of me voluntarily what I should have asked of you first, if nature had not made me so alien to gratitude. Therefore, as far as learning and humanity are concerned (since by nature I am slower and more fierce), I will gladly give you the first place; but as for faith in maintaining friendship, I have not placed myself before you, nor have I placed myself after you. May Christ, the best and greatest, make this pact between us all turn to the glory of Christ and the benefit of the Church, and may He inspire the efforts of both with His grace and spirit, so that all deceit and evil trickery may be absent, and so that with mutual prayers and efforts, each may help and support the other in the Lord's work and in promoting piety, each according to his strength and duty. If, with joined forces under Christ the commander, we have served in this way, I have no doubt that for that earthly and momentary struggle, we shall all together celebrate an eternal triumph. Let it be so, let it be so! These are my thoughts on your letters to Megander.</p>
      <p>However, since I have written twice to Theodor, our mutual friend, about the troublesome state of my affairs and have asked him to finally communicate my business and the mourning poem for the spirits of Berchtold and Franz to you and Leon, I fear that the letters have not been delivered to him or that he, due to his occupations (for I do not wish to suspect anything more serious of such a great and sincere friend), has not been able to reply to me. This is why I am now going to communicate the whole matter to you, so that you may confer with Leon, Bibliander, and Mr. Uttinger in such a way that I am not harmed among the Bernese.</p>
      <p>The situation is as follows: In the meantime, while Sulzer moved here from Basel and was appointed as my colleague, this was imposed on me in addition to the duty of lecturing, that I should also undertake the duty of preaching whenever necessity urges. Although I refused this condition for about three or four years in total, finally (as I recently, if I am not mistaken, told you in person), when Sulzer relieved me from the theological lectures on the New Testament, I could no longer excuse myself, unless I wanted to move away entirely. As soon as I once took on this burden, the load placed on my shoulders increased day by day, so much so that for about 10 full weeks, I had to both preach and lecture for Franz, who was suffering from a goiter disease, and then for Berchtold of blessed memory, Kun, and Megander many times, as all three were in poor health. When I saw that this burden was clearly unequal to my shoulders, I approached the council and explained the difficulty of the task, and indeed the impossibility, according to the weakness and infancy of my talent, namely that it is neither in the interest of the children to suspend the lessons so often entirely, nor in the interest of the church, for which I am substituted as a preacher with unwashed hands and feet, while in the meantime I remain silent about the ruin of my studies, as I am forced to do this and that unprepared, like a circus horse. In response to this report and complaint, the council gave a concise and (in my opinion) rather rigid answer, namely that I must either affirm or deny briefly, that I would adhere to the previous conditions. Since it was neither safe to assert nor deny at that moment, I requested time to deliberate, and having been given this and having discussed the matter with the ministers of the word, I replied that I would adhere to the previous conditions to some extent, until they provided for the interests of the church. In the meantime, our Berchtold died, and they summoned Doctor Sebastian, a man (as I hear) pious, learned, and sincere, but so worn out by old age that he can benefit our church for only a few years, or even months. Hence, as far as I can see, I would have to remain stuck in the same mire and always roll the same stone. For even if a certain Markus (as they say) is also called from Basel, yet, since Megander and Kun (as I have said) are in poor health and Sebastian is an almost retired soldier of Christ and about to be granted discharge and leave, undoubtedly that former burden and interruption of my studies would cause me trouble. Therefore, if it seems advisable to you, my friends and patrons, I will extricate myself from these difficulties in such a way that, after the expected outcome of this matter and the catastrophe of the whole play, I will approach the council again and tell them that I will diligently serve them in my first calling, if they do not involve me in any business with ecclesiastical function; otherwise, I will resign all at once at the upcoming Pentecost. However, before I say this, I would think it worthwhile to be informed by you whether there would be a place for me to stay with you, or whether a literary position could be provided for me elsewhere. Therefore, my dear Bullinger, I ask you to communicate this matter with the aforementioned men, but cautiously and only under the stipulation of silence, and as soon as possible, inform me of what you have decided about it. I will comply with your advice and counsel, if I can.</p>
      <p>While I was writing this, our people, with a considerable number of soldiers and six cannons, were about to make an expedition the next day to attack a certain fortified castle named Chillon.</p>
      <p>Megander and our Sulzer send their greetings to you and your συνεργοὺς (collaborators). You will also greet in turn, in my name, Leon, Uttinger, Pellican, and especially our Bibliander.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Bern, March 19, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Rhellikan.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed friend and patron. Zurich.</p>
