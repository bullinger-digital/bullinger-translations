      <p>My humble regards to you, etc.</p>
      <p>My lord, beloved, in haste, not especially to you. For some time ago, I wrote to you about a notable dispute among the Appenzellers, namely concerning the bailiff Eisenhut, that he, along with others, should have returned to your city of St. Gallen years ago their banner or flag, which the Appenzellers were said to have captured from them, etc. However, your city is entirely opposed to this and has therefore sent a delegation to Appenzell, including Vadianus, and also responded in writing, stating that this cannot be found to be true and no one can prove that they ever lost their sign. Although this matter is driven by certain individuals and has so far been a burden to the majority of the council and community, these individuals have a large following. Also, that Eisenhut years ago, when he was an envoy, took 100 crowns from the French and placed only 20 in the public treasury. (However, bailiff Eisenhut has legally cleared himself of this against your person.) Also, that he carried the seal of the land to the abbot of St. Gallen in the city, where it was sealed outside the land on behalf of a tenth, although it is found, I hear, that he was commissioned by the church community in the village of Appenzell. In summary: also one, Tyges Zidler, former chancellor, is accused of having written or set against their sworn land book after the pension. These two persons have had to provide surety of 2000 guilders each, not to dispose of their life and property, or to be imprisoned. Next Wednesday, both are to be brought to justice, many testimonies heard, and it seems to be a different opinion, stirred up, and some have not wanted to bow to the consolation, but rather to imprisonment, even those before the council chamber. Next Wednesday is the next court day set; I do not know how it will go. Some hope wildly. Yet it seems to me that if it goes well, a general assembly will be called. There are great factions. May God arrange it to His praise.</p>
      <p>Also, regarding what you mentioned about the Savoy and Geneva affair, since you last wrote to my dear lord Vadian, we desire from you.</p>
      <p>Also, I would like to send 1 load of wine to Zurich down the Lake Constance. I do not know whether I should send it to Stein or Schaffhausen, whichever place would be better to transport it to Zurich; I ask you to inquire with someone knowledgeable and inform me.</p>
      <p>Also, I ask you to send this enclosed letter to Master Werner Steiner.</p>
      <p>My wife and I also send greetings to your wife, also dear mother. May the Lord comfort you. Greet me if anyone inquires about me.</p>
      <p>Written in haste. The bearer of this letter is the late Captain Ambrosius's son; he is a good, friendly man, whom I hope will not be found lacking in truth.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, on Tuesday before Othmar's day in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your willing, etc.</p>
      <p>Hans Vogler, still in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>To my lord and faithful Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his hands.</p>
