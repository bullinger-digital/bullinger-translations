      <p>Greetings. The Emperor (CÃ¤sar) is a liar, as is his father. He promised something, I know not what, that pertains to the peace of Germany in religion, and now he concludes, where such horrendous things are seen, that a more dreadful council could neither be found nor defined. But you know these things. Indeed, I see nothing but future persecution. Therefore, we must prepare our bodies here, so that they may be pleasing to the Lord. May He grant grace and help, so that on the evil day, through patience and the free confession of Christ the Lord, we may be able to stand and endure in those things which we have taught and practiced according to the divine word until now. Amen.</p>
      <p>A rumor has reached here that the Pope has written to the Swiss and requested aid with such zeal as he has never done before; he did not call them sons, but fathers and defenders of the church, and promised as many good things as his holiness can confer; however, the enemy is the Emperor, whose endeavor is the following:</p>
      <p>To make Italy his own. I wish to know if there is any truth in this. Another rumor: the French King (Gallus) attempted to seize Metz under the pretext of supplications; for he sent a huge force of men into the city, and if the matter had not been made public by a certain traitor, something would have been done; for there were also accomplices of the treason in the city. Therefore, soon four leaders were captured and subjected to punishments, whose heads were placed on poles and raised high, as seen by the charioteer who narrated these things. Those who were in the supplications are still detained in the city.</p>
      <p>They predict a war will come, unless the French King wishes his men to be lost. Indeed, here according to the flesh: "Whatever happens, which may call the Emperor out of Germany at some time and meanwhile something else may come upon his Interim, could be pleasing to me." The people of Strasbourg (Argentinenses) have responded to the Emperor, still wishing that their confession remains inviolate. What he will answer, they await. The Lord must be prayed to, that He may protect His word.</p>
      <p>Sultzer is still here because of his wife, who is from Basel. What will become of him, I do not know. Beatus came the day before yesterday, today he descends to Strasbourg with his family and belongings, where his wife also has her origin. Whatever you attach to these of yours, send immediately to Constance to Lord Ambrosius; what they contain, I do not know, but I see it is necessary that they do not delay longer on the journey. I ask you to diligently take care of the matter, as you have done in similar cases. Do not worry about the title or superscription. Send cautiously.</p>
      <p>Lord Pellicanus sent to us a certain Valentinus from Glarus, who so disturbs the order of our church that no other disturber is needed. I have not heard the man, therefore I cannot judge him. Yet he so entices people that no one does not want to hear him. Almost all my brothers have heard him and say the man is neither learned nor entirely sane; he attacks anyone without shame except the common people; this, I do not know by what reason, he wonderfully attracts. The worst of people come to listen; hence the rest are amazed, saying: "Behold, even he listens; therefore, he must be a great and admirable man." The magistrates almost agree with the common people, and thus the best order of all parishes is disturbed. These things I confide to you. However, I wish that if you knew the man, you would describe him to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with all the brothers, especially to Gwalther and Pellicanus. I would like to write to them; but I am so weakened by illness that I can hardly move my fingers.</p>
      <p>Please take care of these letters diligently.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 7, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
