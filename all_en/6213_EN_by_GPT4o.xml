      <p>Honorable, well- and highly learned sir, my entire friendly and willing service is prepared for you beforehand. Therefore, I thank you for your friendly letter along with the book that you sent me, with the offer to repay you for it, if possible. Today, right after the sermon, my godfather Mr. Hans Haller informed me that you wrote to him about the letters you sent me, whether they are from St. Gallen or Appenzell, to send them back to you.</p>
      <p>This should have happened long ago; but my own and other affairs have prevented me until now. I ask you not to take it amiss; for it happened with no ill or evil intent.</p>
      <p>I have also reported everything that should have happened, without showing the letters; I am of good hope that everything will serve for good, especially for the honor of God and the benefit and well-being of the fatherland. With this, may God the Lord always be entrusted in faithfulness.</p>
      <p>May God be with us all.</p>
      <p>Dated Bern, July 30, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your always very willing Claude May, etc. And although the matter ended somewhat amicably at the last meeting, my request would be, once again to you (as I otherwise do not doubt you will do), to insist that a special order be given, as I have indicated to you orally, in good hope that it will not be without fruit. I have seriously sealed the letter to JÃ¤nff.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well- and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the divine word in Zurich, my very esteemed sir. Zurich.</p>
