      <p>Most illustrious man, yesterday I gave a bundle of letters to a certain merchant, which he will deliver to you; but today an opportunity presented itself with this messenger, who is going directly to Basel. Therefore, I write again and send the same thing that I sent in the previous letters; for if those were to be lost, these indeed will not perish.</p>
      <p>Today I received letters from the brothers in Italy, who write that the ambassador of the King of Poland complained to the Roman pontiff that some have slandered his king, as if he had begun to agree with our doctrine, and added that he is even prepared to shed blood for the Roman church in defense against us. Such is the situation. Furthermore, they write that the pope is preparing some sort of reformation, supposedly to cut off the occasion, so that no one may cry out in the council. Persecution is raging in a remarkable manner; pray for those brothers. I am thinking of returning to you, indeed I think it necessary to return for the cause of Christ and to report to you many things that cannot be entrusted to letters. Therefore, I will make an effort to come quickly.</p>
      <p>The Antichrist has given a task to a certain Parascitus, to respond to my books, and he has already responded to some, but impiously, foolishly, and shamelessly. I will have to contend with this monster for some time. This will be my Cocleus.</p>
      <p>I hear that the King of the French is not willingly consenting to the celebration of the council, I think out of hatred for the Emperor, who hopes to gain the advantage from the council that all of Germany will serve him. The Italians are certain that in Augsburg, Philipp will be given to Charles as coadjutor and successor. Farewell, brother in Christ, and pray to God for me with the whole church. I greet Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gesner, Mr. Frisius, Mr. Zwingli, Mr. Lavater, Mr. Otto, Mr. Josias. May God keep you from evil through Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, December 23, 1550.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
