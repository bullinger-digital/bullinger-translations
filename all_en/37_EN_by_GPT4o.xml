    <p xml:id="regest1">Serin sends Bullinger the writing [«De Naemanni adoratione»] along with a cost calculation. Once Bullinger has supplemented the writing and granted permission to print, Serin wishes for the printing to be carried out as quickly as possible (before the end of the Augsburg Diet!) by a Zurich printer, and for thirty copies to be sent to him along with his print template. He will also advance the corresponding money to [bookseller] Hans Varnier, to whom undoubtedly some copies of the booklet [for sale] will be delivered.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Serin does not want his name to be mentioned [on the title page of the print]. At most, [the pseudonym] he mentioned at the end of his treatise could be used there. This is to obscure who the writing is actually directed at. The reasons for this will not be mentioned here. Furthermore, Serin emphatically wishes that (if this can be reconciled with Swiss frankness) neither the printer nor the place of printing be disclosed, so that [this mention] does not suffice as a suspicion of heresy to keep the booklet away from the intended recipients in the papal territories [around Znaim]. Nevertheless, the writing is also relevant for the cities of Germany, as they prove themselves daily as traitors of the faith through their stance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Except for one colleague [N.N.] and two city clerks, no one in Ulm knows anything about this [printing] project, not even Martin Frecht.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Serin has carefully considered every word while writing his text and has strived to show moderation. However, he cannot rule out that a mistake might have occurred. It would be time-consuming and particularly risky to list more about it here now. Serin has avoided his Swabian dialect to create the impression that the writing originated from the pen of a papist in Bavaria or Austria. Therefore, the printer should not change anything in the text! If something appears too awkward or clumsy to Bullinger, he should still not change it but consider that Serin's pursued goal led him to [this choice of words]. This is especially important to keep in mind when reading Serin's explanations on the Old and New Testament and other similar topics.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Bullinger should respond briefly so that Serin knows what to expect in this matter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">There is no time for news. Besides, there are only a few anyway. Johannes Piscatorius has gone to Urach in Württemberg. Martin Bucer from Strasbourg is secretly expected in the vicinity of Augsburg, as he was summoned by Emperor Charles V at the request of some imperial estates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[P.S.:] The people of Ulm would be greatly worried about the Swiss if Joachim Vadian had not raised hope with Martin Frecht by [mentioning] the Swiss delegation [to the baptism of Claude de France in Paris]. May the Lord protect the Swiss.</p>

      <p>S.P. I send you, my most esteemed and dearest Bullinger, this present writing along with the calculation, which, if you add to it and deem it worthy of publication, I wish to be printed by one of your printers in Zurich as soon as possible, and before the end of the Augsburg Diet, and for 30 copies to be sent to me along with this prototype of mine. Our Varnier, to whom undoubtedly some copies will also be sent, will receive the payment from me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>However, I do not want my name to be added otherwise than as I have appended it on the back, for this reason among others, so that it is less likely to be discovered who it is to whom I have written. The gravest reasons, which I refrain from recounting, demand this. Furthermore, I also wish emphatically, unless it seems entirely unworthy of Swiss liberty and frankness, that neither the printer nor the name of the city be disclosed, lest the booklet be hindered by suspicion of heresy, which I have taken every precaution to avoid, from spreading through the papal regions, for which it was primarily composed by me. Although in our cities too, many daily reveal themselves and shamelessly come forward as Naëmites.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>There is no one in this city, not even our Martin, except for one of the brothers and two scribes, who is aware of this business.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>With what intention each thing was said and so tempered (for I did not wish to utter a single word rashly and thoughtlessly, unless it was through ignorance that I erred!). It would be both lengthy and dangerous to recount more here now. I have deliberately avoided the Swabian dialect, which I otherwise use, to create the impression that these writings originated from some Bavarian or Austrian province and were composed by a papist. Therefore, the printer should be warned not to attempt to change anything. For I would like it to appear entirely as if it arose from Bavaria or Austria and was written by a papist. If anything seems to you awkward or harshly said, and yet you do not wish to change it, consider, I pray, that either the argument or my purpose perhaps demanded it and led me to it. This will be especially necessary when you read about the nature of testaments and other such matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Briefly, I pray, respond according to your accustomed benevolence towards me, most illustrious man and most esteemed brother, so that I may know how the matter stands.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>There is no time to write news now. I have very little anyway. Our Piscator has gone to Urach in the Duchy of Württemberg. Martin from Strasbourg is secretly expected in the vicinity of Augsburg, when he is summoned to be heard by the Emperor according to the petition of some estates.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell and keep me in your thoughts. February 6th, in the year, etc., 48. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Yours, Soerinus.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>We would greatly fear for you, if Vadian had not already given our Martin hope from the delegation of your princes. May the Lord defend you and guide all your plans, dearest brothers. Amen.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
