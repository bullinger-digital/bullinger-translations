      <p>Greetings. I return to you, honorable lord and compater, everything that I have received from you today and in these days, and I give you special thanks for the singular effort you have undertaken in the description of the Rhaetian affairs concerning Johannes Planta. The lords consuls, treasurers, and all the others who have learned the outcome of this tragedy from your writing also thank you with me, and they ask that you share with us, as soon as you can have them, what is subsequently done and decided by those Rhaetian judges; for it seems that this evil has taken deeper roots than to be eradicated in that one instance.</p>
      <p>Regarding your booklets, I either remember or do not rightly remember having written my judgment to you. Whatever it may be, do you think that anything that comes from you is not of great value to me? However, to let you know that I have read and thoroughly read them, I received great consolation from the one about the coming of the Lord, and from the other, education. If only everyone would follow this moderation! The affairs of the church would be better. I feel the same about your considerations on the Saxon edition. However, those letters from Nuremberg disturbed me; I see that the lord wants to draw the Wittenbergers into the arena, and if only they would give glory to God and openly join our camp!</p>
      <p>They would find enough help not only with the lord but also with men; for it will indeed be necessary to break through once and expunge that αθτοσ εξα. As for us, we have nothing special. Lord Steiger has completed his two-year term, and Lord Mülinen has succeeded him again; both greet you. Our Telamonius has also been added again to the senatorial order with some others. My father-in-law fell into a dangerous illness on Easter day after taking communion at lunch, from which he is still bedridden, so that we do not know what the lord intends to decide about him; however, we pray that he may wish to leave and preserve him with us longer; for this is greatly required not only by his private affairs but also by public ones.</p>
      <p>Farewell. The lords, friends, brothers, and finally all my household greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 9, 1572.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>The booklet, which I send at the same time, I compiled from the book of decrees 16 years ago; some men of good judgment have seen it with me, who think it should be published; for they liked the order and method I used. As I have easily suppressed it with me until now, so I will gladly suppress it further. Meanwhile, I pray that you take at least one or two hours to go through the chapters and titles only and freely write to me what you think, as you have the utmost authority over me. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my honorable lord and dearest compater.</p>
      <p>Zurich. M. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
