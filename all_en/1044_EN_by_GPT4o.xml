      <p>Grace and mercy from the Lord through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Lucius Haimius, the consul, and I received your letter dated October 3rd, dearest brother; we read and understood everything. In eight days, we will consult with the friends and relatives of the boys about these matters; for the issues that the barber proposed are serious, and Lord Johannes Blasius of blessed memory left his affairs tangled and disordered. I believe it will happen that the boy will be called back to his ancestral home; however, we will settle the expenses incurred so far without delay and put your mind at ease. No one has yet been appointed in Blasius's place; I will make an effort for Philippus Galitius to succeed him. Pontasella is well, though bereft of wife and children; he has only his mother bedridden; he receives his stipend without reduction, although he is no longer burdened with work. I have understood about the imperial matters.</p>
      <p>We in Chur are in dire need of divine mercy and help; for we have been deprived of the best citizens who favored the gospel and all the learned men. Among the learned, Johannes Blasius, Rudolf von Salis, Sampson von Salis, a well-educated young man, Caspar Andretina, and Hieronymus Ilantinus, the pastor, have died. You write about the daughter, which gives me encouragement. I am especially grateful to you, who endure such labors for my sake, and then to the host and his wife; convey my greetings also to the little daughter, and when something is lacking, let me know. I would also like the girl to be sent to school after the grape harvest to learn to write; for before winter (if she at least has a place), I will not call her back. Farewell. From Chur, October 7, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and brother. To ZÃ¼rich, Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
