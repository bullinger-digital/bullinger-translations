      <p>Greetings. A divinely provided opportunity recently arose for our brothers Farel and Beza, while they were traveling there, to remove the offense caused by a misunderstanding of their integrity, which had been conceived from a vain suspicion. I was certainly persuaded, as Beza had solemnly testified to me, that they had remained silent about the confession because they considered the matter to be of lesser importance, not warranting any mention. It would never have been credible that they concealed it from me out of any fear.</p>
      <p>Although there was some ambiguity or obscurity due to brevity, I had no doubt that they would rather die ten times than deviate even slightly from our agreement, indeed, that they would openly profess to feel the same as we do. Therefore, our Gwalther was too harsh in his attack on both me and them.</p>
      <p>As for what I wrote about the promise, I do not see why it should have offended you. You deny that it is within the discretion of any private individual to promise anything concerning a common matter.</p>
      <p>However, I thought it was clearly settled between us: if we were called to a conference, we would have neither a just cause nor an honorable pretext to refuse.</p>
      <p>What I wrote to Philipp will be more clearly understood from the words themselves. Now Philipp's own letters will show that nothing was more desirable than for him to openly join our side. The case of Jakob Andreae is different: yet he too, if he did not fear Brentius, would be quite teachable. I encouraged your young disciple as you advised.</p>
      <p>A pious brother who is traveling to you with him asked me to add some commendation to Philipp's letters. Although he had decided to go directly to you when leaving Philipp, he was brought here by our Crispin. However, since the language barrier prevents his work from being useful to us, he now returns to the destination he had initially set for himself. While the man's piety and other virtues are sufficient to gain favor, he is nonetheless worthy of being received by our churches, from which he was expelled by his fellow countrymen and also by the Saxons due to their connection. I hope that a suitable position will easily be found for this pious, modest, and learned man, either with you or in the territory of Bern. Farewell, most distinguished and venerable brother, with your wife and family.</p>
      <p>May the Lord always keep you safe, guide you with His spirit, and bless you. I send many greetings to your colleagues.</p>
      <p>Geneva, October 13, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>Return Philipp's letters as soon as an opportunity for a messenger arises. To the esteemed minister of Christ and faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, Heinrich Bullinger, most honored brother and fellow minister.</p>
