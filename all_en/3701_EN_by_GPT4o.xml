      <p>Greetings. I received yesterday, dearest godfather in the Lord, the sermons you sent to me concerning the feast days of the Lord himself, for which I am grateful to you for this gift. I would prefer to repay you in kind, if my old friend Johannes Herwagen were still among the living. For I perceive that his heirs are so disposed that I scarcely dare to ask from them a tenth part of those things which I used to request and receive with confidence from their parent, about which I wrote to you before, if I am not mistaken. Whatever this may be, I pray to the Lord to bless your labors and grant you a long, comfortable old age, sufficient for your usual labors, and at the same time grant such times in which the works of good men may find a place and be well placed. We have fallen into times in which the bodies of those who have labored diligently in the work of the Lord are either alive or impiously dug up from their graves and handed over to Vulcan, indeed the sacred Bibles themselves are condemned as heresy and thrown into burning pyres. If these things are happening while the light of truth still prevails, what shall we think will happen when it is removed from our midst due to our sins? Meanwhile, however, the labors of those who have illustrated the truth of the gospel of God, whether by teaching or by writing, will not be in vain; for they will at least ensure that there will be no excuse for the impious and unbelieving, which itself contributes to the glory of God. Regarding the cause of the people of Lausanne, you have undoubtedly received information from Mr. Haller, my godfather.</p>
      <p>Good men are more scrupulously engaged in the work of the Lord than the state of present times allows. Farewell excellently, dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>I wish health to your whole household and to Mr. Bibliander, Peter Martyr, Gwalther, Bernardino.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 11.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your godfather.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dear brother and godfather in Christ.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
