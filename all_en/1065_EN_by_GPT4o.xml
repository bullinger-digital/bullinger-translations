      <p>Greetings. I have seen the Spanish-German inquisition, dearest compater in the Lord, which you sent here for reading. I have sensed the wickedness of the monks and remembered the words of Erasmus, who in 1533 wrote to Johann Cholerus, the provost of Chur, who was also the provost at St. Maurice in Augsburg, in this manner:</p>
      <p>"I clearly see that if the affairs of the Lutherans decline, such a tyranny of the monks will arise that we will long for Luther." The affairs of the Lutherans in Germany are indeed greatly declining, and this tyranny of the monks, which the Emperor judges to be the piety of true religion, not only arises but also spreads, and I think this is the reason why Queen Mary was unexpectedly compelled to return to her Dutch subjects from the Augsburg Diet; for it is said that her principal nobles fled from the face of this tyranny while the Emperor and she were plotting something at that Diet.</p>
      <p>The disaster that the people of Magdeburg incurred through their own recklessness, by not obeying the counsel of Count Mansfeld, is greater than your letters suggest. For Sperlinus wrote to me about this matter in recent days, which he received from a certain nobleman from Meissen in this manner: "He reports to me that about 600 persons from Magdeburg, from citizens and servants, have been killed by Duke George of Mecklenburg the Younger, whose father Duke Albrecht was always against the gospel and loyal to the Emperor. But the old Duke Heinrich is good for our religion and rich, this one is ruined. You may well believe that such Duke Heinrich and these actions are all arranged from the Emperor's kitchen and the monks' purse and plans, intending to weary the Christian people. May the Almighty grant better. Yet the people of Magdeburg (whom also Count Mansfeld and others advised against this sortie) are still firm and manly.</p>
      <p>In summary, these are war exercises; such gifts are given in such a board game. The people of Brunswick and the duke have inflicted more than a skirmish on both sides, with 800 or 900 men killed. There are general oppositions.</p>
      <p>The Pope has paid Duke Heinrich 7 companies of soldiers, and he, the duke, is now in Augsburg and is being interrogated against the people of the city; they have also arrived there with 21 horses. Magdeburg and Bremen are summoned for interrogation on November 2nd. He wrote this to me on October 21st, from which it is easy to see what that Magdeburg disaster has caused. I fear the example of your neighbors in Constance. Therefore, the Lord must be prayed to, to give those cities not only the spirit of fortitude but also of sincere communion and the most necessary consensus. That Mecklenburg man would have attempted none of these things if those cities had adhered to each other with greater consensus and faith. And the spirit of consensus that I wish for them, I also wish for our evangelical republics and churches here. United strength is stronger than itself when dispersed; there is no strength in scattered brooms.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, dearest compater in the Lord. The plague does not indeed rage here with full force, but it creeps in such a way that it continually takes away not a few, and that from our neighbors. Therefore, we expect at any moment the hand of our heavenly Father visiting us, which I write so that you may commend us to His grace in your prayers. Greet all the lords and brothers, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Theodor, Mr. Gwalther, and the other brothers and friends. Bern, November 2, 1550.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your compater in the Lord. To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most diligent pastor of the church in Zurich, his dearest lord and compater.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
