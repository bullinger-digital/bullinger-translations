    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Del Prato was very pleased with what Baldassare Altieri showed him in the letter from Bullinger [not received] addressed to him, and this for two reasons: In a personal regard, especially since the letter shows that Bullinger has not forgotten Del Prato and Altieri, and in a political regard, because Bullinger communicated that the relationship between France and the Swiss Confederates is good. Even though he had no doubt about it, this is now pleasantly confirmed by Bullinger's communication, as good relations benefit both the Swiss Confederates and France. Del Prato will also engage in this within his limited means. Indeed, Bullinger, who is so influential, should continue to advocate for this and not forget him in the process. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] In Venice, everyone was pleased except for a few (as is always the case) about the [military] success of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. The people of Zurich will have learned about this earlier. </p>

      <p>B. Pratensius to Heinrich Bullinger sends greetings. I was very delighted by what the distinguished man Baldassare Altieri recently showed me in your last letter addressed to him, and this for two reasons: personally, because you testify that the memory of us has not yet faded from your mind, and publicly, because you indicate that the relationship between our king and your Swiss Confederates is so good. Although I had no doubt about it, what you write seems to have a certain emphasis, and just as your friendship has been more important to me than any other, I believe that this very public alliance and connection with you is of great importance to the prosperous state of our France and at the same time to the Swiss. For this reason, I will also cultivate, protect, and observe both as much as I can (though it may be little), and I beseech and implore you to continue to demonstrate the steadfast memory of goodwill towards me and to use all your influence (which I consider to be of great importance) among your people to foster this public connection between the French and the Swiss, so that you may deserve well of the affairs of Christians much more and more.</p>

      <p>Here, everyone (except for a few, who must necessarily be otherwise affected) is very pleased with the successes of the Duke of Saxony; but more recent news reaches you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Venetians have recently been struck with fear that a Turkish fleet might penetrate into the Adriatic Gulf. For many Turkish ships have been seen towards Epirus. But others will inform you better about these matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Furthermore, I would like to know something about Maturin, the French bookseller, who was working in Zurich. In Venice, on the 5th of April, 1547. Farewell!</p>
      <p>To the most renowned man Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and eloquent churchman. In Zurich.</p>
