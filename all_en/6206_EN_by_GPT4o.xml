      <p>Greetings and best wishes. For the things you sent, I thank you, dear brother, especially for the decrees of the council, which I am returning; for last week I received both the index of heretics and the decrees of the Council of Trent published by the pope, with a brief apostolic preface and elegantly printed by Paolo Manuzio in Venice; I received them from Padua from my old friend Mr. Engelbert Milander from Hesse, who may also be known to you. But I have not seen the disputation of that Cardillus of yours, nor have I heard anything about it before. Here, here, if you please, you may take the opportunity to respond to it diligently, relevantly, and briefly. If copies are sent to Frankfurt, I will inform Froschauer.</p>
      <p>The same person said he would take care of Erastus's business; he dealt with the people of Locarno; they replied that they would bring it from Milan, but not for less than 15 gold coins. If I write to Erastus, I will remember your advice.</p>
      <p>The decrees of the Council of Trent were also previously printed in Cologne, from where I also obtained them. What I have from Bern and Geneva, I am sending to you here, so that you may see that even in many matters I never forget you; be careful not to spread them rashly. If it seems convenient to you, return this writing to me; if not, keep it.</p>
      <p>The letter in Latin is from Beza to me.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received any definite response from the people of Bern; when I do, I will write more fully.</p>
      <p>Now farewell together with your wife, children, and our friends; all of mine greet you. Zurich, July 28, 1564.</p>
      <p>Yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, my most esteemed and dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
