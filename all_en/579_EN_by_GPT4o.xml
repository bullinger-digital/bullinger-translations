      <p>Greetings and Peace. As soon as I returned to Strasbourg, I examined with Jan ≈Åaski, whom I remember in person, the letter, and I easily recognized it as the very one you gave me to read there. Furthermore, in the meantime, since I left there, I received from Mr. Calvin his writing on the Eucharist or the Lord's Supper, which he sent to me of his own accord.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it will not be necessary for you to send another. However, you would do me a most pleasing favor if you would send me what you have on the Lord's Supper by Bucer, which he wrote before he became so foolish. I will repay this favor in whatever way possible, whenever your affairs require it. Mr. Butler promised me that he would arrange with Musculus, Vadianus, and several others, to obtain their opinion on the same subject I proposed to you, which you undoubtedly remember well. If he seems to need your help here, please do not withhold it: I wish we could obtain the common consent of the Bernese church! If anything is obtained, the letters written to me from there can be sent to Frankfurt to a certain Adrian Eding, well known to Mr. Butler and also to Froschauer.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, in the news, we have nothing here but all sad things. All these churches seem to be declining more and more every day and are on the verge of complete ruin. For the spirits of all the people, whose role it was to act more manfully, are weakening. Meanwhile, the adversaries laugh with full (as they say) cheeks, and for them, religion and all piety are the greatest mockery. The older and more steadfast in faith and good deeds, and those who have deserved well of religion, and even the prophets themselves, are either called away from the living or summoned elsewhere in Germany. Added to this is the fact that we hear execrable blasphemies against God and His word daily from those who once acknowledged Christ and have now defected from us to the adversaries.</p>
      <p>Finally, we see no repentance leading the people, but rather they become more sluggish and perverse than usual; hence it is certain that nothing awaits us but the gravest punishments for our ingratitude. Meanwhile, may God have mercy on us for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ, and increase our faith by His Spirit, so that we may stand firm, even in the midst of all evils, in the confession of His name.</p>
      <p>You will easily learn the rest from the letters of others. I had indeed decided to travel from Cologne to England; however, due to the serious dangers awaiting me in Flanders, following the advice of friends, we are contemplating a journey through Calais, which we will undertake tomorrow, God willing.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I earnestly commend myself to your prayers. Farewell, most distinguished and honorable teacher, and enroll me in the diary of your friends. May God strengthen you with His Spirit, so that you may bravely and with an unbroken spirit defend the Sparta you have acquired until the very last day of your life, to the glory of His name. Farewell again, and do not fail to inform us of anything you think would be worthwhile for us to know at the next Frankfurt fair.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, July 7, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Jan Utenhove.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished by singular piety and all-encompassing learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most beloved brother. Zurich.</p>
