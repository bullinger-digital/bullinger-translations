      <p>Greetings. Although, most illustrious man, there is hardly anything that comes to mind for me to write to you about, since I should write to you as you have testified that this duty is not unpleasing to you, I did not want to omit it. And since I have nothing else to convey in my letter, I thank you for yours, which I received upon my return here, and in which you again declare your singular benevolence towards me, so that I confess myself to be much more obliged to you. I have informed our Christoph about what you wanted; but he replied that he and all his belongings are rightfully yours. He sends you his warmest greetings. Now, if there were anything here that we could do in your name, we would all gladly perform it. Budaeus, my dearest brother, and Jacob, who was with me when I first visited you, send you their respectful greetings. I truly pray to the Lord for your perpetual peace and ask that He may always guide you with His spirit and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished and especially esteemed by me. Geneva, December 20, 1556.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
