      <p>Greetings and Peace. Your letter dated the 22nd of this month was received by Mr. Hooper, the most vigilant bishop, to which, when I often urged him to respond, he replied that he had decided to remain silent for a while until he received the conclusion of his episcopal business. However, knowing your singular love for the king, the English church, and Hooper, and your intense desire to know what is happening here, although you might receive more information from others, I thought it my duty to write to you in the meantime, while Hooper completes his business, which is significant and of uncertain outcome (as it appears). The king (as you know) assigned him the bishopric of Gloucester; but he refused to accept it unless he was freed in every way from all forms of papal superstition. Here immediately arises the question of the form of the oath, which the bishops prescribed to be made by God, the saints, and the gospels; Hooper absolutely refused to take this impious oath.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when he came before the king in the presence of the royal council, Hooper persuaded the king with many reasons that the oath should be taken by God alone, the καρδιογνώστης (knower of hearts) (This happened on July 20). This pleased the pious king; therefore, he himself struck out with his pen the tail of the oath prescribed by creatures: nothing more holy and worthy of a Christian king could have been done. After this was done, the form of episcopal consecration remained, which, as it was recently prescribed by the bishops in parliament, differs little from the papal form.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Hooper obtained royal letters to the Archbishop of Canterbury, so that he might be consecrated without superstition. But Hooper achieved nothing, as he was referred from the Archbishop of Canterbury to the Bishop of London. But here he refused to use any form of consecration other than that prescribed by parliament. Thus, the bishops give each other mutual assistance, lest any of their glory be diminished. A few days later (July 30), Hooper obtained from the king and his council that he might be consecrated by the Bishop of London without any superstition. He replied that he would soon respond either to the councilors or to Hooper. While Hooper was waiting for a response from the bishop, he went to the king's court and alienated the minds of the princes from Hooper: he diminished the use of vestments and similar things in the church, calling them ἑτερόζυγα (unequally yoked).</p>
      <p>He persuaded many so much that they reluctantly listened to Hooper's excuse later, when Hooper came to the court a little later; and so Hooper asked that if they did not want to hear him speaking, they would at least deign to hear and read his written excuse.</p>
      <p>Hooper obtained this: therefore, he delivered his opinion in writing to the king's councilors about abolishing the use of vestments and similar trifles. If the bishop cannot satisfy them with other reasons, Hooper will prevail. We daily expect the end of this controversy, which is conducted only in private either by conversations or letters, lest any disturbance be stirred up among the ignorant. You see in what state the affairs of the church would be if they depended on the bishops, even the better ones.</p>
      <p>Blessed be God, who has granted England a prudent and pious king. He most diligently purges and gathers the church of Christ. By his favor, a temple of the Augustinians was granted to the foreign Germans and French, so that they might have the administration of the word and sacraments pure according to the apostolic form. We are freed by public letters of the king and his council from all jurisdiction of the bishops.</p>
      <p>To each church, I mean the German and the French, two ministers of the word are assigned by the king (among whom I am unworthily numbered). Over them is appointed the most illustrious superintendent Mr. Johannes a Lasco, by whose work alone, after God, we foreigners have obtained this purity of religion. Some bishops oppose our institution, especially the Bishop of London with some others; but I hope they will achieve nothing.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Canterbury, the sole patron of foreigners, has been especially a supporter and promoter of our church, not without the admiration of some. God can use all things for his glory. He has published these days a huge volume on the Lord's Supper, in which he strongly opposes any presence of the body of Christ. Bucer, admonished these days by Mr. a Lasco the superintendent, not to stir up any disturbance in the sacramental matter, modestly replied that he was thinking nothing of this; rather, he hoped he would easily agree with him (if he were present). Therefore, the superintendent is soon to set out to him for this purpose.</p>
      <p>The Emperor secretly sent Scepper, one of his chief councilors, to England in July, to take away the king's eldest sister, Mary; but the matter was betrayed by divine favor, and prevented. If God were not watching over his own, it would have been all over for them. The same Spanish tyrant is infesting Belgium with the gravest persecutions: he has proposed the most bloody Spanish inquisition, which compels our people to cross over to England.</p>
      <p>May God preserve his church, and we commend our English and foreign church to the prayers of you all.</p>
      <p>Your book sent to the king was most welcome. Mr. Johannes Utenhovius sends greetings to all the ministers of the church, to whom I commend myself very much. London, August 28, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your entire servant, Martin Micronius. While good men are waiting for a favorable wind to cross over, something has intervened concerning our foreign church. The temple, which the king assigned to us, is being diligently restored at royal expense by the work of the royal treasurer, to whom the choir of the same temple was granted. But because little progress is being made in the restoration, Mr. a Lasco asked that the key of the temple be given to us, so that at least on Sundays we might be allowed to preach there. But it was denied by the treasurer, because the temple was a royal gift; therefore, it should not be handed over to us unless it was most magnificently adorned. Speaking also of our freedom of ceremonies, he asked why we would want to have different ones from the English, since the English ones do not conflict with the word of God: finally, after discussing many things about the ceremonies of the church, the treasurer brought the matter to the point that we foreigners must either embrace the English ceremonies or refute them by the word of God.</p>
      <p>This whole tragedy is stirred up against us by the bishops, especially the Bishop of London, who harms all the more grievously, the more he seems to favor the word of God.</p>
      <p>The mouthpiece of the bishops in this cause is the treasurer. You know how great a task it is to establish a nation for Christ.</p>
      <p>Here we need the prayers of all the pious; for it is not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord. Farewell again. 1550, the day before the calends of September.</p>
      <p>The same as above.</p>
      <p>We are very surprised that we have received no response about Valentin Werdmüller, whether he is from the family of the treasurer of Zürich, as he has persuaded us. Indeed, we have made great expenses to rescue him from dangers. If his parents are those he claims, we would wish that what we spent on him be restored to our poor.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
