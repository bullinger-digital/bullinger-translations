      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, dearest and most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greetings. The reason I am only now responding to you, most learned Bullinger, later than you expected, is because we have been waiting until now for the boy's father, who is in Turin, to send the money here as he had promised. Now, since he has delayed for so long, my friend, at whose request I had recommended the boy to you, and I have decided that we should no longer delay but immediately recall him. First, I am sending you six crowns to pay the bookseller and partially satisfy your scribe for the cost of living.</p>
      <p>Then I ask that, as soon as you receive this letter, you gather the books he bought, and from them, make up as much money as you can at least for his travel expenses, and at the same time send him back to us here. I also ask you to briefly collect the accounts that will teach us how much will be owed to the scribe. I will ensure that the remaining amount is paid in due time. However, I would not want any mention of the six crowns in the letters. I am paying them from my own funds. Therefore, I prefer both the father and the one for whose sake I have pledged my faith to believe that the debt is still owed there, so they are more prompt in repaying. Above all, I ask that you excuse me for having caused you this trouble. As I have already said, send the boy back immediately, so that a longer delay does not cause me greater harm.</p>
      <p>The boy whom you recommended to me, besides having a good and kind host, will also be my concern. I have dealt diligently with both him and the tutor he has at home. And whenever necessary, I will remind both. Farewell, most learned man and most sincere friend, and to me, most esteemed. Greet all the brothers diligently in my name. May the Lord always guide you and keep you safe for us for a long time. Geneva, 6th day before the Kalends of September.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
