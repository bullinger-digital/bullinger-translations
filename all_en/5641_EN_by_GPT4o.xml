      <p>S. D. I now submit the response of my father-in-law to Stancarus' book, as well as my own to Brentius' book, which I mentioned in my previous letters.</p>
      <p>I send them not because I think you need them, but to declare my goodwill towards you in some way, and finally to be admonished by you in a brotherly manner, wherever we seem to have gone astray.</p>
      <p>How concerned we are about Aurelia! May the Lord protect her! Our neighboring Swiss Papists are preparing to go to war in France again.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord with the words of the prophet.</p>
      <p>"Scatter, O Lord, the people who delight in war, and do not hand over the soul of your turtledove to the beast!"</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother in Christ. All of ours send you their warmest greetings, especially my sons, sons-in-law, relatives, and brothers.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe with us for a long time! May our brothers be safe, especially Jonvill, to whom I sent money for books the day before yesterday.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 13, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
