    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Pistorius did not respond to Bullinger's letter [HBBW XVI, No. 2401, from March 31] received in May, because he could not find a messenger due to the war in Germany. Even now, he does not have the time. He was just about to set off from Marburg [to Nidda] when he heard that the Zurich [students] were returning home. So he takes the opportunity to at least greet Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The severe disunity in the [evangelical camp] poses a great danger. The enemy is at the door! It is expected at any time that he will attack from Frankfurt. The pastors in the Nidda region are particularly exposed to the danger. Landgrave Philipp of Hesse relies on the protection of his fortifications, which were reinforced by the poor population. But now they are also supposed to maintain them through taxes, so that they can hardly feed themselves. Can one still hope for God's help then?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] If the rumor of an agreement [of the Schmalkaldic League] with France is true, then that would not be good at all. One should think of the alliance of the Jewish people with the Egyptian king, denounced by the prophets! Pistorius would much rather that the [Protestants] submit to the rod of the Lord, with which Nebuchadnezzar was already chastised and with which now also their ingratitude and transgressions must be punished, than that they enter into an alliance with Egypt, claiming in the name of the Lord that this alliance is necessary to their own ruin. No matter what danger Pistorius is exposed to because of his faith, he knows that it is the universal, true faith. May Christ grant him steadfastness!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] He will answer Bullinger's letter after the war turmoil. And should God allow the destruction of the churches in Hesse and thereby deliver Pistorius from this vale of tears, then he might be able to discuss it with Bullinger in person. Just this much: Bullinger has not really understood the [Eucharistic] view of Pistorius and the colleagues who express themselves appropriately on this matter. He should not confuse them with those who claim and teach things that are inappropriate and of which they understand nothing!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger should report on the state of affairs in Zurich and share his opinion on the war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings, also to the colleagues, especially to Rudolf Gwalther, and a request for prayer. In haste.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, our Father, through Jesus Christ, in the Holy Spirit. The reason, most esteemed Bullinger in the Lord, that I have not sent you any letters until now, nor responded to yours sent to me in May, is solely because, amidst such great turmoil throughout Germany, no suitable messenger could be found, and even now I am unable to respond due to the brevity of time. For just as I was about to depart, it was made known to me that your countrymen wish to return home. Therefore, I could not refrain from at least greeting you through a letter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We are placed in utmost sorrow and danger due to the dispersion, not to say oppression, of the churches of Christ. For as we now have enemies nearby, we are compelled to expect a daily attack from Frankfurt, deprived of all human protection, especially we who profess Christ in the Nidda region. Our prince seems to have placed all hope in fortifications. However, since these are built with the sweat of the poor, and now he tries to maintain them with the blood of the needy through the heaviest exactions, I cannot see what success God will grant.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Nor does the French alliance please me, if indeed the rumor spreads true. For what end the alliance of the Jews with the king of Egypt met, is easily clear from the writings of the prophets! I would rather, if I were consulted, advise that we submit to Nebuchadnezzar, the rod of the Lord punishing both our ingratitude and enormous crimes, preserving true religion, than, if he also tried to persecute us, each would profess in the name of the Lord at his own peril, as would be necessary. Certainly, whatever fate is to oppress me in the profession of our confession, which I do not doubt to be both catholic and orthodox of the Church of Christ! I will persist strongly through Christ, who will strengthen me, in whom all things, without whom we are and can do nothing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I will respond to your letters very amicably, as soon as the war tumult has quieted even a little, or, if it has seemed good to the Lord to allow our churches to be devastated by the enemy, and has delivered me from these evils in this life, perhaps we will speak of these matters in person. For I see that you have not fully understood my mind nor perceived the opinion of our colleagues, especially those who speak rightly on this matter. For I do not wish to join those who affirm what they do not know, and teach what they ought not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>If you can, I pray, let me know in what state your affairs are, and what you think of this war tumult.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Jesus, dearest Bullinger, and greet all your colleagues and each one individually, our common lords and friends, especially our Rudolf, in my name most dutifully, and commend our churches to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in your prayers. In haste, from Marburg, February 18, in the year of our Lord 1547. Johannes Pistorius, entirely yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in both piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
