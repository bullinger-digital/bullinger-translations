      <p>My willing service and friendly greetings beforehand.</p>
      <p>Honorable, dear and faithful godfather. Since you might be wondering what decision was made at our Landsgemeinde regarding the war, know that it was held on Monday, November 24th, and that our opponents in faith, especially the leaders, presented various compelling reasons and causes, arguing that we should rightfully provide and allow soldiers to the king according to the agreement, even if something had happened in France, as that should not hinder it, since any potentate may punish his own as he wishes. They reported that Admiral and his followers deserved death because they had planned to do exactly what happened to him and his group, etc. These and similar reasons, that we should not withhold soldiers from the king, were first presented by Captain Fridli Schuler, then by Vogt Hößli, although he is a papist, he nevertheless spoke wonderfully about the matter and indicated that even if it were true that Admiral and his followers had intended to carry out this murder, he could find no solid ground or credible evidence, and would therefore advise not to engage with the king anymore, since he had not punished them according to the law and had thus grievously broken peace and trust, etc. Then Treasurer Schmid and finally Bailiff Schuler eloquently refuted all objections and reminded the papists not to separate from them, but to consider the peace and new understanding they had with each other since the last discord, with such a question to them: "Dear ones, if it had happened to yours, that is, those of your religion in France, as it happened to ours, and we wanted to withdraw and help slaughter the survivors, what would you think of that?" etc. And then it came to a decision, and the papists, who would have gladly agreed in Zug, had a small majority; but the others, who did not want to allow soldiers to the king this time, had a significantly larger majority, etc. And this is the final decision and response that should be written to the king and also publicly announced in all our churches, namely, since they understood that the king had no foreign enemy, and had also previously claimed years ago that he wanted to use our soldiers at the borders against foreign princes and lords who might threaten the crown of France, etc., but since he had used our soldiers against innocent people of the same faith in his own land and had committed this horrific and shocking act, which they had not expected from His Majesty, and now again requested the Confederates to help him finish off the survivors, they would rather renounce the agreement and have nothing more to do with him because of the cruel act. However, since the agreement stipulates that no place can leave the agreement without the others, and the king would not allow that without right, they would, if he or his hereditary land and the crown of France were attacked, uphold the agreement as well as the other places of the Confederation and show him brave assistance. But if it concerned the faith and especially his own people, they would not send or give him any soldiers, and would also forbid their own in their land this time by oath, life, honor, and property, that no one should ride or go to this war if an outbreak should occur, and whoever violated this should be punished as a perjurer, dishonorable man on his body and property, etc. If this does not please His Majesty, she may renounce the alliances and agreement, and they would also consider it a favor, etc.</p>
      <p>We will then await a response from the king, etc. Then, dear godfather, a guard soldier has just left our land, who reports that the king has moved against La Rochelle with 20,000 men, but they do not want to surrender. In his departure, the news came that the king wanted to move with much artillery against this city and shoot down the rebels. But they think little of it.</p>
      <p>A beautiful and lovely star has been seen by us for several mornings now, which has never appeared before, is larger to see and more sparkling than Venus or Lucifer, etc. Some say a similar star was seen around the time Martin Luther passed away, etc. It is still seen in the sky around noon and moves almost directly north according to our land, etc.</p>
      <p>It is my friendly request to you, that you keep me in your prayers and also otherwise in other ways. You cannot believe in what poverty I must manage my household with my children in the long-lasting hardship; if it lasts longer, I will lose everything that God has advised me. My vineyards have completely failed for 2 years now, and I must still cultivate them at great cost. It would be the least service to me and my children, which you have compared to me in [gracious] [lords], if you would also let me be content with the well-being, only that I also had my own fruit. My [gracious] [lords] have promised me much, and especially how they would give me the core for a good price closer than it goes at the common market; some judgments have also been made about it. But when I come once a year for a small amount, they are so unwilling that I do not know what to do, and now the [Mr.] Obman refers me back to my [gracious] [lords], so I cannot always come from the church, I must pay dearly for my obedience, which another greatly benefits from. They are well-mannered, dear people here, but stingy and unfaithful, so that one cannot improve by them even by a penny or a farthing. I have been among a rough but faithful, dear people, from whom I have benefited more in a month with taxes and daily help than I have in almost 3 years now in Glarus. Everyone takes care of their own affairs, and they let me manage mine with great effort and care. Otherwise, they show me all discipline and honor, I must also record my income in almost 100 places, and if the [Mr.] Treasurer did not provide the nest, who gives it to me out of compassion, you can well imagine how it would go for me in the harsh years. I complain to you as my dear lord and father; for it is not about my person, but about my children, for whom I am doing this. Otherwise, I want to endure gladly and, with God's help and grace, not let my service and work be in vain. I am of good hope, I must not be stuck forever in such a danger of unbearable peace, in which I have now served for almost 17 years since I went to Hirtzel, and with great effort. Others, who have suffered little work and have had good salaries alongside, have been placed in better service, which I do not begrudge them. But I think one should consider equality, etc. All this, dear [Mr.] godfather, I let you know not with bad, but with the best intention, that I also with great haste; for I must send the messenger.</p>
      <p>Greet all dear fathers and brothers for me, and also faithfully commend myself to them. Also greet all yours for me. My wife also greets you and yours.</p>
      <p>Given at Glarus on November 25, 1572. Your willing godfather J... Hugo at Glarus.</p>
