    <p xml:id="regest1">Confirms the receipt of the letter from November 23 [1535] and assures Bullinger of his affection and friendship. Has appointed the recommended individuals to parish offices as far as possible. The delivery of a letter regarding the inheritance matter of the [...] Welter von Blidegg was extremely troublesome and caused considerable costs, as he neither knew anything about the addressee, a von Weiler, nor knew the name of the deceased; the messenger left the letter at [Castle] Lichtenberg. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>I received your last letter, written on November 23, on December 26, my venerable and dearest brother, where it was not necessary to write so anxiously about giving thanks. I love, respect, and honor you constantly and amicably for the excellent gifts of the Lord in you.</p>
      <p>I have supported those you recommended as much as possible and appointed them to certain churches, and I have no greater wish than to gratify you in every way.</p>
      <p>As for the Welter matter, good God, with what zeal I have tried to successfully complete it; but no opportunity has presented itself to me at all. I partly blame Welter himself and you equally, for neither of you indicated anything about the name or place of those nobles from Weiler, nor did the letters addressed to them bear anything of the sort, and I was completely ignorant of the name of the deceased. Furthermore, those letters were delivered to me too late, so that I could not diligently inquire about everything due to the time constraints. However, I sent a messenger to Lichtenberg, to a certain nobleman from Weiler, whom the courier did not find at home, but after leaving the letters there, he returned to me, and because the weather was extremely inclement at that time, I was compelled to pay 12 batzones, as they call them, and would have gladly spent more if it had been possible to make any progress. In the meantime, I do not know, however, what I have accomplished. Therefore, both you and Welter should consider my effort favorably. If any mistake was made here, it was due to your negligence; for if you had written clearly about each detail, everything might have been completed with less trouble but with more successful results.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable Bullinger, and commend me diligently to the Lord, as I know you do. Greet all the brothers and friends, especially the fellow ministers, Pellican, Leo, and especially Theodor. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>TÃ¼bingen, January 2, 1536.</p>
      <p>Greet your dearest wife.</p>
      <p>Truly yours, if anyone's, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his lord and brother, to be especially respected.</p>
