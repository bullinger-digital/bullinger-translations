    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger unnecessarily apologized in a letter to [Philipp] Gallicius for not having received Travers warmly enough during his visit to Zurich last autumn; Travers is rather grateful for the appreciation shown. During a meal with the mayor of Chur [Luzi Heim], where Bullinger was also mentioned, he recounted in the presence of the learned but entirely papist-minded Dean Bartholomäus von Castelmur about Bullinger's sermon on the Transfiguration of Christ according to Lk 9 [28-36], whereupon Castelmur wanted to know whether Bullinger, like "the other Lutherans," denied that the dead could appear in bodily form, although this is evident from this Bible passage as well as from Mt 27 [52f] and 1 Kings 28 [1 Sam 28, 3-25]; however, Bullinger had not commented on this, and from Gallicius, Travers received no satisfactory answer, which is why he now asks for a statement on the question of ghost apparitions. Greetings to Otto Werdmüller, Benedikt Euander, Johannes Pontisella, and the other [scholars in Zurich]; asks Bullinger to take care of his son [Johannes Travers] if necessary.</p>

      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a learned and pious man, pastor of Zurich, Johannes Travers from the Grisons.</p>
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. When I returned from Zurich last autumn, most esteemed Heinrich, a few days later your letter reached our Gallicius, in which, among other things, you seemed to lament that you did not receive me with the humanity that would have been appropriate while I was with you. I conclude, my Bullinger, that you are of such a nature that you strive to bestow excessive acts of kindness and humanity on those devoted to you. I was indeed amazed at your humanity, by which you lowered yourself so much that such an abundance of your affection was shown to me. What did you omit, most distinguished brother, by which you could have honored my presence more? Truly nothing. I owe you immortal thanks for such anxious care and estimation of me; but it greatly distresses me that I am only a burden to you. You should rightly disdain my presumption and ineptitude. However, when I came to Chur and was having dinner with our mayor, there was a discussion about your head; indeed, the mayor himself, overcome by the spirit of truth, praised you. Also present there was Bartholomäus von Castelmur, the dean, a man of much learning, but an opponent of evangelical prudence, a papist, I say, to the core. I had brought up the explanation of Luke 9 about the Transfiguration of the Lord, which you delivered in Zurich on the Sunday I was there, and explained it as accurately as my memory allowed. That Bartholomäus, impatient with your name, asked whether you had denied the bodily appearance of the dead, as all the other Lutherans, to use his word, do. I replied that you had made no mention of that matter at all. Then he said: "Behold, how clear is the place of the bodily presence of those spirits from that chapter and also from Matthew 27 and 1 Kings 28," and consequently concluded from the similarity that the spirits of the dead could reassume their bodies and appear to the living even before the general resurrection of the flesh. There was much debate over this matter during dinner. Later, eager to be better informed on such a matter, I approached Philipp Gallicius to boldly express what he thought about the matter, and he seemed to me to be uncertain in his judgment. Finally, I decided to consult you, the teacher of truth, on what you think about this matter and the spirits that disturb homes and families and fill many with wonder and fear. Therefore, I earnestly ask you, most friendly man, and require with zeal for the truth, to communicate to me in your leisure, based on the scripture, what the genuine sense of the scripture is on such a matter, so that I may both find peace of mind and teach those who are wrongly instructed. You will do what is your duty and a most pleasing thing for me. Farewell. You will greet the magnificent Otto Werdmüller, Benedikt Euander, Johannes Pontisella, and the other scholars and brothers in my name, and if you perceive that my son needs any advice, I pray you to assist and correct him with your kindness. From Zuoz, on the third Ides of March 1544.</p>
