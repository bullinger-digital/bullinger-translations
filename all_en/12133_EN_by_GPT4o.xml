    <p xml:id="regest1">Farel had already written to the [Z端rchers] regarding [Jean Chaponneau]. He opposes the censorship customary among the pastors. Since the not insignificant [Z端rcher] congregation, in contrast to the other congregations that were also asked, has not responded, they are once again asked for their opinion and are again provided with the description of the censorship procedure used in [Neuenburg] as well as the theses of the opponent [HBBW XIV, No. 2023]. - May the [Z端rchers], who had already proven helpful in the past years [1541/42] (when some wanted to expel Farel, the founder of the [Neuenburg] congregation), once again provide assistance to the [Neuenburg] congregation. - Enclosed are the [copies] of the opinions received from the other churches, as these will also benefit the [Z端rchers].</p>

      <p>Previously, Mr. Farel sent you a letter in which he sought to elicit your opinion on a certain controversy that arose between us and one of our fellow ministers. However, since you have not sent us any letters regarding your opinion, we are compelled to write to you again on the same matter and send you a document in which the method we use for censuring brothers is described. This method was opposed by the aforementioned individual with certain propositions, an example of which we are also sending to you. Since we could not satisfy him with any firm and fair reasons, nothing seemed more honest or safer to us than to have this entire controversy resolved by the judgment of the churches, among which yours, not to be underestimated, comes to mind first.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dearest brothers, we beseech and implore you through Jesus Christ to inform us by letter as soon as possible what you think about this matter.</p>
      <p>By doing so, you will make us, already bound to you, even more bound. For we have not forgotten what you did in previous years to help our struggling and declining church. For what could have been hoped for regarding the state of that church, in which anyone could be admitted to the ministry of the word without the consent and vote of the ministers, and from which Farel, a pious man, whose ministry the Lord had founded that church, was disgracefully expelled by the wickedness of some as if he were some kind of mercenary? However, the Lord, in His mercy, wished to remedy these nefarious errors and vices with the most holy admonitions and counsels of yours and the other churches. Therefore, we ask you, brothers, since you have previously begun to bring help to the Lord's church, to now also bring your assistance to it. If you do not do this, we will be surprised; but we trust that you will indeed do so.</p>
      <p>The churches, whose judgment we submitted to, have replied to us. We are sending you copies of the letters so that we may share with you the gifts bestowed upon them by the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for a long time for His church.</p>
