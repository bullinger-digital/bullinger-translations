      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Most esteemed man of God, I wrote to you in recent days and commended to you the cause of Christ, which in our church requires your favor; now, however, I commend to you our Bernardino, who, as you know, at the time when Stancarus and some others were causing me troubles, from which by the grace of God and with your help I was freed, was a faithful companion to me when I came to you. I commend the boy to you. For I know that, where you can do good, you need no man's recommendation; yet the good and simple man asked me to write to you, thinking my recommendation would be pleasing to you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you, do not let his opinion deceive him, but rather let him see that even those undeserving are embraced by your grace. May the Lord Jesus Christ keep you safe for us and His church for a long time, most reverend and kindest lord. Chiavenna, April 24, 1561</p>
      <p>Your Augustin Mainardi.</p>
