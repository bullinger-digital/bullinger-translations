      <p>Your singular love for me and my perpetual respect for you rightly demand that I show myself to be grateful and mindful to you; for I gladly acknowledge that the effort, work, and kindness you have shown me, as well as your longstanding humanity and goodwill towards my father, remain intact and whole.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since your service greatly aids my affairs and studies, it will be my duty, since I can never repay it, to always remember such a great benefit. But I wish that God would grant me the ability someday to demonstrate my feelings for you in deeds rather than words; indeed, I will never fail in my duty and dedication to your dignity. For now, what I can and should do in my absence is to continually pray for your health and safety; in return, I hope, dearest father (for I have no one else to rightly call by this name), that you will persist in your benevolence towards me and allow the book, which you say you have written for the Earl of Warwick, to be offered through me and Hupper, whom the prince has promised to do everything in your favor. Hupper indeed spoke with the earl and received an excellent response; however, since that time, he has not addressed the matter with him, so nothing has yet been accomplished. But you, dearest father, by offering your book, will easily bring the whole matter to a conclusion, provided it is arranged to be offered to the earl through me and Hupper; I ask you to do this as earnestly as I can. Oxford, December 16, 1550.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your greatness, Alexander Schmutz, your son in Christ.</p>
      <p>I would write to you myself if I had not already informed you fully about all matters twice and if I did not have to respond to two very difficult questions here in the college tonight. You will soon receive the prince's letters along with mine. Consider this the title of the Earl of Warwick: To John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, Earl of Warwick, Prefect of the Royal Household and Counselor. I believe you know well enough that the marquis is superior to the earl in honor and dignity. Therefore, place the prince of Dorchester first, whose title you know here to be: To Henry Grey, Marquis of Dorset, Lord Ferrers of Groby, Harington, Bonville, and Astley, Royal Counselor. Farewell forever, most excellent and learned man. Thomas Caius, the archigrammateus (chief scribe) of this city, greets you. In haste, Oxford.</p>
      <p>Johannes von Ulm, devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and kind man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and patron.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
