      <p> That you are uncertain whether the aforementioned spiritual electors have arrived in Ulm, they are not only sent to Ulm but also to their dioceses on this day. Regarding Schärtle, we have heard that he has once again caused trouble in a monastery; it is said that he is slowly moving forward with his servants. We thank you for the friendly request from Mayor Lavantar, and we ask that if we have any new information, we kindly report it to you. In return, we will inform you confidentially from our side that yesterday our young cousin, Landgrave Wilhelm of Hesse, etc., had his own servant, a nobleman well known to us, his dear chamberlain, with us, informing us that Duke Moritz, Margrave Albrecht, and our aforementioned cousin have over 35 companies together and over 4000 horsemen, have taken Augsburg weeks ago, have surrendered to the confederate princes, and all three princes moved on the third day with three strong companies, equipped with 52 cannons or guns, which were not yet mounted on wheels, which the emperor had recently made or cast. These were given to the Landgrave at the beginning of their L. Geb; for they are repairing their torn and broken fortresses (caused by Charles V) with great seriousness and cost. The aforementioned electors, Mainz, Cologne, Trier, have sent their troops to the Three Leagues and warlords and have promised, agreed, and signed that they will not provide any help to their party and Charles, likewise the Bishop of Würzburg along with the chapter. However, we have little faith or trust in their written promises and oaths. What has been heard from us regarding these matters and what has been answered cannot be written down at this time (also for length reasons). This news should be accepted as true and sufficient in secret and with patience; you will soon learn other and more news daily. Remember, if God grants us more health (here was a setback), as we hope. </p>
      <p> Meanwhile, many good and sensible people are greatly concerned about the confederate princes, fearing that your Confederates themselves and the initiated negotiations will suffer a great setback, as they are allowed to gather in Durge, a very large force is running to the emperor, and there is no open and free passage as of this day. However, one will not believe it until they suffer harm. Entrusted to God. Acted in ill ndt. in letters. </p>
