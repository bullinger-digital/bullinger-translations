    <p xml:id="regest1">That Bullinger enabled Lavater to study [abroad], that he continues to advise him and even expects frequent letters from him, proves his great interest in him. Lavater did not answer Bullinger's previous letter [not received], as it did not seem necessary to him and he did not want to be a nuisance with his letters. But now he has understood that he should write more often.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Regarding the [later] letter [not received]: Bullinger should not worry about Lavater's faith. No one could dissuade him from it. He understands [Martin] Bucer well. Since his return from the [Second Regensburg Religious] discussion, Bucer has been giving public lectures on the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- According to Bullinger's wish, Lavater also read Bullinger's letter to the Englishman John [Hooper]. He was very pleased with Bullinger's pious response and the sympathy expressed to him in the letter. He sends his regards. Lavater has not met [Hooper] in [April]. He also does not know where he is currently staying.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- He cannot report to Bullinger how Councilor [Mathis] Pfarrer reacted to Bullinger's letter [not received], as Pfarrer was not at home when Lavater delivered the letter. However, Lavater informed his wife [Euphrosine, née Brant] at that time that he was staying with [Matthias] Zell.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Lavater is pleased to hear that Bullinger and his family are doing well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger is right to admonish him not to attend too many lectures, as this leads to mental confusion. Accordingly, Lavater limited his choice of subjects, and although he knows how much Bullinger expects from him, he endeavored during this school year to mainly develop his language and literature knowledge as well as his rhetorical skills, even if he does not learn much new during the actual lessons, as in his class the material from previous years is essentially repeated. But now he attends the lessons of Gerhard Sevenus on Cicero's "De partitione oratoria" and of [Johannes] Sturm [on argumentation]. However, he does not know why he should stay in Strasbourg after the school year ends. Not that the lessons bore him; on the contrary, he would have liked to have started his studies in Strasbourg earlier. Rather, he fears that his father [Hans Rudolf] will not allow him a long stay abroad, although he would like to study other subjects besides linguistics (which are also offered in Zurich), such as mathematics. It is also well known that interdisciplinarity is beneficial for theological studies. Bullinger should find out how long Lavater's father will allow his son to study abroad. Accordingly, he should inform how the studies will continue.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and the whole family.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Written in the house of [Johannes] Marbach, near the [Church] of St. Nicholas.</p>

      <p>S. P. D. Although your dedication towards me has already been made known to me through many things, as the unique patron of my studies, I have especially perceived it in this: partly because you have not only been the principal figure for me in undertaking and entering into the path of these studies, but also because you encourage me with your letters to continue in the course of studies I have begun, and partly because I understand that my letters do not seem verbose to you; therefore, unless I love you in return, I would be very ungrateful. I did not respond to your previous letters because they did not seem to require a response; moreover, I did not want to be a nuisance to you with the multitude of my letters. But now, since I understand that you desire my letters, I will fulfill the duty of writing with the frequency of letters rather than with the excuse of interruption.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>And, to come to your letters first, regarding religion, do not expect anything else from me than what I promised to provide you when departing. I say, as I have always said: there is no danger concerning my faith. No one is troublesome to me in this regard, nor would it be a great praise and ample spoils even if they were to conquer me. Nor have I yet seen what they can bring forth from the sacred writings to establish their cause. As for Bucer, I am not so dull as not to understand what he says, where everything tends, or what he is planning. Recently, having returned from the assembly, he began to publicly interpret the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I read your letters to John the Englishman as you requested. He was pleased with what you wrote, and he praised the piety he perceived from the letters and your goodwill towards him, and he instructed me, if I were to send you letters, to write greetings to you and to thank you on his behalf. However, I do not know where he is currently staying. I have not seen him at all this month.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You wonder what Councilor Pfarrer replied. At that time, he was attending to the helm of the republic. Therefore, I could not deliver the letters to him personally. However, I gave them to his wife and told her, if she inquired about the messenger, to say that I was staying with Mr. Matthias. Therefore, I am not quite sure what his response was.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I was pleased that you wrote in a friendly manner that your father and your family are in good health.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Finally, you advise me to be cautious not to disturb my intellect with the multitude of lectures. You advise well, most esteemed father, for I too have been able to feel that the multitude of teachings and such a variety of matters distract the minds of learners; therefore, I have changed somewhat. I know you require much from me and promise you great things about myself. However, this year I can only acquire a solid knowledge of dialectics and rhetoric. For during this time, the things that were entrusted to those listeners last year have been repeated in the class, so that I could listen with little benefit and have almost no certain lectures. Now, however, Mr. Gerardus Sevenus, the teacher of the first class, has most learnedly begun Cicero's rhetoric, "De partitionibus oratoriis," and Sturm's dialectics. Therefore, if the year is completed, I do not see why I should remain in Strasbourg any longer. It is necessary then to taste other disciplines as well, which illuminate theology, which I think can be done more conveniently elsewhere, where life is also less expensive. For in our gymnasium, apart from the fact that the rudiments are most faithfully taught, I do not see what it does not have in common with other academies. But how necessary the knowledge of disciplines is to him who hopes to achieve some fruit in theology, there is no one who does not see! Therefore, I beg you (to whom the care of my study has been entrusted by my parent, and who have willingly undertaken it) even for this reason, that you promised patronage, to also consider my studies in this part (for your encouragement, your voice, and authority with my parent are very influential), and to diligently inquire how long he wishes me to be abroad, so that I may know how I should shape my studies. For I fear that little time will be granted to remain away from home. I mention this not because I am weary of studying in Strasbourg (I wish I could have come to Strasbourg a few years earlier and could stay longer, unless a different way of life seemed to demand it), but so that you can give advice in time and inform me about this matter as much as you are allowed to know. For if I knew that there would be no space and leisure for other arts, having laid the foundations, I would turn to mathematics, leaving dialectics and rhetoric (whose use is great and necessary in all parts of life).</p>

      <p>Farewell. Do not disdain to greet your wife and the whole family in my name.</p>

      <p>Yours sincerely, Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. Zürich.</p>
