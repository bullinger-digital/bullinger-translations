    <p xml:id="regest1">Although the commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians turned out shorter than that on the First, it should be considered that the demanding task always compels the commentator to a certain degree of thoroughness. Even if the work cannot meet all expectations, Melander should still defend the author against unjustified criticism.</p>

      <p>In the preface to Heinrich Bullinger's commentary on the Second Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians addressed to Dionysius Melander.</p>
      <p>Perhaps I was more lengthy in examining the previous epistle, so we will provide more succinct comments on the latter. Meanwhile, let everyone consider for themselves how many and how great are the observations that should be made by somewhat more diligent commentators, and that these cannot be resolved in a few words. For in many places, a different reading must be explained, and which of these is more genuine, but also everywhere it must be noted what the force and propriety of certain words are, what the inconveniences of the speech are, what tropes, what figures of speech, how the more obscure, shorter, and more confused statements can be explained more clearly, more copiously, and more plainly. Then, what is first and foremost required in commentaries, the context of the speech must be observed and ordered even more scrupulously, the author's purpose must be investigated, it must be indicated how each argument is referred to the purpose, what is inserted incidentally and what is said by digression. Sometimes the sense must be rendered by paraphrase, the vigor and ardor of the speech must be shown, but also commonplaces must sometimes be treated, which it will suffice to have noted several times, and it must also be noted what the use of those things that have been disputed is, nor should it be omitted if anyone has abused them. For truth must be asserted, and falsehood refuted. What, moreover, is the benefit of sometimes reviewing the opinions of others? But who, I ask, has treated all these things briefly? Therefore, those who sometimes publish more copious commentaries deserve pardon. There are indeed those whom brevity has commended to many, but they have either noted only the sense in a few words or certain figures or commonplaces or have published notes and, as it were, certain fragments. You will find very few who have observed and treated all these things more diligently in writing commentaries. I do not say this because we have provided all these things in our commentaries, but because the work itself has grown greater in our hands than expected. It will be your task, most excellent Dionysius, to defend our faithfulness and diligence against the insolent calumnies of some and to support us laboring in the vineyard of the Lord with your perpetual prayers.</p>
