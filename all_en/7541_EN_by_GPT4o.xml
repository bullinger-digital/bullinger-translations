      <p>Indeed, what I should write to you, my father, I do not know, since Tretius can be a very long letter to all of you there.</p>
      <p>I also have doubts about the discipline, whether it can be introduced into this church so late. I believe that only our Bohemian brothers at this time are the ones who maintain it; about whom I have written a commentary in these days, which, if you wish, I will also send to you and yours to read. I agree with you about the origin of the Waldensians; but ours are different from those, who did not originate from the Poor of Lyon, but from Hus, and indeed here from Wycliffe the Englishman.</p>
      <p>May the Lord help you all, so that you may complete what you have well begun. Friesland is burning with wars, to devastate which large Spanish forces are said to be descending. The German leaders are assisting the Prince of Orange. I see, my father, that the time is now approaching when the arrival of our liberator is to be expected. Come, therefore, Lord, quickly and free us from these evils.</p>
      <p>Farewell for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Heidelberg, July 24, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes a Lasco. To the most noble theologian Heinrich Bullinger, as to a father to be revered.</p>
