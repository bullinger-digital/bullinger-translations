    <p xml:id="regest1">Caroli has found refuge in France, where he will strengthen the reservations against the evangelical doctrine. Also, [Guillaume] Bigot, who was encouraged in faith by Grynäus, could become an opponent under the influence of the cardinals who secured his pardon. The disunity of the Bernese pastors is convenient for the money-hungry Bernese and damages the reputation of the Gospel; Myconius urges Bullinger once again to take action against it. He is well aware of his insignificance. Knows nothing of the negotiations of the Confederates. [Erasmus Alber] has been called to the Margraviate of Brandenburg, Bugenhagen to Denmark. Requests a statement on Bucer's justification offer. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I hear that Charles has been received in France, as the king heard him protest against the Lutherans. I do not know if this is true. It is certain that the followers of the gospel are not heard worse by him for any other reason than that he thinks they do not have the right understanding of the divinity of Christ. If he has now received him, as a noble and pious man reported to us today, I fear he would not be coldly indifferent. The same person affirmed that Charles is almost delirious, from which some divine that what he does, he does not do with a good conscience. Indeed, I do not know what the matter is. As long as he was with us, he acted in such a way that I would have sworn he was a good man. I write this so that you may fear with me that France has someone who will deter more and more from receiving the gospel, and this indeed against the sentiment of my mind.</p>
      <p>Also received is Bigot, a man great in philosophical knowledge, a poet, skilled in languages, meanwhile a soldier and a murderer, for which reason he has so far lacked the king's favor. And he was received by the favor of certain cardinals. While he was here, he began to learn beautifully about Christ from Doctor Grynäus; now, after he has felt, indeed fully received, the favor from those men, I do not know again what to think. I fear he is now another who, having left the knowledge of the truth, will introduce a hindrance among the French. I wish I am not truly divining!</p>
      <p>Regarding the dissension of the Bernese brothers, I again ask you to apply diligence; for today I receive the most cruel news about them. They have factions and they support them, no exhortations to unity in the sermons, so that those who come from elsewhere say: "What kind of gospel is this?" Furthermore, it is known that in France it has become a proverb "the Bernese gospel" because of certain anxious money devourers, whose manifest avarice and insatiability are attributed to the dissension of the brothers; in what way, you will easily divine yourself. The Savoyards also complain, where a penny was to be given to the duke, now two must be given, and there is nothing that can satisfy the prefects; they always thought the Bernese cultivated justice beyond others from the doctrine of the gospel, now they feel and see much differently, what kind of gospel is preached to them. These things with you, so that you may have something to write to them, which may provide some kind of stimulus to move them - not that you lack what to move them with, but because I think you do not know what I am saying.</p>
      <p>As for me, whoever thinks I am nothing, thinks rightly. I know myself, and the more diligently I inquire into whatever I am, the more I am forced to say what I have said. May God have mercy on me.</p>
      <p>I know nothing about the Confederates, except that they are miserable. Furthermore, the Elector of Brandenburg has sent for a preacher of the gospel to the Landgrave; he immediately went to the March. Some hope is conceived from there. Pomeranus, called by the King of Denmark, has moved, and Luther has been restored to his place, that is, he has been made a pastor again.</p>
      <p>You surely know about the letters that Bucer wrote to the Bernese senate for his purification. I would like to know what you think here.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily with your wife and children. I wish all the brothers well.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 26, in the year 37.</p>
      <p>Your Myco.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most learned brother in his most revered Lord.</p>
