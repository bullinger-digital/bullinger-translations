    <p xml:id="regest1">Accompanied Capito and Bucer to Bern with Grynaeus on the council's orders, where Bucer, as the accompanying document attests, was able to dispel all reservations regarding his behavior in the concord issue; although Bullinger unfortunately did not attend the meeting, his subsequent approval will contribute to overcoming the division. Upon their arrival, the visitors were presented with a grim picture of the conditions in Bern, as the disunity among the theologians had given momentum to the Anabaptists, rebellious peasants, and other opponents; after the successful mediation between the people of Bern, Strasbourg, and Geneva, it is now important that Bullinger restrains potential troublemakers within his sphere of influence and demonstrates the leniency necessary for the sake of unity.</p>

      <p>Gryn√§us and I were together in Bern with Capito and Bucer, as ordered by our council, after the people of Strasbourg had requested it. Our mandate was to act as mediators if the situation required it, which we did to the best of our ability. Bucer did not want to be poorly regarded by the Bernese as venerable friends, as if he had acted against the debate, in which he had fought vigorously, or against the synod, whose decrees Capito had written, or against the common confession, which we all composed together, or as if he had been treacherous in the matter of concord. Therefore, he excused himself in many ways and thus satisfied both the council and the brothers, for which he also took away a sealed testimony of the bear, a copy of which I now send to you. There is no doubt that you will approve it. If only you had been present at the proceedings, so you could have seen how sincerely it was conducted in this matter! On the journey, it was often said among us: "Surely Bullinger will be present, called by the Bernese brothers; for then nothing would be more perfect." But disappointed in our hope, we continued and brought the matter to the point you see. Consensus on the cause of the Eucharist was strengthened, and the former brotherhood was, as it were, renewed. I indeed think that God was in our midst; the appearance was so terrible at first glance. Now, if your support is added, there will be hope that the churches of Christ will be without schism. Here I would add an exhortation; but because there is no need for it with you regarding the truth, I say only this: Consider what has been done, so that you accept it as the truth, as it is, and everything will be secure.</p>
      <p>I will explain this dreadful image more explicitly: After we had entered the Bernese territory, the brothers came running, raising their hands for our arrival and, after giving thanks to the Lord, said: "Unless your presence removes the discord that is in our church, it is over for us and the gospel. For the Anabaptists are rising anew, the peasants threaten murder, they look to the goods of the church, adulterers, pensioners, papists raise their heads. Hence, there is no peace for us; dangers have surrounded us so much." Then, when we came into the city, the same song about murder was plainly sung not only by the common people but also by the senators. The captured Anabaptists, led as prisoners, moved both minds and mouths more, so that they spoke thus: "What is this matter? Those good people are led in this way, and there is no worthy cause. Why is it not done in this way with our priests, who openly sow such dissensions in our church and republic," etc. See, my Bullinger, the appearance. What do you think we thought and consulted here? First, the bad suspicions against the people of Strasbourg had to be removed, then common concord had to be established, then the fury of private discord (which is most pestilent) had to be calmed; finally, the people of Geneva had to be brought back to the right path. But the Lord accomplished all these things in such a way that all good things seem to be hoped for in the future, provided we invoke Him, who gave such a desired end, to continually look upon us and keep us in duty. Then also beware, lest there be evil instigators who try to rekindle the extinguished fire. Therefore, I beseech you by the Lord, apply diligence, so that the evil of discord does not rise again among them and is also avoided among us; for if you do this with the authority you have, you cannot do better. Similarly, prohibit any of yours from pouring cold water. For I have understood, whom some have made a refuge for themselves. What kind and how great they are, it is not fitting for the church to dissent, but rather to overlook innumerable things, so that unity can be maintained. Indeed, I do not doubt that, when this has been done, it will soon come to pass that overlooking will no longer be necessary. Let there be concord, and the Lord will be among us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger, and greet your wife and the brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 4, in the year 37.</p>
      <p>Your Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of Christ, his dearest lord and brother in the Lord.</p>
