    <p xml:id="regest1">The messenger [...] delivers the remaining pages of the [“True Confession”]; it has indeed become a bit long, but this could not be avoided. Bullinger sends a copy to [Thomas Blarer] and sends his regards. He requests that the other four copies [of the German or Latin version] along with accompanying letters be forwarded to [Hans] Welser, Claudius [Pius] Peutinger, [Wolfgang] Musculus, and Georg Frölich with the next messenger to Augsburg; he also sends a copy to [Martin] Frecht. - Bullinger thanks for the news about the Diet [at Worms], about [Charles V], and about Landgrave [Philip of Hesse]. Does Blarer have any news about the Council of Trent? What if the beast shows its strength and with its three horns (which symbolize the spiritual, imperial, and royal power) stabs the believers? But God will defeat the beast; therefore, Bibliander has published the [“Faithful Report”], which Blarer will soon see. - Blarer should write more often and let Bullinger know if he still owes him any messenger fees. - Regards. - [P.S.:] The Latin translation [“Orthodox Confession of the Church of Zurich”] by Gwalther is also printed.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>The messenger here will give you, my most esteemed brother, the remaining pages. You might have suspected that much more is still missing from your side, which is why you wrote that you prefer us to be more concise; and indeed, we are quite lengthy. But in such a significant matter with such varied arguments, how, I ask, could we have been shorter? We too would prefer everything to be shorter. I am sending a copy to your brother Thomas, whom I ask you to commend me to, and you will convey my most dutiful greetings. I beg both of you not to disdain these small gifts. Please send the remaining four copies along with the letters to Augsburg with the next available messenger. I have written to Hans Welser, Claudius Pius Peutinger, Wolfgang Musculus, and Georg Frölich, to whom you should also commend me. I am also sending a copy to our Martin Frecht, etc.</p>
      <p>For the information you have consigned and shared from a friend's letters about the Diet, the emperor, and the Landgrave's affairs, I give you my greatest thanks. But what do you have about the Council of Trent? What if the three-headed dog and the three-horned beast were to exert their greatest strength here and with a triple row of teeth grind the flesh of the saints or with the trident - spiritual, imperial, and royal - power pierce the faithful?</p>
      <p>But the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, blessed God forever, lives, who will eternally pierce the accursed beast. Bibliander has published a book against the beast that is not to be regretted, which you will soon see.</p>
      <p>Please write to me more frequently; for in the last 3 months, you have written only once or twice. If there is still something outstanding, dear, let me know. If there is anything else, I do not know it anymore. You should not incur any costs or damages on my or our behalf, etc.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 16th of March, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Our Latin response was made by Gwalther, which is also printed.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Ambrosius Blarer, pastor of the church of Constance, dearest brother. Constance.</p>
