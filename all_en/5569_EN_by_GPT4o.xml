      <p>May God the Lord grant you and us all a good and prosperous year, etc.</p>
      <p>When Brother Kaspar arrived yesterday from Lindau, he was informed for certain that the Emperor was already in Strasbourg and would stay this Friday in Freiburg im Breisgau, then return, etc. In Feldkirch, a Frenchman was seen with 30 horses or more along with mules; it is said that he is the son of the King of Navarre; Brother Kaspar could not find anyone to tell him where he was going or had ridden to. Also, Master Lutz, a locksmith from Lindau, who recently returned from France, reported how miserably the evangelicals in Paris were burned, drowned, hanged by the feet, and thus drowned with their heads in the water; the chief watchman in Paris was beheaded and dragged around the city by his feet, and finally burned; in total, more than a third of the men in the city were banished or killed. Paul David from Basel (who was a very wealthy goldsmith in Paris) was approached by men, saying that if he gave 300 francs, they would ensure his safety for the sake of his faith, and when he paid the money, he and all his people were banished to Antwerp the next morning with the indication that they would let him enjoy his spent money; otherwise, they would also have him killed. He had to leave his possessions and goods, worth more than a hundred thousand guilders, behind.</p>
      <p>The poor evangelicals were not particularly harmed among the Germans; but those who were rich had to suffer or flee. Regarding the cities in France, things are otherwise fairly well according to the circumstances (according to his report), and he believes the Huguenots are still holding firm, as many have left. This little bit of news, along with the wish for a good and prosperous year, I wanted to inform you of, thus commending myself to you. Your willing servant, Remigius von Schauenstein.</p>
