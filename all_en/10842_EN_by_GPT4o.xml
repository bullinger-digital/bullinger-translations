    <p xml:id="regest1">As in the past four years, numerous Zurich pastors have had their benefice income withdrawn or reduced, the council demands clarification. The affected pastors are therefore to be requested to submit reports on their situation, the causes of the deficiency, and possible remedies by the eve of the synod [of May 9]. Requests notification to the dean in Uster [Utz Eckstein].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Since there have been complaints among many brothers that in the past four years their designated benefice income has been withdrawn and they have nothing to sustain themselves, and are therefore forced to leave the parishes, I have presented the complaint to my lords, indicating the damage that has resulted, etc. In response, they have instructed me to thoroughly investigate who these persons are. For if the benefice income remains, is not withdrawn, and there is a reasonable provision, they will let it remain; but where there is a clear deficiency and the provisions (income) are withdrawn and the designated competencies are not paid due to the disfavor of the feudal lords, they should report themselves.</p>
      <p>Regarding this, it is my opinion and request that you inform not everyone, but only the brothers for whom it is relevant, as mentioned above, of my lords' opinion and ensure that a report is prepared by them, explaining the following points: 1. What is the situation with the pastors, who is the feudal lord, and what is the church's capacity; 2. What and where is the deficiency, what and how much has been lost, who has disputed it, and how it has been lost; 3. Indication of how the matter could be remedied, and where it (if available) could be taken from.</p>
      <p>When such a report is prepared, send it to me immediately, or bring it at the latest to the synod on May 8, which is Monday after the May Day; although, if possible, sent before the synod, I will then present it to the appointed ones as instructed.</p>
      <p>May the church of Christ be entrusted to you in faithfulness.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, Friday after Easter 1536.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger. Also inform the dean in Uster, although I think he has none under him.</p>
      <p>To the pious and faithful Johannes Stumpf, dean in Bubikon, his dear brother.</p>
