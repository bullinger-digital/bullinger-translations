      <p> S. D. Your illness, most esteemed lord and incomparable friend, torments me for many reasons, both because I grieve for your situation and because I sorely miss your learned and most delightful letters. But we must bear what we cannot change. All things are in the hand of the almighty Lord who loves us; He governs all things according to His good will, and indeed for our salvation. We must always pray to the Lord to recognize this. I send to your piety our Consensus and that of dear brother Calvin, and I do not doubt that it will bring you the greatest joy. Before it was published, it was seen by several distinguished men from England, Prussia, France, Italy, and Hungary, and they did not disapprove. Therefore, it seemed right to publish it, especially now when our adversaries are organizing everything against us. I also send you the Fifth Decade of my sermons on the Church of Christ against the Church of the Antichrist, on the ministry and ministers of the church against the false bishops, on the faithful prayer of the church against superstitious prayers, on the sacraments in general and specifically against the merchants. I hope that in these, especially in the fourth sermon on the sacraments, I have done something worthwhile and that those who condemn us as heretics and sacramentarians will understand their error, etc. I also discuss the various institutions of the church in the tenth sermon. As they are, I know I have now offended the papists more gravely than ever before; thus, I hope I have gratified many with pious reasons. But I await your most exact judgment on these matters. What do you think will happen?</p>
      <p> Will we be called to the council or not? But we will be called. Should we go or not go? Who would go to the enemies of Christ, not to advocate for the truth, but to hear the most unjust sentence of condemnation? But more on this soon. What news do you have about the people of Magdeburg? Live and farewell eternally, most illustrious man. ZÃ¼rich, March 8, 1551. You have long understood that the assembly is to be held tomorrow in Baden; our delegates are Lord Consul Lavater and brother Aescher, etc. May all the brothers and fellow ministers be safe.</p>
      <p> Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p> I beg you, lord, not to neglect our cause to be pursued in Poland on account of Lord Florian's debt.</p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Lord Joachim Vadian, most worthy consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p> St. Gallen.</p>
