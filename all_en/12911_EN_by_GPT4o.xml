    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger may forgive this hasty letter. Blarer has been suffering from diarrhea for two days and is bedridden.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The situation with the [southern German] cities is as Bullinger writes [not preserved]. May God have mercy on them and restore them! Bullinger should pray that the people of Konstanz do not succumb to temptation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] From the latest letters from the Strasbourg council and Martin Bucer, it appears that the city will have surrendered in the meantime. Bucer is very upset about this. He, along with some others, resisted energetically but in vain. However, the city is said to have received the best peace terms of all the cities. Wolfgang Rehlinger was strongly intriguing in this matter. A few weeks ago, he also offered the people of Konstanz to advocate for them in Ulm, but the council did not pursue it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer thanks Bullinger for his judgment in marital matters. He fully shares his opinion, but others disagree with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger's offer regarding the matter concerning [Hans] Widenhuber is unnecessary. Blarer is satisfied.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] At the moment, he cannot report anything certain about Landgrave Philipp of Hesse. However, he does not believe that he is acting against [the Schmalkaldic League], even though it is reported again that he is inactive and hunting daily near Kassel with the young [Karl Viktor] of Brunswick. Reports from various places, including Augsburg, claim that he has allowed Martin von Rossem and Count [Otto] of Rietberg (both of whom are said to have been defeated near Bremen by the Hanseatic cities) to take Brunswick and Westphalia in the name of the Emperor. But that can hardly be true, for otherwise, he would be in a really bad situation!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blarer has received the two bundles of letters. Sebastian Schertlin (who is still in Konstanz) is currently forwarding them to Augsburg. Enclosed is another letter that must be delivered to Bernardino Ochino in Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Blarer has not yet learned what the Zurich council communicated to the Konstanz council. In any case, it is also heard in Konstanz about the two battles [at Rochlitz], in which Duke Moritz of Saxony narrowly escaped capture. King Ferdinand I also almost fell into the hands [of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony], had the attack occurred a little later. Bishop Julius Pflug, Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg, Landgrave [Christoph] of Leuchtenberg, Count [Georg] of Helfenstein, and others were captured. The Elector is said to still have over 30,000 mercenaries and 5,000 cavalrymen. May the Lord give him strength and fortify him. In the Elector's camp, only one notable man fell, namely Lord Wolf Dietrich of Pfirt, who was, however, a poor man! The battle is said to have lasted eight hours. Perhaps Bullinger already knows about this, and it will also be detailed in the aforementioned letter from the Zurich council. However, Blarer will only be able to learn the content of the letter later if he does not want to miss the messenger [...] who is to deliver the present letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Duke Ulrich of Württemberg has again sent a messenger [...] to Blarer through his councilor [Johannes] Knoder. He wanted to know about the surrender of Konstanz, especially since he heard that the Emperor had granted the city a good peace. He also asked to be informed about the Swiss Confederates and their current diet. Last Thursday [March 24], Blarer answered these questions in writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The current difficult and unstable situation is puzzling! The people are dissatisfied and could soon become violent, especially if the Emperor were to withdraw his garrison troops in case of need (as he is hardly able to recruit new mercenaries). Peter Scher the Elder of Schwarzenburg wrote to Blarer that these troops have brought an epidemic, and that many people are dying of a head disease around Hohenasperg and at other of their stationing locations.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Blarer regrets the dissatisfaction that overcame the Zurich councilors after the return of their envoy Georg Müller from Konstanz. He does not know the reason for this. He will try to find out from his brother [Thomas] and his cousin [Konrad Zwick]. It would be most regrettable if the Konstanz council opposed a good plan. May God guide the authorities for the good, so that they do not stray from His path!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Blarer thanks for the information about the two [pastors Joachim Gachnang and Johannes Gisling]. May the Lord protect His church from such wolves!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Bullinger should pray for Konstanz. Greetings. Blarer's wife [Katharina, née Ryff] sends greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler]. Blarer has still not visited his brother or his cousin. In haste.</p>

      <p>All the best I can manage. I have been bedridden for two days and have had severe diarrhea, which is why I am not well. Please forgive my miserable writing, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The situation with the cities is as you wrote about. May God have mercy on them and restore what has fallen, and sustain with His fatherly hand what still stands upright, so that it does not also fall! Pray earnestly and with faith for us, that we do not also fall into temptation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding Strasbourg, according to the latest letters from my lords and also from Bucer, it seems that it will now be over with them. Bucer is very upset. He, along with others, has done his best, but could not succeed, although the conditions are said to be more tolerable and milder than those imposed on all others. Wolfgang Rehlinger has been very active, and a few weeks ago he also offered to advocate for us in Ulm, but my lords have not taken it up at all.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Thank you for your diligent judgment in the marital matter. I am very pleased with your opinion, as it was also my opinion beforehand, but others have given a different one. I do not know what else to do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Regarding Widenhuber, it is not necessary. I am quite satisfied.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Regarding the Landgrave, I cannot write anything certain to you, especially since I do not believe that he should act and deal badly with ours. It is reported again that he is safe and at ease, hunting daily in Kassel with the young man from Brunswick. He also allows Martin von Rossem and the Count of Rietberg, who are said to have been defeated near Bremen by the Hanseatic cities, to take the land of Brunswick and Westphalia in the Emperor's name. This is written from more than one place. And it was also written in this manner from Augsburg just last Tuesday. If it were a matter I would gladly believe, I would consider it entirely true, but I cannot believe it until I must. For if it is true, it will go worse for him than for all others!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The two packets of letters have reached me. I hope they are already on their way to Augsburg through Mr. Schertlin. He is still here with us. Also, I am sending you another letter to the pious Bernardino. Please deliver it to him in Basel.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I have not yet heard what your lords have written to ours regarding the news. Perhaps it is only now being discussed in the council. But news of the two battles has arrived a few days ago, and that Duke Moritz narrowly escaped, and the king himself was also supposed to have come to the town. They would have been caught if they had not started the matter too early. Julius Pflug, the honorable bishop, was also captured along with Margrave Albrecht and the Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, along with the Count of Helfenstein and several others. The Elector is said to still have 30,000 foot soldiers and 5,000 horsemen together. May God give him strength and fortitude to accomplish much good, as it still looks quite even for him. May the Lord ensure that fortune is not squandered again! The pious Elector has said he will give all his life and goods to the beloved Gospel of Christ! May the Lord strengthen and always sustain him in this! No one of note has fallen except Lord Wolf Dietrich of Pfirt: He was a miserable man. The battle is said to have lasted up to eight hours. But perhaps you already know all this beforehand, and it is perhaps in your lords' letter to ours as well. I could not delay writing until it was read to me. I was concerned I would miss the messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Duke Ulrich has again sent his own messenger through his councilor, Doctor Knoder, who must always be present everywhere, up here. He wanted to know from me how things stood here regarding the reconciliation. For the Duke had heard that we had been accepted with very good conditions. He also asked again to be informed about the Swiss Confederates and the current diet; however, there is a misunderstanding, as he thought the diet had already begun. I answered last Tuesday as much as I knew.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I cannot understand why all this is happening. The matters are difficult everywhere. They have a sandy, slippery ground on which they cannot stand long. The people are dissatisfied everywhere, and it is to be feared that there will soon be unrest when the foreign troops come away, as they are now hastily returning home and the Emperor is in need. For if he is in trouble, he cannot get mercenaries anywhere who are willing to march. Also, my brother-in-law Peter Scher writes to me from Württemberg that a great plague has come into the land through the foreign troops stationed there, and that it is raging fiercely around Asperg and wherever they have been stationed, with a pestilential head disease. Thus, what the sword leaves behind, the plague must strike. Lord God from heaven, let all this lead to our improvement!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>That you write to me in confidence that your councilors have received some displeasure after Master Jörg Müller returned home, etc., I am sorry. But I know neither the beginning nor the end of it. I care little about these things. But it would be a true sorrow to me if something good were to be hindered by my lords, so that it does not come to fruition. If I could improve anything about it, I would do it with utmost loyalty. I will speak with my dear brother and cousin when I come to them, to see if they might tell me something about it, as much as is appropriate for them. I pray to God from the heart that He may guide them and all authorities powerfully in the strength of His Spirit to all good, and that they may not stray from His ways in these severe temptations and bitter adversities, but may always find His pleasing and best will and stand firm against all the gates of hell and be preserved.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Thank you for the information about the two you know of. May the Lord God graciously and soon deliver the churches from such wolves and build them up for the best through faithful godly servants!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>May the Lord God be praised temporally and eternally. Praying for us without ceasing, along with yours. Greet your dear household with all good lords and friends. My dear wife wishes you and yours all the best and good. I have not yet been to see my dear brother and cousin. Dated in haste, March 26, 1547, Saturday.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother and most venerable and dear friend. In Zurich.</p>
