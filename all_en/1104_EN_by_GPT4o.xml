      <p>Greetings in the Lord. This is the fourth time I write, but I do not know if you have received any letters yet; however, you will receive them shortly, for the letters have arrived by chance, not by deliberate effort. The people of Magdeburg remain steadfast; soldiers are flocking to them, whom they do not wish to accept, for they do not want to burden themselves with impious soldiers.</p>
      <p>They have inflicted great damage on Mecklenburg and overturned the blockhouse. Then the duke's brother claims the regions for himself, which the warrior brother has held until now; perhaps he acts deceitfully, so that the people of Magdeburg or other cities do not destroy the duke's villages and small towns with fire.</p>
      <p>It is said that the Emperor is enlisting soldiers and will send them as reinforcements to the dukes opposing the people of Magdeburg. He pretends to have business in Hungary with the Turks; but who will believe that? Until now, he has been accustomed to extracting money from everyone under that pretext.</p>
      <p>What does this mean? Two miles from Basel is the place or prefecture of the deceased Salamant, where it is forbidden for the peasants to sell pigs; they are supposed to slaughter them in their own houses under a heavy penalty. What do you think the followers of Ferdinand are planning?</p>
      <p>We are also involved because of internal dissensions; otherwise, we would easily resist these people who trouble us daily.</p>
      <p>You will shortly receive Grebel, perhaps from Froschauer; for the book is enclosed in his vessel along with knives. In England, it is said that there are consultations about imposing the gospel on the French, and the king wants to forgive all the money that the French owe him for many years, at least so that the French may accept Christ into their dominion. Then he will establish a perpetual alliance with them, etc. We will perhaps hear more certain news about this shortly. Basel, December 7, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
