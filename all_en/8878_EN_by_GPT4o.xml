      <p>Our greetings to you, honorable and dear friend. We have received your letter along with the booklet you recently had printed, and we have noted your humble inclination and the sharing of the mentioned booklet with us, for which we are graciously thankful. In return, we are inclined to consider you with grace and all good things. We also hope that the Almighty will fatherly share His blessing and grace, so that your work may bring fruitful benefit to His long-contested church in these troubled last times and may lead to prosperous salvation and welfare everywhere. We do not wish to conceal this from you, whom we commend to the protection of the Almighty, so that you may continue to serve the church of Christ fruitfully for a long time. We remain graciously well-disposed towards you.</p>
      <p>Dated Heidelberg, April 24th, in the year 1572. To the honorable, our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, servant of the church in Zurich.</p>
