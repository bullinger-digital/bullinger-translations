      <p>Greetings. For this particular reason, most esteemed Bullinger in the Lord, I wanted to write to you now, so that the one who delivers this may have the opportunity to receive letters from you in return. Otherwise, there is nothing at present that greatly requires writing, except for this one thing that my wife asks me to write. She indicates to me that she desires you to lift the child she carries in her womb from the sacred font of baptism, if it is a boy. This intention of yours has become known not only to my wife but also to some others, and finally, through my wife's indication, it has been communicated to me; which I embrace in you as candid and sincere with the greatest eagerness. However, we wish to know what you will do if the Lord gives not a boy, but a girl. In that case, we would wish your most honorable wife to become a godmother to us, unless it would be more troublesome than she could bear due to her frail body. There are still about 8 weeks remaining until the time of birth. I beseech you, write in the meantime what you think should be done. If the Lord gives a boy, we already choose you as the godfather; if a girl, let us know what you would like to do then.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, my affairs are tolerably well, except that I have not yet fully recovered from the feverish illness that seized me after my wife and children were restored to health. However, there is hope that soon I will be fully restored to my former health. Farewell excellently, dearest of men. Greetings to your most honorable wife and your entire household in my name and that of mine.</p>
      <p>Bern, the last day of July 1549.</p>
      <p>Also, greetings to our Gervasius, whom the Lord may console in his widowhood in exile.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian M. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, dearest lord and brother in Christ. In Zürich.</p>
