      <p>I received yesterday for the first time your three booklets on justification.</p>
      <p>I will soon have one elegantly bound, which I will offer to the Duke with my own hand, the second to Brenz, and the third I will devour myself, for which I give you the greatest thanks. Everything here is safe and peaceful. Du Moulin, Frecht, and Volmar send their regards to you. The first will have a very sharp speech tomorrow in the schools against the beast, indeed, which has even corrupted civil law with its decretals. I know that many will grumble; however, to appease them, I will immediately have it printed with my preface.</p>
      <p>Human prudence often advises me to be silent and to rest, not to provoke and stir up greater envy for myself; but the spirit immediately comes and disrupts those plans. We are not our own, therefore, even if I most wanted to be silent, the Lord would not allow it.</p>
      <p>I am now engaged in the matter of the Antichrist; you have helped me with your commentary on the Epistle to the Thessalonians, from which I have drawn much. But I was displeased that Calvin, in the exposition of those words "unless the rebellion comes," disagrees with you and all the ancients. I have followed your opinion.</p>
      <p>You write that wonders are reported there about our Germany; but we, who are here, hear nothing of these or certainly not such things that should be commended with the word "wonders"; either we are sleeping here, or false things are reported to you. I am indeed (for many serious reasons) negligent in investigating such things; but if wonders were happening, even unwillingly, I would be forced to hear. Peter Martyr has finally prevailed and will remain in Strasbourg. He recommends Emanuel to me, a professor of the holy language, if he could have a position here, I will make an effort. I received from you two letters from the Bishop of Bayonne and I thank you; three days ago I sent some writings to him, which he will soon send to you. I wrote that your Beatus returned safely from Hungary to Regensburg; then where he went, is unknown. Having completed the booklet, which I am preparing on the Antichrist, I will tackle a somewhat unclean matter, namely on brothels, in which I can remarkably attack the papacy.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well with the whole family, school, and church. Pray for me, which I greatly ask of you. Tübingen, February 26, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zürich, honorable brother. In Zürich.</p>
