    <p xml:id="regest1">[Johannes] Fries is to be appointed as the head of the newly established theological school in Lausanne. They hope to recruit Euander as a Hebrew teacher. Caroli will teach the Old Testament, Viret the New Testament; during their daily lessons, the headmaster will explain the Greek text. Many French-speaking pastors greet the Burgundians in their sermons; God's Spirit will likely soon become active among them.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord! We have established a school in Lausanne and a theological lecture. Therefore, we will need directors on both sides who are learned and educated, especially a headmaster of the school who knows the French language: for this position, we will undoubtedly call Johannes Fries from Zurich, unless it is denied to us by you. We will ensure that he has a stipend and reward worthy of him, namely, one hundred gold coins of our currency, or thereabouts. Thus, the salary he receives from the Church of Zurich can be transferred to someone else.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we will diligently seek to have a professor of the Hebrew language. If only Euander would come to us! Caroli will provide the Old Testament, and Viret the New Testament theologian. For each, there will be a daily public lecture, where the headmaster will interpret the Greek text on both sides. Moreover, our ministers of the French language greet the Burgundians in many places in their sermons, whom we hope God will soon visit with His Spirit. Farewell, my dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 15, in the year 37.</p>
      <p>Your entirely, Megander.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger and Leo Jud, directors of the Church of Zurich, his dearest brothers in the Lord.</p>
