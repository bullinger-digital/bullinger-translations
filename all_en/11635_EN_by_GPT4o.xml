    <p xml:id="regest1">There is hardly enough time to confirm the receipt of his letter; regarding the situation in which the Emperor [Charles V] finds himself, he has again been informed of what he has already communicated; in Germany, measures against the Turk [Suleiman I] are indeed being discussed, but there is no talk of moral improvement. In Myconius’ house, a son of Fridolin Ryff has fallen victim to the plague. He can only thank Bullinger for his efforts. A Basel resident met Christian [Wirth] and Konrad [Suter] in Augsburg, who were supposedly on their way to Tübingen. He wants to help the widow recommended by Bullinger. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. There is hardly enough time to confirm the receipt of your letter. Regarding the Emperor, I have again received the information I recently communicated. It is still uncertain whether he has been captured or besieged. Frequent consultations are taking place throughout Germany against the Turk; there is no talk of moral improvement.</p>
      <p>The plague is still raging. Tomorrow will be the eighth day since a young man of good hope, the son of Fridolin Ryff, a senator, was carried out of my house. I await what more God wills.</p>
      <p>You undertake labors to gratify me, for which I give you immortal thanks; for what else can I do unless the Lord offers an opportunity sometime?</p>
      <p>A certain resident of Basel was in Augsburg a few days ago; he reported that he saw and greeted Christian and Konrad there, and that they said they were going straight to Tübingen. This is for you.</p>
      <p>For the widow you commend to me, I will be most ready to bestow whatever good I can, in your name.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more, nor can I do more.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your wife and children, with Theodor, Pellican, and others in the Lord. Pray, I ask, to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 16, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his brother in the Lord, to be respected.</p>
