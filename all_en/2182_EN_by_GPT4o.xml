      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Behold, once again, our most beloved lord and brother in Christ, our relative Rotenbergius comes to you from your Gotthard to demand the debt. Indeed, he is slower than I had believed in explaining that which he nevertheless promised to do. I believe that rich soul is richer in spirit than in purse, however it may be, I pray that you will be willing to assist in that payment of yours, and remind him to keep his promise, etc. Furthermore, regarding the matters of our daughter-in-law with the most honorable Zürich council, I urge you for the sake of our friendship, that they may be brought to a conclusion. For she has decided, due to the almost inevitable necessity of her body, to go to the Baden Baths at the beginning of spring, and then to return to her homeland; for thus it seemed to all of us, and Bullius of blessed memory also instructed her to return to her own after his death. Therefore, use all the strength of your eloquence and all the zeal you can, so that he may be released by the council under whatever conditions you can; for he will not remain with you. But these things are for your bosom. I certainly have no news to write, except that there is a rumor spreading in Saxony and other surrounding northern regions that a great army of cavalry and infantry is being secretly assembled, but whose name is not yet known; there are those who think that Margrave Albrecht is planning such things with the support of the French. Whether this is true, I do not know. May the Lord grant His church... peace and refuge with all tyrants extinguished, who lay traps for us. Farewell with all your pious colleagues and all who sincerely wish for the promotion of the truth of the true word. From Lindau, February 7, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Hieronymus Pappus.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
