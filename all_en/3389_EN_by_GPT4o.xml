      <p>Greetings. I read your letter, reverend father in Christ, with great pleasure; for from it, which is quite lengthy, I could easily perceive that you have not yet abandoned your love for me, as you spare no effort to educate me on matters that can be of great use to me at some point and also provide significant assistance in managing church affairs well. However, I must confess, I am amazed that you can endure such great labors, as it is believable that you allow no idle time, dedicating it entirely to writing. But where, in the meantime, are your labors that you devote to delivering sermons? I would advise you to ease up a bit on the diligence of your studies and take care of your health, if your pious and learned labors did not also greatly benefit us, your students. Therefore, I do not wish to deter you from such a holy purpose; but if it can be done without compromising your health, which is certainly of utmost concern to me, I further encourage you to hasten to complete the remaining commentaries on Jeremiah and thus continue to serve the church of Christ in the best possible way.</p>
      <p>For your writings to me, etc., and also for the volume of homilies on Jeremiah, I give you immense thanks.</p>
      <p>I certainly embrace and cherish all your works as treasures. If I had anything to explain about Italian affairs or could find out anything from others in any way, believe me, dear Bullinger, I would not spare any effort, but would execute everything most diligently; however, everything is silent with us. I certainly know that the matter of Ferrara is not settled, but all signs point towards peace, mainly through the intercession of the Venetians, as reported by Friderich von Salis, whose letter I received today, etc. He asserts that the Venetians are very concerned both on land and sea and are remarkably diligent in preparing their troops and cavalry stationed inland. The more prudent among us infer from this that they fear wars might break out closer to their dominions. This is from Friderich von Salis.</p>
      <p>Indeed, as I heard from our consuls, there is great hope that the matter of Ferrara will be settled shortly.</p>
      <p>The sum of money is large, which the imperialists demand from Ferrara; it is still mentioned to this day. Thus say our consuls.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Italian persecution, I have no certain information, and in such a short time, I could not explore anything certain, etc. It is astonishing how the French, who passed through here, insulted the pope.</p>
      <p>Everyone I have heard so far curses him. And Beatus Wilhelm von Bonstetten claims to have heard from the mouth of the Duke of Guise that he said he would bid a long farewell to Italy and would not wish to return until his king, better instructed, would take up arms against the pope himself, and in that war, he would serve his king for free. I do not doubt that if things had gone well for the French in Italy, they would have been much more ferocious under the pope's auspices and indeed would have committed many more atrocities against Christians. Now, with his forces somewhat weakened and broken, he might restrain himself from his usual persecution and be content with his own France, not coveting foreign spoils, lest he, like Aesop's dog, also experiences with great harm what happened to him. Certainly, when I think to myself how often small beginnings have brought destruction to great kingdoms, when, as you write, the cup of divine wrath began to be passed around, I can also understand that if the fatal necessity were now impending over the French (what if it is also over us?), this prelude would have enough weight in itself for a just overthrow. There is no need to respond to Leodevico Mantovano.</p>
      <p>We find many such curious and novelty-loving people among us, and almost the less educated some are, the more confidently they undertake new things. While I was reading your letter, he himself came over, but not a word about these questions with me. I likewise pretended, etc., and I do not doubt that he harbors some monstrosity; but if he attempts anything, we will meet him in time. Frölich passed through here, then also Fuchsberger, and most recently the Duke of Anjou; the remaining leaders passed through here on horseback a month ago. The French places have sent a delegation to France (for they sent the decrees of the last Lucerne assembly to us). For there are 13 companies in Piedmont; they are supposed to have received no pay for 7 months. All power is to be given to the Bishop of Orléans; but if the Swiss envoy does not find money and decision with him, he is to ride to Piedmont and dismiss the soldiers from their oaths, etc., with the promise that if they withdraw immediately, they will ensure that they are paid. So much for this.</p>
      <p>I have never written anything in my life more hastily; I was not given any time to reread (delay). Forgive me, I beg you, for your kindness. More another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your entire household and church.</p>
      <p>I received your letter late; this is the reason for the haste, Chur, November 2, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your countrymen greet you.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>Beatus Wilhelm von Bonstetten is beginning to feel better and, as we hope, will fully recover soon. You should inform his aunt of this, so that perhaps his relatives are not worried, if you can, by indication. The one who delivers this letter to you is yours and has come from Italy.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you can learn something from him, etc. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant president of the church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
