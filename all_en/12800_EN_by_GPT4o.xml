    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger thanks Blarer for the letters that have just arrived from January 7 and 11 [No. 2743 and No. 2746]. He can only reply in haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The capture of Frankfurt is bad (apparently not just a rumor!). Even worse would be a failure of Augsburg. Then Strasbourg would also be lost. But even if Saxony and Hesse were to capitulate, one must remain confident, as [the Reformation] is founded on God and His eternal Word. Now Dan 7, [21] ("The horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them") is being fulfilled. Furthermore, one now understands what it means to trust not in princes, but in God [Ps 146 (Vulg. 145), 2f], and to build Solomon's temple without hammer and axe [John 2, 19-21]. Ultimately, the Lord will still rule over the enemies with the scepter of His power from Zion. His Word is most effective precisely when everything succeeds for the enemies. This was already observed during the Babylonian captivity. Daniel also prophesied it. However, it is also true that the majority of humanity sides with the devil. Therefore, Christ already wondered whether He would find faith on earth upon His return.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] So be confident in the Lord! He can even physically save His own [from danger]. If He does not, they are ready to die for Him, for even then He will triumph. He no longer needs hypocritical Christians! Now the gold must be separated by fire. Hallowed be God's name! May the Antichrist perish!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] After the believers have endured their suffering, those who now submit to the antichristian, shameless, and cunning Emperor Charles V will suffer for all eternity [Dan 8, 23].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer should remain steadfast. [The people of Constance] should not surrender, otherwise they would have to take in the devil, the pope, and the priests again. Even if no one comes to their aid, the Lord can save them, as He once saved Bethulia from Holofernes and Jerusalem from Sennacherib. If He does not, then better to die! As long as Hezekiah relied on the ruler of Egypt, his situation was hopeless.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] As soon as the Zurich councilors learn of the decisions [of the assembly in] Baden, they will inform the people of Constance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Currently, only the following can be reported: Firstly, that Emperor Charles V sent the Confederates a flattering letter on December 27, 1546, to the day in Baden, which Bullinger himself has read. In it, the Emperor expresses his friendship to the Confederates. They need neither to arm nor to raise troops. The war has no religious motive; he only wants to bring the followers of the outlawed princes [Elector John Frederick of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse] back to reason. Among them is Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, whom he wants to bring back to obedience, without harming the neighboring Confederates. With this letter, he deceives several Confederate places. He also announces an ambassador [Jean Mouchet] from Burgundy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Secondly, it is reported that on the evening of January 11 [François de La Rivière], the envoy of the French King [Francis I], arrived in Baden. More details about his mission are not yet known. According to a letter also read by Bullinger from Colonel [Wilhelm] Frölich in French service, Francis I is to request 14,000 Swiss mercenaries. He has already armed 18,000 French and Gascons and is currently recruiting 6,000 Italians; he plans a campaign against the Emperor in Italy. However, in Bullinger's view, he will abandon this plan as soon as he learns of the disgraceful capitulation of the Germans! If he still proceeds, nothing can be expected from this "Egyptian" king.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Enclosed are two letters with a request for return. One [HBBW XVIII, No. 2673] is from Baldassare Altieri, the secretary of the ambassador [Edmund Harvell] of the English King [Henry VIII] in Venice. The other [HBBW XVIII, No. 2733] is from the capable Englishman John Burcher. Also enclosed is a letter for Johannes Haller. If Blarer cannot safely deliver the letter to Augsburg, he should burn it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] In great haste.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace, patience, and strength grant us God, etc. Beloved brother, I write to you this response with the utmost thanks for your faithful, diligent report. For I have now received your two letters, the first on January 7, the second on January 11.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I am particularly troubled by the bad news about Frankfurt, if it is true that it has been taken (I always hoped it was just a rumor). It would trouble me even more if Augsburg were to fall. Then it would also be over for Strasbourg. Now, in the name of God, even if Saxony and Hesse were to fall, we have nothing to rely on but the living God and His eternal Word. That cannot fail us; indeed, it will be fulfilled as Daniel 7 says: "And the horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them," etc. We now see what it means: "Do not trust in princes, in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation"; and that God's temple, the true Solomon's, is built without hammer and axe. "The Lord will send the rod of your strength out of Zion, to rule in the midst of your enemies." For when our and God's enemies have everything they could wish for, then the Word will truly rise, as in the Babylonian captivity and as it is said in Daniel, although the majority will remain with the devil, so much so that when the Son of Man comes, He will hardly find faith on earth, Luke 18.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Therefore, my lord and brother, let us be truly comforted in the Lord, who will not forsake us. If He wills, He can deliver us, even delightfully; if not, let us confidently surrender to the hand of God with His grace and pour out our souls for the testament of Christ. God will and shall triumph in the martyrdom and death of His beloved, who remain with Him. He no longer wants hypocritical Christians. "Gold is tested by fire." "Hallowed be the name of the Lord!" "May the name of the Antichrist be confounded!"</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Those who now shamefully submit to the antichristian, cunning, intelligent propositions of the Emperor will first be plagued without end, once they have overcome the believers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Dear one, be steadfast! Do not surrender! Otherwise, you must take back the devil, the pope, and the priests. Receive God rightly, and even if no one comes to your aid, the Lord, if He wills, can deliver you as He did Bethulia from Holofernes and Jerusalem from Sennacherib. If He does not, then it is more honorable for you to die in a heap with God and honor. As long as Hezekiah looked to the king of Egypt, his situation was hopeless; Isaiah 30:3, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>My lords have not yet received any news from Baden. As soon as we have something definite, it will not be withheld from you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Aside from the two points, we have: The Emperor has written a wonderfully smooth letter, which I have held and read myself, with the original, his seal, etc. It was sent to my lords on the day. In it, he promises himself; says we need no armament or exception; he is our friend; wants to let us remain, hold firm, be a gracious lord, etc.; he does not pursue faith; only brings to obedience those who follow the princes who are banned and outlawed; therefore he also wants to bring Württemberg to obedience, though, although it is our neighbor, without harm to us, etc. Dated at Heilbronn, December 27. With this letter, he has deceived many or several of the Confederate places, that they believe in him. And some kind of embassy from Burgundy is still to come. It will still report, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The other is that on Tuesday night the French envoy came to Baden. We still do not know what his mission is. But Frölich, the king's chief captain, writes here. I have also held the letter in my hands. The king requests 14,000 Swiss. He has armed 18,000 French and Gascons. He takes on 6,000 Italians to lead into Italy against the Emperor, and it is said to be certainly true. But I think when the king hears how shamefully the Germans submit to the Emperor, he will also withdraw. But if he proceeds, what salvation from the king of Egypt?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Here you have two letters. Send them back to me. Baltazar Alterius is the secretary of the English king's treasurer in Venice. Burkerus is English and a student. Send me the letter directly to Augsburg Haller. If you cannot do it directly, burn it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Dated January 14, 1547. In great haste. God be with you forever. The Lord will deliver us. H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his beloved lord and brother, Master Ambrosius Blarer, preacher in Constance.</p>
