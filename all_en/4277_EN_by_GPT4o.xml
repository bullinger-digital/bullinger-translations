      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most illustrious Friedrich, and I also showed it to the most honorable council, regarding what you wrote about the 20,000 who are said to be enlisted in Mailand, possibly to be led to Tripolis. They wish to hear if you have learned anything more certain about where they are to be led; for I think we Swiss must diligently watch over our affairs, as there are those who claim that some unknown schemes are being woven against us. From England, we hear that religion is proceeding happily, but many fear that due to the nearby Scottish war, England might become entangled.</p>
      <p>From Frankreich, we have nothing certain yet about how the sedition, stirred up by some unknown parties against the Guises, has been settled. You perhaps now have more certain information.</p>
      <p>We are quite well here and wish you, yours, and all our friends and brothers to be well. ZÃ¼rich, 4th of May, 1560.</p>
      <p>I wrote in great haste, as I heard rather late that our Jordan is present, whom I commend to you. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, the most honorable commissioner of the Grafschaft Chiavenna, his esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
