      <p>We do not think, most esteemed fathers and brothers in the Lord, that the horrendous and by far the greatest calamity of the French churches needs to be explained to you, not only because we admit that we lack the words to adequately describe those tragic outrages, but also because we fear to reopen our wound with a new recollection. Nor do we doubt that you have already heard the whole matter by mere rumor, that is, the cruelty unheard of in all previous ages, and have shuddered at the hearing of those things which we ourselves have seen and felt to a great extent. This one thing we will say: with a sudden attack on our churches by the treacherous and conspiratorial enemies of the Gospel, a massacre of the pious was carried out to the tune of many thousands of people, their possessions plundered, their temples overturned and set on fire, the preaching of the Gospel forbidden, and finally, with bloodshed spread throughout all of France, we have, by the greatest benefit of God our Savior, survived many and various dangers and have finally arrived here as if on a few planks from such a shipwreck. And if anything could be added to such a calamity, this private misery would also be added to that common one, that almost nothing is left to us except life itself.</p>
      <p>These things, most esteemed fathers and brothers, we mention, first so that we may commend to God in your most holy prayers the ruins of so many fallen churches and ourselves, and then to ask you, for that Christian charity which we have so often experienced in you, to assist our brother and fellow minister, Mr. Ricaldus, who has delivered this to you and will narrate the state of our affairs in detail, with your authority, grace, and counsel towards your magnificent and most honorable council. For he has been sent to it with mandates by many noble French families.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we earnestly beseech you to kindly listen to him in detail, especially those things that pertain to the embassy, and to deign to interpose your efforts. Furthermore, if, led by your favor and pious exhortations and especially by its own charity, the magnificent and most honorable council alleviates our poverty with its liberality and refreshes the suffering members of Christ with Christian compassion, you will have done a deed most worthy of your piety and clemency. May God, the Father of mercies, through His only-begotten Jesus Christ, perpetually bless your labors and promote them to His honor and the edification of the church, and may He confirm your most ample and truly Christian republic with His spirit, protect it with His defense, and enrich it more and more each day with an abundance of all good things!</p>
      <p>Geneva, December 4, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient brothers in the Lord, the French ministers rescued from the very jaws of lions, Perillatus, Theopsaltes, Quinsonus C. Valerius in the name of the whole assembly.</p>
      <p>To the reverend men and most esteemed fathers and brothers in the Lord, the faithful ministers and doctors of the church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
