      <p>Greetings. Yesterday I received your letter written on the 17th of this month.</p>
      <p>You will see the conditions of peace sent to me by a friend, which I share with the lords and the most honorable senate. I also beg them not to be upset if the usual pension is paid to them later than I had thought, because the king wants to dismiss the foreign soldier, which is a great burden to him, and because the human mind can hardly rest and follow more peaceful counsels. Many dream and write much about the thoughts of princes; but it is the Lord who moderates their counsels and turns everything to His glory and the salvation of His own, and contains and restrains the furies of men. As for the matter of the guest Ciconia, it will not be my fault if he is not safe and his post remains after others have been ejected and removed. I can promise nothing certain yet; but what I can and will understand, I will inform you. Your envoy, who is at the Diet of Augsburg, on the 13th of this month and other envoys dined with the king's envoys and are well. There is not good agreement among all on the article of religion.</p>
      <p>You know that due to the truce made with the Turk, many refuse money. The King of Bohemia is sent to that kingdom by the Emperor to demand money; the same is urged in Austria by Archduke Ferdinand. The Archbishop of Mainz and the Archbishop of Trier are there; the Duke of W端rttemberg is taking care of his health at the baths; the Palatine is excused by the concerns of the recently offered electorate, the Duke of Cleves by ill health, I do not know what excuses the Archbishop of Cologne. The Saxon princes cannot be present because of the Muscovite, who has occupied a good part of Livonia. The Duke of L端neburg is marrying the daughter of Elector Margrave Joachim; neighbors are gathering for these nuptials. The Turkish Emperor is preparing great forces to invade and oppress his younger son Bayezid, who, disobedient to his father, strangled his governor and others. He is in the army with thirty thousand horsemen and many foot soldiers and cannons, and pretending to attack his brother, he wants to become the lord of Egypt. God allows furies and demons to wander through the world, to torment the unbelievers, while in the meantime the good enjoy peace, which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of the world's storms.</p>
      <p>I commend your son to you and to Mr. Martyr and Gwalter and myself to their prayers.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love us, as you do.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, April 20.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>It will be more convenient for the guest to purchase the clothes for your son, which he will indicate as necessary.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Z端rich. In Z端rich.</p>
