      <p>Greetings. Since the courier is now ready for the journey, I am compelled to write very quickly, most illustrious man and father in Christ, highly esteemed, especially to fulfill your request by sending back the writings from Wittenberg. We are very pleased with them and we give thanks to the Lord with you, who in His great mercy has granted us such agreement. On the other hand, I hear that the people of Strasbourg and their followers elsewhere are in turmoil. It is said that Jacob Andreae and Brentius himself are preparing their writings against these, although there is a rumor that the latter passed away last month.</p>
      <p>Narpachius and Flinner were recently in Basel; but I hear they were not received in the spirit they had hoped for and were immediately dismissed as disturbers of the church and returned home. It is also reported that Mr. Hospinian was forbidden by the theologians to teach anything about the Lord's Supper or justification, but he offered himself for a public disputation and the matter was referred to the senate, and he was granted free speech in these and all other articles against Sulcer and other adversaries.</p>
      <p>No sensible person should be offended by the rite of many churches, in which the custom of private confession and absolution is maintained; for in proposition 104, they list the reasons why it is retained, which have nothing in common with the papists' torture and superstition, and that rite is part of external discipline, which is freely observed in those churches. Mr. Blasius is still tormented beyond measure, although the Lord grants him admirable patience, which he demonstrates with remarkable virtue. We expect his passing at any moment, and to finally beseech the Lord for this, you will join your prayers with ours.</p>
      <p>Farewell. The consuls, Leo, and all the brothers greet you respectfully. Greet in our name all the brothers who are with us.</p>
      <p>Given hastily on September 5, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted in humanity, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church in Zurich, his friend and father in Christ, highly esteemed.</p>
