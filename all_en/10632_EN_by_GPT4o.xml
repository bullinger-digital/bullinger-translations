    <p xml:id="regest1">Interprets the emergence of the Anabaptists as a punishment for the contempt of the Gospel. A new conflict has arisen between Z端rich and the Five Cantons because the Z端rich bailiff in the Free Bailiwicks, [Itelhans] Thumysen, rejects the compulsion to attend Mass and the invocation of saints in the oath formula. Encloses a letter from [Hans] Vogler with news from Holland. Myconius is to urge vigilance so that Strasbourg does not become a second M端nster. Has heard nothing about an abduction [of the Duchess of Savoy] by the Castellan of Musso. Sends him a confidential copy of his letter to Bucer [above No. 562], which Bucer apparently took badly.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You never leave my mind, dearest brother, even though I do not write frequently. As you suspect, the corrupt morals of this age threaten destruction to the world, I too believe they lie at our doorstep. The Anabaptist plague may perhaps have been sent by the Lord himself, to punish the ingratitude and insolence of the world in the manner of the Huns and Goths. And if this is quelled, either a Moor or a Turk or some Getulian will emerge. Our crimes must indeed be punished. For some persecute the truth, others despise it when preached and understood. Would not the most just avenger prepare some millstone for such a perverse age?</p>
      <p>Today we are despised and afflicted in wondrous ways by our Philistines, the Five Cantons. They attempt to prescribe laws to our prefect, that is, they command that the prefect, who is ordered to administer justice in the name of our city to the bailiwick of Wagental, compel attendance at Mass, name saints in the oath, etc. See what impudence this is! Our senate responded with great constancy that it would by no means permit this. The prefect himself, Itelhans Thumysen, freely testified before the envoys of the Five Cantons that he would by no means do this. Therefore, a new conflict has arisen for us. What it will eventually lead to, you can easily guess. In short: All the impious think of eradicating Christ and his kingdom. But they will only succeed as much as Zechariah predicted they would in Zech. 12. We are a stone of testing.</p>
      <p>What I have from Holland, you will read and return the paper. Vogler wrote, Vadian sent it.</p>
      <p>What you wrote about the Hoffmannites greatly distresses me. You know what kind of city they inhabit. If they were to win, it would be the ultimate loss for the Gospel. Therefore, you will encourage good men, if you know any, to be vigilant, so that Strasbourg does not become a second M端nster.</p>
      <p>I hear nothing about the abduction by the robber of Musso.</p>
      <p>You will keep the copy of the letter sent to Bucer for yourself alone. He is very angry with me for this, I think; for he has not written even a word to me so far. But I would not care much, since a faithful and free response could have offended. But consider these words as spoken to a stone and return the copy with the next sure messenger.</p>
      <p>Farewell along with all the saints. Utinger wishes you well.</p>
      <p>June 19, 1535.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
