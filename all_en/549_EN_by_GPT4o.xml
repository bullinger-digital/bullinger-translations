      <p>For the benefits you have bestowed upon me, most upright and learned Bullinger, I am most grateful and will gladly repay them if the occasion arises. I am sending a package to be delivered to you, which I believe was received from Poland, along with a German imperial book from my collection; for none is found for sale here. I intended to add Josephus, but the coachman seemed unwilling to accept even that small package; however, it will reach your kindness soon. Farewell and continue to love me. June 4, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Frobenius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Bullinger, the most faithful preacher of the divine word in ZÃ¼rich, his much esteemed master.</p>
