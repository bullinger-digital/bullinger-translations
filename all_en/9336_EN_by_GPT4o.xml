      <p>Greetings. The matters that make you anxious, brother, also greatly distress me; but what can you do in a situation that depends on so many votes, not one of which is within your power?</p>
      <p>Therefore, I turn to the help of God and pray that He Himself will govern this dangerous business. However, I assure you to be secure about the previous letters; I have shown them to no one, not even our closest friends, and to be certain that no danger is created for you from them, I have certainly torn them up, and here I have inserted a fragment in the middle.</p>
      <p>I received the later ones today along with those you enclosed; but I saw none pertaining to the treasurer, to whom you say you wrote extensively.</p>
      <p>So I approached him and asked; he says he received nothing from you. He sends his regards to you.</p>
      <p>I understand him to be speaking about a certain preacher, I think from Thusis, a brazen and dark-complexioned man, who was seen repeatedly in court to inspire the judges and to act with remarkable audacity. As far as I understand, he has no negative opinion about you. The point is that people should be directed to remain steadfast in their stance, acknowledging that every court should punish its wrongdoers justly, not with violence, spears, and helmets; that every accused should be allowed to come to a decent and impartial court and defend themselves, and then the judgment should proceed. Such is granted to thieves and murderers instead of evil, when it is said, 'I do not want to hear you,' etc.; likewise, that neither the sovereign nor any foreign lord should be interfered with, and everyone should be left with their justice untouched, etc. All this seems to me neither unreasonable nor unjust. If it turns out from the accusations after their given response that they are scoundrels, then they should be dealt with as scoundrels. If they have equal rights to justice and thereof, their goods will be well treated and judged against them as against villains, and then no one can protect them, as those who are not allowed to come to justice, etc.</p>
      <p>These are few words. From France, Belgium, Poland, and Germany, nothing.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with you and your family. Greet all our friends, etc. What was done in your synod? What about that Ganthner? May 29, 1573.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I had indeed begun to wash, but I am forced to stop; I cannot bear it.</p>
      <p>I am afflicted with the most severe pains of the bladder and urine, honor be to your ears, and no advice from doctors helps in the slightest. I hope the Lord will free me from this misery through this means; but may His will be done. - I will write about the book of Scipio Laelius another time. I write this in great haste and in poor health.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor in Chur at St. Martin, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
