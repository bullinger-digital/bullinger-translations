      <p>Greetings and best wishes. If I have not responded so quickly to your excellence, let it excuse me; for nothing presented itself that I could write about. Should I have written to you about the punishment of the wretched French, whom I know to be most humane? And if those who thirsted for blood have had their fill. We hear many things from August, but I know that everything is already known to your excellence.</p>
      <p>From Rome, it is understood that the Pope, indeed raving as they write, is raging furiously against many books, the catalog of which I send to your excellence and ask that you return them to me afterward, so that I may share them with friends in France. If I learn anything else worthy of you, I will not spare my effort and pen.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I wish her to fare happily.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur on the first day of February 1559.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellence, Jean Jacques de Cambray. To the most distinguished man, excellent in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>For I would have written to you about the punishment of the wretched French, whom I know to be most humane, and if those who thirsted for blood have had their fill... From Rome, we understand the Pope, indeed raving as they write, is raging furiously against many books, the catalog of which I send. Chur, 1st February 1559.</p>
