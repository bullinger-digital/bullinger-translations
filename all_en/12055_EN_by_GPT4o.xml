    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's letter has filled Meyer with hope and joy; his wife [Regula Meyer?], the bearer of the letter, can report more; Bullinger should advise Meyer on how best to present himself to the synod in order to regain the favor of the brothers; as a penitent, he feels that God has forgiven him; may people also forgive him! He will remain in his position until Christmas; afterwards - since the [Count Palatine Ottheinrich I.] must withdraw to Heidelberg [and thereby many concerning changes will arise] - Meyer intends to move on; perhaps Bullinger can help him find a position with his fellow countrymen (if not in the region of Zurich, then perhaps in Bern or Basel); Bullinger should write to him about what to do; Meyer's wife is waiting for the conclusion of the synod. Bullinger should also reconcile him with [Hans Rudolf] Lavater and [Hans] Wegmann; tongues have indeed caused much harm; greetings also to Theodor [Bibliander], [Kaspar] Megander, [Rudolf] Gwalther, and Erasmus Schmid. Bullinger's commentaries on the Gospels are highly praised by the scholars in the area; Bullinger's greetings to the currently absent Adam [Bartholomäus] have been conveyed; he has recommended Bullinger to the Count Palatine.</p>

      <p>To his most holy Bullinger. Greetings through Christ.</p>
      <p>I live and am well in mind and body through the Lord, dearest Bullinger, who comforts, sustains, and protects me in a wonderful way. I have conceived great hope for my affairs from your letters, soon to sail into a happier port. Although at first they were quite bitter, they have become sweeter - as is the way of sincere friends - and have brought much joy. I have now written other, perhaps more pleasant, letters through my wife. This is the message; and what the letters do not teach you, you will learn from the mouth of my wife.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will be brief. I earnestly beseech you, with your outstanding guiding wisdom, to help me, who is ignorant, in what way the synod should be approached, so that I may again return to favor with the best brothers and obtain reconciliation. I have written, as you see, to the holy assembly. If you have better advice, give it; if anything needs to be changed or added, let it be done; for the time has passed which I imposed on myself as a place of repentance, now that I know and feel and do not at all doubt that I have returned to favor with our Lord God. Forgive me, O people! For thus I think, and I hope it will happen soon.</p>
      <p>I will remain in my position and place until the Lord's Nativity. Finally, I will depart willingly for this reason, that - the most illustrious prince departing with his duchy to Heidelberg - a new face of the kingdom's duchy has arisen. It is to be feared that with the movement, a sadder face of many things, both of the bundles and of religion, will follow than has been so far. Therefore, if you know a place suitable for my character and a worthy province among my Swiss - if not now in your field, at least some place either among the Bernese or the Basilians - I will prepare myself most honorably and diligently. Also, write back about what needs to be done.</p>
      <p>For my wife will await the end of the brothers' congregation. You will greet the best and most prudent men of the senatorial order, Lavater, the city treasurer, and Mr. Wegmann, and soften them in my favor and the sweetness of former friendship. A petulant tongue has instilled much in the most beautiful minds, which at some time, when they see, will have been quite bitter words against me.</p>
      <p>Finally, may your family, the church, the most holy senate, the best brothers, Theodor, Megander, Gwalther, Erasmus Fabritius, be well. Farewell, the port and breeze of my affairs. May our Lord keep you healthy and surviving for the use of the church.</p>
      <p>Your commentaries on the evangelists are read by many learned men among us and are carried with great praise. I have greeted Mr. Adam, the licentiate, in your name. He has recommended you to the prince. He is not at home now; hindered by the prince's business, he is rotated and almost scattered here and there. May the Lord always be present with his own. Amen.</p>
      <p>Written in Mödingen, with a swift pen, on the 8th of October in the year 44. Your always, Laurentius Agricola, now an exile, but a strong athlete in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most Christian heart and most learned and prudent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the evangelist of Zurich, best and dearest brother and friend.</p>
