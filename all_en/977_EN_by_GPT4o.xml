      <p> S. A certain man, pretending not to be an evil evangelical, sat in Wallenburg, a small town in our jurisdiction, and used these words in a public inn: "If the emperor is not in Zurich within 4 weeks or if the city is not heavily besieged, then you can cut off my head, and the people of the Five Cantons will betray themselves." The parish priest of Wallenburg told me this. I was indignant that the innkeeper did not immediately report this to the prefect, so that he could be questioned further; but he had escaped. </p>
      <p> Similar things happened in the village of Riehen, also in our jurisdiction, where someone confidently asserted that the Confederates would be invaded by the Emperor. Even if these are mere trifles, it does no harm to know such harsh things, so that those against whom they are prepared may be more ready; for if they are true, it is beneficial to know, provided they make us more cautious, and if otherwise, knowing does no harm. There is no doubt about the Emperor's intentions; it is more serious what is said about the rest. Indeed, I wish I could hope for better from these matters. Farewell with your family. </p>

      <p> These things are for your ears, unless there is a safe place where you can use them, especially concerning the Five, etc. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord. </p>
