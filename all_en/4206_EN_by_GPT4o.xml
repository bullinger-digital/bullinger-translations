      <p>Greetings. I am surrounded by countless tasks; therefore, reverend father in Christ, I ask you to excuse me. The matter of Christ is at a standstill; I dare not say it is progressing, as I see things daily that I would rather not. The new pope is said to be unusually generous towards all his people; there are those who affirm that the Venetians have been favored with a significant gift from him. Hannibal, his nephew from his sister, is said to have been elevated to the highest dignity, residing in Unterems, a man known to those familiar with him as fierce. Riding with him is Dietegen Salis, the Roman governor in the courts; for the pope's brother, the castellan of Müs, is said to have served Dietegen's father in Pergäl and to have been his riding instructor; the pope is said to have later lifted this Dietegen from baptism. He himself is a widower, hoping for the priesthood.</p>
      <p>Thus, we are in the middle.</p>
      <p>May God be present for His church.</p>
      <p>I send news that Mr. Guarnerius and I have brought.</p>
      <p>Return the document.</p>
      <p>I cannot say more now.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Chur, February 5, 1560.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. If there is any certainty with you about the French persecution or if anything has emerged, especially in Germany, please send it to us. To the most honorable man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the church in Zürich, his lord and much-honored patron.</p>
