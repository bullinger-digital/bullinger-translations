      <p>Greetings, my dearest and best brother. Now I can write openly what I want, since I have my own nephew as a messenger, whom I am sending to Bassafontaneum for certain reasons.</p>
      <p>I am well, by the grace of God, and the gout has not troubled me for more than four months; however, I am thinking of going to the nearby thermal baths next month, which will dry out the harmful humor. I am working, as usual, on our studies without interruption. I have written ten sermons on the Antichrist these days; now I am attacking brothels, with all due respect. I was in Augsburg, from where I also wrote to you; I could not easily say whether there is more evil than good there; for besides many monks and other such dregs, there are very many Schwenkfeldians and various kinds of heretics.</p>
      <p>Those who truly give their name to the gospel, except for a small flock, good God, what kind of men they are! I will not say more here. Many speak well of the Eucharist; but I suspect rather with some carnal opinion. After returning from Augsburg, I was at court for three days, where everything is fine. But now you will hear something new about the affairs of Mr. Molinaeus and mine; for the prince wrote to both of us that he had heard that we often dealt with the sacramental matter against what he himself said in his confession, and he advises us to desist. I carefully keep the letters, with which I can prove to some unbelievers, not to you, that we are not neglecting our duty here and are being steadfast. But these things are now with you.</p>
      <p>Brentius highly praises your book on Justification and certainly holds you in high regard; for there was much talk about you. There was no opportunity to speak with the prince himself on this matter; but there will be soon, I hope, when he has finished bathing. In short: the situation is as I wrote before: Here, besides Molinaeus and the Augsburg doctor, I know no one, I do not say who agrees with us, but who does not pursue our opinion with almost deadly hatred, except for Volmar, who would indeed like to agree with us, but does not dare. But that one, whom you know, to whom that other one from Basel wrote, as I wrote, rages and is insane; no enemy is more fierce, no man more carnal; he thinks he can please God by persecuting us, even if he spends the whole day drinking afterwards, oh shame. The Duke of Prussia, having sent an envoy, who is still lingering here, is seeking learned men from this school. I have tasted what is in the man, and I have clearly noticed that he will bring no one with him who has not sworn allegiance to these teachers.</p>
      <p>I think he will bring Doctor Jacob Beurlin, who will only reform the Regiomontan school, which has collapsed after the death and contention of Osiander. But you will see the Saxons, especially the Magdeburgers, rushing against the TÃ¼bingeners, as supporters of Osiander; for last summer they even wrote letters defending him, and I have seen in turn the letters of the Magdeburg pastors, who complain about these things; but when they see that they and no others are being called to that Prussian school, they will shout much more.</p>
      <p>The state of Germany is entirely turbulent; all the princes and all the free cities are afraid, and there are prudent men who think they are afraid in vain. It is almost certain that almost all the princes have gathered soldiers, though few. Our prince has called his captains; he has advised them to be ready; he has sent to the towns to announce that the soldiers must be ready, if they are called. But I see no soldiers. Some think the terror was instilled by the arrival of Philip, the Prince of Spain, who is sailing to Flanders with a hundred ships, bringing many Spanish cohorts. Others affirm that the Emperor is almost childish and it is to be feared that he may suddenly die and that on the occasion of his death great tumults may arise in Germany with the more powerful striving to oppress the weaker. Others, however, think that a league of some princes has been made and therefore, because the Emperor could have discovered this and attacked suddenly, the princes themselves wanted to prepare arms; indeed, they say that our prince has been made the commander of the league and has appointed this Sartlinus as his substitute. I will not give an opinion among such diverse opinions. Margrave Albert has gathered an excellent cavalry; a certain rumor flies that he has become a Frenchman again, but I do not think it is true. There will now be another assembly of princes not far from Speyer in the town of Rothenburg, where it will be discussed whether the proscription against the margrave should be executed, or this will be a pretext under which many other things will be done. You will say, I suppose, what are you doing there, if you know so few certain things about great matters? Listen, Bullinger, I am an Italian man, by which name I suffer great envy; moreover, everyone already knows that I agree with you on the Eucharist, which greatly increases the hatred; therefore I enclose myself within my walls and only go to court for a great reason, and there I ask for nothing, I speak of nothing of such matters; otherwise, I would stir up too many hornets for myself, and what is more, I want to begin to collect myself, to cut off long hope and live for God alone, and to trample the world and the things in it; indeed, my mind foresees that I will soon emigrate. And so that you may know, dearest brother, all my affairs, I now want to extricate myself entirely from those French envoys, which I also told you in person that I would do, and for this reason, I am now sending Aurelius to them. However, I wish to dissolve, not tear apart, the friendship, so that I may not seem to despise those who certainly supported me for some time.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand Gonzaga came to Augsburg when I was there, and when I had left, he followed on the same day with three hundred horses, which I often saw behind me. He met our duke and asked about me, where I was, then from those who led him, and not only he, but more than 20 from his retinue anxiously asked where I was. But I was in the midst of them, and they did not recognize me. They say the Emperor removed him from that Milanese government and wants to send him to England to be an advisor to his son. But listen further: Cardinal Pole, who recently went to the Emperor and then to the French to negotiate peace, wrote 4 books for the papacy several years ago and had them printed in Rome, spreading them with great cunning throughout Italy, and we could not reach the book; finally, I reached it and have it with me. Good God, how eloquent and how pestilent.</p>
      <p>I am now sending a sample; taste it, I beg you, taste the virulence. I wish you would print this little bit that I am sending there; for listen, listen, I would have liked to print it here with notes and spread it throughout Germany, because that very cardinal is expected to come to the assembly; but some of the duke's advisors said that consideration should be given to the Emperor, with whom he is serving as an envoy. Cursed be the Emperors, and cursed be the world, if through it we are hindered from doing those things that can promote the glory of God. If you wish to print it there, you certainly may; at least distribute many copies. I wish to discuss the whole book with you and use your advice on how it should be refuted. I hope for the future assembly and that I will be present; but if there is none or it does not seem right for the prince that I should be present, who knows, since I wish to bathe, whether I might come to your nearby thermal baths? Certainly, I wish to do so for your sake and for your people, with whom I could enjoy some time. May God direct the matter.</p>
      <p>I think you have those writings of mine, that is, the two actions of the papal secretary, which Mr. Baionensis sent to you in my words. Therefore, you will give them to Aurelius to bring to me and at the same time write what you think, what you consider should be added or removed. Then think about how you think the matter of religion should be handled at the next assembly, and write something of this kind to me. We hear that the pope, through that cardinal I mentioned, is negotiating peace so that he can complete his council and immediately wage war against the disobedient; therefore, without a doubt, there will be mention of the council at the assembly, especially if any hope of peace shines forth and even if none shines forth, so that we may be detained from thinking about a national one. I now live in Germany with this hope, to be present at a national one, and I will endure everything, as long as I reserve myself for that time, if the Lord wills.</p>
      <p>I had omitted to say in its place about Gribaldo, who is being called to Prussia to teach civil law there. I wish he would leave Italy, whether he must go to Prussia or to the Hyperboreans.</p>
      <p>One thing troubles me about him; for I suspect the man is infected along with the Basel people, about whom I have spoken with you at some time. I think you have heard that certain tables were printed in Basel under the name of a certain Leonardo Pedemontano, who dreams himself to be another Moses; indeed, I hear it is written in the title that they were dictated by the Holy Spirit. I know the man; he is a fanatic, but the greater sin lies with the one who either printed or was the author for him to publish. The Bernese have ordered him to be exiled from their entire territory. I do not know if you have heard that Julius of Milan has published a booklet against Lactantius, the one who lives in Geneva. The contention is about the flight of the pious; but I am most indignant that contentions are increasing among our own. What will the papists say about us? Indeed, God must be prayed to, that such scandals may cease.</p>
      <p>Farewell, best brother, and greetings to the whole family, school, and church. Pray for me, which I implore you by God. TÃ¼bingen, April 24, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
