      <p>Greetings in the Lord. The reports of your exceptional kindness are reflected in your letters. Although at this time no matter of great importance was offered, having found someone to deliver this to you, I did not want to miss the opportunity to send my letter. That my previous letters to you were received in such a favorable manner, I perceive your interest in me, and you have encouraged me so much that, even if there is nothing serious or very important, I will write to you, if only to strengthen the friendship we have begun. I conveyed your greetings (as you wrote to me) to my lord (now Duke of Suffolk), so that he might send you a letter. Indeed, you can do nothing more pleasing to his excellence than to continue, as you once did, to impart pious teachings of conduct to his daughter.</p>
      <p>For although she is so well brought up that there is great hope for her progress in piety, your exhortations (παρακλήσεις) add certain encouragements, as they always carry their own weight, either because they come from a stranger or because they come from a man like you.</p>
      <p>You commend to me Johann von Ulm along with the other Swiss. If only I could be of as much assistance to them as I wish! However, although it has not yet seemed good to God that I can do so, they will always find my effort, diligence, and zeal ready to help them in whatever way I can, especially Johann von Ulm, whom I know and in my opinion is an upright young man and of uncorrupted morals. Farewell. May Christ protect you in every way and always be present in your ministry! Remember me (I beg you) in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Your devoted James Haddon. To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
      <p>James Haddon.</p>
