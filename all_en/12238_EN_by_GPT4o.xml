    <p xml:id="regest1">The exemplary Gerhard thom Camph has returned to Strasbourg and conveyed Bullinger's greetings. - That Bullinger is no longer clear about Vermigli's attitude towards the people of Zurich, because Vermigli did not answer two of his letters, pains Vermigli. Why should Vermigli no longer be devoted to Bullinger, since the Zurichers' view of the Lord's Supper does not contradict the truth? Vermigli regrets the dispute over the Lord's Supper, but the people of Zurich cannot be held responsible for it. Perhaps this dispute even highlights the significance of the Lord's Supper more strongly. - Vermigli possesses only two letters from Bullinger [not received], both responses to previous letters from Vermigli [HBBW XII, No. 1674. 1706]. The reasons he did not respond are: he did not want to burden the busy Bullinger with his letters (even Bullinger's late responses have made Vermigli understand how much Bullinger is occupied), nor did he have anything special to report. Furthermore, there is rarely an opportunity to send a letter to Zurich with someone, and often he does not learn about it. Now, however, he will endeavor to write more often. - Vermigli is still willing to assist Bullinger. - Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan and [Theodor] Bibliander.</p>

      <p>Greetings. A young man of Frisian nationality has been staying with you for some time, whose character we have found here to be upright and his diligence in studies remarkable; for he was with us here for a considerable time. He returned to us in Strasbourg and conveyed your greetings to me in your name, which, as pleasant as it was, I am not inclined to explain at present.</p>
      <p>How much I value you and have always valued you, God knows; therefore, it was more distressing to me that you instructed to be announced that you, I say, are very surprised why I have not responded, although you have sent letters to me twice so far, and how it happens that you do not know whether I should be counted among your friends or enemies. What, dear Bullinger, (I ask you) could or should have alienated me from your most sincere affection?</p>
      <p>Truly, nothing that I know of has intervened that I should turn away such a friend and, what is more important, such a member of Christ. I am not one to indulge in dissensions or wish to undermine Christian peace because of the controversy that has arisen over the Eucharist. The opinion of your church, as far as I understand it, does not deviate from the truth. If, therefore, you do not think that I have become hostile to you because of this, I can conjecture no other reason why you should be led to doubt my goodwill towards you. But be assured, nothing of this kind could have caused it. Therefore, be persuaded that I am at present as ever in the number of your friends. However, do not think that I am so disposed that I do not greatly regret that these controversies have arisen in these times. But may God avert that I should attribute the cause and origin of their reawakening to you! I deplore the misfortune of the matter, but I do not burden you with my vote. And yet, since I do not doubt that Christ is present and will be perpetually present with his church, I promise myself some certain fruit from this conflict of disputations. For discussions of this kind have at least been accustomed to bring this utility, that the matter which is controverted is illustrated with greater evidence and clarity. Therefore, I will strive with all my might from God through Christ, both that the truth may retain its weight and that the minds, which are offended on both sides, may be soothed and reconciled by the oil of the Holy Spirit. As for me, do not (I beg you) suspect anything sinister. I cultivate peace with you and the union of the church. Let others burn and inflame as much as they wish. I ought not to spurn or condemn those opinions which agree with the word of God; among which I have decided to place yours. You have, therefore, candidly and sincerely my mind concerning this matter.</p>
      <p>I come to the cause of your wonder. It is, as this man says, that you have written to me twice now, and I have not replied. Your letters (I wish you to believe me) have not been delivered. Neither Christian charity nor Italian custom has taught me to disdain to respond to a friend who writes - and such a friend as you are. I would never have done that, so help me God. I have received two letters from you so far, but they were responses to mine, which I had previously written to you. If I have not again addressed you with mine, as I had begun, it was not out of forgetfulness of you or neglect of duty, but because I was not willing to interrupt your occupations, which both the matters that were being agitated declared you to be very much occupied, and the long delay in replying was an indication. There was also a lack of subjects for writing, since nothing occurred that seemed worthy of your knowledge. Therefore, to disturb your studies without profit - not to say like a madman - could seem to be of a man consulting less (than he ought) for the benefit of the church. Nor is there such a frequent abundance of couriers to you that it makes my case worse. Some do come to you from here occasionally, I admit; but I do not always know about it. Nevertheless, so that our bond in Christ may be free from every stain of suspicion, I will henceforth take care not to appear sluggish in writing.</p>
      <p>May God keep you safe for us for a long time. Finally, do not forget that if you think I can do anything here for your favor, you should know that I will accomplish it immediately, as soon as you have taken care to explain it to me.</p>
      <p>Greet, I beseech you, Mr. Pellikan, Bibliander, and the other brothers in Christ. In Strasbourg, on the Nones of July 1545.</p>
      <p>Petrus Martyr Vermilius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
