      <p>Greetings. I have responded to your letters written on the 25th and 28th of August.</p>
      <p>Here, I received yours written on the 5th of September and those you wrote to Mr. P[eter] M[artyr], I have sent; I await his response, so that I may send it to you and from his letters, you may better understand what is happening here. Today, the papal legate, Cardinal of Ferrara, is expected here with the Theatines.</p>
      <p>All good men nevertheless persist in great hope regarding the proposed colloquy; but time and patience are needed. I will be as solicitous for such an eminent and admirable man, Mr. P[eter] M[artyr], as for a father.</p>
      <p>I am writing back to Mr. Fabricius.</p>
      <p>Others have written the same to me; but I know these disturbances arise from the fact that particular pensions were not yet paid and the money destined for that purpose was diverted to other uses due to the treasurer's fault. Now I believe they have been satisfied.</p>
      <p>That is a very old game, and the Philippics are accustomed to attempt and repeat the same at every assembly. The peace treaties and the latest confederation should be enough to keep them in line, and that no one would be so foolish as to give so much.</p>
      <p>As for the legate being absent, it is not out of contempt, but because he has business, and among those who have nothing to complain about, there is no need for intercessors, and those who, at great expense, foster idle leisure in the kingdom's greatest poverty. But what can you do with those who do not know what is good and fair and who want to catch eels and fish. I have arranged for the king to write to them, and whatever happens, I will be able to set everything in order in person. I have understood what was done in Basel and I do not doubt there are those here who would gladly pervert everything, so that the kitchen and disgraceful profit remain safe.</p>
      <p>The Lord will complete what He has begun.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to your prayers and those of friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>At Saint-Germain on the 19th of September.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>I am sending to you a speech delivered by Beza on behalf of the ministers; it is worthy of your reading.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
