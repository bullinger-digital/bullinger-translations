      <p>Greetings. For the examples you sent me, I confess that I owe you much.</p>
      <p>Now, apart from expressing my gratitude, I have nothing with which to reciprocate your kindness. Do not doubt my loyalty; it will not be a disadvantage to you with anyone.</p>
      <p>Regarding Schärt[lino], some have already spread the word in our city (if it can be called a city) that he was with me in Griesenberg, evidently to weigh me down with hatred among those who are more favorably disposed towards me, already burdened more than enough by various crosses. What was written from Basel about the reasons for the Emperor's haste towards the Belgians, Bucer had already written to me from Strasbourg, and those letters contained nothing else, so there is no reason for me to send them to you, except that he adds about his people in Strasbourg that the populace greatly desires Christ, the senate fears the Emperor, and therefore they have finally been forced to petition the Emperor to allow them some churches, so that in other matters he may take care through his bishop during the Interim. The whole reason is that the Emperor's wrath cannot be borne in any way. However, they fear that the Emperor will impose the papacy on the bishop and the Interim on others as in Augsburg; he adds that this still needs to be referred to the great council (by which I understand he means the votes of the individual tribes). "Some hope," he says, "I do not despair; but in the meantime, we are in the greatest danger of sedition and oppression by enemies." Would that, my Bullinger, we might someday see more peaceful times, so that we do not have to perpetually dwell in these ruins (of) buildings founded on sand, but soon migrate into those tents of trust (as it is with that prophet) and find abundant rest!</p>
      <p>That Marcellus took longer to ensure that other letter reached you bothers me, because even if it would have been much better for you to receive it sooner, it would not have been his fault if it had not been delivered; which I would consider bearable if he were either far away from there or did not send a servant to the city almost every day for other business. But these things are often attributed to friends out of favor.</p>
      <p>For the hope you open to us in the name of Naogeorgus, I am grateful. He seems entirely worthy, for whom good and learned people should do their duty. I will first advise him to go to Bern; our Haller wrote to me from there not long ago very affectionately, which I do not think you are unaware of. I have already begun to love this young man very much for his singular and learned piety and most pleasant manners. May the Lord preserve him for us and indeed for His church for a very long time, continually advancing and surpassing himself for the extension of Christ's kingdom, which now seems to be contracted into a narrow space and almost entirely extinguished, but soon will re-emerge with great glory of divine majesty, the most cruel tyranny of those impious ones being broken, who will pay deserved penalties to the most just avenging God.</p>
      <p>Pray for us, as you do, that the Lord may show me His ways and mine, not only for myself but also for my brother and cousin and some other pious people, and may He happily expedite and resolve our cares. You can easily guess, with your prudence, what kind of evils now greatly trouble and torment my mind. May the Lord have mercy on me and all the afflicted and kindly comfort us with the anointing of His Spirit! Greet Musculus and Gervasius from me with reverence; I have received Musculus's letters, to which I will respond as soon as possible. Greetings to Buttler and Hopper, those most holy and best Englishmen. Also, on the 16th of this month, Captain Eckle came to Kreuzlingen, lodging in the monastery. The abbot was in Weingarten; he sent for Hans Montprat, informing him that he had orders from a gracious lord of his, who is an imperial and royal commissioner, and desires six members of the council to come to him.</p>
      <p>They have now been appointed, and the captain has been brought into the city to the Hecht. To the appointed gentlemen, he stated that there is a means by which the city can be helped, namely if they agree to open a gate at night and let in up to 1000 men, under the pretense that they are taking the city by force; however, he would give his son as a pledge that no one would be harmed in body, property, or goods; the people are supposed to be German, good, well-known companions and neighbors. And since they are already surrendering unconditionally, this would be a better means. He spoke of guarding the gates and requested that the matter be kept secret; however, he could allow it to come to a large council, but did not want it to be brought to a community; he also said, among other things, that whoever feared could well move away, to which someone said: "It might mean an entire upper district;" to which he replied: "No." He also suggested that if this is not done, they would have to fear something much greater and worse; also, if a council agreed to this, he would then make further arrangements. Thereupon, they requested clarification of some articles from him.</p>
      <p>These are now wonderful, strange actions, while the other gentlemen and negotiators are acting and yet all articles have been agreed upon, that now such a complaint is being raised with Eckle. It is believed that it is all the king's practice; he wants to take the city by force of the ban, so that Constance would no longer be an imperial city, but a city of the House of Austria. Otherwise, if they made peace with the emperor and the ban was lifted, the king would not have to impose anything on the people of Constance that would be contrary to the empire's heritage.</p>
      <p>That Eckle is lodging in Kreuzlingen is strange. The abbot has let some know how precarious the situation of the people of Constance is and that the emperor does not want to grant them mercy and how they must strengthen the guards, as they are doing, and he is also keeping a stronger watch, etc. And yet on Wednesday, when he returned from the abbot in Weingarten, he brought some reasonable decision.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the four gentlemen, the negotiators, had a meeting in Überlingen. It is believed that the citizens will be allowed to move. May God grant it to them for good!</p>
      <p>These are truly strange, swift, wonderful things of the entirely adventurous practitioners. Oh, why have not more people taken Constance by force of the ban! How badly one is deceived everywhere!</p>
      <p>What will follow if Constance becomes an Austrian city, that has much and rightly to be considered, whether the Confederates also have reason to assess all this.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, guilds were held in Constance, but whether this matter was brought up or not, I cannot know at all what was discussed; for I have not received any writing since then. But some were in Constance on Sunday evening; they say they heard that there is something new, that they want to let all those who do not want to stay there leave with their property and goods. And that seems plausible to me; for this will be the right grip on the lute; for thus the good-hearted will also advise, since it cannot be better, so that they may come to an agreement in peace.</p>
      <p>Now I must ask you for a service, so that you are sufficiently troubled with me, namely that you inquire with your city clerk whether my lords have not sent your people a copy of their letter to Fürstenberg and Weingarten, and if so, that the city clerk would also kindly let a copy of it come to me through you, if you otherwise have a message to send to me; for our city clerk has lost his copy and does not like to write again to Weingarten. Let me know the scribe's fee; it shall be paid honestly. I kindly ask you not to forget this.</p>
      <p>Given on the 23rd of September 1548.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his friend and brother, by far the dearest of all. Zurich</p>
