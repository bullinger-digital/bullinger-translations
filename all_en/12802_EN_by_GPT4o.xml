    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] What more is there to write? Man is vain, useless, and unreliable! Hardly had [the Protestants] been tested by God, they already subjected themselves to the godless papist ordinances! What would have happened if they had faced an even heavier cross? Surely they would have denied Christ! Gast does not exaggerate the cunning of the pseudo-evangelicals!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The money he spent on [the purchase of wool intended for Bullinger's wife Anna, née Adlischwyler] has been refunded. His wife [Apollonia, née Glaser] thanks for the enclosed gifts. She plans to reciprocate for them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The pious Duke Christoph of Württemberg has settled in Basel with his wife [Anna Maria, née Brandenburg-Ansbach]. Count Georg [of Württemberg-Mömpelgard] is now expected with his entire household and all the preachers [of his dominion]. Emperor Charles V is probably merciless towards him. He has imposed an enormous fine on the Count. Either the Count will have to pay it or sell or pledge his territory to King Francis I of France until the Emperor's wrath subsides. Bullinger surely knows that Duke Christoph has given Mömpelgard to King Francis I, and that the sign of the [Bourbon] lily has been placed everywhere in Mömpelgard as well as in the surrounding countryside.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger will also be well informed about the content of the flattering letter that the fox-like Emperor wrote to the Swiss Confederates. Ulm, Augsburg, and the other [southern German] cities have all submitted to the unjust conditions of the Emperor. The city of Strasbourg still holds out, but its authorities are already wavering. Philip of Hesse is supposed to disband his troops and seek the Emperor's favor. Gast often thinks of the Psalm verse "Do not trust in man!" [Ps 146, 2f]. The ailing Myconius will report further. He is bedridden, and his wife [Margret] is even sicker than he is.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] A few days ago, Francesco Stancaro, coming from Augsburg, arrived in Basel. The learned Hebraist and Hellenist fears the Emperor and King Ferdinand I. Wolfgang Musculus also plans to leave the restless Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The brave warrior Claus von Hattstatt wanted to visit Duke Christoph in Basel. When he dined at an inn in Ensisheim, he was arrested and taken to the castle, where he had to take an oath, while his companions were already forced to do so in the tavern. He is accused of being on the side of France and the [imperial] cities. What will come of this?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The Emperor is said to plan to go to Schlettstadt to march against Strasbourg from there and to devastate Alsace, especially [the dominion of Reichenweier and the county of Horburg]. Everyone is afraid. Thus, the wicked and the hypocritical followers of the Gospel are exposed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger will probably have heard how Johannes Brenz was treated. The papists boast of the imperial success and even blaspheme in doing so!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Gast asks Bullinger to forgive him for writing so rarely.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Myconius will tell how Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony is proceeding against the perfidious Duke Maurice. Before the war began, [Agnes, née of Hesse], the wife of the latter, and the children of [Sibylle, née of Jülich-Cleves-Berg], the wife of the old Elector Johann Friedrich, fell on their knees before Maurice, weeping, and begged him not to start a war against his relative. Maurice replied angrily: "I will do what I promised the Emperor anyway. I will be the future Elector. Leave me alone!" But now he is completely powerless, perhaps even already captured, while his territory is devastated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Greetings to Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, Rudolf Gwalther, and especially to Johannes Fries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] In haste.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. What should I write, I do not know. You know that men are vain, useless, and of no faith. The Lord tests us a little, and we soon fall back to the godless ordinances of the papists! What if a greater and more bitter cross were to trouble us, do you think they would act differently? Without a doubt, they would deny Christ himself. But I do not wish to exaggerate the treachery of our so-called evangelicals.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have received the money from the wool. My wife thanks you for the gifts. She intends to reciprocate in due time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Duke Christoph of Württemberg is staying with us, a pious prince, loving the word of the Lord. We are expecting Count Georg with his entire family and all his ministers of the word. For the Emperor refuses to accept him into his favor, perhaps. He demands a large sum of money from him, which he will either pay or pledge or sell his territory to the King of France for a time, until the Emperor's wrath is somewhat extinguished. Nor do I think you are unaware that Duke Christoph has given Mömpelgard to the French and that the lilies are affixed everywhere in the city and fields.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You know better than I that the Emperor has written flattering words to the Swiss. This is to act in a fox-like manner. Ulm, Augsburg, and the remaining cities have been taken into the Emperor's favor under unjust conditions. Strasbourg still persists, but its leaders are wavering. Philip of Hesse is said to be dismissing his soldiers. He seeks the Emperor's favor. I often recall the saying of the Psalms: "Do not trust in man," etc. You will receive the rest from Myconius, who is ill. He himself is bedridden with his wife, who suffers from a more cruel disease than he does.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>These days, Stancaro, a learned man in Hebrew and Greek, came to us from Augsburg, fearing the tyranny of the Emperor and Ferdinand. Musculus is considering changing his place. The citizens are turbulent, and it is no wonder.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Claus von Hattstatt, a noble and brave soldier, wanted to travel from Basel to Württemberg. He was captured in Ensisheim while he was eating at an inn. He had to swear into the castle; the servants into the tavern. He is accused of being French and from the cities. Thus, this must brew in.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It is said that the Emperor wants to camp at Schlettstadt, to attack Strasbourg, to devastate Alsace, especially the Württemberg lands. Everyone is frightened. Thus, the truth is trampled underfoot by the wicked, the hypocrites are brought to light, who have covered their wickedness under the guise of the Gospel.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>What has been done with Brenz, I do not think is unknown to you. The papists boast of the Emperor's successful outcome. They set their mouth against the heavens, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell and forgive me for writing so rarely.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Myconius will tell what the Elector in Saxony is doing with the treacherous Maurice; before whom his wife, the children of the old prince's wife, fell on their knees before the beginning of the war, in prayers with weeping eyes, begging him not to start a war against his cousin, who has done him so much good. Then he became angry. He said: "I will do what I have promised the Emperor, whatever may happen. I am the future Elector! Therefore, leave me with love." Thus he departed, but completely exhausted, his region devastated, and, as some say, even captured.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I wanted to write these few things to you. Greet in my name Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, especially Fries with Gwalther and the other ministers. You know my hand.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, my dear gracious lord. Zurich.</p>
