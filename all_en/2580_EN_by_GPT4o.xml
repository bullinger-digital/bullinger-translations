      <p>Greetings. I sent a letter with money through Mathias Schenkh in recent days, which you spent on books in my name, most honorable Bullinger. In the meantime, I received a letter from you with the most pious booklet dated February 10th.</p>
      <p>I also sent a letter on February 27th to the most honorable man, Mr. Gesner, through a certain Bernese courier called Pernagel; he promised in good faith to deliver it upon receiving payment. I ask you to inform Mr. Gesner that I have certainly obtained the privilege for a decade with great effort. It is now being written; therefore, he can safely place on the frontispiece of the book to be published, "with the privilege of the King of the Romans for a decade." They are writing the privilege in the chancellery; but because they are busier than to be able to complete it immediately, I wanted to inform Mr. Gesner of this before it was written. Therefore, let him preface the privilege with a caution that it should not be reprinted within the decade. It has been decided and registered in the council; therefore, it is as valid as if it were already written.</p>
      <p>Your booklet on the Last Judgment is very well received by many good men. I had Calvin's booklet on the Lord's Supper, certainly learned; I wish for more, so that it may be shared with friends. Neither [...] nor any of his people are acting among us except for a certain provost, a man fiercely raging against religion and for this reason most acceptable to the king, to whom it is less safe to grant letters.</p>
      <p>Recently, he opened letters from Paul Vergerius to a friend at the king's court and showed them to the king, not without danger to the one to whom the letters were addressed; but I will make an effort to safely transfer my letters with your booklet again to the most excellent man.</p>
      <p>The advice of the people of Zurich is highly commended, for they did not subscribe to the most unjust sentence passed against the pious people of Locarno. Our assemblies are proceeding strongly; the fourth consultation was held yesterday; the pious have conducted themselves vigorously in defending religion and upholding the treaty composed at Padua in the past war; for they do not wish to depart a nail's breadth from the articles concluded there, even though the sons of this world strain every nerve to escape from the Paduan concord and prescription and to make others escape. The impious outnumber the pious in votes; but those who stand by the gospel, though fewer, are more steadfast in asserting the truth. They have a foundation by no means fig-like, on which they rely; for the Paduan prescription among other things contains this, that matters of religion should be settled by equal votes. A thousand wedges are sought to dissolve this knot; but I hope they will attempt everything in vain. Farewell, most learned Bullinger, and I pray you greet Mr. Gesner and other good men in my name. Mr. von Freyberg, who is now here at the assemblies with his prince, wishes to announce his greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Your booklet was sent to my father through William. Also, greet William. Augsburg, very quickly, March 6th, 1555.</p>
      <p>Mr. Welser received the booklet you sent with open arms; he will write to you about this matter himself.</p>
      <p>Gereon Sailer, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant ecclesiast of Zurich, lord and esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
