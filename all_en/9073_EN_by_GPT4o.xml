      <p>Greetings. We bear with great difficulty the departure of the most learned and kind man, Mr. MÃ¼ller, from us, and with a very sorrowful heart, we reluctantly let go of this unique ornament of all of Rhaetia. However, since he can no longer serve such a bloody king, nor does he wish to, due to the piety he possesses, and since he is about to undertake a journey to you for the sake of entering into another condition, I could not let him go to you without my letters, in which I at least signify that I have received yours along with two copies of this work.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul joins me in giving you immense thanks, who never cease to honor us with such precious gifts and honors.</p>
      <p>Would that we could soon be grateful to you in reality. I prefer that you learn from the letters of the governors of the Valtellina what is heard about the Spaniards raging around our borders, rather than from the doubtful reports of others. The prefect of Sondrio, as well as the governors of Traona and Morbegno, wrote to our consul: the governor of Milan, along with nobles, senators, and other men, numbering about 1500, have come to inspect the borders, reaching Como by boat according to ancient custom, and although they think no danger threatens us from this, they still advise us to be vigilant and prepared for future events, should any arise.</p>
      <p>The commissioner of Clavenna, Mr. Johannes von Salis, son of the late Frederick of illustrious memory, also wrote singularly to our consul, of which I provide you a copy, so that you may hear and see for yourselves what they judge. Such messages will be spread among the communities of Rhaetia, which our lords will simultaneously arm with exhortations to vigilance and care. It is truly surprising that the Pagans, once summoned, have remained so silent.</p>
      <p>Balthasar Planta, a brother of Rhaetia, thinking of revenge, cruelly attacked the brothers of the Engadin; but, affected by disgrace, he brought great dishonor upon himself due to the obligation of an oath, forced to recant and suffering a loss of 40 gold coins. However, a false rumor is spread that he is also imprisoned.</p>
      <p>We can hardly restrain ourselves, indeed barely, from raising our voice against that confederation which our people have with the most treacherous Frenchman. This would indeed be troublesome for the royal beneficiaries; but with what honesty will we have a robber as an ally? Shall we, for the sake of those who have all honesty for sale, pursue a robber with friendship and favor? But enough of this for now.</p>
      <p>All those greeted return your greetings.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly from Chur, October 20, 1572. May you all be safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Your reverence's most observant, Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zurich, his singular lord, to be honored with the greatest respect.</p>
