      <p>Greetings. Almost nothing presents itself as worthy of mention, especially since I wrote back to your kindness a few days ago, except that I thought I should briefly respond to the letters that were brought today. I have heard nothing about the peace that the Venetians are said to have bought, and I hardly think they would regret buying it at such a price. I have no doubt that you have already learned that the Pope, whom I called Innocent, is named Pius III, and that he is from the Medici family of Milan. It is commonly reported that he will hold a council in Milan or even elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The French disturbances, if I examine the matter more closely (as far as I am able to know), seem to me to arise with some justification. May the Lord turn all these things to the glory of His name and for our salvation, as He most certainly will. The suitors for the Queen of England are now said to be Charles and Ferdinand; I think both will be disappointed; much has been said about those future marriages, various gifts were being prepared or rather were said to be prepared; now all is silent. Almost everything is quiet with us now; meanwhile (as I also wrote before) soldiers are being secretly enlisted everywhere.</p>
      <p>The Nurembergers fear for themselves and their own, and they implore the confederates; however, none of these things are yet being done openly. They threaten to expel the Duke of Blaw, the son of John Frederick, Duke of Saxony of blessed memory, to whom that territory previously belonged. But other things are being done in the meantime; from small beginnings, great movements have often arisen.</p>
      <p>Nothing new has been reported from the Netherlands for a long time; the indication is that things are not going entirely according to plan. Farewell most happily in the Lord, who makes us all well.</p>
      <p>Given at Augsburg, commonly called by error, when it is truly Rhaetia, on the 16th of February in the year 1560. Your reverence's most observant Georg von Stetten the Younger.</p>
      <p>I was not able to write back to C. Singer due to lack of time; nevertheless, you will greet him in my name. To the venerable and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
