      <p>S. On the 15th of May, dearly beloved godfather and Christian brother, my dear Heinrich, with God's help, I have returned home from the tumultuous company of the soldiers. I have sent your letter to Mr. Gregor Lowerer in haste, to which he has replied with a long letter, the summary of which is: he is too poor, currently has nothing in hand, and knows not how to provide for Johan, neither wife nor children, nor to take them in; the situation is strange, and he does not know if he can stay or not, etc. It is said that before the harvest comes, our matter will come to an end. He asks for a little more patience until he can settle his affairs. Dr. Lętus writes to you about the situation with us and elsewhere; I will leave it at that.</p>
      <p>In this turmoil, many hearts have been revealed, showing that when they are at home, they fear God more than the devil, lamenting that they have abandoned the Gospel and not remained with the Pope, spreading wondrous tales and cruel lies and blasphemies, so that one might wonder how such a devil can lie hidden in the hearts of men, etc.</p>
      <p>I have asked and instructed Mr. Caspar of Tälikon to handle my matters faithfully, as he well knows. I have settled all matters, and I hope that my affairs will be left in peace. However, if envy or other swift people of the world act otherwise, which I do not expect, I desire to give a rightful response, etc. So that I am not overwhelmed, considering that I am in distant lands in the service of my gracious lord, with great personal loss, etc.</p>
      <p>In haste, in Lauingen, 19th of May, 56. Greet all good people for me, etc.</p>
      <p>Laurentius.</p>
      <p>To the pious, wise, and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich, my beloved godfather and old good friend, etc. Zürich.</p>
