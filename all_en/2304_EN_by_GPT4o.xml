      <p>In summary: I thought it necessary to come here secretly, and I do not regret it.</p>
      <p>I will leave shortly after.</p>
      <p>There was much talk about you with Bassafontaneo, who had written and later reported that he found you in the forest apostolically and holds you in great esteem. The people of Locarno were accused of being Anabaptists, but certainly without reason. Therefore, I wrote them a confession of faith here, which I am sending to you. Show it there, if it seems appropriate, to the senators or promise them in person about it. Farewell and be well. Pray for me. Baden, 7th of June, 1554.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
