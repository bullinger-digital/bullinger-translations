    <p xml:id="regest1">He gave one of the two letters received from Bullinger to [Niklaus] Wyttenbach to pass on to [Peter] Im Haag and [...] Nägeli. He read the other with distress; after he, as already communicated, was concerned together with [Rudolf] Rebstock and the mayor [Valerius Göuffi] about the word "nüt" [in the copy of Luther's letter from June 27], they came across two more differing copies from Zurich. To prevent the Zurich council and the city clerk [Werner Beyel] from being accused of negligence, he sent two of the copies for correction to [Beyel], but received them back uncorrected at a crucial point; now he is at a loss as to how to present the matter to the Biel council and the country pastors. He has acted in loyalty to Zurich and does not want to be considered a restless spirit. He tries to do justice to Luther, but stands on a firm foundation of faith and will not succumb to temptations. Greetings. Fortunatus [Andronicus] reported that there had been talks with Bucer about a general synod involving the French Bernese territories and that Bucer had justified the presence of Christ in the bread in a lecture with Exodus [3, 2].</p>

      <p>Peace and truth from the Lord through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>I received two letters from you through my boy, dearest brother in Christ and much esteemed in the Lord. I gave one to the distinguished man Im Haag through our Wyttenbach, which he, as well as Nägeli, read, mutually encouraging each other to a certain pious and not obstinate constancy.</p>
      <p>I received and read the other with great sorrow of my soul for this reason: You heard how I wrote to you about this word "nüt" and what troubled our mayor and Rebstock as well as me. We could not come to terms with it, and not without reason, when the messenger from Zurich, with the letters I had given you from the senators, arrived. Jacob came from Zurich showing letters he had copied from our Rhellicanus, sounding differently not in the part of the word, which was clear, but in other words, namely: "Yet truly the true body and blood of our Lord." On this day also came from Zurich the Dutch bookseller (I do not know by what name he is called). He also showed letters containing the same words, which the Zurich letters did not have at all, but were entirely absent.</p>
      <p>Then, trembling all over, fearing a stumbling block, I tried to prevent our people from seizing the opportunity, if the matter came to the senate, to slander both the senate and the Zurich scribe, as if they were less attentive in such an important matter, but rather negligent. I urged from a good and sincere heart, which has never failed me, from the Zurich people, my boy (whom you kindly received), recommending the letters of Jacob and the same ones the Zurich messenger brought, sending them to the scribe in Zurich, earnestly asking him to examine the letters and correct what was missing, pointing out the defect to him, so that he would not be ill-spoken of even by our people. No one could come out of it or understand it. You too, candid brother, take these words and see what you see and understand and what you want to teach others. We have kept this quiet, no one has said a word about it. However, when the boy arrived, he brought the letters uncorrected, except that he corrected the word "nüt"; the rest, where the matter lay, he did not touch at all, and they are exactly as they were before. We have no certainty, we dare not define anything certain in such a serious matter, since it is also clear to us through Wyttenbach that the Bernese letters do not sound like ours. What then can we answer to the questions of our senate, what to the brothers in the field, to whom the letters should be delivered in French? Who will translate Luther's letters from German into Latin for them, since we do not have them whole and complete like the Bernese and other churches? He is a monk, we have nothing to do with him, master. And so it has happened and still stands.</p>
      <p>I have wanted to prevent all this out of loyal intention; it stands just as always, that I almost have to persuade myself that what I have always done and sought for the benefit and honor of the city (God knows this) should be considered a disturbance to me. I should have let it go through and still let it go, as some do, then I would be free of suspicion, if I had not written to the city scribe in Zurich, whom I have always considered my good lord (as it has always happened to me), thinking he would do what I had written to him in a friendly and cordial manner.</p>
      <p>Now, my dear lord and brother, I could not refrain from complaining to you in loyalty about what oppresses me, and I can hardly hold back my tears; for we see the church infected everywhere with this dross, and when it would be necessary to silence the mouths of the barking with Luther's writings, we do not have them sound and complete (who otherwise is not sound). I will comply with your advice, as I received in your letters. May God give me a good mind, and that I may hold a right judgment of everyone, whether against Luther or others. My heart has never been torn from him for twelve years. I have a brother who has been known to me for many years, has now been with me, tells me words about Luther; he has gone to Luther himself for the third time with the Appenzeller, for he was also there at that time, etc. I have set my feet on a firm rock, from which the certainty and sincerity of my faith, imparted by teachers and masters not to be regretted, has flowed to me clearly enough.</p>
      <p>I will be content with this; for I do not want to pour out the fountain of living water and draw and drink water from a putrid cistern and pit. Let those who want to drink. The bait is laid under the trap, I sniff; lick, taste, nibble, snap, be greedy, taste, try, whoever wants. I mean, if we had gone into the matter with some as they had it before them, we would now have received the reward from those quick, sly, wet boys.</p>
      <p>Now may the gracious God preserve us, give us His peace and blessing. Amen. Greet your mother, your wife, all my brothers, to whose faith and love I hope to always be commended.</p>
      <p>From Biel, August 29, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Peter.</p>
      <p>The day before yesterday, a certain Frenchman named Fortunatus came to us from Strasbourg, whom our Caspar knows very well, a pious man and not a follower of Luther.</p>
      <p>He said amazing things about Bucer, how they plan and try to attempt a certain general synod, talking with him about how the French under Bernese rule could also be present and become present, etc. My Bullinger, there is no better way, than when they recruit, to refuse them. Leave us with love and unconfused, sitting quietly on the nest. Fortunatus told me how he heard Bucer in a public lecture treat this passage from Exodus 3:2: "And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire" and from this prove the presence of Christ in the bread, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich.</p>
