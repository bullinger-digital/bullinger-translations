    <p xml:id="regest1">In his letter of April 27 [No. 1624], he already shared some information about the outcome of the Imperial Diet [at Speyer], now Jakob Velocianus [Funcklin] will tell Bullinger what [Konrad Zwick] has reported since then. His wife [Amalia, née Muntprat] will undertake a spa treatment near Zurich with her three sons [Jakob, Ulrich, and (...) Zwick] and a nephew of Blarer [Albert Blarer]; Funcklin, the teacher of the young boys, who suffers from scabies, is to accompany them. The recently critically ill [Johannes] Zwick is recovering; [Konrad] Pellikan wrote that Bullinger, Leo [Jud], Theodor [Bibliander], himself, and others were also ailing, Blarer wishes them a speedy recovery. Funcklin will show Bullinger a letter from the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] to C[aspar] Schwenckfeld; Blarer himself has already warned in earlier letters about the great harm Schwenckfeld poses to the churches, especially since he dazzles many with his personality; Bullinger should help tackle the problem at its root. He recently visited his sister [Barbara, née Blarer] and brother-in-law [Heinrich von Ulm] in Grießenberg, who send their regards to Bullinger, as does Barbara [née von Ulm], the pious daughter-in-law of [Diethelm] Röist, who is plagued by tormenting scruples; Bullinger can certainly discreetly provide relief; greetings to the Röists, praise for the promising son [Jakob Röist]. Further greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings, dearest of the dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I sent you a letter on April 27th, in which I informed you about the outcome of the Imperial Diet, as much as was possible to know at that time. Now, this excellent young man Jakob Velocianus will tell you in detail, if you desire, what remains to be said about this matter, since he was a diligent and attentive listener when our Konrad Zwick reported everything there in the brothers' assembly thoroughly and in good faith.</p>
      <p>Conrad's wife, with her three sons and my nephew from my brother, will undertake a spa treatment not far from Zurich, and it seemed appropriate to add this Jakob, whom they have already used as a tutor for some time, especially since he himself is tormented by unbearable scabies, so that they do not throw off the yoke of discipline too insolently.</p>
      <p>Zwick, who was again very close to death, is somewhat recovering again by the grace of the Lord. Our Pellikan recently wrote that you, Leo, Theodor, himself, and others are not in good health; but we hope that Christ's healing hand will restore you all.</p>
      <p>Velocianus will present to you the Landgrave's letter to C[aspar] Schwenckfeld, which is said to have been composed without Theseus, and the style itself reflects something military and princely. I have already written to you in my previous letters what I think of C[aspar] S[chwenckfeld]. He harms our churches more than anyone who has not experienced it could believe. Certainly, the minds of most people are such that, when they see a life commended by remarkable temperance, they immediately judge the doctrine that comes from it, especially if it is seasoned with a certain eloquence, to be true and solid. For this reason, the austerity of John's life also carried his doctrine so strongly that, compared to it, Christ himself seemed inferior to many. I wish that this evil could be removed from the churches in time through your vigilance and that of those like you! For once it has taken deeper root, it will certainly be very difficult to uproot it completely. Please see to it that you do not neglect your part here; for whoever defeats this most charming but most harmful enemy with a strong hand will benefit the church of Christ beyond measure.</p>
      <p>I was with my sister and brother-in-law in Grießenberg these days, who very diligently asked me to send you their greetings if I ever wrote to you, although my brother-in-law himself has either already been to Zurich or will be soon. At the same time, they indicated that they were asked by the daughter-in-law of your senior Röist, Barbara von Ulm, to commend her to you through me, which I wish to be granted by you as much as possible; for she is truly a pious woman, and whatever might be lacking in her in terms of form or other graces, she compensates beautifully. However, she is timid and not free from scruples that trouble her from time to time, which you can easily remove for her with your Christian prudence and the familiarity you have with her father-in-law and husband, so that she may grow to a proper strength of spirit. You will certainly discover this problem from her with a certain skill and as if doing something else; otherwise, shame will prevent her from revealing it to you. You will greet her very lovingly with my words as well, not forgetting Röist the father and son, whom I especially wish to be commended by you. They affirm that the father's genius and manners shine wonderfully in the son, so that your republic has every reason to congratulate itself, since the father has fulfilled all the numbers of an excellent and most fortunate consul, so that we can rightly pronounce your Zurich fortunate to have been born under his consulship.</p>
      <p>Greet your most chaste wife with your whole household and all your servants in the Lord, especially our most friendly Gwalther. All of ours greet you. Farewell, my soul and my heart, in the Lord. May 22, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his most venerable and dearest brother, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of Zurich.</p>
