    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] After Blarer had already written extensively the day before [with No. 2841], he would like to briefly mention something regarding Konrad Zwick. Zwick is very distressed for the reasons he discussed in his letter yesterday [to Johannes Haab]. The people of Zurich should act more prudently so that Zwick does not lose heart and his efforts are not in vain. The matter is important.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, I wrote to you yesterday. This is solely regarding my cousin: He is very distressed for reasons you can gather from his letter. I beg you, for God's sake, to be attentive and involved, so that the matter is handled more prudently and the good, pious man does not become disheartened and thus all efforts are not ruined. You cannot do anything better, as much depends on this matter. Act according to my heartfelt trust (expectation). Dated March 12.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
