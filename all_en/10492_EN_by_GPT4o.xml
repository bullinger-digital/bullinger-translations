    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger and all others assured him that the issue of the Lord's Supper had been happily resolved in W端rttemberg, so that he and the people of Basel were already hoping for the expansion of the true Church. Meanwhile, however, they are being troubled by the people of Strasbourg, Bucer, etc. Ferdinand I is preparing a war against them under the pretext that they have a false understanding of the Lord's Supper, claiming their Supper is without Christ. In response, the people of Basel sent them the First Basel Confession. Meanwhile, the people of Strasbourg are trying to separate them from Bullinger: Bullinger had approved Bucer's booklet addressed "to the people of M端nster," while the people of Basel hold a different opinion than Bucer. The people of Basel are being led to understand that only a turn towards Lutheranism could save them. Myconius asks for Bullinger's opinion on Bucer's writing, which he does not yet know, as well as on the one he recently sent to Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You write to me that everyone is happily dealing with the matter and cause of the Eucharist in W端rttemberg. From this, my brothers and I have had no small hope that the true Church of God will soon expand its borders as widely as possible. Meanwhile, however, I am troubled by the people of Strasbourg, as if a war is threatening our heads from some Ferdinand, whose title will indeed be the sacrament of the Supper misunderstood. For they object to us that the Supper is without Christ, just as a tragedy representing Atreus is without Atreus. Indeed, I say frankly that this cannot be proven until they prove that faith is absent from us. Since they cannot do this, neither can they prove the other. For if there is faith, then Christ is present; if there is no faith, then neither is Christ present. We have sent our confession, waiting to see what they will respond. See what they are doing in the meantime: They bring you up to me, as if you agree entirely with Bucer, while we disagree. They write thus: "Bullinger added a white stone to the booklet of M端nster. Nothing, he says, could be written more suited to his mind." What you have approved here, I do not know. I have not seen the booklet, nor is there anyone who has told me anything about it. After I see it, who knows, maybe I will add something too? In short, they predict so badly for us that unless we become Lutherans, we are doomed. They do not use these words, indeed, but I cannot interpret the words they use otherwise. I wonder what the matter is. There is something hidden, which I can guess, but not say for sure, although it is entirely true to me. Therefore, I ask you to write to us what you approve in Bucer's booklet, then what you find in the one I recently sent.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Jesus Christ with your church. These things are for your bosom.</p>
      <p>Hastily in Basel, October 14, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother in the Lord</p>
