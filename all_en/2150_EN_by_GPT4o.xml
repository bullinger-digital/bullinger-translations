      <p>S. I was very pleased to have the opportunity to respond to your letters, and first, regarding the money to be sent to Paris, you should know that nothing has been accomplished yet, because that Jacob from the Well has not come; but I have arranged everything so that if he comes, it will be announced immediately. Keller's brother, a goldsmith who serves my wife's brother, a rather excellent young man, will join him as a companion. Regarding the war between the Genoese and the French, we have received quite different news, that is, the French fleet consisting of 20 ships was sunk by the force of the storm, with only two galleys excepted, then Corsica was recovered by the Genoese except for the fortress of St. Dionysius, which they say is impregnable, and with this success, the Emperor's spirits have grown so much that he has completely rejected the papal legate bringing some peace conditions. But also a certain new island has been discovered by the Spaniards, rich in gold and silver mines. Regarding the marriage between the Spaniard and the Englishwoman, everything is reported to be agreed and concluded, and under these conditions, it has been arranged that England will retain the form of its ancient governance and the authority of the parliamentary senate, in which the prince himself can participate if he wishes; that no more than fifty Spaniards will be supported on the island, and that whether he leaves children from the queen or dies without an heir, he will subject Lower Germany to the English kingdom.</p>
      <p>These are the Spanish arts destined for catching foxes. But such troubles are deserved by the prodigious ingratitude and inconstancy of the people. Albert still has some remaining banners of soldiers in the town of Schweinfurt and Blassemburg intact, and in both places, the nerve of the war is only with other necessities, which are sufficient for prolonging the war. The confederates (as they are called) from Heidelberg are said to be about to negotiate peace, but without much hope of success. Nothing about the diet nor the council. Our Lycosthenes, aided by the prayers of the churches, has begun to recover somewhat and now stammers with his tongue, who also read your letters, which I presented myself, with great refreshment of spirit and wished to thank you through me. Farewell in the Lord, most distinguished man, with all yours. Basel, January 7, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>The Queen of England sent 9 cargo ships to Spain along with her legate to summon the groom, who is thought to be coming in the future spring, perhaps in March. Meanwhile, on December 20, she proclaimed under penalty of death that no one should speak openly about the imperial or Spanish marriages.</p>
