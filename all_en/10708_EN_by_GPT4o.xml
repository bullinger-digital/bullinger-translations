      <p>Grace and peace, Bullinger, friend and esteemed in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I read what you added to Capito's letter about me. But consider, my brother, since heart and soul should be one among the saints, how it befits us to so neglect the dissensions of the saints. Those who are swine and dogs are worthy of silence; the weak, erring, and sinners from the Lord's flock are preserved, brought back, and instructed by the word of God.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, you could have responded to what I call your faith regarding the meeting so clearly and even with an oath promised. Faith is of the utmost importance to the saints. Let us remember that we are men and learn the image of Christian friendship from the scriptures.</p>
      <p>Farewell. God is love, and love is what Paul preaches in 1 Corinthians 13. Greet Leo and the others, and if we worship one Christ, let it be our primary concern to be one in Him.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, November 2.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Be assured about the French affairs. Our republic has so far pursued other plans, and the Lord defends it from private plans. We, however, embrace those who fear God in every nation and confidently expect from Christ in rejecting men who deserve such fruits. Outside of Christ, all mortals are lost; in Christ, all [...]. For there is much that we must openly exhort even among the chosen and in ourselves.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man M. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed colleague and brother in the Lord.</p>
