      <p>Greetings. I cannot write more. Therefore, be content with these brief words, beloved brother. I have received your letters; I cannot respond to everything as I am hindered and overwhelmed by other matters. Our common response to Brentius's testament, which they published against us, full of venom and slander, is being printed. Perhaps in eight days, God willing, I will send it to you once printed. I am also sending the elegant judgment of Urbanus Rhegius on punishing heretics. I have also ensured that my judgment, presented to our magistrate many years ago, is included. However, see to it that you return it safely along with Beza's book, which I gladly lend to you for a longer time; for I am entirely yours and what is mine is yours. Rhegius's judgment is elegant and well-supported; I know it will please you. But what do you say about the expulsion? I hope you will not be expelled. However, if you are expelled for defending the truth, you know where to turn. But hope for better things and pray to the Lord to grant better things. Our Gwalther is responding to Lentulus. I see that excommunication is the mother of many new controversies. But since we have a Christian magistrate, why is it not requested from him to restrain the wicked and himself exclude the impenitent, as you now tell me about the commissioners sent to Valtellina? Grain has never been sold at a higher price here than today. May the Lord have mercy on us! My Zwingli of blessed memory did not fall and die in the sacred pulpit, but he began to fall ill there before he began to preach, and he was carried home, where after a few hours he peacefully passed away at home. I cannot write more, I am forced to break off the letter.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you and bless your household! Greet the most honorable men, the consuls, Pontisella, Gregor, Bonet, especially Campell; be fearless and strong in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 9, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
