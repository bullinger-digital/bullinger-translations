      <p>S. P. The reason I am responding to your letters later than I should have, most honorable Bullinger, is due to continuous, troublesome, and laborious matters, especially concerning my dearest wife who is still ill. These matters have left me with almost no leisure time for studying, let alone writing. She was gravely ill for a long time, then began to recover somewhat, but in such a way that required even greater care and concern. Recently, on the advice of doctors, I brought her to Basel; there she is being cared for most diligently by her parents. I hope she will recover, but that is by the grace of our Savior Jesus Christ and the constant prayers of the pious. Having returned to Strasbourg, the first bit of leisure I found, before finally returning to my studies, I decided to spend entirely on writing letters to friends (for I had to reply to many) and especially to you. Therefore, in the first place, as is fitting, I respond to yours: That you have recommended your son to me with such zeal, not only in your letters but also in those of our Celius, is indeed unnecessary. For what could you ask of me that I do not owe much more to you and all yours, not only because of our common profession of piety but also because of our private friendship? Therefore, as far as I am concerned, he will be as recommended to me as Heinrich was and as anyone ever could be, and I will not fail him in any matter, provided he does not fail himself and is not ashamed to use my help privately, as Heinrich his brother did, whenever he judges it to be useful to him in any way. For I wish to benefit him not only publicly in school but also privately at home, as much as I can. To Heinrich, who, as long as he was with us, diligently and (I believe) attentively listened to my lectures, both theological and philosophical, I give this testimony, which can be given to an honorable student, of piety, integrity, and love of learning; but I accuse him of excessive modesty, by which he is accustomed to be held back more than he should, so that he does not visit his teachers, especially friends, privately at home, to ask, request, and learn: I do not overlook that light thing which was often instilled in me as a boy: to ask often, to retain what is asked, to teach what is retained. These three things make a disciple... of the master. I fear that this other one, who has the same modesty, will do the same. Therefore, you, as a father, should admonish both sons with letters and encourage and animate them to take more courage. I promise all my effort, study, diligence, in short, all my resources and myself entirely to you and yours, I only ask that you continue to love me as you have begun. Farewell. I bid all those learned and pious men there to be well. You will know that the little book by Mr. Calvin on the Eucharistic matter has so irritated the adversaries that they shamelessly added a certain treatise against us in a little book, in which they try to prove that the body of Christ is everywhere. O impudent impiety. To what end has it come, when oaths are sworn on the words of men! They stir up this whole commotion to show that they want to stand by the words: this is the body, etc., and not deviate a hair's breadth from it, and afterwards they are not ashamed to affix such a title to that book, which has never been seen in the sacred writings nor in the fathers, indeed which is contrary to the sacred writings, the creed, the doctrine of all the fathers, and all human reason. The Papists want to defend all things papal because they have sworn to the pope and for this reason, they are idolaters; but I fear that many others have now sworn to another man in such a way that they have decided to defend even his (forgive me) farts as articles of faith and voices sent down from heaven. Indeed, God must be asked to finally have mercy on his church. I write this not without the greatest pain of mind, especially since here it is not allowed to speak even a word about these matters at present, indeed not even to open one's mouth. But even if not directly, I am forced to strike obliquely, whether they like it or not. The Lord will be my helper. Again, farewell, most excellent lord, and ask the Lord also for me and my wife, that he may restore her to me soon. Strasbourg, September 25, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Hieronymus Zanchus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and most worthy pastor Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a friend and as a most revered father.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
