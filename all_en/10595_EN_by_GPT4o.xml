    <p xml:id="regest1">Like Myconius, he believes that the Strasbourg doctors should focus more on the conditions in their own church; their opinions on the concord issue have given the French king a reason for the persecutions, as can be seen from his letters to the German [imperial estates]. Welcomes Strasbourg's actions [against the Anabaptists]. Myconius sent his preface to Zwingli's "Opus articulorum" in anticipation of a response to the statements contained therein about the Lord's Supper issue. Myconius is not insignificant to him and his people. He cannot yet report anything certain about the gathering of an army in Merano. Inquires about who initiated the preparations for the siege of Münster.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>You are indeed right, esteemed brother, regarding the Strasbourg doctors. They are curious about foreign churches, while being more negligent and lenient than is appropriate in their own. If only they would take care of their own affairs at home! What they have achieved with their advice written to France about mending concord is testified by that fabricated document dedicated to the Germans. There, it almost admits that the king took the opportunity to rage against the wretched from those counsels. But examine for yourself what the king has written. How truly vain is that most disgraceful rascal! How inconsistent are the things he writes to the Germans and what he commands in his own kingdom! But let us allow him to fill the measure of his fathers, so that he may also receive the reward of the fathers.</p>
      <p>What you write about the Strasbourg doctors has filled me with uncommon joy. For I once feared that what happened in Münster might also occur in Strasbourg, which we lament. But may the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>I knew that you had long possessed Zwingli's articles written in that language by the author, which Leo had translated into Latin, so I did not think it necessary to send them. I have now sent the Apology, which you had not seen before, primarily because I seemed to have dealt with the matter of the Eucharist not obscurely and thus satisfied some contentious individuals for our common cause. I awaited your judgment.</p>
      <p>Although you may be "nothing" to some haughty individuals, to me and mine, you are not nothing. Meanwhile, we are nothing, all of us who are servants of God. The grace of the Lord, which has been given to us, must be praised in all things.</p>
      <p>Opinions have varied about the army gathered in Merano. What some report is inauspicious for us and the gospel of Christ. Comander, the Bishop of Chur, suspects something, but I will write more about this matter when I have more certain information.</p>
      <p>You will inform me who is gathering an army against Münster and who dared to impose a tribute of 2000 gold coins on your city.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 19, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the people of Basel, his esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
