      <p> Greetings. When the letter from our Morellius was delivered to me the day before yesterday, this messenger conveniently presented himself, through whom I could inform you that it was most welcome to me. But adverse health, which kept me in bed this morning, prevented me from replying to you as I had planned. Although I had already excused myself to the messenger, I preferred to utter a few words rather than send him away completely empty-handed. I will soon send a defense of our Consensus. But I now warn you in advance that the writing will be neither precisely polished nor of great labor: so that you do not perhaps promise yourself something excellent. </p>
      <p> I write nothing about the state of our affairs, except that we are still in doubt: because through the laziness of our people, it is allowed for the wicked to play no less boldly than with impunity. Meanwhile, I am being more than atrociously slandered by our neighbors. For the preachers of the Bernese countryside proclaim me a heretic worse than all the papists from the pulpit. And the more insolently anyone rages against me, the more favor and support he gains for himself. </p>
      <p> Since I have sufficiently experienced that nothing is to be hoped for from our brothers, whom these injuries ought to have affected, I remain silent and as if mute. Nor will it be through me that the wicked do not satisfy themselves, and even the envious are satiated. Meanwhile, the Lord will look down from heaven and avenge. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother to be sincerely respected by me. Greet in my name Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalther, Zwingli, the noblemen, your wife, and family. </p>
      <p> May the Lord keep you all, govern you with His spirit, and pursue you with every kind of blessing. I do not respond to Mr. Charles de Moulin, because I wrote a little before. I am not a little afraid that his peevishness may harm the defense of a good cause. Farewell again. My colleagues and many friends respectfully greet you. Geneva, September 18, 1554. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Calvin. </p>
      <p> To the distinguished minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed and upright brother and fellow minister. </p>
