    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger is to forward the important letter [from Lorenzo Torrentino] to [Johannes] Oporin in Basel with a reliable messenger. - The St. Gallen merchant Huldrych Sclappritz had brought from Italy the recently printed work in Rome by the excellent theologian Theodoret of Cyrus, De Providentia [Sermones X], which Vadian [with a letter not preserved] was allowed to gift to Bullinger. - Now it is reported that currently in Rome, the commentary of Eustathios [of Thessalonica] on the entire Homer, an unpublished piece [“Electra”] by Euripides, as well as other writings of excellent authors, which were recently discovered in the Vatican Library, are being printed. Vadian can only marvel that a den of vice [like Rome] begins to promote the fine arts in such critical times as these. - Pope [Paul III] supports the council more than ever before, but only one that confirms his nonsense and over which he maintains control. - There is no news from the [Schmalkaldic League] in Frankfurt, which is supposed to last longer. - [Johannes] Kessler has already read [the biographical notes] on twelve abbots [of the “Small Chronicle”]. By the upcoming 1st of December [correct: January], [everything] with the explanations intended for Bullinger and [Johannes] Stumpf will be sent to Zurich [Vadian BW VI 487-493, No. 1442]. Vadian has presented the events from the 10th century onwards in the treatment of the various monks in a way that no other author, not even a monk, has ever done. Moreover, until now there was neither a Latin nor a German account of the last six abbots [of St. Gallen], [Kaspar von Breitenlandenberg, Ulrich Rösch, Gotthard Giel von Glattburg, Franz Geißberg, Kilian Germann, and Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee].</p>

      <p> Greetings. I ask that the enclosed letters be sent to Oporin in Basel by a reliable messenger. I am reluctant to burden you with such tasks; however, since there are no couriers at hand to whom I could entrust them, and I certainly would not want them to be lost, I have deemed it worthwhile to trouble you, even though you are very busy, rather than entrust them to someone of uncertain reliability. Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus, who wrote several books on Providence (recently printed in Rome), was brought to me from Italy by Huldrych Sclappritz, a merchant from our region, and I wished to give it to you as a gift, theologian to theologian and wise man to wise man. It is reported that in Rome, the entire commentary of Eustathios on Homer is now being printed, along with an as-yet-unpublished play by Euripides and other notable authors, which the Vatican Library has recently provided to some who were diligently searching. They also say that some quite valuable Latin authors are being printed, which makes me wonder how, by the grace of God, this den of vice and doctrines has begun to promote the fine arts in such turbulent times. But the Muses have their patrons everywhere, and perhaps it is not surprising that in that city, once the capital of literature, there are those who look favorably upon the fine arts and wish to support the ancient humanism. - The Pope is once again pushing for his council and is more determined than ever, but he wants to hold it on his own terms and be the lord and master of it; he is going about it with wild gestures. Time will reveal this. We have heard nothing from Frankfurt, and if the reports are true, they will not come to an agreement anytime soon. May God grant that good may come of it! - Kessler has read about the twelve abbots, and by the upcoming Kalends of December, they will be sent there along with my writings explaining my counsel, which both you and our Stumpf should read. I seem to have uncovered the local affairs from nine hundred years ago, and indeed uncovered them in such a way that I do not doubt that no one, not even the monks themselves, has a better account of the main events and deeds than what I have included here and there. Moreover, the history of the last six abbots has not been recorded in either Latin or the vernacular, which is especially worthy of knowing. Farewell. St. Gallen, December 30, 1545. Your Vadianus. </p>
      <p> To the most pious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the illustrious city of Zurich, my most esteemed lord. </p>
