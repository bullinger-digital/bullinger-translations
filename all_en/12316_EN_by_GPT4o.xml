    <p xml:id="regest1">An answer to the question of whether believers are allowed to ally with non-Christians is difficult to provide. - On one hand, it is noted that the alliances that the people of God made with, among others, the Syrians and the Assyrians mostly ended badly. Therefore, it would be better to avoid such alliances as much as possible. - On the other hand, if a neighbor, whose religion is not entirely pure, lives in good harmony [with the Protestants] without persecuting their religion, one may ally with them if it is beneficial and the situation requires it. Thus, Abraham allied with the Canaanites, David with pagan kings, and Solomon with Hiram. Furthermore, the Lord says: "Whoever is not against us is for us" (Mark 9:40). Therefore, those who do not persecute or fight [the Protestants] should not be regarded as enemies or dogs. - In general, however, the believer must remain cautious, avoid trusting people (whether believers or non-believers), and ensure that they can always practice their faith freely. If they were not allowed to form an alliance, they would also not be allowed to live in any city that is not of entirely pure faith, especially since they must commit to the authority of the city. - Therefore, if one can forgo an alliance, they should do so. If not, one may enter into such an alliance as long as the faith remains free, even if [the partner] is not ideal. - Often, one allies with people considered to be very devout, [whereas] sometimes people one is wary of are more devout [than assumed]. Here, one needs God's guidance and should take their time. - This opinion, written in haste, should remain confidential.</p>

      <p>It is quite dangerous to answer your question; for who can deal with worldly matters without somehow staining themselves? Your question is whether believers can also ally with non-Christians.</p>
      <p>However, I see well that the alliances that the believing kings of God's people made with the unbelieving Syrians, Assyrians, etc., mostly turned out badly. Therefore, the safest course is for those who can and may, to avoid such alliances. And the scriptures that serve this purpose are Deuteronomy 7:1-4, Isaiah 30:1-3, and 31:1, 3, etc.</p>
      <p>However, where there are people who are not entirely pure and true to our religion, yet live in harmony and do not persecute our religion but tolerate it, and if there is some significant benefit and reasonable cause, to make some understanding (alliance) with them, I could not advise any of God's people against it. For Abraham, our father, made and kept alliances according to his need with the Canaanites, David with some pagan kings, and Solomon with Hiram. The Lord says in Mark 9:40: "Whoever is not against us is for us," etc. Therefore, those who do not threaten our faith, who let us be and do not attack us, should not be considered open enemies and nothing should be wished upon them, nor should they be treated contemptuously like dogs, for more harm than good would likely be done.</p>
      <p>And in this matter, a believing heart will seek a way to avoid trusting and relying on either believing or unbelieving allies, and to keep the faith free, not surrendering it to anyone. If a believer cannot do this, then they cannot move to a place that is not entirely of pure and true faith, where they bind and subject themselves to the authority of the city.</p>
      <p>Whoever can stay out of it does well. But whoever cannot find a place to go must and may settle there, yet keep their faith pure. Thus, I think it is not unreasonable to make an understanding with those who are not entirely just.</p>
      <p>We often make understandings with people we consider very devout. But those we avoid are sometimes more devout. Therefore, the matter is slippery (dangerous, uncertain). One must pray to God for advice and help. But time and occasion sometimes provide counsel.</p>
      <p>Given as above in haste. Since I heard that the cart had not yet left, I wrote this quickly. I ask you to keep it to yourself and show it to no one.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, well-learned, pious, and faithful Master Ambrosius Blarer, preacher in Konstanz, his honorable dear lord.</p>
