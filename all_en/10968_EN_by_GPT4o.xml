    <p xml:id="regest1">The Basel council rightly considers the [response drafted at the meeting from November 12-14] to Luther as insufficient, as despite the agreement reached, an explicit approval [of the Wittenberg Concord] is missing, and suggests a change to the Zurich council; Myconius asks Bullinger to take up the matter. In Bern, Erasmus [Ritter], who fears for his reputation due to the dispute with Benedikt [Burgauer], is planning something in connection with Bucer's "Retraction"; he should be admonished. Bullinger's response to the criticism of a letter from the Bernese is based on a misunderstanding: the remark did not refer to the opinion of the Bernese Synod [from October 17]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The day before I wrote this, our council read the common response to Luther, which, when read to the end, affected some so much that they hardly (this in your ear) recognized it as a response. I speak only of the preface. In this, neither was it affirmed nor denied (which the people of Strasbourg especially request in its name), for which we all expended some effort. So they say. And indeed, when the words are rightly considered, we are almost compelled to say the same. For those things which you sent described in your last letters and called the crux of the matter, what do they have other than: Thus far we have taught, and if this is your opinion, it seems that it is equal to and not contrary to our faith and our confession; therefore, we will also teach thus in the future. And what kind of response, I ask, is that to Luther's request? He wants us to respond clearly to his articles, whether they please us or not. However, among us it was agreed: They please us, provided the opinion is as the declaration of the people of Strasbourg contains; for then the articles do not seem contrary to our confession, but consonant. Therefore, unless we respond in this way, Luther will not have the response he requested. Thus, concord is lost, which we do not wish. This is the reason why our people are sending letters to that council at present, if they can persuade them to agree to the proposed formula. You should indeed act with all your might, so that they agree, since nothing at all has been cut off from the entire opinion, indeed not even changed. You strive, and rightly so, that we do not depart from you; strive also that we are not compelled to do what you fear. This will indeed happen now, if you agree that we give a response that does not expose us to ridicule by all. Indeed, I cannot indicate in time what is inept in that writing; however, I want you to review it more diligently, and you will undoubtedly find inept and obscure things, which if they should be sent to that sharp-nosed one, he would certainly use them against us. I ask you, consider these things well.</p>
      <p>The people of Bern are doing everything rightly. Erasmus [Ritter] is attempting something among his people because of Bucer's Retraction. The restless man fears for his reputation concerning the matter against Benedikt [Burgauer]. I wish to be admonished by letters; for he disregards me because I disagree with him in that cause.</p>
      <p>What you responded about the people of Bern is entirely superfluous; for I was speaking of the last response, although more obscurely; you understood it as the response of the brothers, which nevertheless pleased me and everyone at the beginning.</p>
      <p>Do, most friendly of friends, that the response is sent off with equal consent, so that we may finally hear what Luther's disposition is towards us.</p>
      <p>Farewell always with your people. Greet Leo, Pellican, and Theodor.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 12, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief bishop of the people of Zurich, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
