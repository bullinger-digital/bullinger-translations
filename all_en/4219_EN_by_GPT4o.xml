      <p>Greetings. I am still engaged in my labors; therefore, I will be brief.</p>
      <p>We are doing quite well here by the grace of God; I hope you are also in good health. Your letters have been delivered to me in good faith.</p>
      <p>I thank you for your diligence.</p>
      <p>I have nothing at present worthy of you.</p>
      <p>I leave it to your discretion whether to accept Augustine or not. I believe Mr. Gessner is occasionally gifted with manuscripts by friends, and our law among other things states that a good lord or friend, as has always been the custom, may take from his own goods and give gifts without danger. However, I have never wanted to accept anything of any significance from the envoys of kings. I gave several books to Cognetius; he sent me Theophylact on the 4 Gospels; I, in turn, sent him others to repay him, etc. I can hardly believe that Philip of Spain will allow the Pope to use Milan at his own discretion. Ferdinand and Philip do not agree well because of Milan.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the cardinals will order this pope to die. I have long since handed over the miserable horse to you, dead and alive, boiled and roasted; take what you can, I want nothing of it here; the crows may carry it away on the road. What you take is gain; for I am always worried that, in addition to all costs, I must also pay the executioner's fee. Therefore, sell it as you can and as if it were your own.</p>
      <p>My son Stoffel has always been fond of horses and riding; God has placed him on a miserable donkey, if he would become wise, it would be a good little horse. But joking aside; I give you full power to sell, etc.</p>
      <p>I will always show myself grateful to you.</p>
      <p>Pay the price to the smith; I will repay everything in good faith.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet Mr. Philipp, Pontasella, the consuls, the envoy, and all friends.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 23, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
