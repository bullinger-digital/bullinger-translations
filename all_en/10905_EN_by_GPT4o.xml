      <p>My friendly, willing service to you.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, I thank you for the friendly and Christian little book that you have sent me. If I can repay you, I will be willing to do so.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, I have heard that the mayor of Lucerne and an envoy from Schwyz are currently in Zurich. What they intend to negotiate, I do not know. Dear Master Heinrich, my request to you is, if it is possible and does not harm you, that you let me know what your opinion is. For the people are deceitful; if they could cause us harm, even under a different pretense, they would not hesitate to do so.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, they have written to me about the wedding, that I should be at the inn on the first day of August. God willing, I will come. But I will now go to Bern to do my annual accounting on the 28th day of July this month. Whatever I can do to serve you, I would always gladly do. I will quickly return home.</p>
      <p>And greet for me Mr. Lafider and Heinrich and Master Leu and other good brothers. Nothing more, except God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given on the 19th day of July, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant</p>
      <p>Bitzius Haller, chief magistrate of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, venerable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and friend.</p>
