      <p>S. Recently, I wrote to you about various matters; I thought Mr. Jacob Zorn would leave early today. However, he is still here today, which is why I want to inform you immediately about what was handled today. My lords, the schoolmasters, have come together.</p>
      <p>Zebed√§us is being transferred to Yverdon, a measure and order for the colloquies has been prescribed, from which all discord has arisen so far, also 2 boys from Zurich are being transferred to Lausanne, as you will understand from the common letter. Today, after we came from each other, the man from Locarno arrives; I was with him at the governor's; he has summoned us for tomorrow for the council. I suspect that the messenger will be given instructions for the day in Baden.</p>
      <p>Once it is completed, I will also write to Myconius and inform you how it went. God be with you. August 23.</p>
      <p>You may also write to Myconius and Zwingli in the meantime. Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
