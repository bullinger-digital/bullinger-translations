      <p> Greetings. Today, honorable lord and godfather, I received your letter through this messenger of your city, and since he is about to depart on the same day, I cannot respond to you as fully as I would like, nor can I send back the response of the people of Glarus given to our Pagans. This same cause also greatly afflicts me, as I see how little spirit there is in those who nonetheless profess to be servants of the King of Kings and who seem to fight not for perishable, but for paternal and immortal glory. I fear this one thing: if ever something serious were to be undertaken, namely that our spirits would fail us; for we see how cold everything is if something is to be done with these people. Therefore, it is necessary that the Lord rouses us and gives us courage; otherwise, all is lost. I had hoped they would go to Italy, the ancient cemetery of the Swiss, so that we might be more at peace in the meantime; but I think this journey will be in vain. Nevertheless, we will call upon the Lord, who has so far thwarted their plans, to continue to break them in the future as well. As for your exposition, we eagerly await it. What we are to say has already been made clear to you. We wish to publish everything that contributes to the destruction of Babylon and the erection of the kingdom of Christ. Nothing seems too harsh or unworthy of such wickedness to us. For there is no tongue that can adequately express, nor any hand that can sufficiently depict and describe this mystery of iniquity. But you see how minds and judgments vary. Apiarius himself has made this work suspect to many and has thus slandered Froschauer. If he had kept silent, perhaps no suspicion would have arisen about this. But we are well aware not only of your learning but also of the prudence you use in your writings, so that we cannot imagine anyone taking offense at your writing. Therefore, as much as it is in us, we will strive to have it printed, and we will consider it a great favor that you deign to entrust your labors to us. But what if you dedicated this work to our senate and in this way, by having it printed under their authority, you would accomplish it conveniently. You would certainly do something not unworthy of yourself, and very pleasing to them, and they would more willingly consent to the publication if their name were attached. </p>
      <p> You can think about these things yourself according to your prudence. Moreover, I cannot refrain from pouring out to you the great sorrow of my soul. For on October 29th, that most illustrious man and most pious heart, Wolfgang von Erlach, passed away, whom this republic certainly did not have a similar one and in whom the hopes of great things were placed. His death seems to portend a great evil; for no one else could have been moved with such great detriment to the republic and all good things as he. However, I will write more soon. </p>
      <p> Farewell. May your house be safe, furthermore, Lord Peter Martyr, Lord Gualther, your sons-in-law, and the other brothers. All of ours greet you. </p>
      <p> Bern, November 16, 1556. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, most esteemed and beloved lord and godfather. M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich. </p>
