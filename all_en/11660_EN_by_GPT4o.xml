    <p xml:id="regest1">Received the letter that Vadian sent from [the Diet in] Baden [on March 20] and is pleased about St. Gallen's victory [in the dispute with Appenzell regarding the market admission of Appenzell linen]. Thanks for the German-language writing directed against Schwenckfeld [Manuscript to BZD C 315]; [Konrad] Pellikan likes it; Bullinger has not yet read it due to many obligations. His commentary on Matthew is now in print. When [Christoph] Froschauer returns from Frankfurt, he will discuss with him a publication of [Vadian's] writing; suggests regarding the author's indication, the writing should be described as "extracted by a Christian brother from Vadian's works." [Oswald] Myconius writes [No. 1614] that he has not received any reliable news from Speyer, only the persistent rumor that the estates wanted to grant the Emperor [Charles V] 8000 horsemen and 40000 foot soldiers; if King [Ferdinand] adds another 28000 foot soldiers, there is good hope of recapturing Hungary. There is great hope that the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] will accept the Gospel. Asks for news from Hungary. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I received your letter, most learned Vadian, written from Baden, and I rejoice with you over the victory achieved. I give my greatest thanks for your German book laboriously written against Schwenckfeld's impious questions and shared with me. Pellikan has read it, and he is pleased; indeed, he cannot sufficiently praise your pious and learned mind with ample acclaim. As for myself, to tell the truth, I have not yet read it; for I must preach so often, repeat biblical and public lectures so often, and finally, both domestic and public affairs pull me in different directions, so that sometimes I lament my fate a little impatiently. Meanwhile, as you have seen, Matthew has begun to be printed, illustrated with our commentaries. A sheet is printed every day; unless I write, compose, correct, and publish it simultaneously, it cannot be made public by the next Frankfurt fair or by the beginning of August, nor has Froschauer printed it so far without enormous loss. Since he has gone to Frankfurt in good time, I have not discussed the printing of the book with him. When he returns after the festival, I will speak with him, and if any time or leisure is granted in the meantime, I will learn what you have written, not to add a critical stone, but to learn what can be objected to such impious tricks. As for the author to whom the work is attributed, the title that seems most fitting to me is: Extracted and arranged by a Christian brother from the books of Vadian, etc. - Myconius writes that he has received nothing certain from Speyer, except that the rumor is consistently spread that the estates have promised to give the Emperor 8000 horsemen and 40000 foot soldiers, and if the King adds 28000, he is hopeful that Hungary can be recovered; there is great hope that the Archbishop of Cologne will accept the Gospel. I have written these things to you in haste, so as not to write nothing. You, for your humanity and piety, love me, consider these things of ours kindly, and if you have any news about Hungarian affairs, share it, etc. Farewell. The last day of March 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed and dear lord.</p>
