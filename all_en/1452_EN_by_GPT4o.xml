      <p>Greetings. For your letters and the new matters you shared with me, I am very grateful to you. I wish that at the next assembly, the spirits of the Swiss may be so united that they realize they have been false prophets, who, led by not insignificant conjectures, rightly seem to themselves to foresee differently. Indeed, such a constant consensus of minds would be a great terror even to that most powerful Emperor, who has held power from the beginning of his reign through evil arts rather than strength. Therefore, we pray with our churches to the one Lord of earth and heaven, that we may soon see peace and a better state of affairs.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I received letters from Augsburg, in which they write that the Emperor will certainly winter there with his forces, and that a truce of several months has already been agreed with the people of Magdeburg, because the Emperor's soldiers are to be sent to Piedmont.</p>
      <p>A legate from the side of the Pope is expected in Lyon at any moment, who will negotiate the conditions of peace with the French.</p>
      <p>A pious merchant from Augsburg writes that the Frenchman in Lyon has obtained from the English and the Venetians that they lift his recently born son from the sacred font, and that a Venetian legate has already come to Lyon for this reason, and will then proceed directly to the king.</p>
      <p>Daily reports are written about the ferocity and horrendous cruelty of the Turks, and nowhere do just aids appear by which the most wretched Christians might be avenged of those evils as is fitting; thus, indeed, we will be utterly and shortly destroyed by the sword of that erotic enemy and by our own deceptions and betrayals, unless we soon adopt different spirits.</p>
      <p>If by chance you wish to know anything about my own affairs, I am well here with mine, and indeed, since it seemed good to the Lord to separate me entirely from my best friends, I prefer to be here than anywhere else; for I measure myself by my own foot, as I ought, and I give thanks to Christ, the prince of shepherds, that he wished to impose such a burden on me, his veteran soldier, which, aided by his helping hand, I see I can somehow bear with these little shoulders.</p>
      <p>Hold me bound by the bonds of your charity, as you have for many years, and diligently commend me to the heavenly Father through his Son Christ with pious patronage.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers, your fellow ministers, along with the other most distinguished men and our friends, especially your most holy wife with your sweetest children, for whom I earnestly pray that Christ may eternally favor them. My dearest Funck, who reverently greets you and commends himself to you, no differently than if he were a true son, the staff of my old age and part of my soul. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Biel/Bienne, October 29, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his not only esteemed but by far the best brother of all. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
