    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blasius and [Luzi Heim] received Bullinger's letter [not received] through merchants along with Emperor Charles V's proposition for the [Augsburg] Diet. They forwarded Bullinger's letter intended for [Francesco] Negri [not received] to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Last week, Blasius was in Chiavenna as well as in the Valtellina towns of Traona and Caspano. There, a successor was chosen for the preacher [...] expelled from Caspano, namely the noble Doctor Raphael Paravicini. This will trouble the devil once again! In Chiavenna, there is a serious dispute between Agostino Mainardi and Camillo Renato regarding the sacraments. While Mainardi holds the view that the sacraments confirm God's covenants, Renato is against it. Since both have a truly Italian temperament, there will be much trouble!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Verified news came from Italy regarding the Emperor. His troops cunningly and treacherously took Parma and Piacenza. Duke Pier Luigi Farnese was stabbed [in Piacenza] and thrown out of the castle. [Galeotto II. Pico della] Mirandola arrived [to help] an hour and a half too late and withdrew with his mercenaries back to Mirandola.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings and blessings. In haste.</p>

      <p>Last week, I was in Chiavenna and in the Valtellina towns of Traona and Caspano, where another minister was appointed in place of the expelled one; a doctor and nobleman they chose, named Dr. Raphael Paravicini. Without a doubt, Satan will once again cause trouble, etc. In Chiavenna, I found a harmful contention between Agostino and Camillo regarding the sacraments: Agostino wants the sacraments, which confirm God's covenants; Camillo opposes it. I am concerned it will serve as a great scandal, as they are truly Italian temperaments, etc.</p>
