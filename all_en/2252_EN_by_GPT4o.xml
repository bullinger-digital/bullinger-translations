      <p>S. P. If I have any news, I send it to your masters, so I do not repeat myself, and you will have this hastily from me, so that you know that the son of the Emperor is expected every hour in Flanders to complete the English marriage. Meanwhile, as I received yesterday through letters written from London twelve days ago, that queen exercises unheard-of tyranny. For she has already killed about four hundred of the best and noble men, and the same fate is expected for her own sister Isabella; for she was captured twenty days ago, and the utmost justice is being applied to her. Among us, arms are being prepared, as you know, and there is no other hope than that the Lord will be present. I will be in Baden on Sunday, from where, if I have any news, I will share it with you. Farewell, most excellent one. From Solothurn, April 5th.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassefontaneus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
      <p>This letter belongs to Mr. Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
