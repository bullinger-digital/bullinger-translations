      <p>Greetings. That (reverend father in Christ) you, out of your love for me, most dutifully share with me everything that you judge to be of interest to us, is incredibly pleasing and delightful to me. If only I could someday repay your many merits towards me with my own services. What you write about the massacre of the French, I had already learned from Mr. Coignet, who, as to his intimate friend, did not hesitate to entrust the whole matter to me as it happened. I could indeed have written the same to you, had not Mr. Coignet assured me that he intended to go directly to you, and I truly wonder where he might be lingering in the meantime; for it has been a long time since he left us. Mr. Coignet added that Duke Guise would soon pass through here; for the king has summoned him from Italy; he will succeed in the place of the constable, whom Mr. Coignet reported to be seriously wounded or to have fallen in battle or to have come into the power of the enemy. Meanwhile, since the Christians are in extreme danger in France, Mr. Coignet advised that intervention should be made with Duke Guise both in words and in writing; for he thought that an opportunity for a successful action had now been presented; for we are usually more favorable to those who are afflicted when our own affairs are in distress. Therefore, the petition which we decided to offer to the duke, the summary of which we will also diligently pursue in words, if only we are given the opportunity to approach him, I now send to you.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt, however, that he will also pass through your area. If you were to attack him with the same forces as we do, or even stronger ones, our mutual assistance would greatly strengthen the goodness of the cause. From Italy, there is no news, except that a certain plague, spread by German soldiers, is claiming many lives. Antonius Corvinus, the son of Antonius Corvinus, recently passed through here, who, because he was in poor or almost desperate health, wanted me to be summoned to him by his host.</p>
      <p>He, a man of very tall stature, followed a Saxon knight who serves the Emperor and preached the gospel in the camp. He says there were about 600 of them; of these, 300 remain; for two hundred have died, and a hundred are still lying on the stretcher. However, he has never been at the real battlefield, so he could not tell me anything certain about it. These Saxons (he says) have moved into the land of the Duke of Ferrara to show themselves as enemies.</p>
      <p>He says that the imperial soldiers were paid very poorly, and that he and his men, during the time they were in Italy, never received any pay. Mr. Coignet reports that our soldiers are returning home miserably, those who can come at all; for as soon as their commander comes, like Froelich (who is also expected), it will be dangerous for them. From the Bündner, six companies have gone away, there are hardly 800 soldiers among them, half of whom are Bündner, if one counts goatherds and all together.</p>
      <p>They have all passed through here, oh God, it is a gathered little people; if they have to save France, it will go rough. Antoni Notz, the quartermaster of Captain Froelich, rode through here, stayed a little while in Appenzell due to illness; he told me that Captain Clam was at the Landsgemeinde in Schwyz; for as far as they allowed the king's soldiers, those from Appenzell also granted soldiers to Captain Clam.</p>
      <p>He brought home some news that 10 from the community of Schwyz had sworn together with an oath (among them was also a bailiff from the village) to risk their lives and property to bring the matter to the point that all foreign princes and lords must go idle, etc. They went barefoot on a pilgrimage to Einsiedeln for this purpose, and presented this intention at the community on the 15th of August, though modestly, and in summary, the whole community of Schwyz has sworn off all pensions, rents, gifts, and service money under the loss of honor and property, also to swear into the land and not more out of it. Antonius Notz claimed to have heard this from Clam himself.</p>
      <p>How long it will last, God knows well, without any doubt as long as before. These things hastily, as you see; therefore, forgive me, I beg you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ; the lords consuls, Mr. Philipp, Mr. Pontisella, have instructed me to send you their greetings.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to all yours, especially to your wife, the most honorable matron, along with your entire family. What I asked you before, I now ask again: if you can conveniently, do not hesitate to commend me to the most honorable lords consuls, Mr. Habio and Mr. Müller, my most esteemed patrons.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, in Chur, the day before the calends of September in the year of our Lord 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
