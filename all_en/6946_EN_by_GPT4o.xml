      <p>Greetings. You will learn from the enclosed note what is happening with us; I also ask you to share it with Mr. Gwalther. The reports about Turkish or Hungarian affairs seem very doubtful to me. It is known that the Papists are once again nurturing some kind of monstrosity and are insinuating themselves very much with the Lutherans (who now everywhere are labeled as "confessionists," I believe from the Augsburg Confession, to be distinguished from the Calvinists) and are almost joining with them. However, their plans are disturbed like those of Ahithophel. I have nothing more to say now. I implore the Lord to always be with His own and to strengthen and preserve you. Farewell. Please convey my many greetings to Mr. Rodolph Gwalther, your consul, and other friends in my name. Given at my estate Bocksberg, 3 miles from the city, on November 12, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten. To the venerable, pious, and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
