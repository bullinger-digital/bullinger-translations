    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius thanks for [Bullinger's Commentary on Mark]. [In the accompanying letter, which has not been preserved], Bullinger complained that Myconius had not sent him his commentary on Mark [from 1538] despite asking twice. Myconius would not have done such a thing even in a dream. Myconius did comply with Pellikan's request for a copy. However, perhaps Bullinger's request reached him only when no copies were left, as Myconius could not have shown himself ungrateful to the thankful Bullinger. He has always hated ingratitude, which is why he recently complained about [Rudolf] Gwalther. - The Pope [Paul III] has summoned the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] to Rome within 60 days in a letter. Even Emperor [Charles V] is showing a hard stance against his confidant and ordered that he must present himself within 30 days. [Charles V] has taken the people of Cologne, the entire clergy, and the university under his imperial protection against the Archbishop in a [“Letter of Protection and Safeguard”]. The Archbishop renounces fame and continues to assert himself [further] against the Pope. Myconius would have sent copies of these writings if they existed and if he did not believe that Bullinger would receive these documents from Frankfurt. - Myconius could not keep Bullinger's communication about the Milanese Vicar [Giulio della Rovere] to himself; he reported it to the Mayor [Theodor Brand] and his brother Bernhard, who asked Myconius to send the copy [of Bullinger's message] to Strasbourg so that it could reach Landgrave Philip of Hesse from there. Even a messenger [...] was tasked with it. - Congratulations to Heinrich Buchter! Like Bullinger, Myconius is also pleased with the harmony of the brothers in [Zurich]. - The [student] and bearer Kaspar Schneeberger wishes to be carefully examined [by the people of Zurich], as his grandfather [Hans] accused him of ignorance and hurt him deeply. Markus [Bertschi] and Myconius advise handling Schneeberger cautiously, for if he is spoken to kindly, one is dealing with a good-natured person. - Bullinger should inform how the [people of Zurich] will react to the proposal of Schwenckfeld presented in Myconius’ last letter [No. 2243]. [Schwenckfeld] indulges too much in idleness. If he held a public office, he would adhere more to the simplicity of the [Holy] Scripture. - Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander] and Pellikan. - Markus [Bertschi] sends his regards back.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Once again, you have gratified me with a most excellent gift, for which may the Lord be your reward. However, you accuse me here of not sending my commentary on Mark to you, despite your asking twice. I speak before the Lord, if it had come to me even in a dream, I would not have refused. Dominus Pellicanus requested it, and I complied with him. Why would I not have been more obedient to you, if you had asked? It would have been shameful to offer my work unsolicited. "But I did ask," you say; perhaps at a time when none remained. For I know myself not to be ungrateful towards those who, like you, have burdened me with kindness. I have always hated ingratitude. This is why I recently accused Gwalther of this vice towards me, although I do not complain here that he does not gift me with his writings or speak well of me or do anything else of the sort, but because of something he did once (which I can hardly forget); from which his mind seemed not entirely sound towards a benevolent person.</p>
      <p>And he proved this once and again, so that I can no longer doubt. But let these things pass.</p>
      <p>The Pope has written very gravely against the Archbishop of Cologne. He summons him to Rome within 60 days from June 27. The Emperor acts equally cruelly against him, even though he is a relative. He commands him to appear before him within 30 days, wherever he may be, or before his commissioners. He has written to the people of Cologne, the entire clergy, and the university, and promises his defense as Emperor against the Archbishop concerning religion, rights, and their entire state. And here, if I have seen everything correctly, he renounces all glory to God and claims it for the Pope. I would have sent these if they were copied or if I were not persuaded that you would have everything from Frankfurt; for they are printed, although mine are written by hand. Hence, I am pleased with what you write, that you expect nothing from the Emperor but fire and sword.</p>
      <p>I could not contain what you wrote about the Milanese Vicar. I told the consul and Lord Bernhard, his brother; for which reason they asked me to send the copies to the people of Strasbourg, so that they might be conveyed to Hesse. And this matter seemed so important that they sent a messenger to Strasbourg. These things are for your bosom.</p>
      <p>Congratulate Lord Heinrich Buchter diligently in my name. I know him to be a good, prudent, and spirited man; may the Lord grant that he may complete his business steadfastly! You rejoice in the concord of the brothers of that church, and rightly so; for I have experienced that no greater evil can befall either publicly or privately than the discord of brothers, indeed I know what even the opinion of dissension among brothers brings among subjects. May the Lord Jesus remove this evil from the churches with His spirit, let us pray.</p>
      <p>Gaspar Schnebergius, who delivers this, asks through me that as soon as he arrives home, you diligently investigate what he knows of letters, what he does not know.</p>
      <p>For his grandfather, reproaching him, accused him of ignorance, and he bears this so impatiently that he has ordered me to write and ask thus. He wants to be known by you, whether he is such or not. If he is found to be unskilled and ignorant of letters, he offers himself to bear the evil; but if he is found to have spent his time well while here, he wishes to be treated as he deserves. Meanwhile, he hopes so excellently of himself that he expects uncommon praise from you. Come on! He is of such a nature that if you treat him well and praise him more than you blame him, he is quite tolerable, indeed good and pleasant. If you despise, vex, or mock him, he becomes utterly stupid. Therefore, I wish him to be treated according to his nature, lest he become useless. This is commonly agreed upon by Lord Marcus and me.</p>
      <p>Concerning the Schwenckfeldian counsel, about which I wrote to you last, let me know what is in mind. That man lives in excessive idleness, and therefore devotes himself to idle thoughts. If he were in public office, he would be restrained by serious matters, so that he would love the simplicity of the scriptures more.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with Theodor and Pellicanus. Basel, September 24, 1545.</p>
      <p>Marcus sends his regards back to you diligently.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, the most worthy bishop of the people of Zurich, his venerable lord and brother.</p>
