    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian wants to be precisely informed about Rudolf Gwalther's matter. Certainly, the [Nine Places] are all the more displeased with him because he is Huldrych Zwingli's son-in-law! Yet surely they would behave even more aggressively if the [Protestant] cities were not allowed to respond to slanders and attacks, especially those of the Pope [Paul III], and had to conceal their faith! How then could there be a beneficial extension of the alliance among the Confederates (which would allow the cities their religion)? And how could the cities maintain their religion over time if they are forbidden to defend their faith against the blasphemer [the Pope] and to address the disputed religious points? Yet this is entirely in line with the course of action advocated by the bishops and abbots in their secret conclaves!</p>

      <p>Joachim Vadian, on the third day before the Calends of February, 1547.</p>
      <p>I wish to be promptly and faithfully informed by you about the matters concerning Rudolf Gwalther. Do not doubt that all the more his cause is viewed unfavorably by the adversaries because he is the son-in-law of our Huldrych Zwingli. How easily, however, will they be oppressed if we are not allowed to respond to any slanderous calumnies and injuries, especially those of the Pope, and to give an account of our faith to the judging world! Will the safe conduct of the alliance, which asserts us in our religion, be preserved? How will we be able to remain in our faith if they do not allow us to defend it against the blasphemer and to bring all disputes to light? But this kind of strategy is promoted by the bishops and abbots in their secret gatherings.</p>
