      <p>Greetings. The letters you wrote to me, most honorable Bullinger, dated April 29th, from Strasbourg, finally arrived here in Worms along with the package of books on July 18th. From this, you can infer how risky it is to exchange anything between us, especially if it is somewhat large (like that package); add to this, if it is of any value, as it must pass through so many hands. Considering this, when Froschauer visited me at my home on his return from the spring fair, excusing himself for not bringing the books at that time and promising that once he returned to Zürich, he would send them to me as soon as possible, I reminded him, indeed I asked him, to do so; it would be more than enough if he brought them with him to the autumn fair in Frankfurt (which is now celebrated). However, as I understood from your letters and the package that arrived with them, you did not want to delay it that long; therefore, even though they reached my hands later than you expected, I owe you special thanks for your great inclination towards me, who is undeserving of such favor.</p>
      <p>I have already expressed as much gratitude as I could in words for the intended gift, and now that I have received it, what prevents me from expressing it again? And if I do not, I would rightly be considered ungrateful. Therefore, I express my thanks again and again, as much as I can, from my heart, which, as long as I live, will not be taken away by any length of time or any circumstance. But listen, most esteemed and excellent Bullinger, there is one thing I ask in return, through Him whom you serve so happily and tirelessly, Christ, that you do not disdain the small silver cup, which I entrusted to Froschauer to be given to you in my name, a humble gift indeed and less than your kindness towards me deserves, not considering the smallness of its price, but the sincerity of the heart from which it comes towards you, and let it be with you as the books you sent me are with me, a perpetual memorial of the friendship in Christ established between us.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, most honorable Bullinger, the day has finally dawned, by the kindness of the most merciful Father, that I, still surviving among mortals, can fulfill what I promised last year concerning the thousands. I have counted them out to Froschauer to be delivered to you, along with letters to the most honorable and holy order of your council, with an index written in our vernacular language, indicating how much silver, how much gold currency, and the various types of each are used today among us, that is, in that miserable and afflicted empire. I hope nothing will be lacking from the promised sum; if anything is lacking, if life accompanies me until then, I will make it up at the spring fair with interest, for which if the obligations are sent to me, it will be sufficient and more than enough.</p>
      <p>I would write more about the troubled state of Germany; but a fatigue of the body, contracted from somewhere in recent days, has delayed my writing. However, I am comforted in the meantime that the business concerning those thousands is almost entirely completed while I am still alive; I see nothing remaining but the completion of the obligations; I wish for a perpetual testimony in this matter.</p>
      <p>My wife sends two gold rings, one as a gift to your wife, the other to Gwalther's wife, but with the condition that your wife has the choice; she will assign the other to whomever she wishes. Farewell equally from me and from my wife in Christ, happily with all yours, whom you will command to be very well in the name of both of us. From the old city of the Vangiones, Worms on the Rhine, September 8th, 1553.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Wolfgang Waidner. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most ample church of Zürich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>I received the cup, but I ordered Stampfer to appraise it and indicate the price, and I repaid as much as he indicated the price to be.</p>
      <p>Last of Mr. Waidner, September 1553.</p>
