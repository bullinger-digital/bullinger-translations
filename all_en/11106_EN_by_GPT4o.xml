    <p xml:id="regest1">Is in good health but is only writing now due to other commitments. He was pleased to hear that the Bern Synod has confirmed the [First Helvetic] Confession and its explanation [in the letter from the reformed cities of the Swiss Confederation to Luther] and has refrained from disputed terms of the doctrine of the Lord's Supper. However, he disapproves that Bucer, as often before, is once again introducing a new and still unclear confession. He himself remains with the previous confession and does not want to be pressured into any new stance, but continues to strive for peace and has written to Bucer as a friend, stating that he understands and approves the explanations about the sacraments in Melanchthon's "Loci" as opposed to those of Bucer. He requests the forwarding of letters to Bucer and Capito.</p>

      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, H. Bullinger wishes grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You wonder, I know, whether I am alive or have passed away, because I have not sent you any letters until now. But now I briefly make up for what has been diminished not by enmity or neglect, but by business. Therefore, I wish you and yours to be well. For I, along with my whole family and other dearest brothers, thanks and glory be to God, am well.</p>
      <p>I received and gladly read the letters written about the Bern Synod; especially that they have decided to teach according to the Basel Confession and its exposition, but to leave aside those exotic and contentious words "substantially," "corporally," "carnally," "supernaturally," etc. And I wish the people of Strasbourg had been content with this response! For, to speak freely what I feel, I would have preferred that those tablets and the bear had neither been sought nor obtained. For my mind foresees that those who were not content with the simple response of the brothers, indeed so anxiously desired even their confession to be approved, will do something unknown at some point. Was the Basel Confession not seen as sufficient? What was the need to weave a new one? And what will be the end of confessing and subscribing? First, a book was proposed to the people of MÃ¼nster, then the Basel Confession, then the confession of the four cities, afterwards the Saxon Confession with its apology, fifthly the articles brought from Wittenberg, now even the approval of the Retractions has been sought; seventhly, three articles were written from Schmalkalden by Bucer. Here now in Bern, a new confession is also being written, which I would gladly call more obscure than any I have seen so far. To these we are astonished, we subscribe, we approve everything. And indeed, our patience here is remarkable. Therefore, we are miserably harassed by constant incursions daily. What I once confessed in the Basel Confession and exposition to Doctor Luther, I confess again and will confess no more. Let others write a thousand confessions; this one will be enough for me for many thousands. Meanwhile, I will neither approve nor disapprove of anyone's private confessions. However, those which I understand not to conflict with ours, I do not reject; Bucer's, so help me God, I do not understand. I do not know what he aims at. I pour these things into the bosom of a friend. You know how to bear my simplicity. Meanwhile, there is no need to fear new tragedies. We are peaceful. We will continue to strive for concord. However, I will by no means approve of those new movements and efforts. God knows my heart, what I aim at; He will judge on the last day. I wrote to Bucer that I do not understand his writings in the same way, but I understand and am pleased with what Melanchthon wrote in the "Loci Communes" about the sacraments. I believe Bucer will take kindly what a friend writes to a friend. I beseech you, however, to ensure that these letters written to Bucer and Capito are faithfully delivered to Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>4th of November, in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
