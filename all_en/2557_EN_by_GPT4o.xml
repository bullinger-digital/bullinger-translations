      <p>S. D. Before my last letter to you with our Conrad Zwick, almost two months ago, we wrote and sent the account of our faith committed to paper, so that you, in your piety, might return your correction and judgment in writing to me. I do not doubt that my letters have been delivered to you by such a reliable bearer. However, I am surprised that you have not sent any letters to me in the meantime; if they have been intercepted, I am sorry. Even though I am occupied with secular affairs, I still prefer the glory of Christ and our salvation to any occupation. Hence, the customs and iniquities of this age do nothing more than almost destroy me entirely. You will hear from the enclosed letter of the supreme pontiff of Augsburg among the evangelicals what they confess about the idol they call a sacrament. Would that the word, namely sacrament, had never crept into the church or were expressed even in German with a German word; I would certainly be sure that such enormous errors and scandals had never taken such deep root, not to mention that the entire foundation of the papacy rests on this one thing. We will soon see what the new papacy is going to attempt; I deeply regret that there are so many who do not see the nearby walls burning. The diet now begun in Augsburg is never to be ended, evidently for the extermination of the gospel, as far as human efforts can go. I earnestly ask you to respond to my confession of faith, provided you have received it; if not, let me know, and it will be sent to you again.</p>
      <p>For the coming spring, I intend to visit the Baths, or rather the pious men who are more beneficial than all the Baths. If it is possible for you to respond soon, you will have done the duty of a faithful friend and brother. Farewell and diligently and reverently greet your freedom, which has collapsed everywhere else in the world... it is about to leave the lands, not to be found again(?). Hastily. Neuburg on the Danube, February 14, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Georg Fr√∂lich from Lemnicz, Vice-Chancellor of the Count Palatine Otto Henry, etc.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man and my brother, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant shepherd of Christ's flock among the renowned people of Zurich.</p>
