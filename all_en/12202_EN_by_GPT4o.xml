    <p xml:id="regest1">The Bernese have received the letter from the [Zürichers] dated March 12 and the [“True Declaration”], but have not been able to have it read aloud so far, hindered by official duties. The [Zürichers] should attribute the delay not to any disregard, but to business matters. The [Bernese] have received the letter with pleasure and express their thanks and friendship to the [Zürichers]. Furthermore, they assure the [Zürichers] that they intend to adhere firmly to their disputation [of 1528] (which has not yet been refuted by the Holy Scripture) and the resulting Reformation as before.</p>

      <p>Our entirely friendly, willing service, along with whatever love and goodness we can offer, beforehand. Highly and well-educated, venerable, honorable, wise, especially beloved lords and friends, your comforting letter dated the twelfth of the past March, along with the printed booklet, we have long since received, but until now, due to our great affairs, have not been able to have it read aloud. Therefore, we want to earnestly and diligently ask you not to take this long delay as if we both - the letter and the booklet - are disregarded, but rather (as mentioned above) attribute it to our many affairs. Accordingly, we attach to you a completely sincere response to let you know that we have received and understood your letter with the highest thanks and great pleasure, with heartfelt assurance that wherever we can and may show you love, friendship, and willing service, you will find us more willing than willing at any time. And as you urgently admonish us to remain steadfast in the truth, obtained through our disputation, you and everyone else should be assured that we are of unshaken and constant resolve and will, as we have often resolved before (since no one has yet refuted, overturned, or laid down this disputation with biblical scripture), to remain and persist with the same and our resulting reformation with the help and grace of God.</p>
      <p>Given on Sunday, May 10, 1545.</p>
      <p>Mayor, council, and citizens of the city</p>
      <p>Bern.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-educated, honorable, wise preachers, readers, and common servants of the church of Zürich, our especially beloved lords and friends.</p>
