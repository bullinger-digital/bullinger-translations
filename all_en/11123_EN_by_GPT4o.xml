    <p xml:id="regest1">[The Bernese pastors] want to oppose the efforts of Theodor [Bibliander]; the moment is unfavorable to undertake anything against Bucer. The letter from the Zurichers [No. 1073] has met with their approval; Megander has passed it on to [Peter Cyro] to possibly bring it to the council. He has heard that the hospital master has moved into his house; he urgently requests to arrange for the temporary accommodation of his household goods. The Bernese are putting their church in danger; he opposes them but exercises restraint.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We will, as much as we can, thwart Theodor's efforts; certainly, at this time, it seems unwise to attempt anything against Bucer or anyone else.</p>
      <p>We have read the letters you sent. Certainly, there is no one among us who does not highly approve of them, unless it befit a good man to praise while standing and to blame while sitting. The letters were delivered by me to the secretaries, and a copy was given to them so that, if it seems appropriate, they may ensure they are read by the council; however, they have not yet been read.</p>
      <p>I hear that the hospital master has moved into my house; but I do not understand what has been done with my furniture. I beg you, by the Lord, to arrange for suitable accommodation for me until I can have the one assigned to me.</p>
      <p>Our schemers; for they are hastening the ruin of our church by their complaints, indeed by their discovered crime. So that I do not appear contentious, I oppose them only in public sermons, yet with utmost modesty.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 20, 1537.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned men Bullinger and Leo, the most vigilant ministers and brothers of the Zurich church.</p>
