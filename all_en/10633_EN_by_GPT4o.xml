    <p xml:id="regest1">Remembers Bullinger, especially now as he is reading his writing "De testamento seu foedere dei," which he received as a gift from him. Requests the sending of the promised commentaries on the letters to the Corinthians and Hebrews, which were promised to him during his visit to Zurich. Inquires about the concord between Ambrosius Blarer and Erhard Schnepf, as a report from Augustin Heilmann has unsettled him, as well as about Blarer's justification letter and the meeting of preachers in Constance. Gubler, a fellow brother, asks for a recommendation. Greetings. Recommendation of the letter carriers.</p>

      <p>Grace of God the Father through Christ be with us all. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your excellence and kindness, once observed, most illustrious Master Heinrich, remain firmly in my memory to this day, much like the saying of Virgil "as long as the boar loves the mountain ridges, as long as the fish loves the rivers," and no oblivion will erase it, especially as I read your edition "On the Unique and Eternal Testament of God," which I received as a gift from you in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Most kind brother, you are familiar with the legal rule that every promise becomes a debt. Almost a year ago, returning from Stuttgart, we conversed in your house (where you received me most kindly) about Blarer and Schnepf. Among other things, you promised your commentary on the letters to the Corinthians and Hebrews, which I earnestly request you entrust to the bearer of this letter, as he returns from the baths of Baden, so that I may enrich and adorn my modest collection with your works.</p>
      <p>Finally, inform me about the concord between Blarer and Schnepf (if business allows). Recently, the notary of Constance, Augustin Heilmann, if I am not mistaken from Bremgarten, wrote to me on the twentieth of May that he had seen a letter from Schnepf. Therefore, I am concerned about this concord. Moreover, I ask you to write to me most precisely your judgment on Blarer's apology. Forgive me, brother, for inserting many things. They say that excellent ministers of the word of God were in Constance; it is also known that you were called there. I do not know the reason for your absence; I would guess, if it would not turn into a dream. Some ministers traveling around the world seem to wink at Luther in the matter of the sacrament, but may the best and greatest accomplish his work in his own. May the wavering be strong.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Gubler, our fellow brother, was present while I was writing this letter, indicating his strong desire to reveal his zeal to you. When he tries to speak with you either orally or in writing, say that I have greatly approved of his zeal for you.</p>
      <p>No news from us. If you have any, write. Greet your most chaste wife with the children and family in my name.</p>
      <p>Given in Malans, in the year thirty-five of the fifteenth century, on the twenty-second of June.</p>
      <p>Minister of the word of God of the church</p>
      <p>Malans, your Florian Chinlius.</p>
      <p>May you have these bearers of the present letter, ministers and faithful of the church of Chur, recommended, I pray.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and many-gifted man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the church of Zurich, his sincere lord.</p>
