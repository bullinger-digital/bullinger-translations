    <p xml:id="regest1">Returned from Isny two days ago and received Bullinger's letter; upon closer reading, Bullinger would judge the records of the Regensburg Imperial Diet as most do. May God preserve the health of Bullinger and other servants of God; the plague continues to claim victims in Konstanz, as well as in other places; Bucer has confirmed the news [from Strasbourg] communicated by Bullinger; even Blarer's exemplary sister Margaretha, a faithful admirer of Bullinger, fell victim to the plague. Greetings; one of the brothers Zwick will write about the Imperial Diet and celestial signs. Send [Johannes Lening's] writing on polygamy if needed; enclosed is a portrait of [Simon] Grynaeus.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Three days ago, upon my return from Isny, I received your letter, most illustrious and esteemed Bullinger, to which I find it impossible to respond amidst the storms pressing upon us from all sides. Regarding the acts, I do not doubt that, if you had read them most diligently, you would judge them as most do; but the world will not be torn from its nature by any means. Be careful not to give thanks for trivial matters in the future; we are bound to you by countless obligations and are gladly so, not unaware of your singular and generously humane kindness, which expects nothing in return from anyone. Would that our circumstances might someday allow us to gratify you as we wish!</p>
      <p>We received with great joy the news that you, who administer the church of Christ, are well. May the Lord preserve this health perpetually, lest His people be like sheep without a shepherd. The fact that this disease is causing sporadic outbreaks among us is entirely due to what it does among many others. The Lord wishes to make us more eager and vigilant through this troublesome affliction of the flesh.</p>
      <p>Upon my return, I found Bucer's letters here, which write almost the same things that you noted from the letters sent to Basel. This affliction strikes us almost uniformly if you consider the number; however, it takes away some notable individuals, one of whom could be worth many thousands to us. Among them, the Lord, the author of life, has transferred to life from death our most excellent and truly faithful deaconess of our church, my own sister Margaretha, to the great sorrow of all. This matter continually renews itself in my mind, so that I feel the most uncontrollable emotions of my heart, fearing entirely that her death portends some evil for our entire city, as many good people fear with me. For as far as she is concerned, we are most certain that she is not dead, but has exchanged death for the most blessed life; for she breathed her last breath so sweetly among sacred words, full of confidence in Christ, that you would have said she was not dying, but peacefully falling asleep in the Lord and entrusting her soul into the hands of her faithful Creator. For us, however, so much consolation and benefit has been lost that we increasingly understand with incredible sorrow that we have lost more than half of our soul. Yet, when we refer everything to the will of the best Father, we are also of good courage here, hoping that, since she will never return to us, we may soon depart to her, hopefully with equal happiness. She was entirely loving towards you and not long before her last day, she greatly regretted not writing to you more often to fulfill her duty. Pray for us, that we may soon follow her to Christ in the same footsteps; certainly, nothing is more desired now; yet may the Lord's will be done.</p>
      <p>Commend me to the best and most venerable brothers Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and Megander. Greet your entire household with all friends and the consul RÃ¶sti[o]. All of ours greet you, my brother with both Zwick brothers. One of them writes a little about the Imperial Diet and celestial signs. I can write no more. May our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ come to the aid of His church in its more than afflicted state in due time, having mercy on us! Farewell well in Him.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, the last day of November 1541.</p>
      <p>Let me know if you have read the German dialogue on polygamy; I will send it if you have not seen it before. Here you have a lead-cast image of our Grynaeus, quite successfully expressed to life, which should indeed have been golden; but you will rather kiss the form than the material.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent minister of the church of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother to be esteemed in every way.</p>
