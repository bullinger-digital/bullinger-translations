      <p>Greetings. Since, most learned Bullinger, in the past year I was forced to leave my small province in Richen with the remaining brothers Erb and Myliander, because I did not want to be entangled again in the yoke of servitude, having been called to the freedom of Christ and the apostles, I therefore departed from there and went straight to my homeland, which is the noble DÃ¼sseldorf, a town very close and near to the Rhine, adorned with liberal studies. I went there, I say, for some reasons, to greet my widowed mother and dearest brothers, whom I found safe and sound.</p>
      <p>And when I was planning to leave them, quite uncertain about some condition, except that I knew our Lord and God Jesus Christ would be kind and generous to his own, which I had learned a little earlier from your letters, suddenly friends and men very devoted to our freedom called me to Wesel, which is easily the metropolis in the Duchy of Cleves, shining especially with the pure doctrine of the gospel and pious morals. From the republic of these people, I obtained an honest and piously educated virgin, liberally supporting myself and mine from their revenues, which I could not hide from you and my other brothers, like my sweetest father Matthias Erb and Jacob Myliander, earnestly asking you through that love with which Christ Jesus loved us, to greet me in my absence with your letters and to inform me about your affairs and the health of everyone, which will be done most conveniently if the letters are sent to Wendelin Richelius, the printer in Strasbourg; for he is a good man who will diligently ensure that they are soon delivered to me through my little brother, whom I support there.</p>
      <p>This city tolerates me and my faith, and only this one thing torments my mind, that I am forced to unwillingly endure the most ardent hatred of many donkeys inflamed against you, solely because of the truth and more sincere exposition of the Eucharist and the Lord's Supper. Recently, Mr. Tilemann Heshusius, otherwise a native citizen of our republic, who foolishly quarreled with Wilhelm Klebitz in Heidelberg, published a defamatory pamphlet against our most learned brother John Calvin and all of us locals.</p>
      <p>Among other things, he spews that the approved writers, especially Augustine, Ambrose, Tertullian, Cyprian, Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Basil, etc., were alien to the error (as they call it) of the Zwinglians and Calvinists, verbatim adding the following: "Augustine is without controversy the most approved of all ecclesiastical writers and the most serious witness after the apostles. But let the sacramentarians at least dare to produce sentences from this author that support the opinion fabricated by them.</p>
      <p>They say, he calls the bread the figure of the body of Christ, and we admit this; for it is the figure and symbol of the body of Christ, but present in the supper, not far removed from us, as you imagine. Similar mutilated testimonies of the ancients, such as about the eating of the impious, in this same pamphlet against Philip Melanchthon of blessed memory, he turns the prejudice against himself and his own, exclaiming what an unbridled desire for lying there is in us Calvinists, that we dare to produce Augustine as a witness of our invention.</p>
      <p>These things alone, Father Bullinger, distress me, and unless they cease their slandering, they will completely consume me. Inform me about the affairs being conducted and the matters of religion among you and others.</p>
      <p>Remind Myliander to write to me through you as often as possible. Hastily in Wesel, March 20, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your book on the Anabaptists is eagerly read and cherished by the pious. Karl Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man in morals and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, residing in the holy church of Christ in Zurich, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
