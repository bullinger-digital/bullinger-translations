      <p>Greetings. I wanted to send these to you, most esteemed sir, through the nuncio who is about to leave for Lindau, to inform you as soon as possible of a matter of great importance recently brought from England, which a reliable report confirms. The Duke of Alba and the Pope have conspired with the Duke of Norfolk, promising to assist him in capturing the Queen of Scotland as his wife and simultaneously obtaining the kingdoms of Scotland and England. Forty warships came near England, waiting for the appointed day for the ships of Norfolk and his allies to meet them, so that together they could unexpectedly rush into London, plunder it, and capture the Queen of England. However, as God willed, Norfolk could not gather his forces by the appointed day, and so those 40 ships, having waited a long time without seeing any allies approaching, withdrew from there (they had landed near the city or port of Dover), fearing that the English would spot them and pursue them if seen. The matter was reported to the Queen, and Norfolk, who was already suspected by her, was captured. Letters were found with him containing the entire form and order of the conspiracy. Hence, many others have been thrown into prison; what will become of them is awaited.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, it was also reported that 50 mules loaded from Spain were heading towards Lyon, supposedly carrying saffron; however, they were not loaded with saffron, but 40 with silver and 10 with gold, all of which the Huguenots captured in France; these were being sent to the Duke of Alba. Now a false rumor is being spread that all that money belonged to merchants. The Duke of Alba still continues to cruelly persecute the faithful. May the Lord have mercy on them and finally avenge His own. The victory of the Venetians against the Turks is confirmed and boastfully proclaimed; meanwhile, I perceive from some wise men that the Venetians indeed won, but not without loss, nor was the damage inflicted on the Turks as great as they boasted; about 20,000 Turks fell, and about 10,000 Christians. I ask you to also share this with Mr. Rudolph Gwalther and convey my most respectful greetings to him in my name; for I am compelled to hurry in writing.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your people.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, November 7, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your reverence's most observant, Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zürich, my dear lord and friend. Zürich.</p>
