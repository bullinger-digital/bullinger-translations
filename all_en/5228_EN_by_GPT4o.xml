      <p>Greetings. I received through our Löffelsperger your response to Brentz, which I immediately read with the greatest pleasure, and I give thanks to the Lord, who has bestowed such great gifts upon you; I pray to Him that He may keep you safe for as long as possible for the defense of His truth. I was especially pleased with what you wrote so clearly about the personal union of natures in Christ, in which the adversaries place their greatest defense, that they cannot conceal their errors. But where is Abraham Musculus' Antilogia against Parsimonius' sermon written? I hoped that we would have it by this fair; for I wish him to become renowned, especially in this matter, for which he has always seemed to me to be particularly inclined and equipped. I have written elsewhere why it could not be printed with us.</p>
      <p>As for his condition, we will neglect nothing that we can accomplish, although we do not dare as much as we would like because of the relationship; nevertheless, it will not be neglected. Your response has not yet been communicated to us by the senate; for there are few senators in the city, but they are expected and will convene at the next Easter, where new magistrates are elected; then I hope this matter will also be addressed. As far as I know, the people of Schaffhausen have not yet written anything; the people of Basel are displeased at being overlooked; they think this was done at my instigation, in which I am innocent; for I could have borne their judgment as well as yours. Steiger is in Lausanne, and since the Greek professor is setting out there today, I will send your letters along with the booklet you are sending to him; although he will return shortly, he will have more leisure to examine it on the journey than if he were at home. Diesbach writes to you himself, from whom you will have any news, if there are any.</p>
      <p>I would like to know for certain whether the delegates from the Swiss are setting out for the council; for we have also heard this rumor from elsewhere, that they are setting out; but others assert that they are not setting out; for no one is willing to pay their expenses, indeed the pope or the fathers of the council are also demanding their share from them to sustain the council; this troubles them, who are never equipped to give, but always only to receive. If you have any certain information about these matters, please let me know.</p>
      <p>I have from reliable sources that the people of Freiburg have been urged by the others to help defend and even impose on others what is decided in the council, but they have responded that they are indeed ready to accept and defend whatever the council decides, but not beyond the borders of their own jurisdiction; for they will compel no others in religion except those pertaining to them; anders und wyters söll man sich nüt zuͦ inen versen. The people of Solothurn, however, are fierce, who seem to be preparing the bear for themselves alone.</p>
      <p>Recently, at a certain banquet, a certain Solothurn councilor, when drunk, said he was burning with zeal against those Lutherans, to destroy them all, a good man sitting nearby took a large cup and offered it to him whole, to quench this ardor by drinking; soon when he complained again of burning, he offered him another, and thus it happened that he soon vomited this ardor with great disgrace. I wrote recently about your Christophorus; I await your instructions on what I should accomplish for you here. All of ours greet you in return, especially those to whom you sent copies, many of whom also write back themselves. May all the brothers be safe, and finally, your wife and the entire household.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 15, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
