It is suspected that he will move on to Rome or Milan, where he might find acceptance.

      <p>From Munich, we have received credible news that around the beginning of August, Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, known as the incendiary, arrived at the castle in Landshut at the court of Duke Ludwig X of Bavaria. He was not well received, as no one is pleased to see him. Landshut is located 8 miles from Munich on the Isar River and has a princely castle where Duke Georg of Bavaria held court years ago, and now Duke Ludwig holds court. Duke Ludwig told the Duke of Brunswick bluntly that he does not approve of his past actions and will not support him until he faces the consequences of his deeds. It is certain that he will not find refuge with these princes. He is accompanied only by his chaplain, his jester (there are two jesters), and a rider. It is expected that he will head to Italy, to Rome or Milan, where he might find refuge.</p>
      <p>The princes of Saxony and Hesse are now advancing into his land and are said to have besieged his strongest castle, believing it will not hold out. I believe he will lose all his territories, as these two princes are very strong in the field.</p>
      <p>May God bless those who wish well for His glory. Amen. Doctor von Watt.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
