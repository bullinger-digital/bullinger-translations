      <p>Greetings. Three days ago, most illustrious man, I received your letters, in which were those you sent from Poland.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, I took that bundle to Mr. Calvin: he himself read through those written by Mr. Stanislaus, from whom he had also recently received letters.</p>
      <p>He briefly glanced at two other writings, but did not read them thoroughly.</p>
      <p>At the end of another writing, he laughed at the threats of Gregorius Paulus.</p>
      <p>Mr. Beza was present.</p>
      <p>Finally, he said that he had already briefly responded to the vain imaginations and absurdities of those people.</p>
      <p>He did not add anything else at that time.</p>
      <p>Today, when our Linettus returned from Lyon, he responded to Mr. Stanislaus with a few words regarding what he asked, and referred him to his Admonition and Epistle, unless he prefers to seek a more detailed treatment of this matter from his other books.</p>
      <p>Finally, he writes that it will happen that this Gregorius will extort something.</p>
      <p>This is the summary of the letters, and he resolves the question of invocation in a few words.</p>
      <p>A copy, which is very brief, will be sent to you, if it seems appropriate.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I hope to write something against Stancarus at some point.</p>
      <p>I am now returning those Polish letters.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would have gladly taken down and sent to you anything more he might have dictated or said about that controversy: but you know the brevity of the man.</p>
      <p>If you think my assistance might be useful to you in any other matter, I will gladly comply.</p>
      <p>In your name, I greeted Mr. Calvin, Mr. Beza, Budaeus, and others, who all respectfully greet you.</p>
      <p>I wish all of yours to be safe.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for a long time, guide you with His spirit, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, September 12, 1563.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, whom I hold in great esteem.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
