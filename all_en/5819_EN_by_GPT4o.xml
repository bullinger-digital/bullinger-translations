      <p>Greetings. Your last letter, dated July 2, was, like all your letters, most welcome to me; however, it caused me sorrow, as I understood from it that you are being worn down by constant pains of illness. I pray to the Lord to restore you and keep you safe for His church for a long time.</p>
      <p>I too have been bedridden for over 14 days due to severe pains in my stomach and head, which have caused all my limbs to become numb.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am now brief in writing.</p>
      <p>I have begun to recover somewhat; but it is only a little, as much as pleases the Lord, to whom I have completely entrusted myself, both in life and in death.</p>
      <p>I did not want you to be unaware that it has been written to us once and again by faithful people from the court of the Elector Palatine, that we should not inscribe anything in our books to the prince that might be displeasing to him, not because he does not wholeheartedly embrace the truth, but because he does not want to give an opportunity to slanderers, who claim that he has become a Zwinglian and Calvinist, etc.</p>
      <p>I mention this because I understand that you intend to dedicate your Jeremiah to him.</p>
      <p>I am glad that we will have your interpretation of this prophet; but first, examine whether your dedication to the prince will be welcome; if he does not wish to have it inscribed to him, it would be more convenient to dedicate it to someone else.</p>
      <p>You will learn what Brentius is doing from these Poles, one of whom is Ostroróg, the son of a nobleman in Poland, an excellent young man whom you can safely trust.</p>
      <p>He is recommended to me by the best people, so I did not hesitate to recommend him to you as well.</p>
      <p>Our adversaries are spreading astonishing rumors about the success of the Council of Trent, to which they say Condé will certainly subscribe, which I do not believe.</p>
      <p>They add that the situation of the faithful is in a very bad state because the affairs of the English are desperate.</p>
      <p>If you have any certain information about these matters, please share it with us, I beseech you, out of your kindness.</p>
      <p>All your fellow ministers send their greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Please convey our greetings to your dear brothers.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, July 26, 1563, Zurich.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The father of the children you wrote about has not come to me; otherwise, I am ready to serve all those whom you commend to me.</p>
      <p>I have not reread this.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
