    <p xml:id="regest1">Welser received Bullinger's letter [not preserved] through Johannes Haller. He is pleased that the [Zurichers] so willingly complied with the [Augsburg Council's request for a preacher]. The [people of Augsburg] will show their gratitude. Welser will treat the preacher Haller as well as [the Zurichers] and especially Bullinger, for the sake of the Gospel, not only as friends but as brothers. On Sunday, Haller will preach. Welser has no doubt about Haller's orthodoxy. He is also unlikely to be contentious. - The [Zurichers] are probably well informed about the outcome of the Brunswick affair. May God, who granted victory to the Evangelicals, continue to protect them! - Greetings to the brethren.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ, with the offering of my willing service and all good things beforehand.</p>
      <p>Dear Mr. Bullinger, I have received your Christian letter through Mr. Johannes Haller, and I was pleased to hear that my lords, the honorable council of Zurich, have so kindly and amicably complied with the request. My lords will also reciprocate in a serviceable and neighborly manner towards the honorable council of the city of Zurich, as is due in greater and equal measure. You should know that I will conduct myself towards the preacher and all of yours not only as a friend but as a brother, and especially towards you, my lords and brothers, doing what is pleasing to you, all in the expansion of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. By Sunday, he will preach. I am without any doubt that he is sound in doctrine. As I have perceived so far, he is also unlikely to be contentious. May the Lord grant him and all of us further His grace and the Holy Spirit for all good things. Amen.</p>
      <p>As for how the war with Brunswick has turned out, you are probably well informed by now. God the Lord has granted victory to the Evangelical side in all respects and delivered the enemy into their hands, for which we rightly thank Him, not deviating from His word. For He who has so graciously preserved it thus far can still do so. To Him be praise forever. Please greet your fellow brothers in the Gospel of Jesus Christ kindly on my behalf, and consider me for your best. The grace of God be with us all always. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated Augsburg, the 21st day of November in 1545. Your willing brother in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, Hans Welser, in my own handwriting.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader in the word of Jesus Christ in Zurich, my lord and friend, to be delivered.</p>
