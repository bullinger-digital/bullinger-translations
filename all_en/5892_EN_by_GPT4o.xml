      <p>My willing service beforehand.</p>
      <p>Honorable, well-learned, especially dear sir.</p>
      <p>Your letter to my father-in-law, Mr. Benedict Stocker, concerning a French scholarship holder and his payment, was received and discussed by my mother-in-law in the absence of my father-in-law, and she instructed me to write to you the following opinion: namely, that although according to your letter my father-in-law has been in France for some time, he has not been able to find out where or in which place Coignet is currently staying.</p>
      <p>She also does not know whether Coignet has written anything to my father-in-law about this matter or not.</p>
      <p>However, she intends to give your letter to my father-in-law when he returns home, or in case it is not known when he will return, to send it to him these days.</p>
      <p>In good hope, you will find good information and money with him, etc.</p>
      <p>Which she should not withhold from you as a friendly response at this time.</p>
      <p>I am willing to serve you.</p>
      <p>Given in Schaffhausen on the 28th of September in the year 1563.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans im Thurn of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the honorable well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, master of the liberal arts and preacher in Zurich, my dear sir.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
