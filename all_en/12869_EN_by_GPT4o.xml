    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blessing wish. Zwick has realized from Bullinger's letter [not received] that he did not correctly understand his last letter [not received]. He did not want the Zurich council to contact Basel or France, but rather that Bullinger personally writes to a trusted person in Basel, so that this person can initiate the matter with the French envoy in Basel [Guillaume Du Plessis, sieur de Lyancourt]. Zwick also cannot imagine that anything could be achieved in this regard with Schwyz or Zug. Time is pressing! Therefore, Peter Scher von Schwarzenburg is now riding to Bullinger. He will explain Zwick's plan to him. And should the Zurich councilors find out about it, they will hardly have anything to object to, as neither Zurich nor the other Confederates can suffer any disadvantage from it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is now important to promote the matter through a trusted mediator with King Francis I or his envoy. Whether Bullinger uses Hans Wunderlich or a well-known person from Basel is completely irrelevant. The main thing is that it happens quickly!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It should also be considered whether the matter should be presented to the mediator orally or in writing. Zwick and Scher would prefer if this were done with a written instruction, in the drafting of which Scher will assist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] If Bullinger is also of this opinion, he should not adhere to the drafts that Zwick sent him last time. These are to be destroyed. Bullinger should now follow Scher's instructions, which he may of course improve.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] However, if he finds it more appropriate to inform the mediator orally, Scher is ready to take this on. Bullinger should then address a letter of recommendation to Wunderlich or the trusted person in Basel, in which Scher must not be mentioned by name.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Abbot of Weingarten [Gerwig Blarer] has offered his mediation to the people of Konstanz, as A[mbrosius Blarer] will report in more detail. Allegedly, he was commissioned [by Emperor Charles V] to negotiate with the [Protestant] cities regarding their fines and homage. Today, Sunday the 20th, an envoy [...] of the Land Commander [Johann Werner von Reischach] also appeared in the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] From the enclosures [not received], which Bullinger should only allow a few [Zurich councilors] to read, it will be evident how the council of Konstanz responded to Hans Jakob von Landau and Hans Baumgartner. Bullinger should send the enclosures back and communicate what he thinks about the letter to Landau.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] Just now, the letter from the Zurich council has arrived, through which Zwick learns about the convening of a diet next Sunday. The people of Konstanz do not intend to send an envoy there, as this would give rise to gossip!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Now it is important to inform Wunderlich or the Basel mediator even faster about Zwick's plan, so that the French envoy can be informed about it before the diet begins.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Since Zwick's plan does not require much explanation, it should be presented in writing to Wunderlich or the person in Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] [Guillaume Du Plessis, sieur de Lyancourt], should decide for himself whether he prefers to discuss the matter in Basel or Bern with the local councilors, or rather during the diet with the delegates from Bern or Basel. The important thing is that he only involves trusted persons from Zurich, Bern, or Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] The [four] Protestant places should only bring up the topic of Konstanz with the other places when they notice that the latter are inclined towards Konstanz; otherwise, this would only harm Konstanz and the [Four Places]. If it turns out during the diet that the other places are not submissive to the Emperor (or if the French envoy or the people from Inner Switzerland speak about Konstanz), then the people of Zurich and the other [three places] should encourage their allies to send a letter to the council of Konstanz, asking them not to be incited against the Confederation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] If the Zurich envoys [at the diet] notice that such a letter is indeed being written, they should say the following: Well, dear Confederates! In the friendly letter to Konstanz, it should be requested not to accept mercenaries from the northern part of Lake Constance in case of emergency, as the latter are loyal to the Emperor and would not resist if he intended to march through Konstanz [against the Confederates]. Therefore, the people of Konstanz should rather recruit Confederates in case of need.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] If such a letter were to be written, it would be beneficial for both the [Confederates] and the people of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] All in all, it is important not to address the case of Konstanz as long as there are no signs that the other Confederates are positively inclined towards Konstanz. But if the latter is the case, then one should proceed as outlined above.</p>

      <p>The grace of God be with us. May He strengthen you in soul and body for His praise and the betterment of His church! Amen. From your last letter, I understood that you did not correctly grasp my writing. For it was not my intention that your lords should bring the matter to Basel or France, but rather that you personally should write to a trusted person in Basel, who could then arrange the matter with the French envoy. Therefore, I cannot imagine that anything could be achieved with Schwyz or Zug. But so that we understand each other correctly and the matter is advanced (for it is nearing the end), I have arranged for my brother-in-law Peter Scher to ride to you. From his instructions, you will, as I hope, thoroughly understand my plan. And since any delay is detrimental, I have arranged the matter in the shortest way I could think of. Also, ensure that this practice, if it reaches the secret ones in Zurich, will not be disadvantageous to them or others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The matter now rests on having a trusted man who is capable of promoting the matter with the French or their envoy in the right way. Whether you prefer Wunderlich or a trusted person in Basel, it is all the same to me. I know no one. But the one who can best advance the matter will be the best choice.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Furthermore, it should be considered whether it is better to entrust this matter to the mediator orally or in writing. If it can be arranged by you with writings, it is most preferable to my brother-in-law and me. Whatever he can help you with in writing, he will not withhold.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In the case that you will write, you should not send away my previous copies, but tear them up, and now pay attention only to brother-in-law Peter's instructions. You may, however, improve them to your liking.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>If, however, you consider it better that the information be given orally to Wunderlich or in Basel, I have asked brother Peter to be willing to do so. In this case, you should give a letter to Wunderlich or the other in Basel, but not mention his name in it. May God grant grace!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We have no news these days, except that the Abbot of Weingarten has also offered to mediate with many good words. What else he has let be heard, you will learn from Master Ambrosius. Many similar talks are happening. This abbot is said to have a commission to negotiate with the cities regarding the fines and the oath. Today, Sunday the 20th, an envoy from the Land Commander was also here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>What my lords have answered to Lando and previously to Bomgartner, you will learn from the copies enclosed here. You should not let many people read them and send them back to me with the first envoy and pray to God that we act according to His will. I desire to hear your opinion and judgment on my lords' answer to Lando. Conrat Zwick.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>After I wrote this, your lords' letter arrived, from which I understood that a day is to be held next Sunday. Now I do not expect that my lords will send anyone there because of less noise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Furthermore, it is necessary that Wunderlich or the one in Basel be informed of the matter without delay, so that the French envoy is informed before the day.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Thirdly, since the plan is short and clear, I think it could well be arranged in writing with Wunderlich or Basel.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Fourthly, whether the French prefer to arrange the matter in Basel or Bern with the secret ones or now on the day with the envoys from Bern or Basel, that is up to him, only that it is done with trusted people and only that the three cities Zurich, Bern, and Basel are involved.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Fifthly, I think it is good that the evangelical places do not mention those of Konstanz to the others, unless they first learn that they are not ill-disposed. Otherwise, you have to consider, should something be brought up on our behalf and a bad decision follow, it would be to your and our disadvantage. But if they show themselves in the deliberation of the diet in such a way that one can assume they will not be good imperialists, then (or if the French or those from Inner Switzerland themselves mention Konstanz), then your lords and others could also speak best to it and, in my opinion, act only on the basis that my lords would write a friendly letter with a request not to let themselves be moved against the Confederates.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Furthermore, when your lords learn that such a letter would be approved and the envoys let themselves be noticed by us quite well, then I think it would be well done if your lords would then bring up such an opinion: Well, dear Confederates! You want to write friendly to those of Konstanz and ask, etc., but if a danger arises in Konstanz, so that they would have to accept an addition, it would be good to make the practice that they take the addition from ours. For if they are to take troops across the lake, it is all imperial, and treachery could soon be made, even if those of Konstanz would like to keep the pass, they could not do it, unless our troops were in the city. Then we would be all the safer, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>If the matter could then be brought to the point that your lords would be instructed to make such a practice, and that they might allow us an addition in case of need, it would be good for you and us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>In summary: It is important to see that if the minds are not well disposed towards us, nothing should be brought up on our behalf. If they show themselves friendly, then proceed as outlined above. May God grant grace and peace.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and God-learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and trusted friend.</p>
