      <p>Greetings, Reverend Sir, I received the letters and booklets last year sent to me through Mr. Conrad Gessner from Augsburg, to which other letters and gifts were added this year, which I keep as tokens of your constant benevolence towards me among my treasures.</p>
      <p>In this Baltic region, by the grace of God, the studies of the true doctrine of the Son of God flourish in churches and schools. Our academy has been enriched this year by the addition of two outstanding theologians, Doctor Georg Venetus and Doctor Tilemann Heshusius, the former interpreting the Epistle to the Romans, and the latter the Psalms of David. Mr. Johannes Draconites has nearly completed his four-year exposition of the prophets. I am currently presenting the Gospel according to Luke and the theological topics of Philipp Melanchthon to the listeners, and I am greatly aided by your most learned commentaries on Luke.</p>
      <p>Our princes, Johann Albrecht and Ulrich, brothers, have this summer allocated three thousand five hundred gold coins from the revenues of ecclesiastical goods to support the academy and the consistory.</p>
      <p>In Livonia, a fierce war has erupted because the lords of the Teutonic Order have captured the Archbishop of Riga, Wilhelm, brother of the Duke of Prussia, and the bishop's coadjutor, Christoph, Duke of Mecklenburg, surrounding them with a siege. To liberate them, the King of Poland, the Duke of Prussia, and our Dukes of Mecklenburg have joined forces. I pray to God that amidst these tumultuous wars, He may preserve and protect the churches, which are otherwise excellently established in Livonia.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Rostock, the day before St. Lawrence's Day, 1556.</p>
      <p>David Chytraeus.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man, outstanding in wisdom and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, his esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
      <p>Give the messenger a drink money.</p>
