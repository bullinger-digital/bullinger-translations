    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer thanks Bullinger for his Christian comfort [in a letter not received] and wishes that God would grant every citizen of Konstanz such a disposition!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The human encouragement given by the Zurich council, on the other hand, is weak and disappointing. The enemies have earlier and better understood how to influence the Confederates in their deliberations than the [Protestants]. Blarer regrets that the [four Protestant places] have not shown more courage in such an important matter for them as well! He fears that God may have decided to corner the people of Konstanz and the Swiss [Protestant] places. The latter must not forget that they are not much further from the potential battlefield than the people of Konstanz. Blarer is willing to believe that the Confederates would not tolerate a siege on their soil; in such a case, their interests would be at stake. But are they aware that with such a statement they have not yet shown Christian, neighborly love to the people of Konstanz? By the way, a siege on Konstanz soil would be just as dangerous for them. However, they do not address this case in their letter. What is the use of the assurance that in case of need, Swiss soldiers would come to Konstanz's aid on their own? It was recently observed how inefficient such mercenaries are! Moreover, the Confederates are currently discussing the punishment of the mercenaries who joined the Schmalkaldic League. Zurich is even in favor of such measures! How can one then expect that many Swiss mercenaries would join the people of Konstanz?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blarer has already suspected this and also expressed the assumption in his last letter [No. 2754] that Konstanz will probably have to be abandoned by everyone. However, he is not afraid of it because he knows exactly that God wants to test everyone through this. Only a few will pass this test.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Zurich council assures [on behalf of the Four Places] the people of Konstanz of its goodwill and adds that it will do everything it can responsibly. But what does this mean? It probably corresponds to God's will that everyone only wants to watch as the other is plunged into ruin until the enemy has destroyed everyone. But basically, this does not matter, as the Lord will already take the souls of His own into eternity within a short time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer has just learned from Konrad Zwick how Hans Baumgartner and others, who are trying to reach an amicable settlement with Emperor Charles V, are urging Konstanz for a response. The Emperor, who is already in Ulm, is said to have summoned the cities not yet reconciled there. Zwick now fears that the good words of the negotiators and the lack of support from the Confederates will tempt the people of Konstanz to make peace. And even if they were allowed to keep their faith, this would greatly endanger relations with the neighboring Confederates. Zwick therefore asks whether Bullinger could not obtain a subsidy of 30,000 florins from Francis I for the cities of Konstanz and Lindau through Antoine Morelet du Museau or [Wilhelm] Frölich. This would enable these cities to strengthen their [defensive walls]. In return, they would commit not to allow any soldiers against Francis I [in Italy] or against [his allies], the Confederates, to pass through and not to provide any help against France and the Confederates until they have repaid Francis I the money. In case of need, Francis I should also finance a garrison of 500 men in each city for 6 florins per mercenary for three months. The money for this should be deposited in Zurich by the end of each month.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Zwick believes that Francis I could hardly invest his money better, especially since such an agreement would serve his interests and those of the Confederates; which the [Zurichers] could probably easily convince him of. Both Blarer and Zwick consider this a good solution. In this way, neither the Zurichers nor other Confederates would have to commit themselves to Konstanz in any way (which they are trying to avoid because of the Emperor); moreover, the help provided to Konstanz by Francis I would also benefit them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The fee for the messenger to Morelet and the other expenses should be advanced by [the Zurichers]. Zwick will then pay these out of his own pocket. Action should be taken quickly, as the imperial side is not sleeping. Such human support is needed if one does not want the people and the councilors to submit to the Emperor. Bullinger should do his best. Who knows, maybe God will intervene so that such help is not necessary.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The day before, the pious councilor Matthäus Molckenpur, well known to Bullinger, passed away. The city has lost a strong support as a result.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Captain Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz, who captured the Ehrenberg pass, has arrived in Konstanz. He no longer wants to stay in Ulm, even though he received an annual salary of 550 florins from the city. He reports that the people of Ulm intend to let the Emperor winter with them and to admit 4,000 Spaniards into the city. He believes that the Emperor will have a fortress built in Ulm and never give up the city, but will try to take over all of Swabia from there to form a duchy. In this way, he will rule over all of southern Germany. He already controls the four important Württemberg fortresses [Urach, Hohenasperg, Schorndorf, and Kirchheim unter Teck]. If one is not careful, he will subjugate the Germans and the Confederates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Greetings. Nothing is to be paid to the messenger [...]. Bullinger should take up the matter urgently.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, your Christian comfort is just. I thank you most highly for it. I wish and desire from the heart that everyone among us would be so disposed. May God grant such a heart!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Your human comfort, however, is weak and very different from what one would have expected. What has been negotiated with the Confederates, the adversaries (opponents) have known earlier and better than we, how and on what grounds it was pressed. I am heartily sorry that those who are committed to God's word, in such an important matter, which should also be of great concern to them, are not more zealous and brave. I worry greatly, greatly, from all sorts of indications, that it is decided by the Lord that we must all go into the sack, you as well as we, even though we are only a stone's throw away from the battlefield. What you write, that yours will not allow a siege on your soil, I gladly believe, for such concerns your own situation and need. And yet no Christian or neighborly love is shown or thanks deserved, while the siege on the other side (of the Rhine) is no less worrying, but you do not mention it. What you then further report, that if we need people, they will come, even if they are not sent to us willingly, pleases us little. For as the prophet, so also the soldier, should not run on his own, if he is not sent. I could also promise myself little luck with such self-running servants, for these things should be handled in the orderly and right way, otherwise everything goes wrong, as we have had and still have the examples before our eyes! The punishment now undertaken by the Confederates against those who have joined the empire, in which you should also be included, will make the servants quite unwilling and hold them back from running, as is fair and right on their part.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It has all been foreseen by me, and my own heart has told me so. I have indicated it to you in my last letter, it seems to me that we must be abandoned by everyone, but I do not care at all for my person. For thus the true test of living heartfelt trust in God is found (when we are stripped of all other things and given over in such a manner), that we also willingly want to die and perish here on earth, if it pleases Him. But I see alongside, how people are generally disposed, and there are few who want to look to God without means.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Your lords write to ours, they want to show themselves at any time and do everything they can responsibly. You have well considered how this unusual addition must be understood and what it carries with it. But it pleases the Lord so and is His just and our well-deserved judgment, that one neighbor looks on as the other perishes, until we all go to ruin and the enemy devours us. Well then! It does not matter at all. It is about a bad little hour. The Lord will eternally preserve our souls and let us be His own! Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Now, as I have written this, I am informed by my dear cousin Conrat Zwick, how my lords are being urged for a response by Bomgartner and some others, who have undertaken amicable negotiations since then; that the emperor now, since he is already personally in Ulm, and (also) the other unreconciled cities want to summon there, etc. Now he worries greatly, the good words of the negotiators, and then, that little comfort is found with you, will have much effect. He worries nonetheless, that such a contract will be made. If we are allowed to remain with our religion, it will give birth to bad neighborliness because of other conditions and reasons, etc. Therefore, he thought, whether it would not be possible through you to arrange with Murlet or Frölich that the Frenchman would provide these two cities, Konstanz and Lindau, with a sum of money up to 30,000 florins, and likewise (with the condition that they should fortify their cities, namely against the emperor's land, and, as long as they do not pay the money, they should be obliged not to let the emperor or others pass through their cities against the French or Confederates, nor to provide any other assistance) and, in case they needed it, an addition (namely each city could accept 500 servants for 3 months, at 6 florins per servant), so that when the addition was accepted, the money would then be deposited in Zurich, and before the end of the first month a month's pay would be raised there, and so on, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>My cousin thinks the Frenchman could not invest such money better, for it would be of great benefit to him and the Confederates, as one could well explain to him with truth and you could explain it to him very precisely. My dear cousin and I think all this could well be with God and would be a very good way. For then neither you nor other Confederates would have to negotiate with us (since you would not like to do so because of the emperor), but all this would be the Frenchman's negotiation and would nevertheless also be to your benefit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>If it now seems good to you, and you have to send a messenger to Murlet or elsewhere, you should advance the cost. My cousin will take this cost upon himself. But it would be good if it happened quickly and was not delayed, for they are not delaying there either. So I see, unfortunately, how the common man and senator (councilor, politician) are disposed, where one has no human support. Therefore, do the best, if God ever shows a good means, that we do not let ourselves in so.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Yesterday a very pious Christian senator died, Matthäus Molckenpur, whom you know well. Truly a strong pillar of our city has fallen. May God graciously restore it in another way. (make it good)</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Captain Dietrich Marcell has come here, who conquered the Klause. He no longer wants to be in Ulm, although he received an annual salary of 550 florins from there. He says the people of Ulm want to let the emperor winter with them; they are letting 4,000 Spaniards into their city. He believes the emperor will build a fortress in Ulm and never let go of the city, but will use this city to subdue all of Swabia and establish the Duchy of Swabia. He will become the lord and master of the entire Upper Country, especially since he also holds the four main fortresses in Württemberg. Yes, truly, he is making ways through which he will also master us and you, if one does not take action in time; but one does not think of it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>God be with you. In great haste. You need not give anything to the messenger. Hurry with the matter as best you can! Dated the 21st of January.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
