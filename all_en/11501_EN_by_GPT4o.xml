      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Heinrich LÃ¼thi sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I heartily congratulate you on the birth of your new child, and indeed a son, if I am not mistaken. I wish the boy the greatest happiness, and I pray to the immortal gods that he will be a most obedient son to you, his parent. With their help and favor, may this son of yours one day beautifully reflect his parent both in piety and in learning, and thus be made a son worthy of such a great parent. I am sending two chickens and five thrushes as a gift to the mother, a gift indeed of little importance if you consider the size of the thing itself, but truly the greatest if you consider the spirit of the one who gives it, who is, so help me the gods, most devoted, most bound to you, and most eager to please you in any matter. By Hercules, I dare to promise myself the same from you in return.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live as long as possible and in good health. In the year 1541, on the first day of February.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and learned pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and brother, to be especially revered.</p>
