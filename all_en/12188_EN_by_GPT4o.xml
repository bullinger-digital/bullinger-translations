    <p xml:id="regest1">Regarding the oath [during the alliance vow], [the people of Zurich] have taught their [citizens] to swear only by God and not by the saints, for God is the highest good, as it is also stated in the Epistle to the Hebrews. If one were to include the saints, one would deny the pure, true faith. For instance, Polycarp also did not want to swear by [the goddess] Fortuna or the Fortuna of the Emperor, as Eusebius writes. - Therefore, [the people of Zurich] have sent a delegation to the [Catholic Inner Swiss regions] and informed them that they wish to swear only by God; if the [Catholic regions] wanted to include the saints, they were permitted to do so. However, [the people of Zurich] do not want this and believe that the [Second Kappel] Peace Treaty allows them to do so. After consultation, the Five Regions [in Zurich] have now arrived with their response; at the moment, [the Great Council] is being convened, and Bullinger does not know how it will turn out. The [Inner Swiss regions] are unfriendly towards the [Protestant] cities; they cannot be trusted. Perhaps a solution will be found as in the time of Ahab and Jehoshaphat. - This is in response to Myconius’ letter [No. 2129], and indeed in German, in case Myconius wishes to share it with reliable friends. - Bullinger sends the writing [“De vita monachorum”] by the Italian [Lelio Capilupi].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Regarding the oath, we have taught our people and continue to teach them that they should swear by God alone and not by the saints. The reason: The oath is a testimony to the highest authority for humans, as stated in Hebrews 6:16. What is the highest authority for humans, by that they swear. Since God alone is our highest good, the oath should be made by God alone. To place the saints alongside God is to compare the created with the Creator; no true believer does that. Therefore, we have expressed in God's word, both commanded and forbidden, that we swear by God alone and not by the saints, as stated in Deuteronomy 6:13, 10:20; Joshua 23:7; Psalm 16:4; Jeremiah 4:2, 5:7; Zephaniah 1:5, etc. Lastly, the oath is also an invocation and acknowledgment of God's name, as the form goes: "I will firmly and steadfastly keep this, etc., so help me God," or: "Thus I ask, so help me God." It is therefore about whom we confess as our help, savior, and hope. We testify to the one who is our help and place ourselves under the discipline of the one who can discipline. Now, it is a prominent article of faith that God alone is the one who protects and disciplines; to add the saints is to deny the pure, true faith. Polycarp did not want to swear by Fortuna or by the Fortuna of the Emperor, as is found in Eusebius, Book 5, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, our people have sent their envoys into the lands before the councils, so that my lords do not wish to swear otherwise than by God. If they wish to add the saints, let them do so; but they do not wish to give or take the oath otherwise, believing that the peace of the land allows it, etc. They have received a response to this. And today, as I write this, the citizens are being summoned, and the Five Regions are here to give their answers; I cannot know what will happen. It is well known that they would also like us to be gracious to their leaders; I cannot know what will happen. The people are indeed unfriendly to the cities, and whoever trusts much in their help leans on the reed of Egypt. Perhaps the matter will resolve over time as with Ahab and Jehoshaphat. May God turn everything to the good of His church.</p>
      <p>This is what I had to respond to your letter in a few words, and indeed in German, if you wish to share it with trusted friends; but here, judgment is also needed.</p>
      <p>I send the Virgilian cento of a certain Italian, etc. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 20, 1545.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, esteemed lord and brother. Basel.</p>
