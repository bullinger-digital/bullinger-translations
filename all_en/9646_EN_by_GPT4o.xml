      <p>Greetings. I give you great thanks for writing so quickly and conveniently to our consul and to the other; for the election has not yet taken place. I fear only this one thing, that it may harm Blasio, because the school in Lausanne seems almost on the verge of collapse due to his departure; for there are few among our people who can replace him, nor do the lords want the French, a restless kind of people, to rule there.</p>
      <p>However, let the will of the Lord be done, as long as no deceiver is imposed upon us! For there are those who, although warned so many times, still dare to mutter even about Hasler. As soon as the election has been made, I will write to you about the outcome. Now I can do nothing else; for your messenger is leaving at this hour, at which he delivered yours to me, and I have not yet been able to deliver the letters to others. He is in a hurry to be back in ZÃ¼rich tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Therefore, farewell; I will write more next time. In Bern, on the morning of April 24.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
