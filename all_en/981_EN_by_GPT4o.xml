      <p>Greetings, most esteemed brother in the Lord. I am finally responding today, August 8th, to your letter dated July 5th; for up until this day, when I completed the fourth Decade, I have been so tied to the printing press that I could do nothing else.</p>
      <p>For both ecclesiastical and domestic matters had to be dealt with simultaneously, and I also had to listen to both foreigners and locals. Every day I had to write as much as the press consumed; you know how they hurry and are insistent.</p>
      <p>This is my excuse for my silence.</p>
      <p>The Prussians you recommended did not come at the right time; they did not find me at home; when I came back late, they had left early in the morning. You ask where my gout has gone: the Lord has taken it from me, as long as it seemed good to Him; He knows that I am otherwise sufficiently afflicted and vexed; therefore, He has eased that pain, indeed taken it away. However, I do not think I am completely free. May the Lord keep me and do His will in me, which is always good.</p>
      <p>I do not think the Cantons have sent to the Emperor for the restoration of the Mass; for they know that it cannot be accomplished among us without war, in which they themselves would eventually be involved; but even if they have sent, the Lord still lives.</p>
      <p>On July 26th, the Emperor proposed topics to be discussed: 1. about continuing the council in Trent within a year, 2. about fully accepting the Interim in the meantime, 3. about his neglected reformation, 4. about restoring the church's goods, 5. about the imperial chamber, 6. about common peace, 7. about the session of the imperial estates, 8. about correcting the currency, 9. about the tribute, from the empire's levy; there lay the peasant in the hay. What will happen, infer from these. Read what the most excellent man writes to us from Bologna, and return it; the devil is the pope. Farewell eternally. ZÃ¼rich, August 8th, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
