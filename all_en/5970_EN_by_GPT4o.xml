      <p>I have received your three letters, dearest Bullinger, one dated October 10, another dated March 10, 1563, which were indeed delivered to me rather late, on the day before the calends of last June; the third, written on August 29, was delivered in good time in October.</p>
      <p>From these, I have noticed the abundant and intense force of your love, which expressed itself in the sweetest words, and could be content with only my letters or small gifts.</p>
      <p>However, I sent them so that you might understand that not only I myself but also my affairs and fortunes are prepared for your benefit.</p>
      <p>And as for the thanks you give for the cloth, and you say you will repay, I acknowledge your singular kindness, who, although I owe you much, confess that you are indebted and obliged to me.</p>
      <p>As for the silver cup, in which you constantly recall my memory, I accept it in such a way that, while nothing is more pleasing to me than your benevolence and kindness, it is most gratifying to be in frequent memory and, as it were, to be in your eyes and sight.</p>
      <p>And because it is a very small cup of such modest value, I have sent you another fourteen crowns and my insignia, which you desire, so that you may have a larger cup made, suitable for a full banquet.</p>
      <p>Regarding the plots and fury of the adversaries, by which you are endangered, I am indeed distressed as you are, and again I am uplifted by the consolation you propose through Him who has overcome the world, whose followers cannot be conquered or overcome by the world.</p>
      <p>And from the injuries of the papists, we are not so much afflicted as the glory of God is illustrated, and the gospel is amplified.</p>
      <p>Throughout all of England, we have the same ecclesiastical doctrine as you, in rites and ceremonies indeed, nor, as the people are taught, do we differ much in the estimation of these.</p>
      <p>However, we have never ceased, as you urge, to teach, admonish, and insist on what is right and to be followed from the Holy Scriptures, lest by our fault the flock entrusted to us be scattered by the old errors, which are still secretly spread by the papists.</p>
      <p>Of the books you mention in your second letter, I have received three of the same argument against Brentius's Ubiquity: which matter an Englishman, as you desire, has undertaken, and with divine help will treat it sharply and eloquently, so that it may be known to all that the English agree with the Zurichers in this matter.</p>
      <p>I received news of the death of the most illustrious man Peter Martyr before the arrival of your letters.</p>
      <p>I rejoice over the successor designated by him while dying.</p>
      <p>The Council of Trent, instituted against Christ, when it has been brought to its height, will be scattered by Him who sits in the heavens and laughs at them, just as He has always made the vain counsels of men void and brought them to nothing.</p>
      <p>It remains, my Bullinger, that I send you many greetings in my name and that of my wife, and to the best matrons, your wife and Froschauer's; also to your family, Simler, Losius, Lavater, and Zwingli; then to the beloved brothers in Christ, Mr. Gwalter, Bibliander, Wolf, and Haller, my host, and the poor widow who served us while we were staying together in Froschauer's house, to whom I sent two crowns.</p>
      <p>I wish for your health from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Henceforth, I will take care that you do not lack my letters, which I also ask you to do in return again and again.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for a long time for His church!</p>
      <p>Winchester, December 13, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, as much as I am, Robert, Bishop of Winchester.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and dearest brother in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>"I received the letters of the Bishop of Winchester, England, in August 1564."</p>
