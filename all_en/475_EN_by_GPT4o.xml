      <p>Greetings. Before I left Strasbourg, I informed you about my plans and departure. In the meantime, I have not written because I did not have the opportunity to send letters, and I spent most of the time traveling, which was indeed very troublesome for me, until finally, after a long journey, I settled in this university, where I hold a position in Greek literature, in which I strive to show moderate diligence and faithfulness. Therefore, having some respite and the opportunity to send letters through those who are going to the Frankfurt market, I wanted to write to you to renew our old friendship and give you a reason to write back. Although I am separated from you by a great distance, I am indeed very closely connected in spirit, studies, and religious beliefs.</p>
      <p>For, to pass over the doctrine of religion, in which you excel, I have always attributed to you the praise of integrity and faith, and wherever I am, I do not cease to proclaim these virtues and seek them in many other nations. I believe, however, that it is not without a certain divine plan that we have been cast into this corner, so that for some time we might remain safe from the snares that the tyrants laid for us, even when we were in Basel. But we are in the hand of God, who can protect His own anywhere, and we owe Him this obedience, to be always ready to move from here whenever we are called by our leader. As for the public state of this kingdom, know this: the public assemblies have ended, in which, by common decree of the orders, I hear that the Lord Protector's brother, the admiral, has been condemned and even beheaded, having been caught in many ways in the crime of diminished majesty. In the matter of religion, I also hear that a commendable reformation has been made, which has not yet come to light, but is said to be coming soon. In the widespread conversations of people, it is rumored that the mass has been abolished and the use of marriage has been granted to priests. I believe these two points to be the main ones in the whole reformation, which, as I think, does not aim to inform the entire body of Christian doctrine and to explain each article with a certain and firm opinion without ambiguity, but is entirely focused on properly instituting the ministry of the temples.</p>
      <p>I hear that there was a great debate among the bishops about transubstantiation, all of which were conducted in secret as if they were the Eleusinian mysteries, because it was forbidden to share these great mysteries with profane people. However, I think that some childish things have been left by them with a not reprehensible plan, so that the people are not offended by too much novelty, which, however, can be corrected shortly. But I pronounce nothing certain until the matter is entirely clear to me. As soon as a booklet is published, if it is in Latin, I will send it to you; if otherwise, I will write more certain things about each article. You can inform Master Hooper of these things, to whom I will write if time permits; I would like him to perform the duty owed to his country, which is gravely suffering from a lack of good preachers at this time, and to bring help to the churches in the greatest calling of all, which is the work of a man not only of outstanding talent but also of a heroic heart, which I think he can do with dignity.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to Master Pellican and the other brothers, in whose prayers I wish to commend the entire course of my life to God. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Cambridge, March 25, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the word of God. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
