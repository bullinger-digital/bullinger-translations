      <p>The recommendation of Philipp, whom you commended to me, was most welcome to me, as he has left here, because he was creating great envy and hatred among many young men, indeed even among our good ones, due to his youthful and foolish audacity and his desire to involve himself in tragedies inopportunely, once and again. For this reason, I feared that if he stayed here, he might someday bring danger upon his own head or even, as it happens, unwillingly fall into it. For it is customary for someone who is forced to admit defeat to suddenly exercise the strength of his kindled hatred against the unsuspecting. Furthermore, his departure was not at all displeasing to me for this reason, that he seemed to me to be most impatient of admonition and just reproof and to hate me because I bore his rashness and audacity with the greatest displeasure and reproached him for it, which the duty of the rectorship, which I have now held for a whole year, required me to notice more severely. But I thought it necessary to consider the reputation and esteem of your name and to overlook it. He indeed puts forward his reasons for his actions, as if he had unwillingly and provokedly defended himself, which I could easily believe. But what was the need to walk around the cemetery after dinner with his sword girded, as many others cut and defile their clothes, indulge in drunkenness, and have nothing more familiar in their mouths than "God's wonder, martyr, element," etc.? For this reason, if it pleases the gods, what would prevent him from taking the same liberty for himself? As if any good young man is sent here to follow the common and disgraceful custom rather than the modesty and honesty of a few. Finally, I was affected with joy at his departure because I understood that he was indeed more hostile towards me because I refused to give him money for drinking parties and similar unnecessary things and because I also forbade the wine merchant to send him as much wine as he wanted. But indeed, whatever I did in this matter, I thought I did it rightly for his own benefit and the honor of his parents, and unless you, my lords, who are so dear and venerable to me, had commended him to me, if I had known he would become so insolent as to interpret in a bad way what I did by your order and for his most rightful benefit and honor, I would not even have wanted to dignify him with a glance, and, to tell the truth, I regret having bestowed any benefit, even the smallest, upon him, as he, once drunk and having roamed with a drawn sword in my house and being reproached by his comrades for that reason, responded: "What do I care about the rector and the dean? Let them come; may God grant it," etc., which I abhor to write and have concealed, lest, if he found out it was revealed to me by them, he might threaten some danger to them as (as they commonly say) his betrayers. It is possible that he may return to the right path; but I strongly doubt it, especially if he is allowed to use his rights in the schools and does not feel a stricter judge and avenger of his morals. I am also particularly moved by the fact that he promised me with a handshake that he would not want to carry his sword out of my house without my consent, which I had taken from him because he had abused it; but having forgotten his given word, he later walked around in the bacchanals masked in the manner of other fools for two days through the city and carried a mask around and finally, I don't know if he got involved in a riot, he was wounded with a small axe and wanting to hide this damage from me, he inflamed and set fire to his leg with his boots on, so that he lay in bed for many days and the fire was barely extinguished. When his host Spissius, a good man, was reluctant to send him food and I did not visit him or he lacked money, he openly said he was living among dogs and Jews and would therefore leave, etc. When he recovered, I reproached him quite harshly for what he had done wrong; but he evaded and excused himself as much as he could and asked me not to remember him unfavorably in your letters, and I gave him hope that if he were indeed going to Lausanne or some similar trivial school (as he claimed), I would conceal everything, but if to any university, especially in Germany, I would hardly do so, fearing that he might be led astray there as he was here; it is, however, my duty to reveal it if I thought he was in danger of his honor in the schools, so that his parents would not be disappointed in their expectations and resources and he would not become a laughingstock to many in the future, and I went over with him the accounts of expenses and receipts and among other things told him he should pay 2 florins for the bed, as he had used it for three quarters of a year, although it was customary to pay at least 3 florins for an annual bed, I nevertheless accepted nothing for one quarter, and he easily agreed and consented and returned a promissory note in the name of the debt. However, two days later he approached a widow related to me by blood, whom I had asked to lend him her bed for 20 weeks (for he had previously used a large bed of mine; but when I saw he was alone and would not use it or perhaps not pay as much as I thought fair, I asked the widow to lend him a bed, assuring her I would see to it that she received what was sufficient) and asked how much she wanted to be paid for the bed. She, in her simplicity, replied that since he was using it alone, she thought she would ask for half the rent; but if he had had a roommate, she would rightly require the full amount, namely 3 florins. Upon hearing this, he went to his drinking companions and slandered, "I have overcharged him; he wants to keep a different account with me," which he did not dare to do. So what was the need for these slanders? But he deserved them by my trust in him, my candid admonitions, my indulgence, where by duty I should have deprived him of his sword and additionally burdened him with a monetary penalty or restrained him according to the tenor of our laws or certainly excluded him from my house. But indeed, what injury did I do to him? He frequently had others who slept with him in the same bed, for which reason I refused to lend him mine any longer, and what I foresaw has now also happened in reality, namely that I would receive slanders rather than a just payment, even though others frequently slept with him, why did I not demand the full sum of 3 Rhenish florins, why only 2 florins, when I should and could have rightfully demanded two and a half for three quarters of a year?</p>
      <p>What did my generosity benefit me, that I forgave him the rent for the bed for a whole quarter? Indeed, he came here on the day of St. John the Baptist and left on March 19, and he considers it unfair to pay 2 florins for the bed for that time, when he knows that some other two Swiss are forced to pay 4 Joachimsthalers for a not better bed for one year. But the matter stands thus: he thought he should make up and compensate for what he had spent more freely on drinking parties, etc., with me as the enemy of his desires. These matters are most unworthy of your expectation and ears, for which reason I had decided and in a way promised to conceal them entirely from you, unless from this last deed it could be inferred that he would bring me into disrepute with you as a defense of his life spent here so honorably or even with more serious slanders. If he does so, take from here what you should answer him; if not, I solemnly beseech you not to reproach him with any such matters done here, but I advise you to at least decide from here how safe it is to support him at great expense in foreign schools, lest you be more disappointed in your expectations, lest the father be exhausted and all the remaining children be burdened with his excessive and useless expenses and finally he himself with his friends and parents become a joke to the neighbors. Therefore, I say, I have entered into this favor with Philipp and write these things to you so that you may assist his parents with timely advice, so that you may rather provide him with a worthy office and an honorable marriage to curb his own license. From what disposition he is towards letters, it can be inferred from here that he neither seriously nor consistently engaged with them here, as I say he gradually sold and disposed of all his books. Nor is it surprising; for the more refined muses do not agree well with Mars and Bacchus, much less with the study of theology. I write, I say, these things not out of a useless desire to revile, but because I wish him to be brought back and recalled to the right path by your counsel and the work of his parents with some such pretext and deliberately fabricated reasons, so that he may fly to it and not suspect the monster that is being nourished, if it may be called the healthiest advice. He told me he was going to Lausanne, but he gave other students hope of going to Leuven together. I ask you, beware that he never understands from my writing that you or his parents are offended and incited against him. Farewell. Written hastily and at intervals due to the importunity of business. Marburg, in the year 1551, March 20.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Wigand Happel. To the most illustrious and distinguished men, Heinrich Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther, most worthy interpreters of the word of God, their reverend lords and friends.</p>
