      <p>S. D. From your letters, most illustrious man, I have derived not a little pleasure, nor is it new or unexpected to me that you, together with your fellow ministers, congratulate me on this liberation. I have no doubt, given the affection with which you regard me, that if I come to Zürich, both your home and all your possessions, as you write, will be ready for my necessary use.</p>
      <p>I give thanks to God, who has endowed you with this spirit and will. Thus He deals with His own, namely, that since they have heavenly things and Christ Himself in common among them, they also diligently cultivate the communion of earthly things, as far as just reason allows. And hence I feel that what the Lord promised is granted to us, that in this life too we may receive a hundredfold, as many of us have suffered some loss of worldly things for the sake of Christ's gospel. Therefore, I do not refuse what you offer; for if I do not remain here, I will come to you, and in mutual faith in Christ, we will not only console each other but also consider together where I can act honorably and faithfully exercise my calling. A few days ago, I wrote to you about this matter, but I fear, due to either the negligence or treachery of the couriers, that you may not have received the letters. I am still very doubtful whether I will be accepted here; indeed, the magistrate, as well as Sturmius, Dasipodius, Sleidanus, and many other learned and good men, would like it; but some theologians resist, saying that it is easy for contentions about the sacramental matter to be stirred up through me, and they are, I think, more strongly suspicious because I have testified to the magistrate that I will neither change nor retract anything from what I have already written in the booklets I have published, since I do not have a double and venal doctrine in the gospel of Christ, but a pure and simple one, which I can promise to them and their school.</p>
      <p>Therefore, may God direct the matter with His providence and grant the outcome that seems best. As for me, whatever way the matter falls, I will take it well, and I ask you to let me know in the meantime what counsel you think should be used and what you think should be done if I do not stay here. Now you have news of my affairs; I will now speak of the English matters.</p>
      <p>The Lord of Canterbury, along with Joanna, formerly queen, and the sons of the Duke of Northumberland, was publicly condemned to death, as is the custom in that kingdom, on November 14th, and this was decreed more severely against him than the others, since he was previously hanged, and afterwards, his body was to be cut into four parts, which they decided he should suffer for the crime of treason committed, while they kept silent about the cause of religion, either because it seemed too honorable or so as not to offend the people too much. Now, however, it has been reported through letters sent from Antwerp, which none of us expected, that the archbishop has been granted life, nevertheless, so that he is detained in prison, and I also think this has happened to others who were condemned with him, and it is believed that this was done so that, if he were to be brought out to be killed with others, popular riots would not be stirred up. Blessed be God, who thus alleviates and mitigates calamities. To this is added the certainty of a future marriage between Philip, King of Spain, and Mary, Queen of England, and now the nobles of the kingdom have given their consent, but under what terms, we still do not know. This is what I have to write now; when I learn more, I will make sure you are not unaware.</p>
      <p>I have read your booklet on the providence of God with great pleasure and thank you for sharing the matter with me so kindly. As for your request for my judgment, I recognize it as a mark of the humanity that is innate in you, not because you need my advice or assistance. Therefore, I will defer discussing this matter with you for the present, partly because I have just returned, and the space of a letter does not allow such a great question to be discussed between us now, partly because I hope that we will soon be able to enjoy mutual conversation. In the meantime, however, I would not want you to take it that, because I wrote to you about this matter, I feared you might become the author of some disturbance or contention, since I am well aware of your spirit and modesty; but I only added that part to my letter so that through you, who are endowed with not inconsiderable authority, others might be countered who might perhaps drag the question into a contest. If I remain in this city, I will treat your son with the affection as if he were born of me; for as I have gladly heard that you have destined him for sacred ministries and have greatly approved your holy counsel in this, so I will help him with whatever means I can, thereby showing how much I value you. As for the cause of the Lord a Lasco, I see you are not a little concerned, and I will inform you about him as best I can. About fifteen days or a little more before I left England, he departed from there with the greater part of his church of foreigners to Denmark. For he told me that the king had already consented that he could be there with his church. However, as I was later informed, he did not have a prosperous voyage; for he struggled for a long time with adverse weather before he and his people reached there, and finally, when they arrived at Copenhagen, they found almost all those places deserted by the inhabitants; for the plague was raging there so that a great part of the natives had either been taken away or compelled to flee. Even the king himself was staying at the borders of the kingdom, that is, not far from Hamburg.</p>
      <p>This is what I can report to you about these matters; but when I learn what has happened since, I will make sure you are not unaware. Farewell, love me as you do, and greet all your fellow ministers in my name. December 30, 1553, in Straßburg:</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>Now my matter is almost settled, and it seems decreed that I will be retained here in Straßburg. Therefore, it will not be necessary to place me elsewhere...</p>
      <p>May God keep you safe for us for a long time. January 1, 155[4]. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
