      <p>Most illustrious man, I have received three letters from you, to which I have not yet given any response, nor do I give one now. Not only am I afflicted by poor health, but I am also overwhelmed by numerous affairs. However, I will soon respond to everything. I only now indicate that I have obtained everything that the masks of Trent have established; I have given them to be copied and will send everything to you as soon as possible. The pastors of Chur urge me to be with them on the day of Paul to discuss certain matters of religion. If my health permits, I will not be absent, and if I come as far as Chur, I will also make my way to you; thus I hope. I cannot write more now. Farewell and greetings to you with your whole household, school, and church. Just an hour ago, a new brother fleeing from Italy came to me, indeed. What I should do, I do not know; I gladly gather the members of Christ; but I have learned that not all are members of Christ who come to me from there. May God guide me with His counsel and spirit.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, January 4, 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Bullinger.</p>
