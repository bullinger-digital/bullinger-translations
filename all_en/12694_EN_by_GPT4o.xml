    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Engelbert [Milander], the former student of Thamer, who is now a follower of Bullinger, reported very pleasing things about the Zurich church in the military camp. It is said to pray twice a week for [the Schmalkaldic League], so that the antichristian Pope [Paul III] and his beloved son [Emperor] Charles [V] of Ghent do not defeat them and the people cannot say: "Where is your God [Ps. 42 (Vulg. 41), 4; 79 (Vulg. 78), 10; 115 (Vulg. 114), 2; Jo 2, 17; Mi 7, 10], and what is to be thought of their Gospel and their faith that alone justifies?" Thamer would rather die than have to hear such a thing! [Milander] also recounted how the opponents of Zurich [and their allies] worship their god Baal and Maozim and attempt to replace the Gospel with Antichristianity. Yet they will experience what David once prophesied to [the enemy]: "May his prayer become sin!", and "The curse he loved, may it come upon him; the blessing he refused, may it be far from him!" (Ps. 109, [7. 17 - Vulg. Ps. 108, 7. 18]). Before this, faith must be purified as if by fire [cf. Zech. 13, 9], so that the [Protestants] learn to put theory into practice. Through the war, it becomes apparent that God is ashamed of both them (because of their ingratitude) and the Papists (because of their idolatry). Thanks to Paul [cf. Heb. 12, 6-10], however, [the Protestants] know that God disciplines them for their salvation. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] The [Schmalkaldic] army is three-headed: The first head is Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony]; the second is Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse]; the third are the [allied] cities. It is thus a monster, and Bullinger knows Homer's statement "Nothing good comes from many rulers. Only one should rule" [Iliad 2, 204]... Had the Landgrave been able to exercise power, they would have long since seized the Emperor and his bishops and cardinals, just as they did with Duke Heinrich of Brunswick! Presumably, however, the measure of the Emperor's misdeeds is not yet full [cf. Gen. 15, 16]. The people of Zurich should therefore continue to pray without ceasing [cf. 1Thess. 5, 17]. Hopefully, their prayers are more effective than military action. </p>

    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] Thamer wrote the present letter mainly to show Bullinger that he does not stand hostile to him (as once communicated). Thamer cannot deny that in the last three years he was a passionate defender of Luther and in doing so did some injustice to Bullinger and others. But now he has been taught better. For if Luther's view of a "natural and substantial" consumption of the body and blood of Christ during the Lord's Supper were true, the New Testament would not be more effective than the Old, and thus the redemption acquired through Christ would be called into question. But enough of that. Should God grant his church external peace again, Thamer would like to visit Zurich and discuss Bullinger's commentary on John with him. </p>

      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ. Engelbert, once my student and now yours, a most learned man, came to me in the camp. He reported to me such things about your churches that filled me with incredible joy. He said that you gather once or twice a week to pray to God, our Father, through the Lord Jesus Christ, that He may grant victory to us, His little flock, and not allow the dreadful tyrant and antichrist, the Pope, through his beloved son Charles of Ghent, to triumph over us miserable ones and to cast such insane words upon the people of God: "Where now is their God, where is the Gospel they constantly proclaimed, where is that faith which they claim alone justifies?" Indeed, I would rather suffer a thousand cruel deaths than witness such calamity upon the church with my own eyes or hear such bitter blasphemies against God, our Father! On the contrary, he also said that your adversaries, the Papists, devoutly worship their Bel and Maozim, hoping to extinguish the light of the Gospel and propagate and restore the antichristian. But what happens to them is what the prophet David foretold in Psalm 108: "May his prayer become sin," etc. Also: "He loved cursing, and it came upon him; he did not delight in blessing, and it was far from him," etc. Before this happens, however, our faith will be tested as if by fire. We have heard the Gospel of God for more than twenty years. Now the time demands that we translate theory into practice, that is, that our progress becomes manifest and we learn how far we still are from the perfection that the law requires of us. I will tell you frankly what I think: The war will be from the wrath of God, in which God will shame us for our ingratitude and the Papists for their idolatry. Yet, like a father, He will discipline us more, or as Paul says, judge us, so that we are not condemned with the wicked world; such punishment will He inflict.</p>

      <p>Our army is three-headed: the first head is the Elector, the second the Landgrave, the third the cities; but you know that a monster has so many heads, and you are not unaware of that saying of Homer:... If the authority of our prince had prevailed as it should have by right, the Emperor would already be in our hands with all the bishops and cardinals, just like Duke Heinrich of Brunswick. But I think his iniquities are not yet complete; he must accumulate more sins so that he may endure greater punishment and the power of God may become known to more people. Pray unceasingly at home, that God the Father may guide and govern both us and our hands, so that we neither plan nor do anything against His majesty and the edification of the church. With these your arms, I hope you will achieve more at home than we with the physical sword.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Written hastily in the camp near Giengen.</p>

      <p>I was pleased to write this to you especially, so that I may not seem to be offended with you, as I hear I have been reported to you. Three years ago, I was a most ardent defender of Luther, I cannot deny, and somewhat unjust to you and others. But thanks be to God, I now understand the matter better. If Luther's opinion about the sacrament were to prevail, that the natural body of Christ is consumed there, then the New Testament would become the Old, because the Lamb of God was a natural and substantial body and blood, which Christ abolished, and He imparts the truth itself, that is, not a sign of redemption, but the redemption itself. But now is not the place to dispute these things. If God once grants external peace to His church, I wish to visit you and discuss with you those places I have noted in your John.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, professor of sacred letters in the church of Zurich, his dearest brother in the Lord. In Zurich.</p>
