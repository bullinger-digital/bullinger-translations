      <p>C[oelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Your immortal benefits, Bullinger, my brother and most esteemed lord, I not only acknowledge but have also testified in many of my letters and proclaimed to everyone, not because I thought you desired this, but because I consider it my duty to express gratitude whenever the opportunity arises. Nor is there any reason for you to fear that I would ever abuse your kindness towards me or challenge your authority in any dispute.</p>
      <p>And yet I know you are not the kind of person who would refuse to help a brother struggling for the truth, even with a word, to whom you have so often provided support in substance, faith, and goodwill. You wrote me a letter; I thank you for responding to mine, and I ask that you also deign to respond to this one. Vergerius, a cunning and sly man, extracted some words from you, not for any other purpose than to completely overturn the good reputation he had earned for himself and his name, a man who says one thing standing and another sitting (forgive me if I speak the truth at the most opportune time), a different man in Rhaetia and Helvetia, another in the court, you understand what I mean, and between us.</p>
      <p>If Ochino had not responded to Westphal, oh blessed Ochino! Because Ochino responded, a sincere man, not at all deceitful, unfortunate Ochino, unfortunate Locarnese; for they will not receive the intended benefit of the prince. Here, here Vergerius claims that I explicitly wrote that men can be saved without Christ, without faith, without religion (I use his word). Oh, the impudence! Where did I ever say, write, or imply this? Why have I suffered so much and so greatly without cause, if indeed without, unless to disturb everything and overturn what has been well said. Whether these things are so, I ask you, brother, see pages 27, 35, and 36, 107, 142, 143, 173, 203, and onwards, and compare these passages with the one that begins on page 195 and onwards, you will see clearly whether I ascribe salvation to anyone without Christ the Lord, without the true worship of God. For on page 196 I even use the words of Zwingli, the apostle of the Swiss churches; if I had followed him in everything, I could have said more, to say nothing of the holy and learned man Rodolph Gualther and others, but I preferred to keep myself within certain limits and speak from my own faith, not that of others. As for the rest of our work, we deal with two kinds of questions, one of those about which one can freely dispute on either side, the other of those which must be held without controversy. About the former, we do not wish to speak affirmatively and definitively, as we have testified in the preface of the whole work and the epilogue. In the course of the discussion, however, the decorum of the characters had to be served, and each had to perform their parts vigorously, which indeed is the custom of dialogues.</p>
      <p>I would show these things with examples, if I did not understand to whom I am writing. What then was the need for Vergerius to stir up so many troubles, unless he thought that my name somehow stood in his way among those nations of which he makes himself the apostle. But let the name of Coelius perish, provided the name of Christ is announced purely, without ambition, without the pursuit of money and the belly. But now I draw in the reins and ask two things from you, my brother and most esteemed lord, one whether you have condemned or otherwise my treatment as impious, as it is said, and heretical, the second, whether it is heresy if someone says that some can obtain salvation without the knowledge of Christ (I do not say without Christ), to these two I ask you to respond, I implore you by God, not to draw you into contention, because I abhor contentions, but to assist me in this matter of my need. For that you dissuaded, advised me not to publish, these things I say are old and about this matter I will also sometime satisfy you in person, as I have also partly done in writing. This duty, which fraternal charity demands and requires from you, I ask you not to deny me, again and again, best brother, I pray. My wife and four children, who are with me, give thanks for your paternal greeting and in turn commend themselves entirely to your piety, and we all greet your wife, an excellent woman, and your daughters and sons and sons-in-law and Mr. Rodolph Gualther, your co-father, who is very dear to me.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your sincerely, Coelius S[ecundus] Curio wrote.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
