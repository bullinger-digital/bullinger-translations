    <p xml:id="regest1">Serin has used the name "Rimmon" in the [German-language] writing [«De adoratione Naemanni»] completely thoughtlessly everywhere (even in places where the text becomes difficult to understand) without declension. The genitive form in the title and especially in the first part would have been much more appropriate for the correct understanding of the text. Therefore, in the print [at the corresponding places], "Rimmon" should be corrected to "Rimmons" or the reader should be informed at the end of the book [about the use of the undeclined word form].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Serin can also send the work himself for sale towards Austria, if the printer does not want to take this on for fear of punishment. For this purpose, several copies should be sent to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">He wants to soon translate his writing into Latin for those Bohemian [brothers] who are not proficient in the German language. He has recently learned of the expulsion threatening them and does not want them to [again] practice the old faith out of fear of this. The translation should also be directed [to the Evangelicals] in Hungary. Serin does not care that he will certainly earn ridicule from those knowledgeable in Latin for his translation: He does not want to be a Roman anyway!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">If the printer does not want to print the writing, he should not bother Bullinger with it, but inform Serin himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">There is no reliable news. In Ulm, however, it is suspected that soon some kind of idolatry (perhaps like in Rome? Certainly a very similar one, as in Brandenburg, Nuremberg, or in Wittenberg) will be introduced.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Martin Bucer is now staying in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Serin would like to hear from Bullinger (if he could spare a little time for it) about the status of his writing, when [the manuscript] will be sent back to him or when the writing will be published.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Greetings, also to all fellow pastors. Bullinger should show Serin goodwill as before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[P.S.:] He should also freely share his opinion on the [planned] dispatch [of the Latin-translated writing] to [Bohemia and Moravia].</p>

      <p>Most imprudently, dearest brother, I have used the word "Rimmon" everywhere, even where it is of great importance, as indeclinable, when it should have been written in the genitive for the less educated and less attentive ("In the temple or house of Rimmon"), in the title and everywhere (especially in the first part) before and after the exposition of these words, which are written in capital letters ("Where I worshipped in the house of Rimmon"), so that the speech would not be perplexing and ambiguous. Therefore, you should give this to the printer, so that he adds the letter "s" or informs the reader at the end.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>If the printer fears he will suffer a loss and cannot send it to Austria himself, let him send me more copies. I will ensure they are sold there.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I think I will soon translate this booklet into Latin for the sake of my Bohemians, who do not understand German, so that they do not worship Rimmon out of fear of exile (which I hear the complete confessors are being punished with), as well as for the neighboring Hungarians. And even if I know I will be mocked by the more delicate Latins, I will bear their disdain, for I do not wish to be Roman otherwise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If the printer wishes to print it, let him write to me himself. I do not want your most serious and holy affairs to be further hindered by these matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am certain of nothing new, except what we predict, that soon some Rimmon, if not Roman, then certainly one of his nephews or relatives, I think, from Brandenburg, Nuremberg, or Wittenberg, will be erected.</p>

      <p>If you have time, indicate with a single line what my Rimmon is doing, and when he will either return or be published.</p>

      <p>Farewell with all fellow pastors and keep me, as you have begun, in your commendation. Ulm, April 11.</p>
      <p>Yours, L. Soërinus.</p>

      <p>Also let me know what you think about the book I am translating, and speak freely, I wish.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful minister of the Catholic Church, Heinrich Bullinger, brother in the Lord, much to be respected. Zurich.</p>
