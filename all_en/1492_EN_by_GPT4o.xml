      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord. Recently, Mr. Calvin was with me when your letter was delivered to him, along with your very learned and pious little work, which you dedicated to our tyrant. If only he had even a crumb of true piety, he is so far from being worthy of the title "most Christian," that I would certainly be surprised to see it appear in your writings to him, if I did not understand well enough that you intended to remind him of his duty with this appellation. However, whenever I think about not only his domestic disgrace and scandals but also his most cruel deeds against the children of God, I wish either that he would not be addressed at all by our people or at least not be adorned with this false title for the sake of posterity. However, let it not be that I criticize your counsel, my father; I am not so insane, indeed I cannot praise enough your outstanding zeal for our French people and I do not cease to pray that you have not expended this effort on him in vain. But enough of this for now.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I was entirely expecting, when Mr. Calvin opened that bundle of letters, that you would respond to my last letters, about which, since I have not heard a word, I suspect they were either intercepted (which I would not want for many reasons) or, at the time you were writing to Calvin, had not yet been delivered to you. But you will soon, I hope, free us from this fear. Everything else here is as usual: astonishing negligence of people and more than supine security in such great evils [...]</p>
