      <p>Praise be to God. June 25, 1550. London.</p>
      <p>Greetings and peace. Today, my dearest lord, I delivered certain letters of yours addressed to Lord Johannes Hooper, and I have no doubt that shortly, if necessary, he will give you a response to the same. I understand that those letters of yours were enclosed in the letters of Johannes Burcher sent to me this month; for I have received many other letters of yours from Burcher from time to time and have taken care to deliver them as soon as I could conveniently to those to whom they were addressed; and you will always find me most ready to do the same whenever necessary.</p>
      <p>Last May, I received your letters dated March 13, along with a copy of the third decade, which you mention there: I am very grateful to your piety for not disdaining to remember me in this way. I have not yet read the booklet: however, I am very pleased with the topics you promise to discuss therein; especially I am glad to hear about negotiations. Because I know you rejoice that the state of England is quite happy, I inform you that never before in our age was there such hope for the purer doctrine of the gospel, its promotion, and the complete overthrow and eradication of antichristian ceremonies and traditions: so much so that we daily expect some Balaams to preach the truth and bless the people of God. And there is a rumor that the Bishop of Winchester will soon be released from the Tower of London, where he has been detained for almost two or three years because of his obstinacy, and will publicly assert the pure doctrine of Christ; with what mind, God knows, perhaps unwillingly. However it may happen, in the meantime, we all here who favor the gospel rejoice that Christ Jesus will be preached clearly.</p>
      <p>But I wrote more of this kind recently to Lord Johannes Butler, whom I ask you to greet in my name, and also his pious wife.</p>
      <p>As for your letters to others, or those of others addressed to you, I would be most willing to fulfill your wish. However, I have long since urged the aforementioned Burcher diligently about the same. And I have no doubt that he will gladly do what you wish, provided he can receive the money he ought to spend for such letters at Strasbourg. My wife, who now (thanks be to God!) has recovered from a very serious illness, commends herself to you and your most pious wife from the heart, as does she who was once the wife of Lord Megander, and to the others known to her there. I have no doubt that the Lord Heavenly Father has heard your and others' pious prayers for her; for she was almost giving up her soul two or three times on alternate nights last December, when you wrote to me and to others here. You write that you lack some pleasure when I do not write to you, and that you delight in my letters. Therefore, I now finally reply, although I do not see any matter from which you would have been so delighted, except in this, that I wrote hastily about the hope we all pious here have for the promotion of the kingdom of God and Christ.</p>
      <p>The reason your letters are sometimes delivered here very late, lingering long on the journey, is that Johannes Burcher often entrusts them to sailors at Strasbourg, even to drivers and passengers who carry goods to Antwerp via the Rhine. He does this especially when the bundles of letters are somewhat large: otherwise, he would be forced to pay postage for each ounce, which weighs ten crucifers at Speyer, and not much less even at Antwerp and London, if they were sent from here by post. At Antwerp, the post takes two Brabant stivers for a sheet of paper to be delivered to London, and besides, as much in London; that is, 4 stivers for a whole sheet of paper: but when we entrust letters to merchants to be delivered, we give nothing here or there.</p>
      <p>Lord Bernardino and Bartholomew Traherne send you many greetings. I pray you, my lord, to commend me to all those there who wish me well, namely Lord Gwalther, Lord Bibliander, Lord Pellican, Zwingli, Ludwig Lavater, and others. In what state Lord Hooper's affairs are, who was nominated Bishop of Gloucester by the royal majesty two months ago, you undoubtedly understand from his own letters.</p>
      <p>He perseveres by the grace of God as a most constant defender of the gospel, and concerning the matter of the Eucharist, he freely preaches your orthodox doctrine everywhere here: he advises, indeed persuades everyone. Our people also, as many as sincerely loved the truth, were always inclined to that opinion of the Eucharist. I pray you to convey my greetings in the Lord Jesus to your most chaste wife, who always guides us in the way of truth. Amen. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, R[ichard] H[illes], Englishman. To the most learned and pious theologian, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest friend, let these letters be given.</p>
      <p>Zurich</p>
