      <p>S. A certain young man from the Gesner family came to me inquiring about my letters; but I do not have anything to write now, and recently, what I received from Italy, I wanted to be communicated to you through Mr. MÃ¼ller. Just know this, that our people have raised their crests after they learned that so many from your region have gone into that mercenary military service.</p>
      <p>Our people from the Grisons, who want to be evangelical and in previous years wanted to be seen as the foremost slayers of papal bulls, were the first now to diligently serve the pope's henchmen.</p>
      <p>Very few are not fully prepared and with gaping throats embrace that military service. Only our people from Chur have most severely prohibited this impiety.</p>
      <p>However, how the citizens will react to this edict, time and the arrival of the orator, if he is well-funded, will abundantly declare. After that immense massacre committed in France, the king's mercenaries swore off this blood money; now they not only receive the wages but also wish for the massacre committed to be continued. The common people rejoice with the prince in that color and pretext under which the robber leads our soldiers, meanwhile, conscience pricks otherwise, and what is confessed is doubted, as long as we indulge our passions more boldly. But let them all go in the name of the devil and never return. The ancestral custom required that the envoy should not only ask for soldiers in front of the three heads but in the convened assemblies at his own expense, in which the syndics, instructed by their people, would deny or grant it from the commission. But now, in their haste, it was immediately referred to the people by the three leaders; for a crow recognizes a crow, and fatherhood has been cast aside into a corner for the sons. About the rest, if there will be any, another time. I just wanted to give this to you so that I would not send this young man away empty-handed.</p>
      <p>May God keep you safe and sound for all of us for as long as possible. Most swiftly from our Chur, June 3, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
