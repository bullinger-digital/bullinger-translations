      <p> Greetings. I received your letter dated the first of February today for the first time, and it is not necessary for me to respond to it in detail, as I expect you will receive mine tomorrow, which I wrote yesterday and sent through a certain messenger of yours. From which you will understand what has been done here and with what consensus your Exposition has been received and that it has been granted to be published also in our name. I hope that all this will satisfy you. As for the points of moderation, as you have now sent them, they please me. At least in these words in the title "on clothing and vessels," if it seems to you to be published under a common name, where you write: "Indeed, we do not contend with anyone nor do we condemn those who use vessels," etc., it would seem not only that we do not condemn anyone using these, but also that some from our churches use such things, so that our people would see that their use is not only not condemned but also approved. I write this for myself; for I have not yet discussed your letters with anyone; I fear that if I showed them to certain people and they understood your intention, that you are publishing this Exposition only for yourselves, they would approve it and with a new decree revoke the previous concession, which allowed it to be published in our name as well. Although this is indifferent to me, I would still like our churches to be more strictly bound to the purity of this doctrine in the future, which will happen if they are included in this consensus and its publication. Therefore, I will wait until I have another response from you and understand what you have decided regarding our latest matters. I will send the copied preface to Beza, as you request. I have nothing else now, except that I pray to the Lord to keep you safe for a long time and to continually grant you new strength, so that you may be equal to bearing so many and such great labors. All of ours greet you. </p>
      <p> Bern, 9th February 1566. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my most esteemed and revered lord and compatriot. </p>
