    <p xml:id="regest1">The decision communicated by [Johann Jakob] Ammann, that the [Zürich] students accommodated with Myconius should find another place due to his workload, compels him to write; as the true reason, they suspect, based on Bullinger's letter to Myconius [No. 1846], the fear that he might instill in them the poison of a false doctrine of the Lord's Supper; however, Myconius has only mentioned it to them once in passing, and he himself firmly maintains that the inner man enjoys Christ in faith, but that Christ, according to his human nature, remains at the right hand of the Father until his return. Hopes for further instruction; what he thinks about leaving Myconius's house will be reported by Ammann. Blessings and greetings from his fellow students.</p>

      <p>Grace and safety of life from the Lord God through Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Expecting a better progress in my studies day by day, most merciful father in the Lord, I have repeatedly postponed sending my humble letters to you until a more convenient and opportune time. But now, some necessity of writing, which I do not fully understand, compels me to do so. Namely, the common decree of your most noble college, recently transmitted to us through our most esteemed teacher, Mr. Ammann, the schoolmaster, that we should leave Myconius and move to another good and sincere citizen, without assigning any reason for this except one: that Mr. Myconius, overwhelmed by daily labors and cares, can hardly support the boarders for whom he is responsible. While we suspect some other reason might be underlying, behold, Myconius seems to bring us the reason from your letters, namely, that we might not, affected by that evil opinion about the Eucharist, perhaps infect the churches that might be entrusted to us, to our own detriment. Indeed, this would be excellently guarded against if Myconius were trying to infect us with this opinion, which he has never done privately except once and only in passing, where, when we responded that it was not our duty to engage in disputes about these difficult matters with anyone, he never provoked us further. I beg you, do not doubt me; for I have laid such a solid foundation of my faith in Christ the Lord, that even if I had to associate with Myconius, Bucer, and Luther for I don't know how many years, I would never be moved from my faith, strengthened by the grace of the Spirit. I have long since learned from you and your fellow companions, but especially from the word of God, that Christ is always present to his church and that in the supper, we enjoy him in faith with the inner, not the outer man, which neither Myconius nor the gates of hell will take from me, nor will they persuade me of any other bodily presence. For I know that the Lord, in his human nature, sits at the right hand of the Father, but in his divine nature, he is always present with us, and therefore they will never persuade me of what they want. For if he will return in the same manner as he was taken up into heaven, to judge at some unknown time, what need is there for us to drag him down from the right hand of the Father with our eating, with equal power with the Father, into this world? But enough of this for now.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I would wish, if at some time it were possible without inconvenience, that you would send me a few words on these matters, which would be my only delight and would not inconsiderably confirm my faith more and more.</p>
      <p>As for what I should respond regarding the other part, whether I should leave Myconius or not, Ammann the schoolmaster will inform you; for I do not wish to burden you, who are often overwhelmed with many other affairs, with additional matters; for I beg you to forgive even these.</p>
      <p>May the Lord God, I pray, always preserve you in the safe state of your affairs for the salvation of his church, his glory, and the benefit of your neighbor. All my fellow students, along with your entire family, greet you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, in the house of Mr. Myconius, in the year of our salvation 1544, February 22. Your disciple in the Lord, Wolfgang Haller, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant president of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and father.</p>
