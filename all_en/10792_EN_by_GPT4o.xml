    <p xml:id="regest1">Paul gives instructions in his letter to Titus, the overseer in Crete, on the selection of suitable pastors; he writes about the duties of office, teaches obedience to authority, and provides other useful instructions. The letter could appear as an extended excerpt from 1 Timothy. Jerome assumed that it was written in Nicopolis, while Theophylact suspected that Paul composed it after the [first] imprisonment. Bullinger dedicates the Titus-Philemon commentary to Utinger, who does much for the word of God and studies, and who knows that the true church assets cannot be secured without the preservation of truth; therefore, he watches over these attentively, for which many were and will be grateful to him.</p>

      <p>To Heinrich Utinger, patron of studies, Heinrich Bullinger's preface to the epistle of St. Paul to Titus.</p>
      <p>The letter is brief, but dense with mysteries and full of utility, which is addressed to Titus. He, having converted to Christ from paganism, advanced so much in the accepted religion that the apostle cherished him among his chief friends, indeed in the place of a son, and furthermore appointed him over the most noble island of Crete. He instructs him with the present letter, prescribing whom to choose as bishops. For he orders that presbyters be appointed in every town, and such indeed who are of upright life and hold fast to sound doctrine, so that they may be able to refute those who contradict. For as among other nations, so especially among the Cretans, there are certain false apostles who must be vigorously opposed. Then he prescribes the duties of persons and ages, also teaching that magistrates must be obeyed. He provides everywhere excellent and effective exhortations. Finally, he prescribes certain things about rejecting questions and avoiding heretics and other necessary matters.</p>
      <p>This could be seen as an epitome of the former epistle to Timothy. For the same things are treated in this as in that, but here everything is shorter and in other words. Otherwise, there is little difference between the two.</p>
      <p>Saint Jerome assumed this was written from Nicopolis, which is situated on the Actian shore, evidently because Paul himself says at the end of the letter: "Make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis; for I have decided to winter there" [Tit 3, 12]. When it was written, whether before or after the apostle was captured, is not sufficiently clear. Theophylact thinks it was written before the imprisonment and before the later epistle to Timothy was published. Certainly, there will be conjectures for the diligent inquirer, by which it can be gathered that it was written after the sentence of Caesar was concluded in Rome.</p>
      <p>Whatever we write on this and the one that follows to Philemon, we dedicate to your name, venerable elder. For you seemed especially worthy of this subject, who excellently supports the ministry of the word and industriously promotes sacred studies and good works. Indeed, you understand that the true riches of the Lord's temple cannot be preserved without the doctrine of truth being safeguarded, therefore you especially guard this as your duty. For this reason, you were most dear to our Zwingli and will deservedly be loved by posterity and all who are studious. You, as you have done hitherto, continue to favor and do good for studies and piety.</p>
