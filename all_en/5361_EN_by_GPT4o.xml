      <p>Greetings. John Heinrich returns to you, whom you recommended to me in your letters.</p>
      <p>He certainly conducted himself most honorably with us. Indeed, I would have wished to accomplish more for his and your sake, but success does not always correspond to our wishes. As far as I am concerned, never will anyone come from there recommended to me by you, who will not be most welcome. Therefore, never doubt my mind and will towards you.</p>
      <p>I wish and desire that everything may turn out prosperous and happy for you and your churches. Nothing more at present.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well with the entire assembly of the pious. London, June 10, 1562.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, F. Bedford. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich. Zurich.</p>
