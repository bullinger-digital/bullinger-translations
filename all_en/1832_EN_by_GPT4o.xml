      <p>Greetings. It can hardly be expressed, most faithful servant and minister of Christ, Bullinger, how much pleasure and true joy your letters and those of the council attached to yours have brought me.</p>
      <p>You indeed indicate from the beginning of your letters, with what success the word of the Lord runs through the world; with so many peoples, so many nations, so many mighty kingdoms defecting from the antichrist to Christ, our only mediator, that, as Christ loves me, nothing could have been more delightful for me to hear. Hereafter, I will more peacefully return my spirit to the Lord, who has prolonged my life thus far. The same joy also brought me, as I heard from your letters, and also from the mouth of Froschauer, that you have recovered from the illness, which you suffered so gravely this winter; for what could have happened more grievously to the church of Christ than to be deprived of such a great teacher, defender, and propagator of evangelical truth? Christ has restored you, his most chosen instrument, to health, anointed you with his saving spirit, so that you may bear his name with your pious pen before the nations, kings, peoples, and nations scattered everywhere throughout the whole world. May he grant that you may remain safe and sound for his church as long as possible; may all those to whom sincere doctrine, the love of Christ, and true piety are dear, join in this wish of mine with an amen. But hey, excellent Bullinger, you know that common saying: "What lacks alternate rest is not durable," and remember that the flesh, with which you are still surrounded, is not adamantine, and so temper your excessive studies, lest you seem, as has happened to many, to summon an untimely death of your own accord.</p>
      <p>Jacobus Ceporinus, if we believe Pindar in the preliminary letter to the pious memory of Huldrych Zwingli, would have lived longer, if he had known or been able to temper himself in this. What labors of genius and sleepless nights without moderation brought to Leo Jud in translating the sacred books from Hebrew, and his συνεργὸς (collaborator) Collin, as you yourself are an eyewitness. If Conrad Gesner has met his fate (which has been reported to me only by uncertain rumor), I will not seem to err greatly if I count him among the former. He was a man, while I was present, still in the prime of life (if you consider his years) and, as my conjecture then suggested, scarcely past forty or certainly not much beyond, yet the pallor of his face then accused his excessive studies. Since these examples are almost domestic to you, I beg you by our common Christ, excellent Bullinger, to have some regard for your health and to temper your studies and vigils, so that the church of Christ may have you as its defender for as long as possible; the little boat of Peter, as it is called, is still tossed in the middle of the sea, that devastating beast is still raging, ready to devour the vineyard of the Lord, unless you and those like you, the most valiant athletes of Christ, crush its head with the hammer of the word of God. Paul, although he desired and sincerely wished to be dissolved and to be with Christ, yet frankly confesses that it is more necessary for the church of Christ that this life be prolonged for him. It is fitting that we should judge the same of you and your like; for what he was to his age, you are today to the church and the sheep of Christ. Therefore, take care of your health.</p>
      <p>Regarding the paper gift, as you call it, of so many volumes partly from you, partly from Rodolph Gwalther, that most dear man, which you have honored me with, though undeserving, I presently give thanks to your kindness, not as I ought, but as I can today; for I frankly acknowledge that I owe more than I can express in any words, so much so that I would rightly seem to be stained with the mark of ingratitude, unless I eventually think of reciprocating. While I was writing these letters and sending them to Froschauer in Frankfurt, I had not yet received your paper gift; but I held it as if I had received it, such is the faith of Froschauer with me. As many of the books given as a gift are published in the German language, I will commend them to my wife to read, hoping not without spiritual benefit and fruit.</p>
      <p>Finally, as for the gift or memento offered by me to your church, school, and in the event to the poorer, there is no need to extol it so much in words, it is indeed modest and very small and by no means comparable to the merits of your church towards me; for you have sown spiritual things; what great thing is it if you reap some of my carnal things, which I will soon otherwise leave behind? Perhaps to ungrateful heirs and unless I provide in my last will, perhaps even to ἀξελούς (unworthy ones). Indeed, I should rather rejoice in my bosom, that it was not deemed unworthy by the church of Christ and approved by you and your most holy council. But let us now dismiss these matters and think about transferring the money to you in the coming autumn. It could not be done from the present fairs, especially not completely and being so late informed about it; if it could have been, I would have indicated it in my recent letters to you.</p>
      <p>You will hear the reason why from the council, to whom I have disclosed it. For the autumn fairs, for the upcoming September, I will take care that the promised money is transferred to Frankfurt and deposited with a man known to Froschauer by name and face. His name is Hieronymus Agninus, as the common titles have it, a doctor not unlearned in civil law, together with some other advocates of that city, a celebrated man, upright and sincerely Christian, once a domestic disciple of Simon Grynaeus in Basel and by that occasion not infrequently a listener of Oecolampadius of pious memory. He will then have instructions from me as my depositary, to either provide a receipt to Froschauer if he wishes or to anyone else bringing letters from your council or you, to promptly and completely pay the said sum in my name; I say completely, unless something has been sent to you through Froschauer from these present fairs as a kind of pledge.</p>
      <p>For there is hope that I will be paid elsewhere in these fairs, if not more, at least one hundred and fifty, which when paid, I have written to the depositary, my present agent, to pay to Froschauer bringing the receipt to you (for you know this is fair and most observed because, as the saying goes, man is a bubble) completely, unless etc. For it is still uncertain to me whether what I expect will happen or not. For while I am staying in Worms, I will be ignorant of what is happening in Frankfurt until the agent reveals it by letters, which cannot be done until the fairs are completely over. However, I want you to know this, even if those one hundred and fifty or more now reach you, you should not be concerned about making the obligations until you have obtained the full sum. And so much for the convenient transfer of the said money.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there are a few things that I would like to be changed in the future obligations, the draft of which the council has sent to me. First of all, that instead of Strasbourg, Frankfurt should be substituted, a place more convenient for me as long as I happen to stay in Worms than Strasbourg, add that the Frankfurt fairs are more celebrated than the Strasbourg ones and therefore that annual pension can be as easily carried and transmitted to Frankfurt by your printers or merchants as to Strasbourg, not to mention that the time for paying the pension, as can be inferred from the above, will fall not on the Strasbourg but on the Frankfurt fairs.</p>
      <p>Regarding the title assigned to me "To the highly learned doctor of both laws," with that ambition set aside, I would prefer it to be replaced with "To the honorable, pious (and if you judge us worthy of that title) and Christian Wolfgang Waidner and Katharina Herdt, spouses, currently residing in Worms on the Rhine"; if the council cannot be persuaded to expunge the rest of the assigned title, which I would like, at least let it expunge that one word "both"; for I would not want the memory of having had anything in common with the son of perdition to be transmitted to posterity. Furthermore, I have advised that a day should be added for the completion of the obligations, which they would have done even without my advising. I approve of all the rest of the draft.</p>
      <p>Finally, you remind me in your letters about the constitution or (as the word is on everyone's lips) the last will; I would gladly comply with your will, but for reasons that, as I hope, will not inconvenience the church of Christ, I have thus far delayed completing it. I do not cease to be an admonisher to my wife, that she may also consider, as I do, to do well with her possessions for the poor... church of Christ. Such admonition has not been entirely fruitless so far, as evidenced by those thousands collected from our common resources and with her consent destined for this use. I am led by good hope that an opportunity will soon be offered, that with her consent I may be allowed to fully dispose of both our possessions, mine and my wife's, according to a wish I have had for many years. If I perceive that it will be delayed longer, I will at least dispose of mine; then I will have complied with your admonition.</p>
      <p>At the end of your letters, you order that my wife and dearest children be greeted along with yours. When I announced this to her acting as an interpreter, she seemed to truly rejoice, which is a sign to me of a heart not alienated from your church, and when she understood that I would reply, she seriously asked and, by her womanly authority, even commanded me to bid you, your wife, and children, along with all those you hold dear, to be very well in Christ from her. And I also bid them to be well in the same, likewise all your fellow ministers, especially (since the names of others escape me) that venerable old man Mr. Pellican with his wife and children, also Friedrich Fry, the dean of your college (if he is still alive); for I still remember, when you received me at a public dinner, that he ascended to our table as the senior, also the most polyglot Theodor Bibliander, than whom I have scarcely seen a more tranquil and modest man, finally with the whole family that most illustrious young man (in the sense that Virgil calls Augustus so), who promises great things for the still lively and flourishing church of Christ, moreover in taming that Roman beast your most valiant συναγωνιστής (fellow combatant), whom as Paul did Timothy, so you not undeservedly call your son. Therefore, if there still remains anywhere a male offspring of Zwingli, you will also bid them to be very well in my name; for I hear that the parent is deceased, as I was once spiritually begotten by the same in Christ Jesus, with the genuine and spiritual understanding of the words of the mystical supper shown, whence: I seem rightly to love his posterity. I know that Gwalther's wife is Zwingli's daughter, whom I have already bid to be well in both my and my wife's name, not yet forgetting that we were also received by them at a private dinner.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all those I have mentioned so far, indeed with your whole church and most holy council eternally in Christ and continue to help me with your prayers to the Lord, as you have begun.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell, most distinguished Bullinger. In Worms on the Rhine, March 26, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Wolfgang Waidner.</p>
