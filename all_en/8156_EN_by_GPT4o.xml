      <p>Greetings. The letters that I wrote to you during the past Christmas days, dear son, I believe you have already received. I entrusted them to your father, my most closely connected and beloved relative, to be delivered.</p>
      <p>Now, I have nothing to add to those letters, except to encourage you to continue diligently in your studies and to pray earnestly to the Lord, that He may grant you the intellect, abilities, and will to advance in letters and virtues, especially since your parent is now considering transferring you to Heidelberg and is faithfully seeking every opportunity to assist you and your studies.</p>
      <p>All our affairs here are, by the grace of God, in a fairly good state. I pray to the Lord that He may allow this happiness to be long-lasting. You, my son, dedicate and commend yourself entirely to God; may He bless you and keep you safe.</p>
      <p>All of mine wish you well and safe. Farewell. ZÃ¼rich, the last day of January 1570. Greet the good men.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>You will greet my dear Albert von Stetten most kindly in my name; convey all my services to him. If I can gratify him in any way, I will most willingly devote myself entirely to him.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Rudolf Gwalther the Younger, who is engaged in good letters in Lausanne.</p>
      <p>Lausanne.</p>
