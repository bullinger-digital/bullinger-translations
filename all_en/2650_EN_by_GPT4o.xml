      <p>I came to Tübingen today, intending to return to Stuttgart immediately. However, since I encountered a messenger heading to Lindau, I wanted to see if this letter could be quickly delivered to you.</p>
      <p>Things have gone well in Poland; it has been decided that communion will be under both kinds, that ministers may be married, that everything in the churches will be in the vernacular language, and that the pure gospel will be preached. Announce this to the brothers, so that they may give thanks to God for this beginning. Things have also gone well in Augsburg: our adversaries grant us peace, as you will know later. I saw what your most honorable council decided regarding the cause of my brothers from Locarno, everything is correct; but regarding the minister, I expected something else, not that I disapprove of our Beccaria - for he is a good man -; but I wish for another pastor for this new church, about which I will speak more later. I am consoled by what is at the end of the decree, that is: the council wishes to take another course of action if Beccaria does not seem suitable. I have involved myself with this church. I will be compelled to be concerned for it daily.</p>
      <p>Greet everyone; pray for me.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, June 12, 1555.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my gracious lord and good friend, to be delivered.</p>
