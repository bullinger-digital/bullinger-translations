      <p>Greetings. I have nothing, most distinguished man, to respond to your letter full of grace at present, except to let you know that it was pleasing to me that you received mine so lovingly, due to your unique kindness, without any merit on my part. I embrace your spirit towards me in such a way that I wish some opportunity would be offered to me, so that you may feel that Borrhaus is not ungrateful. However, when I advised you to beware of deceitful friends for yourself and yours, I did not do this because I suspected that you, as if you were short-sighted, were not acting wisely, but so that you would know that honest people, who are easy to believe, are more often deceived by cunning ones than dishonest ones, just as the children of this age are wiser than the children of light in the sharpness of light, which proclaims of itself: "I am the light of the world" [John 8:12]. Among us was a man, Lucarini, a preacher distinguished in faith and doctrine, whom you should continue to hold in the commendation he deserves, with the benevolence you have begun. I have acted on behalf of him and his, indeed for Christ and our common cause, which I am not accustomed to do.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the brothers, and let us pray to the Lord in this anathema, that the kingdom of Christ, against which the world and the prince of the world, Satan, so greatly move arms, may be expanded, as the prophecy of the prophet begins to strike the earth.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop of the ZÃ¼rich church.</p>
