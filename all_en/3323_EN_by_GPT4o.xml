      <p>Jesus Christus with us, God! Greetings in Christ Jesus!</p>
      <p>I recently received two letters from your lordship, and your book for the English church here, which is indeed useful and very welcome. We clearly see your true paternal affection towards us in these, and we frankly acknowledge that we cannot repay you with worthy thanks, to whom we promise to do as much as we ever can. And since it is a father's joy to see his children eagerly and happily striving towards piety and happiness, imbued with his teachings and benefits, we will certainly diligently strive so that we may derive that benefit from your writings to us, and you may derive that joy from our benefit. And to speak with you separately and familiarly about myself, I want you to believe that your admonition about not contending over indifferent matters was most welcome to me. For I had already decided so myself, and now confirmed by your authority, I will persevere much more steadfastly and eagerly in diligently avoiding offenses and useless disputes, so that all things may be more easily and better accommodated to the peace, concord, and edification of the church. For when I sent my friend Mr. Richard Burcher to Bern, to consult Mr. Johannes Haller about the rites to be used here in our church, I indicated the reasons that led me to wish for leavened bread in the administration of the Lord's Supper: but in the meantime, I neither wanted to ask anything from the magistrate nor to do all that was permissible for me, but only those things which seemed both permissible and also expedient in his judgment. And indeed, he wrote back to me the very thing that I received from you in your letters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will gladly follow your advice not only in this matter but also in those things, whatever you, in your piety and prudence, have advised or counseled to be done or avoided: and I beg you to write to me as soon as you have the time, what you think should be done. If a man wishes to take the sister of his deceased wife as his wife, or if he has already married the sister of his deceased wife, should he retain or dismiss her? I also ask that you read this booklet on the ecclesiastical administration of the English in Geneva, so that I may understand your judgment about it frankly. You see how boldly, relying on your clemency and kindness, I address your lordship, whom I know to be always occupied with the most serious and numerous matters. Therefore, you may defer these things which I now ask until a suitable occasion arises during your leisure. All the English who are here greet your lordship heartily in Christ, and we all acknowledge the greatest thanks due to you for your letters and the book to them. Please convey my greetings to the ministers of your church and all your family, for whom I will never forget to pray to God, and especially for you, that you may live long and be well to illuminate the glory of Christ in the confusion of the antichrist, to our consolation. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Aarau, 18 September.</p>
      <p>Yours, most devoted to you in Christ, Thomas Lever.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a man distinguished in learning and piety, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, my most revered lord and father in Christ. In Zürich.</p>
