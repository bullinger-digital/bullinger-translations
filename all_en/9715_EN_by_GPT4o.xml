      <p>Greetings. I send through a student, most distinguished man and father in Christ, most revered, the letters of Mr. Grynaeus, as you wished, whose father was once well known to me in Basel, and indeed it is to be lamented and deplored in those who are not only proclaimed to have put off the old man and renewed in the spirit of their mind, but also wish to be the chief lights of the church, that less modesty is found in them than in the pagan philosophers. They do not see whom they harass and agitate with their ambition beyond all merit; but I greatly fear that they will indeed feel it to their great harm one day, but will not so easily avert the just penalties of their intemperance, not to say petulance. "He who is with me," says our common Lord and Master Christ, "is not against me." They howl the contrary song: "Those who are with us are against us," turning the best matter into the worst and shamefully abusing that form of discipline, which ought to serve for edification, to the destruction and demolition of the temple of God. May the Lord open the eyes of pious and learned men and especially of the most pious prince, so that they may think and cleanse themselves of the wild olives that are about to choke the better olives, and if they achieve nothing by this very thing, may they plainly cut them off. What you write about the brothers in Wittenberg was partly pleasing and partly displeasing; for I grieve over the fall of the best men; meanwhile, I hope that the Lord will more and more bring forth the truth into the light by this very way. It will be ours to pour out our prayers to the Lord with unceasing groans for them, that He may cleanse the church from all scandals and be present with His own with His presence and His Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>However, I hope that we will soon receive more certain news from your friend in Nuremberg. Marcus Lombardus was exactly the same with us as he was with you, that is, shameless, vain, a wanderer, and in sum a Jew; he left for Lindau to his wife's sister, as he himself said; called by no one, as if called, he demanded travel money in place of a reward and did not consider himself satisfied even with an honorable gift.</p>
      <p>The infamy of his wife has been made known to all. He promised to share his knowledge of many languages with the Germans, who did not even know German correctly.</p>
      <p>The French envoy announced to us the death of his Herod in letters, which I have not yet read. This kingdom mourns that dissipation; they say all royal power is now in the hands of the queen, the mother of the deceased king, so that this Jezebel may also excellently fulfill her measure. These things I write hastily through a known boy, whom I commend to your kindness.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ. All friends respectfully send their greetings. June 21, in the year of Christ 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted to your kindness, Johann Konrad Ulmer. To the most distinguished man and excellent servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful overseer of the church in Zurich, his lord and most revered father in Christ.</p>
