    <p xml:id="regest1">Luther has died. A document printed at an unknown location with verses about Luther's [illness] and death was brought to [St. Gallen]. Vadian wished that this gifted interpreter of the [Holy] Scripture had remained with the churches longer, but regrets that he stubbornly clung to his crude conception of the Lord's Supper. The latter has led to many being relieved by Luther's death and thinking that he can now continue to argue with ghosts. However, Vadian knows with the wise [Marcus Porcius Cato] that no one lives without fault.</p>

      <p>Martin Luther has finally succumbed to fate, and a document with verses, printed at an unknown location, has been brought here, containing both the history of his illness and his death. I wish that a mind endowed with so many gifts and blessed with such great riches for interpreting the Scriptures had been left longer to the churches of Christ. I regret that he was so stubborn and obstinate in defending his crude view of the Eucharist, that there are now quite a few who would prefer him to be among the shadows, that is, the dead, rather than the living, and who now say that he wrestles with phantoms. But I think the saying of the wise man Marcus Porcius Cato is well known: "No one lives without fault."</p>
