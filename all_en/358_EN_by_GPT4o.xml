      <p>S. P. D. I wrote to you a few days ago, most esteemed father, about my plan to travel to Orl√©ans or Aquitaine; but partly due to the high cost of provisions, and partly due to the terrible uprisings of rebellious people that have erupted everywhere in Aquitaine, I have been forced to remain in Paris. In the meantime, I have attended and learned from the lectures on Galen's osteology, which Peter Sylvius, the royal professor of medicine, has interpreted, as it seemed to contribute to my studies. I have added to this the books on the parts of animals by Aristotle, to prepare myself and pave the way for the noble books of Galen on the use of parts, which Sylvius has recently begun to interpret. These must be diligently studied, if for no other reason, at least because they can be considered akin to theological readings.</p>
      <p>The rest of my time is entirely consumed by Greek literature, which I understand will not be useless to me if I wish to resume and continue the sacred studies of theology that I once began in Strasbourg. I am not living with great expenses now, as I have found suitable companions. But this is about my studies and way of life. I suppose you expect much news from France; however, nothing worthy of you has occurred. The state of the church is the same as it always has been, except that the confessors of the true religion have lived in great tranquility for some time, which we attribute to God, the author of peace, rather than to the tyrannical priests. The Aquitanian uprisings have been settled by the king's skill. We have heard that the most severe punishment has been inflicted on the authors of the sedition in Bordeaux. Besides this, I have nothing; as soon as something arises that seems relevant to your thoughts, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deign to keep you safe for a long time for the edification of our church. Do not hesitate to convey my many greetings to my parents, your wife, your children, and the whole family in my name.</p>
      <p>From our study in Paris, on the day before the Nones of December 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Ludwig Lavater of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and vigilant pastor of the city of Zurich, his most esteemed father. To Mr. Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
