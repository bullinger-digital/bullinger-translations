      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ, our redeemer.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I have long been held back by a great desire to write to your piety, most illustrious man, and truly also by a great necessity (as will soon become clear) to write.</p>
      <p>But first, the great distance of places was the reason why I did not comply with this desire and necessity.</p>
      <p>For it happened that I was in a part of the world where no couriers from there are seen, but very frequently Scythians, Muscovites, and other barbarians.</p>
      <p>But finally, a conversation a few days ago removed this obstacle, which I had with the most courteous man, Lord Hieronymus Macovius, the prefect of the very city (which I inhabit).</p>
      <p>For from him, I learned that he was chosen by our illustrious prince as the leader of his son's journey to Switzerland.</p>
      <p>But indeed, there still remained another greater obstacle to writing, namely the consciousness of my own insignificance.</p>
      <p>For this alone easily discouraged my spirit, until finally, forgetting my own insignificance, I began to consider your candor, affability, and supreme humanity (all of which shine abundantly in all your writings and are proclaimed with full voice by those who know you personally).</p>
      <p>For these easily persuaded me to promise myself that you would take everything in good part and forgive me if anything was said inappropriately.</p>
      <p>I also trust that you will not expect either rhetorical skill or solid erudition from a man of that region, where no Muses have ever dwelt due to the cold climate.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it greatly cheers and encourages me to see that your humanity even deliberately neglects the splendor of words in your writings, using simple diction and being content with it.</p>
      <p>Finally, it also greatly kindles hope in me that you are accustomed to treat even the most manifest enemies of the gospel with such humanity, even when many opportunities for reproach are offered.</p>
      <p>But let it suffice to preface these few things; now also receive with calm ears the necessity I mentioned at the beginning, in a few words (for indeed more time is not given to pursue it more verbosely).</p>
      <p>A few years ago, when the light of the divine word could no longer be contained within the borders of Germany, Switzerland, England, and France, by the great benefit of God, it also shone upon these uncultivated regions and especially illuminated our most illustrious prince, Nicholas Radziwiłł, Duke of Olyka and Nesvizh, etc. (whose name your piety has also celebrated in your writings).</p>
      <p>This prince, among other excellent examples worthy of a Christian prince, produced not the least of them.</p>
      <p>For he did not want to be content that he himself, with his court, had embraced the doctrine of Christ, unless he saw all the people of his vast dominions illuminated by the same light.</p>
      <p>Therefore, without delay, he sought out pious ministers of the gospel from everywhere and assigned one to each city, among whom I am also numbered, although little suited to such a great office.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he ordered the temples of iconolaters to be either closed or purified and diligently ensured that other things befitting such a prince were carried out, which indeed pertain little to the present purpose.</p>
      <p>I will bring up what is more relevant to the matter.</p>
      <p>For in that way, different opinions, superstitions, and idolatries were assigned to us to be opposed in various places.</p>
      <p>For some were given the task of uprooting the superstitions of the pope, others of overthrowing the most ancient idolatries of the pagans (since even now many Lithuanians believe in many gods and sacrifice to them). Again, others had to contend with the opinions of the Greeks, namely us, to whom the churches in Russia are entrusted.</p>
      <p>And concerning those who oppose the pope or the obsolete cults of the pagans, there is no need for me to say anything here.</p>
      <p>For the frauds of the papists are very well known to you, and the remnants of paganism are more to be laughed at than refuted with arguments.</p>
      <p>But the opinions or rites of the Greeks cause us much trouble.</p>
      <p>For Russia is an admirer and most diligent imitator, or rather the most superstitious ape, of all Greek superstitions.</p>
      <p>But leaving aside for now other superstitions, which are largely akin to papistic ones and which the word of God easily strangles and dissipates, I will indicate only what troubles us here.</p>
      <p>That is indeed the old but not yet, as it should have been, resolved controversy between the Latins and Greeks, namely about the procession of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>For this, I say, causes great difficulty for all of us who minister in these regions.</p>
      <p>For our churches (or those entrusted to us) embrace and defend the opinion of the Greeks in all things, including this.</p>
      <p>But we, being born and educated in the opposite, at the very beginning of our preaching partly considered that controversy not so important as to be necessary to fight over, and partly defended their opinion.</p>
      <p>But after we were pressed more vehemently and had examined both opinions more closely, we were suddenly forced to adopt other plans.</p>
      <p>A year ago, indeed, we consulted the pastors and elders of the Vilnius church in person, and later our dearest brother and fellow minister Laurentius Criscovius, pastor of the Nesvizh church, also consulted some ministers of Lesser Poland by letters sent to him.</p>
      <p>And indeed, the Vilnius people, having seen the arguments of the Russians and having maturely deliberated and thoroughly and exactly understood the opinion of the Greeks, do not at all object to it.</p>
      <p>But the Poles have not yet responded with anything certain, and it is no wonder, since they have all hitherto considered that question unnecessary.</p>
      <p>Which indeed has happened to the most learned men, as is manifest.</p>
      <p>For who among the moderns has examined that controversy more deeply? For all follow the Latins and think there is no danger in it.</p>
      <p>But I leave these things aside.</p>
      <p>We see, most illustrious man, that you have not left that controversy entirely untouched.</p>
      <p>We have in our hands your most sweet and pious sermons, which you published on the Apocalypse some years ago, not without great progress for the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>In which, although you approve and even explicitly defend the opinion commonly received by the Latins, your candor gave us hope that if the question had not yet been raised then, you would now (being asked, of course) pay attention to that old controversy.</p>
      <p>And for that reason, I send to your piety this writing of the Russians against the opinion of the Latins, translated hastily from our vernacular language (indeed meager, but not entirely to be despised), so that, with your candor, having examined the matter more closely, you may demonstrate in writing what we should follow.</p>
      <p>For although we have also decided to consult the churches closer to us on the same matter, I did not think that occasion should be neglected.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beg you, most illustrious man, in the name of all the ministers of Russia, to bring us present help in this matter and to indicate the other opinion, consistent with your doctrine and various gifts, in accordance with the word of God.</p>
      <p>I know indeed that your piety calls that question scrupulous, and indeed it is, I confess.</p>
      <p>But our Russians will not desist from its treatment for that reason.</p>
      <p>I also know with what arms the Latins fight against the Greeks, and although books reach us with difficulty, we have seen some defenses in that controversy for the Latins, but all these are easily refuted by the Russians.</p>
      <p>We have seen the disputations of Thomas Aquinas, the standard-bearer of the papists, and also the subterfuges of their Apollo or Sphinx (as they are judged by them), Peter Lombard, I say.</p>
      <p>But we have also read the sophistries of George of Trebizond, written in favor of the pope.</p>
      <p>All these are of little, not to say the least, importance.</p>
      <p>But your argument borrowed from Aquinas seemed to me once more than adamantine.</p>
      <p>But how easily it is torn apart by adversaries, let your piety see.</p>
      <p>For thus your piety's argument sounds.</p>
      <p>If the substance and nature of the Father and the Son are one, I do not see how the Spirit can proceed from the Father without also proceeding from the Son.</p>
      <p>But they say, if this argument is valid, it would follow that the Son is not only the Son of the Father but also of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>For it is clear that the Son not only shares the substance and nature with the Father but also with the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>If therefore the Holy Spirit also proceeds from the Son because the Son is of one substance and nature with the Father, it would certainly necessarily follow that the Son was not only born from the Father before the ages but also at the same time from the Holy Spirit, since the Holy Spirit is also of the same substance and nature with the Father, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beseech you again and again, most illustrious man, that having duly considered all these things, you may not fail to assist us.</p>
      <p>But I am persuaded of your candor, that even if perhaps there is some trouble in it, if the edition is corrected, you will not allow private authority to prevail more than common utility and indeed the truth itself with you.</p>
      <p>At the end, I pray that you do not suspect anything sinister about me nor think that these things are written by me with any other mind than that I wish to be taught.</p>
      <p>Moreover, take my loquacity in good part.</p>
      <p>I confess that they are written not in any order but confusedly, but as I have already said, your humanity has made me forget all these things.</p>
      <p>I pray to God, the best and greatest, that He may keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Kleck, in haste and so quickly that I did not even have the opportunity to transcribe, on the 18th day of April in the year of restored salvation 1563.</p>
      <p>Simon Budnaeus, pastor of Kleck... to the most learned man Heinrich Bullinger... most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, lord... father to be honored in all ways.</p>
