    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian apologizes for having kept Bullinger's writing "Contra scandala ex bello infeliciter gesto oborta Apologia" for so long. It was read to the pastors and then lent to some of them and also to friends, who read it with delight and benefit. Among scholars, it is rare for these significant topics to be made accessible in a popular manner. The writing should be read by many!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Herewith, Vadian sends a [Latin] "Mandatorum epitome" [summary] of the English Reformation decree. It might be of interest to Bullinger, even though some things seem to have been omitted [in the translation], such as the question of whether [the English King Edward VI] decided to retain the rites customary in England [from the time of Henry VIII] or not. Perhaps the English believe that nothing should be decided or changed in this regard without first consulting the other churches. But it could also be that the editor of the "Epitome" omitted some things [from the English version of the decree]. It is certain that Erasmus of Rotterdam seems to be highly valued. If Bullinger has already received the "Epitome" from elsewhere, he should return it; otherwise, he may keep it longer, but he should return it eventually.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] From Augsburg, it is learned that nothing has yet been decided at the Imperial Diet. The electors take offense that Johann Friedrich of Saxony is still being held captive. They also do not allow Emperor Charles V to degrade anyone from their rank without their consent, especially since they elected him and not he them. It is also said that the Spaniards' plan to re-establish the [Swabian] League is causing so much resentment and distrust that it will hardly come to fruition. The Emperor would like to subjugate all of Germany. But there are people who resist this and from whose steadfastness many expect good things.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger will probably have heard of the defeat and disgraceful flight of the Scots in the battle against the English troops. The Augsburgers write that 15,000 Scots have fallen. The six[thousand] remaining mourn the fallen and further confirm that 2,000 men were taken prisoner. Pope Paul III is said to be responsible for this disaster. He is said to have caused this bloodbath through his Cardinal Reginald Pole by promising them a certain victory beforehand. The Swiss experienced something similar with Bishop Matthäus Schiner of Sitten when they were slaughtered by the French at Milan. Thus, papal priests generally abuse the reverence shown to them! Their brotherly love consists in destroying any peace among the princes by all possible means!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Allegedly, Captain Hans Schnabel von Schönstein from Bregenz was appointed colonel over 6,000 men (intended for Piedmont) and Gian Giacomo de' Medici, Castellan of Musso, was appointed commander over several thousand cavalry. Both are said to have already crossed the Alps.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] One will probably still have to experience how the Emperor will attack the Swiss if they do not return the territories and cities to Duke Charles III of Savoy. This dispute will soon plunge the entire Swiss Confederation into a war. Therefore, it is important not to fall due to internal discord! For this is precisely what the enemies intend, in order to then take possession of the whole country. But enough of that.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings. In haste.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Forgive me, I pray, for having kept the Apology recited in the college for so long. I first lent it to our ministers, then to some friends, who read it with great pleasure and no less benefit. The topics discussed are indeed noteworthy and rarely encountered by the learned in a popular manner. Therefore, the booklet is worthy of being read by many.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In return, I send you the Epitome of the English Reformation, which indeed contains many things you will gladly learn about, although I see some things have been omitted, such as whether anything has been decided or if England follows the current rites. I would have gladly understood this. Perhaps they consider these matters to be such that nothing should be decided or changed without consulting other churches. But it could also be that the one who compiled the Epitome omitted some things in passing. I see that Erasmus is highly approved by them. If you have received it from elsewhere, I beg you to return it. If not, use it as you wish, but ensure that a copy is returned at some point.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>From Augsburg, we have heard that nothing has yet been concluded at the Diet, and the remaining electors are displeased with the dishonor accepted by the Saxon. It is not permissible for the Emperor to remove anyone from their rank or place without the exact knowledge of the electors, since the Emperor is elected by the electors, and the electors themselves are not appointed by the Emperor, etc. It is also said that the alliance attempted by the Spaniards seems so suspect and deceitful to everyone that its success is almost despaired of. The Emperor would like nothing more than for all of Germany to submit to his desires as captives. However, there are those who refuse, and many wish them well for their steadfastness.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You may have heard of the great defeat of the Scots, oppressed and disgracefully routed by the English army. The people of Augsburg write that 15,000 Scots are missing. The remaining six thousand remember those who fell. They confirm that two thousand were captured. The Pope is said to be the source of all this evil, having achieved through his Cardinal Pole that they perished disgracefully; he had promised them certain victory. A similar disaster was once caused for us by the Bishop of Sitten, who led our people to be slaughtered by French arms near Milan. Thus, the Roman pontiffs are accustomed to enjoying their piety, and this is their brotherly love: to disturb all peace among princes by whatever means they can!</p>

      <p>Captain Schnabel von Bregenz is said to have been appointed commander over 6,000 men in Piedmont, and the Margrave of Musso commander over several thousand cavalry. Both are said to have already crossed the mountains.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You will see our people being sought by the Emperor unless they return their lands and cities to the Duke of Savoy, which will soon entangle the whole of Switzerland in war. Therefore, every effort must be made to prevent our people from falling into internal discord. For this is the main plan of hostile minds, that by dividing us by any means, they might gain possession of all of Switzerland. But enough of that.</p>

      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, quickly, 6th day before the Kalends of November, 1547.</p>
      <p>Vadianus.</p>
      <p>[To the most honorable] Heinrich Bullinger, [his very good] man. Zurich.</p>
