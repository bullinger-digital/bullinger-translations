      <p>Greetings. I believe that you have already received what I sent there. Shortly after, that is, three days ago, I received your last letter along with the common letters of your entire assembly, which could not have been more pleasing to all of us, as you will learn from our common response. Therefore, I defer everything to our meeting, which I would otherwise have written, whether you yourself come, which indeed I would very much like for many reasons, if it can be done without inconvenience to you, or others are sent from your colleagues, with whom I hope, with God's favor, that we may take a convenient and useful counsel at such a necessary time. Farewell, my father. May the Lord Jesus keep you and bless you more and more.</p>
      <p>Geneva, January 8, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours, Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed father and the truly faithful pastor of the Zürich church. Zürich.</p>
