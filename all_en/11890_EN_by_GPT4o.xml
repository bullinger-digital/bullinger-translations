      <p>Greetings. Alas, our Gemus채us fell into a severe fever after his return from Italy and Savoy and was not in his right mind for several days, and on January 19, he breathed his last, not without the lament of many. Thus the Lord deals with our school, taking away the best among us. The proud and arrogant men now reign. Cellarius sought the theological lecture, as did our Myconius; but Myconius achieved what he wanted with the deputies.</p>
      <p>What more shall I add? But I do not wish to stir up trouble. In Strasbourg, Paulus Lacisius, an Italian professor of Greek, is gravely ill, so much so that the doctors have despaired of his recovery.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is on his way to Speyer. Some believe there will be no Diet, as everything is proceeding so coldly. The Spanish and Italian merchants, who are stuck with us, are giving money to reach Milan. I hear from some that the Emperor is recruiting a new army. There is a multitude of captains with us who have so far defended the French territories; what they intend, whether they are gathering soldiers, which seems likely, I do not know. I wanted to inform you of these few things, so that I might write something to you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I do not want to keep this from you: Hedio hopes to soon become a preacher in Mainz, as he has conceived such hope from the Archbishop of Mainz. Would that he might end his life in the Lord, which is very aged! The bishops of Cologne and M체nster continue vigorously in proclaiming the Gospel even in the presence of the Emperor. May the Lord strengthen them with His spirit.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, and if you have leisure, respond most fully to the next letters. You will greet D. Theodor in my name most dutifully. If you wish to share this with Vadianus, you will impart many greetings to him.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 1, 1544.</p>
      <p>I would like you to ensure that the enclosed letters are delivered to the person whose address they bear; for they were sent to me from Strasbourg and I was instructed to send them to Zurich.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, etc. Zurich.</p>
