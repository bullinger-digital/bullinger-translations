      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ.</p>
      <p>I greatly praise your diligence in the writings of the ancients, dearest brother (I wish to be called thus, for I do not acknowledge that you call me your teacher), for they are indeed strong weapons against the papists, namely those on which they themselves rely as pillars. But I do not see what could be strong enough against those senseless and utterly stubborn ones, who have so stripped themselves of all sense of humanity, so completely hardened against all truth, that you could call them not beasts and wild animals, but rather logs. Some things are softened by iron, some by blood, as they say of the diamond, neither are they led by benefits nor held by punishments.</p>
      <p>Now, since I see you are entirely focused on this, that the glory of Christ may be spread as widely as possible, I ask you, if you have gathered anything from the reading of Erasmus of Rotterdam or Doctor Luther and committed it to memory (in which you excel greatly), concerning the Eucharist, to send it to me as quickly as possible. For I have presented their opinion on the Eucharist in this little book, which I send to you, to the Christians, so that all may see what both of them once thought about this matter, and if they wish to be wise, they may join us. For I wish to treat what I have briefly compiled here and offered as a taste more diligently and extensively, and that in Latin, so that in this way even the hypocrites may finally have their masks removed or at least their weakness healed.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Your Leo Jud.</p>
      <p>What I have written to you, I might as well have said to a stone.</p>
      <p>To his brother Heinrich.</p>
