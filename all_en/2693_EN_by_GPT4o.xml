      <p>S. P. D. That your honor has not ceased to send letters to me, an unknown person, in such remote regions, I give the greatest thanks I can, especially since I see that you are led to such an opinion of me, namely, that I pursue with singular love and benevolence the men of this order, who are devoted to piety and sincere worshipers of God. Therefore, for the declaration of your kind and benevolent mind towards me, I love you greatly at the beginning of our friendship, which I desire to be made so firm and strong that it may grow and increase more and more between us every day, and I wish that an opportunity may be given to me, by which I may be able to repay this desire to deserve well of your honor by my work and industry according to your wish.</p>
      <p>The gift, namely the booklet sent to me by you, I receive and honor with a grateful mind and cheerful countenance, both because it sincerely treats the doctrines of the Christian religion, and also because it contains a token and testimony of your mind and will towards me. Therefore, I commend myself to you, excellent and most humane man, and I promise and assure all efforts and services by which I can gratify your honor. Given in Melschtin on the 20th of August in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your honor's friend from the heart. Spithek Jordan of Zaliczin and in Melschtin, Palatine heir of Sandomierz, Przemyśl, and Kamionka captain.</p>
      <p>The same who signed above. To the man of exceptional piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church and a most esteemed friend.</p>
