      <p>Greetings. Unless the Lord, who has thus far advanced the cause of His gospel among resistant men, partly sleeping and partly through the most powerful kingdoms, now extends His strong hand in France, I do not know what that unfortunate synod of bishops and doctors will achieve.</p>
      <p>We cannot doubt what they are going to pronounce.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to assist His cause and the wretched oppressed by the tyranny of the Pope.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a petition paper, I believe, and a booklet of confession; you can later inform me of the summary of the matters.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rombold would do me a favor if he would note down the main points of the matters in the confession on a paper for me.</p>
      <p>As I look more closely at that matrimonial case, it seems that the husband of the deceased sister and the wife of the son of another sister are in the second degree of affinity and for that reason cannot be joined according to our laws, which prohibit the second degree of affinity.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the first degree of affinity is between two sisters; the husbands of those sisters are related by marriage.</p>
      <p>The second degree is the marriage of the sons and daughters of those sisters; the wife of the son is said to be the same flesh with the son, the husband; therefore, she seems to be in the second degree of affinity with the husband of the other sister, considering.</p>
      <p>Gregory in the 35th question of the 5th book says: "Moreover, concerning the affinity, which you say is kinship, which pertains to the husband from the wife's side or to the wife from the husband's side, the reason is most clear, because, if according to the divine sentence my wife and I are one flesh, indeed, my kinship and hers become one closeness for me and her.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I and my wife's sister will be in one and the first degree, but her son will be in the second degree from me, and her granddaughter in the third, and this must be done in the same way in other successions.</p>
      <p>As for the wife of a relative, whatever degree she may be, I must regard her as if she were a woman of my own kinship, which indeed must be observed for the wife concerning the kinship of her husband in all degrees of relationship.</p>
      <p>Those who think otherwise are of the Antichrist, from whom we must guard ourselves all the more strongly, as you have clearly discovered them to oppose the divine laws" etc.</p>
      <p>Thus it is there.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it would seem advisable if it were suggested to that man, who desires to be joined with his relative, to abstain, especially since in such close kinship many can speak ill of him and also curse the judges, who otherwise admit those joined in the second degree of affinity to marriage.</p>
      <p>I have nothing better now; if better things have come to you, you may enjoy them; however, it seems that caution should be exercised.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell eternally.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger</p>
