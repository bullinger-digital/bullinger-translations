    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger's letter [No. 2780] arrived together with the two letters [from January 30, 1547] that the Zurich council addressed to the Zurich pastors working in Augsburg [Haller, Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] and to the Augsburg authorities. The Augsburg council was asked to send the pastors home if it could not guarantee their protection. However, if it can, it should later decide on their stay or dismissal itself. Since Haller and Ruman were not explicitly called home, they will probably not be sent back now, especially since the Augsburg council made them great promises. And even if they wanted to return now, the council would have issued them such a flattering letter of recommendation that it would arouse envy in Zurich. Consequently, Haller and Ruman want to wait for a better opportunity to leave, but never without Georg Frölich's consent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The council, on the other hand, will send away the impudent Meyer and Schwyzer even if they wanted to stay. They will soon be dismissed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The council will only let Haller and Ruman go if they were exposed to immediate danger or if the Zurich council explicitly called them back. The letter from the Zurich council was only useful in that the Augsburgers could see that the Zurichers were concerned about their pastors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The proud and quarrelsome Schwyzer has strongly opposed Haller. Bullinger should protect him against Schwyzer's slanders. Meyer, on the other hand, is more moderate, as he is more learned. Haller expressed to the mayors [Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot] the fear that Meyer and Schwyzer could slander him and Ruman in Zurich. However, the mayors promised to complain to the Zurichers about Meyer and Schwyzer in such a way that they would regret their slanders if necessary.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger should remain vigilant, as Haller and Ruman are still exposed to considerable dangers. A riot is feared in Augsburg. Although the Augsburg council promised [its protection], it is questionable whether it can actually grant it if necessary. Haller is ready to suffer for Christ, but not for reasons that serve neither Christ nor the church nor his own salvation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The wife [...] of Claude d'Aliod, about whom Haller has already reported, is said to have lived in Zurich for a long time according to the Zurich messenger [Hans Zingg]. D'Aliod has infected not a few in Augsburg with the teachings of Arius. He and his followers eventually had to renounce their error before the council. Afterwards, he was expelled from the city, leaving behind a written retraction.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Landgrave Philipp of Hesse is allegedly dedicating himself to hunting. He is said to have known about the evil endeavors of his son-in-law Moritz of Saxony, which Haller, however, doubts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Apart from the soldiers passing through Augsburg, the imperial troops have not yet arrived there. May Emperor Charles V be so occupied that it never comes to that! Frölich will provide more detailed information about it. Haller reveres him like no one else.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings from Wolfgang Musculus, Michael Keller, and Sixt Birck. Today a letter from Francesco Stancaro arrived from Basel. Sebastian Schertlin will already be in Zurich or have been there. At his request, Haller issued him a letter of recommendation for Mayor Hans Rudolf Lavater. Schertlin is a significant personality and deserves the respect of all.</p>

      <p>S. P. We have received your letters along with those from the most honorable council of Zurich, sent to us and the Augsburg council. They write that if they cannot guarantee us free protection, they should send us back; but if they can, they have left it to their discretion to either keep us or dismiss us. Romanus and I, since we have not been openly recalled, and they have promised us splendid things, have not seen a decent reason to leave. For if we were to depart, I do not doubt that the Augsburgers would write magnificently to the Zurichers (about what they promised us); hence, great envy would be stirred against us in Zurich. Therefore, we have decided to wait for a better opportunity, which we wish to use if it presents itself, consulting no one except Mr. Laetus.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Laurentius and Rodolphus hold onto their old ways and speak so importunately that I do not doubt that even if they wanted to stay, they would be sent back. They will be dismissed shortly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>They absolutely do not want to dismiss Romanus and me unless imminent dangers press or an open recall is made by the Zurichers. Therefore, nothing has been resolved for us by this counsel of the lords, except that the Augsburgers see that the Zurichers care for us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Svitzerus, a proud and stubborn man, has strongly opposed me. I ask you to defend me from his slanders; Laurentius, being more learned, is also more modest. I have complained to the consuls that great envy and slander will arise against us in Zurich if we remain. They replied that I should diligently investigate, and if I sense them speaking maliciously against us anywhere, they will pursue them with such a rebuke that they will wish they had been more modest. Therefore, you should defend us, for we will have the entire council to defend us otherwise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In the meantime, since the dangers are not minor, betrayals and internal seditions are to be feared, I still ask you to consult in another way. They promise; but when it will be most necessary for them to fulfill, they will not be able to. However, I will not refuse to undergo any danger that may lead to the glory of Christ. But every Christian should flee those things that are neither glorious to Christ, nor useful to the church, nor salutary to us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I wrote some time ago about that Claude d'Aliod. The Zurich notary told me that his wife had been staying in Zurich for a long time. He sowed Arian heresy and infected not a few (who were also imprisoned with him). Eventually, he was recalled with his accomplices before the council. He was dismissed, leaving behind a written retraction.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>They say that Landgrave Philipp is dedicating himself to hunting, and many suspect that he was aware of all the tragedy that his son-in-law Moritz initiated. However, I do not believe it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>We still have no imperial soldiers in the city, except those who pass through while traveling. We hope the emperor will be so occupied that he will not burden us. Oh, if only! But about these matters, Mr. Laetus will speak more truly and abundantly, whom I alone hold in high regard.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell. Greet the brothers and the family. Musculus, Cellarius, and Xystus greet you. Today we received letters from Stanggaro, who has reached Basel. I believe Schertlium is now with you or has been. For he demanded from me letters of recommendation to Consul Lafaterum. He is truly a great man and worthy to be loved by all good people. Farewell again. February 9, 1547. I. Haller, forever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and venerable father. In Zurich.</p>
