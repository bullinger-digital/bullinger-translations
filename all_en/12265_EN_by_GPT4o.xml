    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger rightly suspected [in a letter that has not been preserved] that Bartholomäus' prolonged silence was due to his many tasks. From Easter until mid-July, he was not in Neuburg [an der Donau]. Hardly had he returned when he received a letter from [Josua], the son of Bullinger's brother [Johannes Reinhart], from which he joyfully learned that the Confederates had not responded to the thrice-crowned beast [Pope Paul III]. Just as God reveals the good reputation of the pious to all, so, according to [Paul], he also reveals the folly of the impious to all. - Now, in short, the explanation requested by Bullinger of Bartholomäus' view on the Eucharist. There is disagreement about the manner in which Christ is present in the Lord's Supper, whereas no one disputes his presence. - The Papists believe in a transformation of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. Bartholomäus cannot agree with this dogma, especially since Bullinger and Vadian have shown that it originates from monks. - However, many pious and learned people, including [Wolfgang] Musculus (in his commentary on Matthew) and [Johannes] Brenz (in his work on the Gospel of John), rightly believe that the signs of the Lord's Supper are not empty signs when the word is added to the bread and wine. The sacrament consists of a connection that attaches the words of the Lord's Supper (the "terminus") to the [elements] of the bread and wine (the "fundamentum"). As long as this connection lasts, the sacrament exists. But if the connection is interrupted, God is no longer connected with the [elements]. This is the case, for example, when not all [words of institution] are spoken over the [elements], other words are used, or even other actions are performed. - This is particularly evident in the example of baptism. Only when the baptismal words are added to the water does the sacrament of regeneration arise. If one were to venerate the water without the addition of the baptismal words, as if the Spirit [or] God were present there, it would be ineffective. - Just as the Spirit is conferred with the water in baptism when the baptismal words ordained by the Lord are spoken, so the Eucharist conveys Christ and his merits when the words of institution are connected with the elements. But how? Here it becomes difficult. It would be cruel to assume, as Jesus' listeners did [John 6:60], that one would grind him with teeth! That would no longer be a sacrament. Likewise, Bartholomäus is careful not to declare the signs empty with the Anabaptists! Christ is present at the Lord's Supper, but not according to any conception, rather as in a sacrament. Bullinger will likely agree with Bartholomäus on this. If not, may he tolerate the insignificant Bartholomäus. - [Josua] does not live in Neuburg, but in Rain [am Lech], in the territory of Duke Wilhelm [IV] of Bavaria. When Bartholomäus dined with [Josua] on [July 19], he invited him to the Neuburg Mass [on July 25]. However, he did not appear but promised a visit. - The beast driven by the false prophet calls the mighty of this world to Armageddon. May it fall victim to itself, as once happened to Ahithophel! - Greetings to the colleagues, especially to Bibliander.</p>

      <p>Many greetings. You rightly attribute my prolonged silence, most learned man, to my numerous and very serious occupations, which have kept me busy here and there throughout the entire summer. For from the feast of Easter until mid-July, I was not in Neuburg serving my office there. But as soon as I returned home after completing all my labors, behold, a young tanner, the son of my brother, brought me your most welcome letters again, in which, among other things, I was greatly cheered by the wisdom and courage of the most serious men of Switzerland, who did not respond even a bit to the flattery of the thrice-crowned beast. Oh good God, "you are just and your judgment is right"! For just as the Lord God brings forth the fame and name of the pious as a light for all to admire, so the folly of the impious "will be evident to all," as the apostle says.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter of the Eucharist, I am too insignificant to judge either your writing or that of another most learned man. However, so that I do not seem to entirely deny what you ask, here, in a few words, is my opinion. All who have varied, indeed disagreed, about the matter of the Eucharist for several years now, agree on this: that Christ is not absent from the supper. But how he is present is a great controversy among all.</p>
      <p>The Papists assert that the symbols of bread and wine are transubstantiated, that is, that the bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of the Lord. I do not agree with them, especially since this dogma, imposed on the churches through the work of monks, has been so openly and strongly exposed and refuted by you and by Vadian.</p>
      <p>There are many other pious and learned men who think and believe differently about the Eucharist, namely that the word is added to the element only, not also changing the element, as Augustine testifies. Meanwhile, they do not teach that the symbols of the supper are empty. These seem to me not to stray entirely from the mark. Such is Musculus in his Matthew, such is Brentius in his John, etc. For sacraments are relations; a relation has two things in itself, namely a foundation and a terminus. Therefore, a relation is nothing other than the application of the foundation to the terminus. Now, when the terminus of the words of the supper is compared to the foundation, namely the bread and the cup, a sacrament is made. As long as the respect or relation lasts, God is effective in the sacraments instituted by him and bound to his institution to provide what the words signify. But when the relation is broken (as happens with the Papists, who carry around the bread of the Eucharist, enclose it, and do not apply all the words in their masses to the foundation of the bread and the cup, content to say only: "This is my body," omitting the preceding and following words "take and eat" along with "do this in remembrance of me," etc.), God is not bound to this, because it is beyond the institution. Let the Papists see, therefore, what they consecrate with their truncated words!</p>
      <p>The matter will be clearer with an example: In baptism, water alone is not a sacrament, nor are the words alone. But when the words of baptism are applied to the water as a terminus to its foundation, then the sacrament of regeneration is made. Now, during the act of relation, that is, while the words are recited and the external ceremony of pouring water is applied according to the Lord's command, God is effective and present in his institution, for in such a washing, with the word of God attached, the Holy Spirit is given to the child. But when the relation is broken, as if someone were to adore the water of baptism alone without the words, as if the Spirit were enclosed there, the Lord God is not effective. The Spirit is indeed given in the action of baptism, when the words and ceremony are applied together according to the Lord's command. But if someone were to draw water from the baptistery without the recitation of the words, they would not draw the Spirit enclosed in the water, but only the water. For there the relation has fallen.</p>
      <p>Just as in baptism the truth of the Spirit is given with the element of water when the words and external ceremony are joined together according to the Lord's command, so in the Eucharist, with the element of bread and the cup, with the word attached, which brings Christ with it, all his goods are applied to us. If Christ and his goods, how not also his body and blood? But how? Here I am stuck, and I hold the wolf by the ears. To say that it is real, so that it is ground with teeth, as those in John 6 thought, I shudder to say. For if it were so, it would not be a sacrament. Again, I fear to assert empty symbols with the Anabaptists. It remains, therefore, that Christ is present at the supper, but not according to anyone's wish, but as the nature of the sacrament requires. If I have followed your mind, let the judgment be with you; but if not, bear with my insignificance, when it is convenient. For I am a disciple, not a judge of others.</p>
      <p>The son of my brother is not in Neuburg, but in the town of Rain under the rule of Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria, a mile from Neuburg. He dined with me on the Sunday before James and was invited to our fair held on the day of James, but he did not appear. However, he promised to visit me sometime. Whatever I can do for his benefit, especially for your sake, I will not refuse to do.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us, except that the beast thrice crowned, at the urging of the frogs coming out of the mouth of the false prophet, is trying to gather the mighty of this world in Armageddon. I pray, therefore, that like Ahithophel, he himself falls into the pit he is trying to dig for others; which will certainly happen to him. For the Lord God scatters the nations who desire war!</p>
      <p>Farewell much. Hastily, in Neuburg on the Danube, in the year etc. 45, on the 19th of August. Please convey my greetings to all the brothers and συνεργοὺς (the coworkers) of the word in Zurich, especially to Theodor Bibliander and the others.</p>
      <p>L. Adam Bartholomäus, entirely yours from the heart, brother and colleague, minister of the word in Neuburg.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, the chief preacher of the word among the people of Zurich, my singularly esteemed lord and friend.</p>
