    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter. He is distressed about the unfavorable outcome of the mandate dispute for the Reformed. Rumors of further plans by the Five Places against them. Bucer is expected in Bern; only the more learned pastors are to be invited to the discussion. Haller hopes for the restoration of harmony in the Church of Bern from him. The question of the Lord's Supper is openly addressed. Haller wants to write about everything but wishes for a meeting with Bullinger. Again requests the sending of Bullinger's commentary notes on the Gospel of John. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your letter from Burckard, dearest Heinrich of all, in which I understood, through the abundance of articles of the composed dispute, which our messenger brought from Herem, what was done there. What else could I say? Such are our times, such are we humans, who proclaim the gospel with our mouths, but in truth and innocence of life, and in the confession of it before men, we accomplish little or nothing. You wouldn't believe how much I grieve both our faint-heartedness and their audacity, that the Lord delays so long either to give us courage or to forestall their recklessness. In Bern, the voice and rumor of all is that the Five Places are now about to raise some kind of question against us, to permanently take away the freedom of the word and to establish authority for themselves among all. We will pray to God that He may preside over us and open our eyes, so that we may look solely to His glory.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we are expecting Bucer. The more learned ministers from the region will be called together, but not a synod. There is still vigilance because of the arsonists, and it is not convenient for the ministers to be absent from the churches, or even from their homes, which the senate has decided. I hope, however, that whatever discord there is among us can be resolved through his diligence, which you, especially you, could very easily achieve, where one might bring you out of the next. If we three in the city are united, the brothers in the countryside will also be united, but if we are divided, factions and parties are immediately formed, through mutual contention, and ambition always seeks its own. In the matter of the Eucharist, we will not be different nor will we speak differently before our churches than truly and openly. For the wrappings of words and ambiguities will be less tolerated than the error itself.</p>
      <p>I will write to you about everything that will be done among us, which I also expect from you. I beg you to always keep me, however little, commended to you. If only I could speak to you even once. If gout and hernia did not press me so much, I would have called you to Lenzburg long ago. I will try sometime, despite the discomfort of the body, to see what I can do. I have nothing else to write.</p>
      <p>Your commentaries are wonderfully pleasing to the brothers. I, shameless, will not cease to demand until I see your John, yet nothing against your convenience.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest heart in the Lord. Your fellow Senecio Franciscus greets you.</p>
      <p>2nd of May.</p>
      <p>Your very small coin, B.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere pastor of the church in Zurich, his brother never not dearest.</p>
