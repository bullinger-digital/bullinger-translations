    <p xml:id="regest1">Renewed intercession for the Werdenberg pastor - of the same origin and age as Zwingli [Jakob Hewer?] - who wants his son to continue his studies in Zurich after attending school in Chur, in order to enable him to pursue a career as a pastor; the father's financial situation is not the best, as many rural parishes necessitate a modest lifestyle; the boy is known to Comander, as he lived with him for half a year; he is going to Margaretha, Zwingli's former maid; [Johannes] Pontisella also knows him; Comander would love to render a service to Bullinger as well. He is eager to learn the outcome of the Regensburg Diet; it is feared that the Emperor is closely cooperating with the Pope, as the Governor of Milan [Alfonso d'Avalos, Marquess of Vasto] is persecuting the Protestants more harshly than ever before. Greetings, also from Johannes Blasius and [Nikolaus Pfister, known as] Baling.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I had already sent a letter to you some time ago, most esteemed Bullinger; whether it was delivered or not, I am completely unaware. I had written about a certain young man, who for two years or more diligently applied himself to studies with us in Chur, well initiated in Latin and Greek, desiring henceforth to pursue good studies in Zurich. He is the son of a pastor in the county of Werdenberg, under the jurisdiction of Glarus, an honest and upright man who has greatly deserved well of the gospel, and who was a compatriot and contemporary of our Zwingli of blessed memory. He sincerely and piously desires to consecrate his son to the ministry of the gospel, but his financial situation is less than sufficient to do so comfortably. For we are pressed by poverty, most of us being sustained by small parishes in our lands, so that we must live sparingly and frugally. We therefore earnestly pray that, aided and commended by your grace and assistance, he may become a participant in some part at least of the distribution to the poor by the venerable lords. The boy is good and pious; I supported him at my table for half a year, from which he became known to me so well that I have no doubt that the benefit will be well placed in him. He is staying with Margaretha, formerly Zwingli's maid; Pontisella knows him. Forgive my importunity, and if I can ever do anything for your favor or benefit, I will do it most eagerly. Moreover, we are very much wondering about the outcome of the Regensburg Diet. We fear that the Emperor is devoted and joined to the Roman bishop as scales to Behemoth. We have this conjecture: the governor of the Duchy of Milan is miserably persecuting Christians more than ever before. He compels them to the most disgraceful recantation and condemns those who refuse to recant to servitude at sea, even men of noble birth and the best lineage. The Marquess has this cruelty from the Emperor; for he himself is not very hostile to the gospel. Farewell. From Chur in Rhaetia, on the fourteenth day before the Kalends of August. Johannes Blasius, Baling, and I, Comander, wish you and all the most beloved brothers well. Yours sincerely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>If you have any news about the Diet, share it with us, as you have begun.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and esteemed friend.</p>
