      <p>Greetings. If I am being troublesome to you, it will be your fairness to forgive me, as in this cause, for which I would willingly lay down my life, I could not refuse this duty to the brothers. Whether our Beza will come there with Budé, I am still uncertain.</p>
      <p>If Beza is permitted, you will hear from both the reason for their journey; if not, Budé's companion will be his relative Charles. I know that I do not need to ask you to assist them.</p>
      <p>Indeed, unless prompted by another, it would never have occurred to me to attempt this; but the pious brothers demand this service to be rendered to them more insistently than I can bear to refuse.</p>
      <p>For it is more fitting to try anything rather than for our inaction to weaken their spirits; for suspicion will cling that their life is being neglected by us. But if the outcome does not meet their expectations, this at least will alleviate the bitterness of the cross, as they will understand that they were a concern to us. Although our delegates have not yet returned from the Baden assembly, I suspect, however, that when they are worn out by the delay, they may be induced to accept any conditions, and indeed this has not been hidden from the neighbors, who are aware of the nature of our people and therefore have stood by their own decisions. And yet they seem to be softening, which also results in our people opposing their demands less, even though they are harsh. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother, much to be respected by me.</p>
      <p>Greet your fellow ministers warmly in my name. I do not include greetings from others, because they are unaware of this expedition.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect, bless, and always guide you with your wife and family! Geneva, 13th of September, 1557. Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and faithful pastor of the Zürich church, Heinrich Bullinger, brother and fellow minister much to be respected.</p>
