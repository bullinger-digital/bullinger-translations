      <p>Reverend Father in Christ, for the past eight days, nothing has troubled me as much as the fear that you might not have placed the subscription of the Confession regarding our churches as we have written. This matter would certainly create great envy for us and even danger among the adversary papists. It is not correctly written, [of the ministers of the Chur of the Rhaetians on this side and beyond the Alps]; for Chur does not command the others. But, if there was an error in the Latin, we still hope that you have subscribed in the German manner, as we have set it, for those who have a good understanding of the form of our churches and the republic; for the German will be read by political men. Oh, if only it is correct! - I have written to the council of Zurich, not only to the consuls, so that I do not have to write again later; for since they sent me here, it is appropriate that I give an account of my duty to them. But to avoid being too lengthy, I will inform you of what is necessary for your consuls to be educated about as well. The God's House is united and acts with great seriousness. It has dispatched 8 men with their credentials in each league to present their common concerns to the communities. But the 7 places have previously written to the 2 leagues, as has Mr. Batt, and through the mediation of Rozins and the landammann Paul Puls, the envoys have been denied an oral audience; they have had to return with their business unfinished; they are to submit their concerns in writing to the land judge and landammann. You know well how it goes; the officials are partisan. However, not all the envoys have returned yet. Some communities in the Upper League and in the courts have given some leeway over the prohibition of the land judge and landammann and have given good advice. The communities are quite good in many places. Now they are waiting here for the envoys, and as I observe and hear: if the 2 leagues act so powerfully, a God's House would propose the right to them, for the sake of deciding who should judge this matter, according to the leagues, indicating that if one league were to clash with the 2, the 2 leagues would appoint 6 men as one party and the one league also 6 men; the parties must agree on the umpire. But there is concern that if the 2 leagues, at the instigation of the 5 places, were to oppose, it might eventually come to arms; for a God's House does not stand back and will sooner put life and property at stake. But if in the end one were to strike another and a God's House were to succumb, woe to you; if the Palestinians fare better, and it would be over for you. Therefore, the matter requires timely counsel, and at this moment there is nothing better than for the city of Zurich to write to the 2 leagues and kindly urge them to stand firm with the right and to take other good measures. The House of God accepts no means with the disadvantage of freedom, etc. It would be better if the 6 places wrote commonly; but the matter is thus neglected. Certainly, the 7 cantons do not have so much regard for you that they would not want to offend you, etc. This is written in haste; I am very tired from writing.</p>
      <p>Bäldius wrote to me diligently. He read the letters of the House of God and the acts of the Baden assemblies; but he does not know that they were also written to the Glarus people. You see the error in the decision; whose fault, I do not know. He writes that he has read the House of God's letters to the 4 cities and St. Gallen. The rest he finally sees, what they themselves seek, whose fault and the Glarus people have been troubled for so long, etc. Please inform me of what is happening in the assemblies; for the most shameless lies are spread everywhere about the Palatine... - I send you here my advice with a request, as soon as you have read it, to send it to Mr. Bäldius in Glarus and let me have your advice on this matter, as I also desire the advice of Mr. Landammann. If the matter is handled correctly and it comes to the best possible outcome, I hope to come to the last resort, although a God's House will hardly engage in any means. However, one must act with discretion, only then, if one cannot proceed further. For the Battians, settled in these lands, are not secretly involved in the matter; they also accept means, etc.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 11, 1566.</p>
