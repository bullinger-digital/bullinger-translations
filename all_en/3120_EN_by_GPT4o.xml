      <p>Greetings. Your letters were most welcome to me, as they announced the desired outcome of the Rhaetian assemblies. However, I would like to know what resolutions were made there that will contribute to the propagation of religion. Regarding the assemblies at Regensburg, I learned yesterday through friends' letters that there is an agreement for a colloquy by the states of the empire, to be held by three learned men from each side with Maximilian presiding. From here, Philipp, Brenz, and Schnepf have been appointed, and from there, Vicedom, Canisius the Jesuit, and some Spaniard whose name I do not know. The designated location is either Strasbourg, Regensburg, or Nuremberg, but the time has not yet been set, although it is not expected to be delayed for long. May the Lord ensure that if the adversaries, as we expect, continue to defend impiety perversely as usual, they receive the confusion they deserve, and the church is finally freed from such gross and manifest...</p>
      <p>I believe the request of the Austrians, as well as that of some others, has been postponed to the outcome of the next assemblies, because the princes require some determination immediately after the colloquy. Meanwhile, they have agreed to provide aid against the Turk in the double Roman campaign, 40,000 infantry and 8,000 cavalry at their own expense for eight months; however, there are those who believe peace will be bought from the Turk and the remaining money will be converted to other uses.</p>
      <p>Vigilance is necessary for Germany, as are repentance and prayers. Regarding the French expedition turned towards Rome, the Duke of Basel wrote here, who himself, along with Schaffhausen and the rest, joined as an ally to fight for the antichrist. The magistrate had prohibited him from allowing himself to be led out of the kingdom; but what cannot money do, and the hitherto declared excessive indulgence towards others breeds insolence. Hence, we are entangled in multiple guilt with horrible scandal. Hardly any other event has afflicted me more, and while I think much about it, I see no remedy unless we are chastised and humbled by the severe rod of the Lord's wrath. But farewell, my Bullinger, and help us with your prayers.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 24, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
