    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger sincerely thanks Blarer for his conscientious letter [HBBW XVII, No. 2602].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Something is to blame for the failure of the good cause [of the Schmalkaldic League]. Therefore, one must pray to God and repent. Due to the relentless actions of some princes, it is to be feared that a victory [of the Schmalkaldic League] could bring even greater horrors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blarer has probably heard of the severe fate that befell the learned Thomas Naogeorg from Saxony because he rejects the bodily presence of Christ in the Eucharist. When the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] heard of Naogeorg's arrival in Augsburg, he ordered his arrest. However, the people of Augsburg did not comply with the request (this in confidence: the people of Zurich and Bern should not find out about it). What can one expect from such friends [like the Elector]? No wonder the cause [of the Schmalkaldic League] is not progressing!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger holds nothing of mathematicians and their predictions. However, it is certain that the godless will not reach half of their days. May the Lord convert [Emperor Charles V] or destroy him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger has heard nothing about the black woodpecker except for a rumor, which he does not believe.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] He is glad that Blarer has received all his letters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Victory will surely come from heaven. Therefore, one must pray to the Lord, who hears those who call upon His name!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger hears only good things about Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse]. He himself wrote to him about the course of the war at Ingolstadt [HBBW XVII, No. 2581].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] [Konrad Schweri], the messenger from Baden, who was in the imperial camp and was held captive in Memmingen, is currently in Zurich. He reported to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs] about the despondency prevailing in the camp and how it was bombarded in an extraordinary manner. In view of the rampant plague there, the Emperor must soon deploy his Italians before they all run away from him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Bullinger is concerned about the Confederation. The Pope [Paul III] and the Emperor have greatly influenced the Five Places. If it continues like this, there could be conflicts among the Confederates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Bern secretly intends to invade the imperial Burgundy, which, however, has a protective alliance with the Confederation. The matter has progressed to the point that [Philipp of Hesse and Johann Friedrich of Saxony] have asked the Four Places in writing [to invade the territories of the Pope and the Emperor]. This greatly displeases the Zurich council. A meeting of the Four Places will probably take place.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] The people of Zurich have approved the dispatch of Jodocus Kilchmeyer, an elderly pastor working in Küsnacht, to Bern. He will travel to Bern this week.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Bullinger would have wished that other pastors than [Sebastian Lepusculus and Hieronymus Gunz], who are not highly regarded, had been sent from Basel to Augsburg. The people of Basel probably wanted to get rid of them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] The Zurich council has complained to Bullinger that the council of Constance writes nothing about the Swiss mercenaries lying at Füssen. Therefore, [Konrad] Zwick's journey to [Füssen] is to be welcomed. Bullinger is waiting for his report. Nevertheless, the people of Constance should write to the people of Zurich [about it].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] If only 3000 Spaniards had been hanged! [Johannes] Haller also reported (with HBBW XVII, No. 2596) about their disgraceful behavior, especially towards women and children. May God punish the violators of women!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] The Florentine mentioned by Blarer [in HBBW XVII, No. 2602] is the powerful Piero Strozzi, who lends the [Schmalkaldic League] 40,000 crowns and tries to recruit the Italians [serving in the imperial troops].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] Bullinger still believes that the [Schmalkaldic League] should kill Charles, just as the Confederates once slew Charles [the Bold].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] The messenger [Schweri], who was detained [in Memmingen] on his return journey [from the imperial camp], was traveling with the permission of the bailiff of Baden [Niklaus Imfeld] not in the service of the Confederates, but of the imperial messenger in the Confederation [Jean Mouchet] from Dole. The intriguing [Mouchet], sent by the devil, was in Zurich the day before and has now traveled on to Bern. Of the letters [that Schweri carried on his return journey], one was addressed to the Nine Places, the other to the Four Places. These were opened by [the Schmalkaldic League in the field camp] at Donauwörth before being forwarded with an apology [to the Confederates]. The people of Zurich were not displeased that the Schmalkaldic League had read the Emperor's letters, but the Five Places were very annoyed about it. When the [Baden] bailiff [asked the leading place Zurich] how he should react to the opening of the letters, he was advised to remain calm. Bullinger will report more to Blarer. Last week, the [messenger sent by the bailiff] was in Zurich and laughed about the whole affair.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] Blarer, whose diligent [letter writing] Bullinger appreciates, may be commended to God. The letter bearer [Engelbert Milander], a Hessian who has been studying in Zurich for some time and comes from poor circumstances, is recommended to Blarer.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Yesterday, while I was dining, I received your long-desired letter, my esteemed brother. It cheered me with its varied exposition, which is not unfavorable. May the Lord so temper our affairs that we may rejoice in His grace, deliverance, and mercy! Amen. I thank you for your diligent and copious writing, which truly gratifies me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In all our lives, there is something that hinders the cause from advancing, even though it is well-suited with grace on our side. Yet we are human, and the Lord knows that we are frail. Therefore, we must daily pray and admonish everyone to improve. There is another thing I do not doubt angers the Lord: I fear if the matter were to proceed smoothly, the truth would not be furthered, as in the need of the princes, some act quite harshly. From this, one must conclude that if the matter stands above, one of the greatest abominations must be protected.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You have probably heard of Mr. Thomas Naogeorg. He is a pious, learned man in Saxony. However, since he did not want to say where flesh and blood are in the bread, he has had a bad place. And when he recently came up to Augsburg and the Elector became aware of him, he ordered his arrest and indicated the aforementioned reason. But the people of Augsburg did not want to do it. Haec tibi dicta sint (I would not want our people here and in Bern to hear about it; the matter would be entirely supported by us), et certa sunt. See, what friends do we have there! What should we expect? That and other things are in the fathers! Is it then a wonder that it stands so still? It is also not a small matter to God and His honor in this article, etc. Now, we will commend it to God. He will know what to do. But the matter is important to me and very regrettable. I am certain that it will not bring any good.</p>

      <p>Vain are the mathematicians and their prognostications. However, He is truthful who said: "The wicked will not live out half their days." May the Lord convert him or remove him from the midst!</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I know nothing about the black woodpecker, except that I have heard a vague rumor, which I do not believe much.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I rejoice that all my writings have been delivered to you in good faith.</p>

      <p>I know, however, that victory is granted from heaven and is obtained more by prayers than by swords and ferocity. Therefore, let us never cease to burden the ears of the Lord of Hosts with pious prayers! He will hear those who call upon His name.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I hear nothing else but that the Landgrave acts with all loyalty and unheard-of seriousness. May God strengthen him! He himself wrote to me how he dealt with them (the Imperialists) before and at Ingolstadt.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>There is the messenger from Baden, who was captured in Memmingen, in the Emperor's camp. He reports about terrible things and that they were so despondent in the Emperor's camp that it is a wonder. He claims (and has said this to the city clerk here) that such shooting has never been heard before, etc. The Italians will not remain long in death; he will and must use them beforehand. Look now and be concerned.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The matter does not look good to me among us Confederates. The Pope and the Emperor have come deeply behind the Five Places. So now something is present. If it continues, I fear we will come to conflict. May God prevent it!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Bern is in a practice to fall upon the Emperor in Burgundy, which, however, has a pact to protect with all the Confederates. And the matter has already progressed to the point that the princes have written up here, and also my lords have been admonished to it, along with the other two places; but this greatly displeases my lords. They think well, there will soon be a day among the four places. I am anxious and do not like the matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>To the people of Bern, it has been granted here to send up to the preacher Mr. Jodocus Kilchmeyer from Lucerne, a capable, well-spoken man. He has so far served Küsnacht on Lake Zurich. He is well advanced in age. This week he will travel up. May God give him luck!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>I would have wished others sent (consider this said to you) than those two, I mean to Augsburg. They were not very welcome in Basel. Perhaps they sent those whom they would gladly do without.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>My lords have now complained to me about the Swiss mercenaries lying at Füssen: How does it come that your lords do not write about them? Therefore, it is good that my dear Mr. and friend Zwick is there. I await your report. But it is good that your lords also write to ours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Oh, if only 3000 of the thieving, robbing Spaniards were hanged! Haller has also written to me about how disgracefully they behave, especially with women and children. May God punish the violators of women!</p>

    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Petrus Strocius is the Florentine. He lends the league 40,000 crowns. He is a powerful military man. He wants to try to recruit the Italians.</p>

      <p>I trust that the Christian league will slay this Charles, as the Confederates once slew Charles of Burgundy.</p>

      <p>The messenger was not of the Confederates, but of the treasurer of Dole, the Emperor's messenger in the Confederation. He was also here yesterday. He does nothing but practice. The devil has brought him to us! He is now in Bern. And the bailiff of Baden allowed the messenger. When he returned, he was captured. One letter of the Emperor was addressed to the Nine Places, the other to the Four Places. These were opened by the princes at Donauwörth, but sent back with a friendly request not to be angry. My lords are not displeased that the princes saw what he wrote to them along with the [4] places Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and are not unwilling. But I hear the 5 places are angry. But do not think that they will make anything further of it now. When the bailiff was asked how and what he should do, etc., it was now said here, be calm, etc. But if anything further arises, it shall not remain hidden from you. Last week the messenger was here. He laughs at the matter. Says they have done him good.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>With this, you are commended to God, and I also consider it good, for I am pleased with your diligence. I commend to you the bearer of this letter, the student Hess, who has long devoted himself to letters in Zurich. He is now going to the camp, soon to return. He is poor. Zurich, October 3, around 2 in the afternoon, 1546.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, faithful minister of the church of Constance, his dearest brother.</p>
