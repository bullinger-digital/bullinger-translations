      <p>S. D. After many months have passed, most kind Bullinger, I longed to address you with my albeit clumsy little letters. My desire was interrupted by an impediment to my right hand, due to which I was unable to write even a single letter for a long time. However, having somewhat recovered, I have taken up the pen so that you might not perhaps conceive a damnable suspicion of me, that I am forgetful of your and your benefactors' kindnesses and oblivious to the many forms of generosity communicated to me. I give you immortal thanks for the benefits and munificence so liberally bestowed upon me.</p>
      <p>However, I beg you to consider my ingratitude, who, beyond words, repays nothing for so many and great gifts and benefits, with a good heart, terrified by my fault; I do not cease to love you from the heart and to observe your merits and dignity. The works with which you have munificently gifted me, I have read with great affection and diligence and have extracted fruit from them, as the Lord has granted grace; they are compilations truly worthy of the author from the sinews of Holy Scripture. May the Lord aid your endeavor and preserve you unharmed for His church and grant you to reach the years of Nestor. Amen.</p>
      <p>Regarding the state of my age, which I am in my 76th year, I inform you, I bear patiently the discomforts of the flesh and the innumerable stings and troublesome conditions of nature that tempt the flesh daily, trusting in the Lord's help, until the present time a whole year remains, what is to come I leave with hope of grace in the true faith of the mercy of Almighty God and His disposition. Our church, cared for by the excellent minister Johannes Concius and most vigilant, is preserved in a tolerable state; the word of the Lord is sincerely preached. The Antichrist does not cease to mix his seed, yet without harm to the truth.</p>
      <p>May the Lord enlighten, nurture, and protect it from all diabolical incursions. Furthermore, most esteemed Bullinger, I wholeheartedly commend to you the bearer of this letter, Jacob von Planta, a young man from a noble family but of modest fortune, who has decided to devote himself to good letters in Zürich. If you could assist him with such promotion that he might be helped from the alms of pious places ordained for the use of the poor, you will do a pious work worthy of you, no less pleasing to me than desired. Greet on my behalf your entire family with the ministers and brothers through Christ to all. My son-in-law Friedrich, with the whole household in Chur, is well; Johannes, his son, distracted from literary studies, devotes himself with greater affection to the lyre, which I cannot accept. Live and farewell, most delightful Bullinger, and continue to love Travers, who is devoted to you, who commends himself to your and the Zürich church's prayers from the heart. From Zuoz, 14th day before the calends of December 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours truly, the most devoted Johannes Travers. To the vigorous defender of the word of God and fearless asserter, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürichers, my brother through Christ, most esteemed.</p>
