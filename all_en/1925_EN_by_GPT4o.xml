      <p>Most honorable prince, gracious lord, my willing service and all good things are always at your princely grace's disposal. First of all, I ask your princely grace to kindly accept my letter, read it willingly, and graciously consider it, as I am moved to do so by no one other than your princely grace's well-being and that of the pious and honest people, who for many and long years have been allowed to freely practice their faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ by your princely grace, and who may not, without great sorrow and severe burden of their consciences, turn to another religion. The entire circle of Christendom now knows how our religion, although called a sect by many, is solely founded on the true word of God, presented to us in both Testaments, and that we wholeheartedly reject all sects, having no fellowship with the old or new heresies and sects of the Valentinians, Arians, Manicheans, Pelagians, Donatists, and others like them, nor with the Anabaptists, Libertines, Georgians, Davidists, Servetians, etc. We keep the holy baptism unblemished, which is given with prayer in the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and we partake of the holy supper of our Lord Jesus Christ with fear of God and faith, holding everything about this venerable sacrament of the true body and blood of Christ that the holy evangelists and Paul teach us to hold. We maintain the twelve articles of our true ancient Christian faith completely pure and unbroken, as well as the glorious and true symbols of the four main councils held at Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, along with the Christian symbols of the holy Athanasius and Damasus and all those like them. We keep the holy ten commandments unchanged, as well as all laws like them, and avoid those that are unlike them. We offer our prayers to God, our creator, in the form, manner, and style as we have been taught and instructed by the holy servants of God in both Testaments, but especially by our Lord Jesus Christ in the holy Our Father.</p>
      <p>Thus, we also teach that all who fall into sin should always turn to God through Christian repentance, namely through heartfelt remorse and confession of their sins, through true faith and righteous improvement of their sinful lives.</p>
      <p>And we do not reject the good works that proceed from true faith, right love, and according to the word of God, so much so that anyone who boasts of faith but does not strive for good works is called a hypocrite rather than a Christian by us. However, we also attribute the forgiveness of sins and righteousness solely to the merit of Christ through faith, so that Christ's suffering is not in vain for us. The fact that we let some things pass and do not accept them is solely because we firmly believe that God the Father has given us all perfection and sufficiency in His only Son, our Lord Christ Jesus, whom we have as our light and only eternal teacher, as our righteousness and redemption, as our only eternal priest, mediator, and intercessor, as the head and life of His church, as the only eternal sacrifice for the sins of the living and the dead; for in Him and no other, as the holy Peter says, is our salvation.</p>
      <p>Since this is truly and fundamentally the case, and our religion is nothing else, your princely grace is undoubtedly not necessarily compelled to no longer tolerate our religion, as if it were an Anabaptist or other evil sect, in your princely grace's lands as before, since it is also evident that in the entire empire, in many places and regions, by princes and lords who have taken and held the same oath with your princely grace, our religion's adherents are left undisturbed. It is also well known how many high estates of the aforementioned Roman Empire, even the imperial majesty itself, tolerate the Jews, who are indeed blasphemers and enemies of the eternally pure, highly praised Virgin Mary and her blessed, saving Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, in their dominion, not only tolerating them but also protecting them against the Christians. Why then should not our religion's adherents, who are in no way comparable to the unbelieving Jews, but are true believers, recognizing that the Son of God, born of the eternally pure Virgin Mary, is the Messiah of all believers and their only eternal comfort, also be allowed to remain undisturbed?</p>
      <p>To hold them in less esteem than the Jews is indeed a great disgrace. My gracious lords of Zurich treat those who are not of their religion in a friendly manner, so that even the prelates have no reason to complain, but can boast that they are treated without burden regarding their life, being, and goods, where one good and friendship should bring about another good and friendship. In no other matters do people's minds become more embittered and unwilling than in matters of religion, when a pious man with his people is forced against his conscience from the faith, on which he is instructed by God's word, to another religion with which he cannot be satisfied in his heart, instructed by God's word. And it is for all prudent rulers to consider how they do not make the willing and friendly unwilling and resentful, but rather keep their own people, as much as possible with God, in good favor and goodwill. It has been shown in recent years how great unrest has been caused to powerful potentates by forcing their willing subjects in matters of religion and thereby making them unwilling. The prayer of the poor is also not to be despised, as it is worth much before God and brings results. God says in His word: when widows, orphans, and troubled people cry out to Him, He will hear them and act sternly against those who cause them to cry out; conversely, He will also hear the prayers of those who pray for their benefactors and will do them good. The Lord Jesus says in the holy gospel that He will richly reward those who offer even a cup of cold water to His followers. Therefore, although the glorious kings Cyrus and Darius were not of the Israelite religion in all things, they nevertheless allowed the Israelites to remain in their religion, which they could have persecuted like Antiochus; indeed, they helped them to build the city and temple in their (the kings') glory, so that they would be obedient to them in other ways and pray faithfully to God for them (the princes). Through this, these kings also attained great fortune and salvation, and I have no doubt that if your princely grace allows the poor people, who are subject to your princely grace's dominion, to remain free and graciously in their faith as before, they will be all the more obedient and willing, and will earnestly pray for your princely grace, and God will also richly show His grace and mercy to your princely grace. Your princely grace would surely attain misfortune and disaster with such oppression, yes, even shorten your life more than in any other matter. There are many examples before our eyes, so it is not necessary to recount them. God Almighty, faithful and merciful, surely watches not only over His word but also over us, who are set on His word, desiring His protection and grace from the heart. Even though many speak evil of us and against us (may God forgive them), and even rejoice in our downfall, God will surely not forsake us, but will save and preserve us for His name's sake, and will visit those who offend and undeservedly revile us in His time. Above all, the time of our life here on earth is truly miserable and short.</p>
      <p>We all must surely die and be brought before the judgment seat of Christ. Therefore, I admonish and beseech your princely grace most earnestly through God and His mercy to faithfully consider all this, to contemplate the end of all things and the strict judgment, and to graciously allow all who are of our true evangelical religion, which is neither Anabaptist nor sectarian, to remain free in their faith as before. This will undoubtedly be faithfully rewarded by the true, faithful, and merciful God. Whatever I can do to serve your princely grace at all times, I would not spare. I hereby earnestly ask your princely grace not to take offense at my letter, but to kindly accept it from me. May God Almighty always be gracious to your princely grace. Given in Zurich on the 12th of July in the year 1553. Your princely grace's willing Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable prince and lord, Lord Diethelm, abbot of St. Gallen, his gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Written on the 24th day of the wine month in the year 1553 in Zurich. Joannes KÃ¶chlin</p>
