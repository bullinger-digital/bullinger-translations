    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to lack of time, a Lasco can only write one letter, which is addressed to everyone. He gratefully received the letter from the [Zurichers] [not received] when he was about to leave [Worms]. No, he will not leave Friesland, as the Zurichers suspect. However, he is ready to offer his help to others on occasion, especially since he has the permission of his church to do so. Thus, he is now serving for the second time in the service of the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied]. He would have liked to come to Zurich, but he couldn't even visit Bucer in Strasbourg. Now he must travel home again, but before that, he will go to [Bonn] to the Archbishop. - As for the divine matters, a Lasco remains deaf to any testimony that is not based on the Holy Scripture. He knows that he is not judged by humans (no matter how wise they may be), but solely based on the Holy Scripture. - In [Worms], the religious matter is being handled with negligence.</p>

      <p>I am now compelled by my occupations to write to all of you, dearest brothers in Christ the Lord, in one letter, and that briefly, for time does not permit much. By chance, I received your letters, which were most welcome to me, while I was on my journey here; in which you seem to suspect that I am considering leaving the churches of Friesland. But I am not thinking of anything of the sort, yet I cannot deny my assistance to others for some time, with the permission of my church. Thus, I first attended to the Archbishop of Cologne, having been called by him, and now I have come here. I would gladly have continued on to you - whom I sincerely wish to see - if it had been possible. But I could not even travel to Strasbourg to see Bucer. And now I am compelled to prepare for my return to my own, and tomorrow I depart from here to the Archbishop of Cologne; from there I will return to my own.</p>
      <p>Regarding my steadfastness in that kind of doctrine, which I believe is known to you, there is no reason for you to doubt anything. I wish to be completely blind, as far as divine matters are concerned, outside of a certain testimony of the divine word, nor do I attribute so much to any human prudence or industry that I would wish to rely on it without the word. I know that I am to be judged not by men, however prudent and ingenious they may be, but by the pure and eternal word of God handed down to us by Christ the Lord through his apostles. Therefore, I submit myself entirely to this alone according to my weakness and pray to the Lord that he may deign to rule me with this royal scepter of his to the glory of his name and the edification of his church.</p>
      <p>Here, the cause of religion is being handled negligently and perhaps will be postponed to another assembly.</p>
      <p>I cannot say more. I wish you all to be well in the Lord. Hastily, in Worms, June 9, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, as much as I am, Johannes a Lasco.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious men Konrad Pellikan, Heinrich Bullinger, and Gerhard von Kampen, most esteemed brothers and friends. In Zurich.</p>
