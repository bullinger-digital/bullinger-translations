    <p xml:id="regest1">The fact that the Zürich council is now confidentially sending its Grand Council member Heinrich Thomann to the Landgrave is an expression of the concern held by Zürich in light of the war instigated by the Emperor [Charles V] and the Pope [Paul III]. It is clear to everyone that this war aims solely at the eradication of the true religion (which Zürich has also adhered to for years). Consequently, the people of Zürich equate the well-being of the brave Landgrave with their own.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The Landgrave will have learned about the difficulties made by the neighboring [Swiss Catholic] allies and how intensely they are courted daily by the Emperor and the Pope. The Zürich council continues to do everything to oppose these allies and can already look back on some good results.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- To continue doing its best in the future, it sends the pious, virtuous, and honest bearer. The Landgrave should place him not among the soldiers but with his servants. The costs will be covered by Zürich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger is always ready to be of service to the Landgrave. In Zürich, people pray for his victory, which is so important for the church as well. Mayor Hans Rudolf Lavater sends his regards.</p>

      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince, gracious lord, your princely grace is my entirely willing service beforehand prepared.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Gracious lord, the fact that to the electoral and also your princely grace, my gracious lord, the bearer of this letter, Heinrich Thomann, your citizen and member of the Grand Council, has been sent, is done in utmost trust and with a very friendly intention. For since this present war by the Emperor and the Pope has been undertaken for no other reason than that they intend to eradicate the true religion (which we have adhered to for many years and intend to continue adhering to with the help of the Almighty), it can be well understood by everyone among us that your princely grace's welfare is the welfare of us all, and your princely grace's misfortune, which God may eternally avert, is the misfortune of us all. Therefore, my gracious lords and all the people have a very great desire for your princely grace's welfare. Trust also in God and all honest people, that they will bravely stand up in times of need.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Thus your princely grace may well know how our neighbors and allies have behaved until now, and how great the efforts by the Emperor and the Pope are daily directed at them. However, my gracious lords have turned away very vigorously from these efforts for the good and advancement of the common cause, and continue to do so; which has also achieved much benefit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>So that they may in the future act more cautiously and thoroughly for their best, as the situation is, they have sent this faithful man to your princely grace, without a doubt, your princely grace will show yourself gracious and willing in this matter. It would therefore be very serviceable to the matter if your princely grace would not place the bearer among any captain or appointed officer, but rather let him stay with your other servants, yet without your princely grace, at my gracious lords' expense. Therefore, I have humbly and friendly requested this of your princely grace. He is a God-fearing, virtuous, and honorable man, to whom all trust can be placed.</p>
      <p>Herewith to serve your princely grace, I offer myself willingly at all times. And here I pray to God the Lord, that He may graciously further and preserve your princely grace in victory and welfare for the well-being of His church. Your princely grace is offered greetings by my gracious lord Johann Rudolf Lavater, Mayor, along with his willing services.</p>
      <p>Given in Zürich, the 6th of September in the year 1546.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's entirely humble, willing</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious high-born Christian prince and lord, Lord Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc., his gracious prince and lord.</p>
