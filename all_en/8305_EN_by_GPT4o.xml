      <p>S. D. For 14 days I have written nothing to your piety, dearest, because I have received nothing from you in return, nor did I have anything worthy to share with you. Now I share with you what I have received from Poland in these days, as well as what I believe to be certain about French affairs. I greatly fear that we must once again descend into the arena and fight. When will enough blood finally be shed? But Cardinal Lorraine cannot be sated with blood. May the Lord repay him and grant us peace, although we seem to deserve dire and numerous punishments! I am, however, in good health and, despite my perpetual labors, I am not only increasingly fatigued but also gradually weakened, yet the Lord provides for me so that I can crawl along and do what I can. May the Lord have mercy on me and all His faithful! If you have any news about the affairs of the Venetians and Italy, about peace or war, please share it.</p>
      <p>It is strange that such fervent beginnings of war progress so little and become so tepid and indeed nonexistent.</p>
      <p>Greet the honorable consuls, Mr. Gregor Carl, Pontisella, and the fellow ministers. If Mr. Ulrich Campell were to be received, I would consider it well done. I now expect abundant letters from you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In the year of our Lord 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I will send the Polish matters, God willing, after eight days; for the copy I had intended for you was taken by someone else, so another must be written, which could not be done today. Therefore, I ask you to consider it kindly. I thought I had it in hand; then someone else took it, as often happens to me, etc. June 30.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, honorable lord and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
