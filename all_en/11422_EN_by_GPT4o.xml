    <p xml:id="regest1">Cannot understand why he is being sent to Tübingen for further studies, as there is equally poor discipline there as in Paris; defends himself against related concerns from Peter Kolin and others. Asks to send him money to Tübingen and also to send him the books he wrote about. During his journey, he learned in Bern about a letter from Bucer to Comander, in which the people of Zurich are attacked; he conveys a quote from it, warns against hypocrites, and can hardly contain his anger. Hopes for understanding for his frank words; it pains him that he is no longer allowed to learn [French]. Asks for a letter of recommendation to [Melchior] Volmar; perhaps he can stay with him and improve his French there. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>I have many things that should be written to you, most kind father; but what I should write or what should be written, I do not know at all. For the new and unexpected decision about Tübingen has me so entangled that I have no advice or help at my disposal. It would be different if I could find even one scholar who would say that this pleases him. The most learned in Lausanne were amazed by it, and in Basel, no one does not condemn it. However, because I have never yet shown any example of disobedience (as you all can testify), I do not want to admit that I seem less obedient towards you here. Yet, I would like to understand more clearly the reasoning and purpose of your decision, which you proposed for me to seek in Tübingen. Certainly, there is no reason why you refused Paris that does not apply even more elsewhere, except for religion. As for the discipline of life, none is more dissolute than in Tübingen, as Grynaeus (to whom this school is better known than to anyone else) testifies. Peter Kolin, to whom I owe this most of all, will rightly think I have acted unjustly (if these things are true), for having lived so many years in such corruption and impiety, unless perhaps he thinks that the constancy of mind was granted to him alone by the Lord. I write this neither out of envy nor hatred (for I love the man very much); but I call others, and especially Myconius, to witness whether I have changed in my morals from my former ways through French associations. Whatever others may complain about my luxury (as you wrote to Lausanne before), I wish such people were as observant at home as they are sharp-sighted in others, or that they would consider all the circumstances before condemning others. But it is easier to criticize the smallest things in others than to notice even the greatest things with which we ourselves struggle.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I earnestly beseech you to act so much with our people that I may also receive money in Tübingen (unless it has already been sent through Wolff), so that I do not appear to be the only one neglected by you. But I entrust this to you as a father and unique patron, whom I have often found to be my only friend and faithful supporter.</p>
      <p>These books, about which I wrote through Rublio, namely Ovid and Virgil, I ask you to send to me first, and also to add the French Thucydides received from Rublio; for I have already agreed with him about it.</p>
      <p>When I was traveling through Bern, I stayed there for two days and in the meantime learned a strange, indeed impious thing. Bucer wrote a letter, indeed a very lengthy book, to Comander, the pastor of Chur. In which, as it was said, many things were written against the people of Zurich, a good and learned young man from Bern, who had copied this book for his teachers (for a copy of it was also sent to Bern), said these words were contained at the beginning of the letter in the division of the argument and handed them to me written down word for word; they are as follows: "Thirdly, I will add about the slanderous accusation of our Bullinger (I call him so because I hope he will return to the right path), by which he has resolved to slander us with utmost injustice and indignity before Mr. Johann Travers, your senator." This young man would have described more to me; but it was not allowed, nor could it be done secretly. I sent this to you as a warning not to trust anyone easily (although you do not need my warning); for we have very sharp enemies who excellently feign friendship. These are the works of that Christian and most pious man (if it pleases the gods), to sting secretly like a scorpion, whom he fears to resist to the face. I do not see how I can dwell securely among such people; I fear that, if provoked, I might hardly restrain myself from violence.</p>
      <p>I write all this to you, dearest father, because you alone are the one with whom I dare to deal freely and safely about my affairs. I ask you to take these things written perhaps with a more ardent impulse of the mind with an even mind. For it pains me not a little that I am now forced to completely abandon that language, not without great loss, of which I had laid the foundations not unsuccessfully. But let these things be your concern.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, most kind father, I would like you to write to Volmar in my name, if perhaps I could live with him at a more just price; for I would very much like this because of the exercise of the French language, which is at his home.</p>
      <p>As for the letters of recommendation, either send them to me in Basel, so that they may be delivered by me, or send them ahead to those people, as it seems best to you. However, it would not be convenient to come without a recommendation.</p>
      <p>Our people from Zurich who were sent to us greet you. You will also greet your wife and mother with the whole family in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most kind father, and keep me commended to you. Basel, 3rd day before the calends of April 1540.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed father. Zurich.</p>
