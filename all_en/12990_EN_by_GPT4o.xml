    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The entire issue is to be addressed in three points. The first question is whether the marriage [of Elsbeth Huber and Jakob Kundigmann] is a legitimate marriage without marital intercourse or not; secondly, whether the woman, through her sexual intercourse with another man due to her husband's impotence, committed adultery or merely engaged in fornication; thirdly, whether the couple should be legally divorced.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The first step is to clarify what can be considered a legitimate marriage according to human and divine order. A marriage is always considered legitimate when two people, in accordance with God's word, are willing to promise mutual fidelity during a public church ceremony and (if God blesses the marriage with children) to start a family.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Since no one doubts this, it would be tedious to elaborate on this and support it with quotes and legal excerpts. However, in the present case, it is necessary to first examine the marital status of the two aforementioned individuals for its legal validity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Everyone knows that these now disputing spouses initially came together in mutual trust and in accordance with God's word (especially since there is no unlawful kinship between them) to start a family. Their marriage was also sealed with a public church ceremony, in which they promised each other fidelity in the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. They did not live together like immoral people or fornicators, but as respectable spouses. Otherwise, they would not have been tolerated in the Christian society of the city of Konstanz. Their marriage is therefore legitimate. To doubt this would question God's order and that of the church, as well as the virtue of fidelity! The severe consequences of this are evident to all reasonable people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [Secondly:] In response to the objection that no children have resulted from this marriage, the following is to be said: Abraham and Sarah (like many other couples) also had no children for a very long time. Nevertheless, these childless marriages are legitimate. Regarding the still disputed question of the man's impotence, it should be noted that the latter has not yet been conclusively proven, and the woman's claims are no longer to be believed, especially since she shamelessly lied to the authorities in her first statement. And even if the man's weakness could indeed be proven, it is still a marriage recognized by law and the church, which has not yet been legally dissolved.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] If the woman had concluded that her marriage could not last due to her husband's impotence, she should not have made herself the judge in her own case and joined another man during the still existing marriage. Instead, she should have kept her marriage vow, lived honorably, approached a recognized judge, presented her complaint, and applied for a divorce. Only after obtaining a divorce could she have lawfully joined another man in marriage.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] However, since she did not live honorably and did not apply for a divorce, her marriage is still legally valid, even if her husband were impotent. A woman may apply for a divorce due to her husband's impotence, which again proves that a marriage is valid despite impotence and can only be dissolved by a legal decision.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] From the foregoing, it becomes clear that the marital union of the persons concerned is legitimate and, consequently, the woman's sexual intercourse with the other man is to be classified not only as fornication but as adultery. Fornication is understood as the unchaste behavior of individuals who are single and do not break any vow of fidelity. However, when the woman in question engaged with another, she was not single. Her vow of fidelity was still legally valid despite the husband's impotence.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Paul writes that through the marital obligation, the body of each spouse becomes the property of the other, so that the man's body no longer belongs to him but to his wife, and the woman's body no longer belongs to her but to her husband. Since the marital union between the mentioned spouses has not been dissolved by God or by the judges (who alone are authorized to dissolve a marriage), it is clear that this woman has treacherously given her body, which belongs to her husband, to another and has therefore not only fornicated but also committed adultery, and should therefore be punished as an adulteress.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Thirdly: If the man's weakness were the only reason for the complaint and the divorce proceedings, there would be no need to rush the divorce of the couple, but rather to have doctors determine whether there might be any hope that God would heal the husband's ailment over time. However, since adultery has occurred here and the man is not to blame for the woman not addressing the issue of impotence in court but committed adultery, and since God allows divorce in the case of adultery, these spouses may rightfully be divorced.</p>

      <p>This entire matter revolves around these three points: Whether this cohabitation of two people (marital union), which they have maintained for several years without marital intercourse (sexual relations), constitutes a legitimate marriage or not? Whether the woman, who engaged with another man due to her husband's impotence, committed adultery or merely fornication? And whether these two can be rightfully and legally separated?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>First, one must consider what is regarded as a legitimate marriage according to divine and human order. A marriage is considered legitimate by everyone when it is entered into properly, with the consent of both parties, not against God's word, where these two help and advise each other, each finding satisfaction in the other, and are willing to raise children together, should God bless them with any. All of this is publicly declared, established, and confirmed before God and the Christian community with a public church ceremony, so that everyone can see and know that they are married and should be regarded as such.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Since this established foundation is undisputed and unchallenged by anyone, but rather accepted as true and undeniable by everyone, it would be not only unnecessary but burdensome to introduce many writings and laws to confirm something that is inherently firm and accepted as certain by everyone. However, it is necessary to now consider and examine the cohabitation and marriage of these two people to see if it is thus constituted. For if their marriage is thus constituted, then it is a legitimate and proper marriage.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is undoubtedly and publicly known that these two people, between whom there is now a dispute, initially came together properly with the consent of both, also not against God's word (as they were neither related nor kin in forbidden degrees), and primarily came together to help and advise each other, each finding satisfaction in the other, and to raise children together, should God give them any (for this reason, they also publicly went to church, where they publicly promised each other marital fidelity and faith before the servant of God in the presence of God and the church; this was also confirmed in the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as there is no higher binding, obligation, and confirmation; they lived together for years not as rogues and fornicators, but as honorable married people), for which everyone regarded them. For otherwise, they would not have been allowed to live together in a Christian community. Therefore, the marriage of these two people is a proper, legitimate marriage. For if this were not considered a marriage, then God's order would be in vain, the entire church would be deceived and misled, fidelity and faith would be broken, and it would not be valued; countless evils would follow from this: All of which reasonable people can well assess and understand!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>However, the objection might be raised here that there are no children in this marriage, as the man is impotent, etc., to which this response is given: Abraham and Sarah also had no children for many years. There are still many married couples who have no children, but their marriage is nonetheless a legitimate marriage. Regarding the man's impotence, it is still in dispute, and it has not yet been proven and demonstrated that he is impotent, so the woman's claims are less credible, especially since she shamelessly presented falsehoods to the authorities in her first statement. But even if it were proven and demonstrated that the man is impotent, the bond of marriage, which was rightfully joined together, remains a legitimate bond and a marriage, as it was established with given and received fidelity before the church and has not yet been legally dissolved!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>If, in this bond, the deficiency is found such that the woman might think the obligation could not stand due to the man's impotence, as she had begun with good hope, the woman (if she intended to have a complaint against the man due to impotence) should not have wanted to be the judge in her own case, nor should she have joined another man during the existing marriage and obligation, but she should have kept her given and promised fidelity honorably to the man, maintained her honor, turned to the proper judges, presented her complaint to them, and requested a divorce, and only after obtaining a divorce should she have joined another man in marriage, with whom she hoped to maintain soul and honor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Since she, however, did not act honorably nor presented any open complaint before the judges, and therefore did not obtain a proper divorce from the judges, the bond of marriage, which was once rightfully and properly, as mentioned above, joined together, remains firm and unbroken, and it is a legitimate marriage between them, even if the man were impotent. For above all, which is clear enough in itself, the laws allow for divorce due to impotence. However, a thing cannot be separated that was not first united by a bond. Therefore, since the laws allow for divorce due to impotence, they acknowledge that there is a bond and marriage between those where one of the two is impotent.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Secondly, from the first point and the legally established foundation, it is good to understand that, since the cohabitation of the aforementioned persons is a proper, legitimate marriage, the woman's engagement with another man is not merely fornication but true adultery. Fornication is the unchastity committed by single persons, where no fidelity and faith are broken. However, this woman's person was not single when she engaged with another, but the given marital fidelity, which she once promised to the man, was still valid. For she was not released and declared single by law and the judges due to the man's impotence, so that she could give and grant her body to another.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Saint Paul says that through the marital obligation, each spouse's body is so committed and obligated to the other, that the man's body is not the man's, but the wife's, and vice versa, the wife's body is not the wife's, but the man's. Since the bond of marriage, which stood between these aforementioned persons, has not been dissolved by God or the judges (who alone have the authority to dissolve it), it is undeniable that this woman has treacherously given her husband's body to another and therefore has not only fornicated but committed adultery and has fallen into the punishment of the adulteress.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Thirdly, if the impotence alone were the reason for the complaint and the divorce proceedings, there would be no need to rush the divorce, but rather to seek the advice of doctors to see if the situation might change over time and God would remove this deficiency. However, since open and known adultery has occurred and the man seeks to be separated from the adulteress, and it is not found that the man gave the woman any reasonable and significant cause for adultery (for she should have rightfully complained about the impotence before the act and before the judges, and not willfully joined another man outside of marriage), and since, above all, the Lord allows for divorce in the unfortunate case of adultery, these two people may rightfully and legally be separated.</p>
