      <p>Greetings. I give you great thanks, and to your daughter Elisabeth, our dearest godmother, for the gift sent to my little daughter. May the Lord repay you a thousandfold and grant that you see many prosperous and happy years. I ask you to thank her on my behalf.</p>
      <p>My little daughter also writes some childish things here to her godmother. I would have written to you sooner; but until now, I had no messengers except for Maternus of Wrocław and no material. When Maternus was here, I had to go somewhere outside the city, so I could not write through him.</p>
      <p>Now, since I have a certain messenger, I could not refrain from at least thanking you; for I still have nothing else that is very worthy of writing. Meanwhile, we have heard nothing about the Savoyard.</p>
      <p>In France, the Duke of Lorraine is raging under the royal pretext. My brother writes that Oleverius of Trier has been freed, and the others have met almost the same fate as those from Locarno. You know better how the people of Glarus are doing.</p>
      <p>The old dispute with the people of Geneva remains. They had captured a certain nobleman, a citizen of Lausanne, the lord of Vufflens; but while our people interceded for him, they released him again. May the Lord grant that all things be settled!</p>
      <p>The lords Dillger, Haller, Steiger, and also Diesbach, my father-in-law, mother, and the whole family greet you and wish you and yours a happy and prosperous year, and long-lasting prosperity. Also, greet all of yours in my name and wish them all happiness.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 10, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his dearest and most esteemed lord and godfather.</p>
