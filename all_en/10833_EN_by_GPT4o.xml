      <p>Peace and grace from God our Father be with us all, dear Master Heinrich. I must again let you know my concern, namely what has happened in Holzhalb's house. Also, he has explicitly spoken with us about how Ulrich Funck, blessed, is guilty of his father having to give away his sister's goods, who was the son of the late Curate Gullen. Also, he spoke with us explicitly that Master Löw did not want to pay the apothecary, and my lords had to force him to do so. Also, he said that no one has been a citizen longer than the poorest.</p>
      <p>Also, his maid, namely Magret, has spoken very rudely to Master Claus Setzstaben, and also said that the Chopfin had given many crowns to the Löwin in a secret manner. Those crowns she gave to Wiesenbach, which he earned. Also, she mocked Master Bertschy Negelly; the two women, the wife and the maid, did so. Also, they mocked Zennder in front of the Rüden. Also, Felix Müller, the cloth shearer. Also, the two women called Andreas Schmitz's sister, who had the young Stumpf, a stone skinner. Also, the maid from Jacob Holzhalb told me how he is a wild pig with drinking; a cup of wine is not enough for him. Also, it was explicitly said how the bailiff Blüwller is a drunkard. Also, how Prosy Fry took Lübolt Grebel's wife away from him.</p>
      <p>On the Thursday after the old carnival, they put up a devotional image. It depicted King Oswald, a crucifix, and Saint Catherine; above it, Gideon, as he prayed to God, and how the servants were drinking the water. After that, during Lent, two small church pieces were made, one with two Saint Johns, in the other King Oswald, etc.</p>
      <p>And with all these things together, I cannot find anything else in myself than that it is an evil machination of the papal court. Now, I say to this, that the true and undoubted faith is all and the New Testament biblical scripture and the baptism and the Lord's Supper, as it is practiced here in Zurich, and besides, no idols nor mass. God, the Lord, grant us His divine grace and increase our faith through His only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>And therefore, wise lords, pious, upright people, you who are all one body and Christ Jesus our head, look into this matter, for simply, those who are willing and papists in the council, our cause cannot be good, for what those who are for God's word push through, the others hinder, and therefore take care, you who have Christ Jesus alone as your comfort and Savior. May God grant us this through His only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. All this I have written to you, so it is.</p>
