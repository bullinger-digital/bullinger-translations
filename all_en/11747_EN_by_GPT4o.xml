    <p xml:id="regest1">Requests to send a letter with the messenger on the return journey from Kempten; Blarer has certainly received the resolution on military service ["Der loblichen statt Zürich ordnung und erkanntnuß wider das schädlich kriegen und reyßlouffen"]. Death of Peter Kolin on [2nd] December, whose Latin translation of the Apocrypha was printed by Froschauer on the same day and is part of the Bible edition ["Biblia sacrosancta"] currently in preparation; the Old Testament was translated by Leo Jud and Bibliander, and several [Zürichers] were involved in the New Testament. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Since a messenger was about to set out for Kempten, I wanted to greet you with this letter, my venerable and dearest friend and brother in the Lord, and at the same time to inform you to prepare something of yours to give to him on his return. I now have nothing more to write. You have undoubtedly received what I recently sent, the decree or plebiscite of our republic against mercenary military service.</p>
      <p>The most learned and pious man, Peter Kolin, returned his spirit to Christ the Redeemer, having been extinguished by the plague within three days, on the 2nd of December. On the same day, the ecclesiastical or apocryphal books, which he translated with great diligence from Greek into Latin, were completed. Froschauer printed them to be included in his Bibles to be published at the upcoming spring fair. The Old Testament was translated from Hebrew by Leo Jud and part by Theodor Bibliander; several of our people are working and have worked on revising and adorning the New Testament, as you will see in a month or two. I believe neither Germany nor France has seen a more elegant and beautiful work, and the printer spares no expense.</p>
      <p>The Lord be with you. 12th of December, 1542.</p>
      <p>Greet your family and brothers. Megander, Pellicanus, Bibliander, and the others greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Ambrosius Blarer, his most sincere and dearest brother and friend. Constance.</p>
