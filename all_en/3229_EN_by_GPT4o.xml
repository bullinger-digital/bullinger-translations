      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I am slow in writing and replying, most learned Mr. Bullinger,... I rejoice. However, that you would thank me so studiously and kindly for... dialect.</p>
      <p>There was absolutely no need for my questions. For I have received far greater things from you, which undoubtedly have been and still are more useful to me than this will be to you. If... we publish in secular literature, they are greater benefits, as you write, than those of kings, what shall we say about those things which you have published and continue to publish in sacred matters. The whole world could not compensate. Therefore, just as you encourage me to continue benefiting Christian schools, I also advise you to do the same, as you do, in helping the church. For if ever necessity demanded, it demands now more than ever. Many neophytes govern churches, whom the apostle had ordered to be kept away from churches, and it happens to us, as it was foretold, that we are carried away into pride and fall into the judgment of the devil, we please ourselves too much and seem to be wiser than our elders, therefore we do not fear to innovate many things even in well-established churches. Therefore, you veterans must strongly resist us who dare such things; otherwise, it is to be feared that the kingdom of the antichrist may gradually be restored in full. To this are added certain turbulent and seditious men, who wickedly and nefariously stir up that evil business in the Eucharist which has been hidden for some time. Oh, what a harmful book a certain Eber (Misami rather than Erasmus) recently offered me to read, my godfather Dr. Adam Carolostadt. How truly these Saxon men are full of thick beer, which does not produce subtle senses. May God grant them a healthier mind and ignite the fire of charity, which lies almost extinguished in ashes, at last. The princes of the empire have now gathered (as I hear) in Frankfurt along with their chief ministers, and they say a certain colloquium is to take place. I see that the leaders of our churches are being overlooked, which I do not approve; for I fear that the Saxons, our enemies, may obtain what they have long tried to achieve since Mr. Luther was still alive, that our churches may be condemned and excommunicated as heretical. Let us therefore be vigilant, sober, pray, and arm ourselves with these weapons against the enemy's schemes, remembering the word of our Savior: This kind of demon is not driven out except by prayer and fasting. Our adversaries seem to be arrogant, proud, ambitious men, incited to quarrels, fervent, irascible. Let us flee and detest these vices, let us be gentle, temperate, peaceful, modest, humble, lowly, not returning evil for evil nor insult for insult, as St. Peter taught us, but on the contrary blessing, because we were called to this, that we might inherit a blessing. Meanwhile, let us freely profess the truth and not depart from it by a hair's breadth for anyone's favor. Thus we will triumph over our conquerors.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, the day before the calends of July in the year of human salvation 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Hospinianus.</p>
      <p>To the most knowledgeable in divine and human letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zürich, his lord and brother in Christ to be respected. Zürich.</p>
