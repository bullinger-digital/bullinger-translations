      <p>Most beloved godfather in the Lord, the matter of Mr. Philipp concerns me greatly, not because I doubt his intentions, but because I fear that the malice of wicked men may not only prevent him from coming to us but also cast him into grave dangers. May the Lord deliver him from the mouths of not just one or two, but many lions and bears, among whom he finds himself.</p>
      <p>As for your Apocalypse, do not doubt; I will do what I can here. May it be through it that the Antichrist is revealed and seen throughout the whole world.</p>
      <p>Regarding your promise to write to Mr. Konrad Zwick, from whom I hope to receive some certainty in the art of carpentry, which holds my interest, it is so pleasing to me that you could hardly do anything more gratifying. Therefore, I beg you to seize the first opportunity to attend to this matter.</p>
      <p>I mourn with all of you and your republic over the death of your consul of blessed memory, and I pray to the Lord to appoint in his place a man endowed with double piety and prudence, just as Elisha was once appointed in place of Elijah. I return Dasypodius's letters.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for your kindness in being willing to send readings. Farewell excellently, most beloved godfather. All of mine greet you, especially your little Heinrich. Greet yours in my name, as well as the lords, fellow ministers, and professors.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 15, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, most beloved lord and godfather. In Zürich.</p>
