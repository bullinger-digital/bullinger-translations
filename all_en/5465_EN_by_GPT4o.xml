      <p>You have probably already received the news that MÃ¢con has been recaptured from the Guise family, with many faithful cruelly slaughtered in that city. Now, rumor has it that Bourges has also surrendered to the king on equal terms, which the royal envoy confirmed in a letter to me dated September 12th; however, there are those who vehemently deny this to be true. They say that the greatest plots are being laid against the Pope and that [guns were fired at him], but the bullets missed; however, he is said to be in great fear for himself... contemplating defection, and just as the Florentine prince is allied with the Pope, so is the Duke of Ferrara. A conflict has arisen between the Duke of Ferrara and the Florentine.</p>
      <p>It is said that the Pope... is in Iberia. They say 60,000 Moors are at sea against the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>The sixth session was celebrated yesterday, yesterday in Trento... May the Lord scatter the council of the wicked, amen!</p>
