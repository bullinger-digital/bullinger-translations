      <p>The professors and preachers of Lausanne have for many years insisted on the matter of excommunication, requesting that it be granted to them, which until now has not been possible (due to concerns about misuse and other disturbances). They have now earnestly pursued this matter, to the extent that they have declared that if they are not granted this, they can no longer serve with a clear conscience and would rather resign. In response, the authorities have asked them to put in writing the form they desire and send it to them.</p>
      <p>They have deliberated and drafted many articles, among which excommunication is almost the least significant. The most important are: 1. That the ecclesiastical court be changed because civil and ecclesiastical powers are mixed within it, and that a purely church council be established that punishes not with imprisonment or other external penalties, but solely with warnings and ultimately with exclusion. 2. That this church council alone should have the authority to handle church matters, whether they concern doctrine, ceremonies, or otherwise, and that the authorities should not burden themselves further with these matters than to execute what is decided by the church council. 3. That the ministers should preside over this council as has been customary from ancient times. 4. That this church council should manage church properties, elect deacons, and that these deacons should also give an account of their administration to them. 5. That excommunication should be carried out by the church council, and public penance by the penitents should be required before they are readmitted by the council. 6. That private instruction (as they call it) should be established, meaning that the ministers should go from house to house or have people sent to them to inquire about their faith, so that they may see to whom they can, with a clear conscience, give or not give the Lord's Supper. 7. Concerning synods and their authority, and how they should be conducted. 8. Concerning predestination, that they should not be forbidden to speak about it, etc.</p>
      <p>When the authorities heard these and other similar articles (of which these are the most important), they were exceedingly angered, and they summoned all the preachers, professors, and schoolmasters here, and brought the matter before the council and citizens on August 15. There it was recognized that the authorities could in no way change their reformation, but were determined to maintain the ecclesiastical court and its statutes, to suppress and punish all misconduct as much as possible according to their office. They also promised to do this with more diligence in the future than perhaps has been done, and to take better care of church properties and use them well. They do not forbid them to speak about predestination, as long as they do so with discretion and for edification. However, they cannot agree to their other articles in any way.</p>
      <p>And since they declared that if this was not accepted, they would want to have leave, the authorities gave them until the next morning to consider whether they would desist from these matters and leave the authorities in peace or not, for if they did not do so, they would not only be denied leave but also banished from the land. When this was laid before them, they gave a written response the next morning and requested permission to dispute these articles with us or others. Whatever is not found in Holy Scripture, they are willing to abandon.</p>
      <p>However, the authorities did not want to engage in any disputation but simply remained firm in their opinion and gave them one more day to consider. We also negotiated so much that they complied and then returned home in peace.</p>
