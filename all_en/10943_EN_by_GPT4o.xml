    <p xml:id="regest1">Learned from Ambrosius Blarer that Bullinger and his family are doing well. His own situation has improved since the visitation, as the letter bearer, his brother-in-law, will report. Would like to come to Zurich himself and pick up the new writings [of Bullinger]. Apologizes for his inadequate writing due to the unexpected availability of a messenger. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My entire humble service etc. to you (first), dear lord and teacher. I always like to hear that things are going well with your people etc., as I have heard from my lord and brother Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Although I have been in poverty, after the visitation [!] my situation (by God's grace) is well and well provided for. Although many challenges (temptations) have befallen me, God has made it better, as my dear brother-in-law, who is delivering this letter, will tell you etc.</p>
      <p>If God wills, I would one day come to you and collect the copies you have written and made.</p>
      <p>The reason I have written to you so inadequately is because my brother-in-law has taken another route for himself and intends to come to Zurich. With that, I thank God and you, who alone are responsible for all good things.</p>
      <p>Given on Tuesday before Gallus' Day in the year 1536.</p>

      <p>To the well-learned M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich etc.</p>
