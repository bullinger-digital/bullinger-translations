      <p>Greetings. If I remember correctly, dearest compater in the Lord, I wrote to you on May 26 through our Gervasius, when he departed from here having been made the pastor of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I have sent no letters to you; for immediately after Gervasius's departure, I fell into a feverish illness and after that into erysipelas, which kept me bedridden for three whole weeks. I used the advice and services first of a certain physician, then also of a surgeon; however, due to the stubbornness of this ailment, neither he nor the other made any progress, until finally, I began to rely on the advice of women, which by the grace of the Lord turned out not badly. Therefore, this week I returned to the reading duties I had left for some time and began the explanation of Genesis.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant His spirit and bring to completion what has been undertaken for the glory of His name. I was in May in Basel and saw the first labors of my Psalter's birth and heard the groans issued under the press in person. I pray to the Lord that it may serve the public utility of the church.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Emperor and the Diet of Augsburg, I can predict nothing good; unless the Lord miraculously assists the afflicted churches in time and restrains the plans of the wicked, you will soon see that your churches, too, will equally share in this danger by which the rest are oppressed. Thus I fear, and for many reasons, which you undoubtedly understand much better than I do.</p>
      <p>The churches should be urged towards sobriety, modesty, humility, and true repentance if they wish to escape the impending evil. I pray, if you have anything about the Diet, write. Farewell very well, dearest compater. Greetings to all yours, the lords, brothers, and friends; all of mine greet you. Bern, June 28, 1550.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, your compater.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Antistes and pastor of the Zürich church, M. Heinrich Bullinger, compater and brother in the dearest Lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
