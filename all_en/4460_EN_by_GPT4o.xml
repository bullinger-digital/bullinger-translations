      <p>Greetings. By the grace of God, I am beginning to feel better, but I have not yet fully recovered; I have dedicated today to purging, for it seemed that the illness wanted to return unless it was prevented. In this illness, one must especially counteract obstructions, and indeed very promptly.</p>
      <p>But you have the skilled doctor, Dr. Gesner, whom I know spares no effort and diligence in caring for Mr. Ludwig, your dearest son-in-law, a most beloved man to me, whose premature death (which God may long avert) would have been distressing and bitter not only to you but to many pious people.</p>
      <p>But I am comforted by what was added in your letters, that he has begun to feel better, and indeed, when the first attack of this illness subsides, all subsequent matters seem easier; but the remnants should not be neglected, of which I am myself a testament. Therefore, advise him to abstain from all cold things and to follow the diet prescribed by the doctors, to especially refrain from very austere wine and to drink what strengthens the stomach. I have nothing new to write, except that our bishop has allied himself with the Comense of Uri or certainly wished to ally himself while about to attend the Baden assembly and return through you and Einsiedeln. What he is plotting is not difficult to guess; but often, he who digs a pit falls into it. Soon there will be an assembly here with few observers; for it has been secretly written by the leaders of the Upper League to our senate that Hercules von Salis, who lives in Chiavenna, is conducting some clandestine negotiations with the Venetians and has promised them an alliance and passage and everything with private authority and has received a thousand crowns annually for himself and two hundred for his son as a reward, and indeed it is said to be so. But another, Augustin von Salis, is negotiating a new alliance with Philip, and that plan is also in preparation, nor did these things escape the departing envoy. I only wanted to hint at these things so that you might gradually learn the state of the Rhaetian Republic.</p>
      <p>Behold, what do these men not dare? and all this with impunity and private authority. So much for this.</p>
      <p>May God preserve you and yours safe for us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Chur, 16th of September, in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
