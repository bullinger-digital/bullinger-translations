      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote to you, my dearest brother, enclosing those acts of the Regensburg assembly, which I earnestly request you to return as soon as you have the opportunity, so that our people may also read them. Now I write only this, that this pious and learned man Erhardus, indeed a Frenchman but now the envoy of the Neuchâtel city and region's brothers, wished to be indicated to you by me in very few words, namely so that he may more successfully fulfill his undertaken duty, and also obtain from you what he has from the people of Strasbourg, as well as from us. Therefore, my venerable Bullinger, assist this excellent man who is pursuing a clearly just and excellent cause, so that he may achieve the fulfillment of his wishes. You will hear the whole matter from him in good faith. It would indeed be a very bad example if even once a distinguished person, such as Farel, a minister of the Church of Christ, were to be forced to yield to the lust and insolence of some, in places, I think, where the word of Christ has been received. Therefore, I think no good person will not consider that strong resistance must be made here at the beginning: especially you, who defend your place here more steadfastly than others. Farewell, my dearest and best brother. May your whole household with all your servants be well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>All of ours lovingly and respectfully wish you well in the Lord, to whom we again and again ask you to commend us diligently. In Konstanz, 10th of November, in the year 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Ambr. Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger of Zürich. To the incomparable brother, especially esteemed and dearest.</p>
