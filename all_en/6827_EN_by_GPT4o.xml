      <p>S. I have received your letters here, for which I thank you. However, that Gentile has not yet been brought here. I wish he were in Geneva; not everyone understands these matters, nor are they a concern for everyone as they should be. Nevertheless, we will not neglect our duty. It will be very beneficial that we still have everything that was done with Gribaldo, the retraction and the document written in his hand, to which even if he also subscribes, it will not be advisable for the churches if he is released. However, the senate will decide on this. We have nothing from France; some lament the most calamitous state, others proclaim much about the progress of truth. About the Turk, everything is now silent. We wonder what is happening among the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>Friends and brothers greet you again. Greet all yours in my name. Bern, at the end of June 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To my friendly, dear lord and godfather Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
