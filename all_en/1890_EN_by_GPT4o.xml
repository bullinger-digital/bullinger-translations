      <p>Most illustrious and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I am now sending a personal messenger and did not think it necessary to spare this small expense, so that we might help the exile of Jesus Christ, your Molineus, for I am not ignorant of the need to help the wretched. The situation is as follows.</p>
      <p>While the count was absent, I took it upon myself to plead the man's case with the duke; I did so, and indeed I used your authority; for I said that you had recommended Molineus to me. The duke responded kindly; but yesterday he sent me a letter, which he had recently received from the exile himself, who was asking for what I had already requested on his behalf, and he instructed me to inform him to come to Tübingen and see if the small town pleases him, if the people do, and the rest; for if it pleases him, he would offer him a position to teach civil law here. Thus the prince instructed me. Now, lest I seem to belittle the offered benefit, I thought it necessary to write everything to you, to you, I say, under whose auspices the matter began to be handled, so that you may inform our brother of the duke's will.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we would have delayed too much if I had not sent a messenger and had wanted to inform you of this in person. I know that exiles are usually anxious and worried while they wait to see into which port they will sail; therefore, I say, I did not want to spare the expense for the glory of the Lord. In the meantime, I want you to know that I have written to my Lactantius in Geneva to inform Molineus that we are handling his case; but you will nonetheless write everything to him in order. The duke spoke much with me about the pastors of Zurich; but I reserve that for my arrival, which I hope will be within 15 days. I am translating two booklets by the prince's order. Duke Maurice and the Duke of Brunswick are sending 5,000 infantry and many more cavalry to support the bishops; this is certain.</p>
      <p>I beg you, brother, to diligently inquire with the host at the Stork and with Ziegler, whether there might be any letters that pertain to me, and give them to this messenger to bring to me, and if Aurelius might have come to Zurich, order him to come to me with this messenger, although I have little hope; for if I hoped, I would send a horse for him. But if by chance, I say, he has arrived, let him come to me now with this messenger, if he wishes, or if he does not wish, let him go wherever he pleases. Furthermore, I beg you to send these letters, which I will add here, to Chur; give them to the host at the Stork and commend them diligently.</p>
      <p>Send the Duchy of Lusitania, which you will find in these letters, to Basel to Jacob Parcum with the booklet, which I will also attach here, at the earliest opportunity, and through some trustworthy man.</p>
      <p>This journey was undertaken entirely in the name of the Lord and blessed by Him; thus I see many things falling into place happily; to Him be praise and glory forever and ever, for He does not abandon His own; for He is faithful. My Josias is doing well; this practice benefits him wonderfully and he adapts well to bearing responsibilities.</p>
      <p>I now conclude. You write to us about all matters diligently. Wolmarius, our host, certainly an excellent man, greets you.</p>
      <p>I bid the whole family, the whole school, the whole church to be well. May the Lord Jesus bless your labors. So be it, so be it.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, June 4, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
