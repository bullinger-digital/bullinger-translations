    <p xml:id="regest1">To the pastors of Basel: Can only report why there is nothing to report yet. The opponents are delaying the start of the conversation; they are unexpectedly in the minority because three of their representatives are inclined towards the Protestants, and therefore they are trying to ensure that only one vote counts for each side. [The Protestants] are hoping for Duke [Wilhelm] of Cleves; also in [Calenberg-GÃ¶ttingen], in Brandenburg, and even among the Lithuanians and Muscovites, the Gospel is gaining a foothold. Promises a detailed report. Reminds of the solidarity in the common service, which is being lived out in a pleasing manner by the theologians present. Due to the hasty departure, he could no longer attend to his lecture. Both letters are to be sent to Zurich; has already written to Bern through Farel. - To the pastors of Zurich: Apologizes for not at least having communicated that nothing is happening here yet. The fact that the matter is not progressing is due to the intrigues of the opponents, but it might benefit the Protestants; he will report more on this later. Has perceived much sympathy for [the Confederates]; conveys greetings and asks that both letters also be sent to Vadian.</p>

      <p>To the most esteemed brothers in Basel.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I am almost equally concerned about what to write and the fact that I write nothing, both due to your grace, most esteemed and beloved brothers. I wish and ought to write something worthy of your ears and expectations; but while I strive to do so and write nothing but the matter itself, I write nothing to you. For so far, nothing has been done. What will happen next is not easy to predict. Meanwhile, I will ensure that you truly understand the reason for this delay and know that nothing is being done.</p>
      <p>Our doctrine, which is the doctrine of Christ and the Gospel, is approved by fourteen votes of the states involved in the assembly, while the doctrine of the Pope and the adversaries has only eight votes, and that before the battle. Seeing this success and agreement, the adversaries, although very incited with hatred and envy against us, wish to fight, yet they cannot come together in any way. The situation is as follows: On both sides, there are eleven men whose votes should count, and while all eleven of ours agree completely, among their eleven, there are three who, although drawn by order and position, openly profess that they are with us in their opinions and minds. One is the preacher of the Palatine Prince in Heidelberg, another is the theologian of the Brandenburg Elector in Frankfurt, and the third is the envoy of the Duke of Cleves. If they are excluded by the adversaries, they come directly to us; if they are retained, they fight with them. The enemies have tried to move and attract them to their side with prayers, threats, art, and deceit, but they cannot find a way to do so. They will not see themselves defeated by the number and multitude of votes (which is the only kind of victory they seek) before they engage in battle. Their entire strategy for this war is based on the multitude and crowd of people, not on the truth and virtue of Christ. This support, which came to us unexpectedly and without our seeking, does not come to them, who seek it alone; they find themselves in great difficulty beyond everyone's expectation, including their own, while we enjoy the greatest advantage beyond the goodness of the cause itself and embrace the Lord's help with grateful hearts. Certainly, if anything is to be attributed to human conspiracy, we would openly win at this time before the battle begins in the provincial council by the vote of most of the empire's states. This provides the adversaries with a reason for delay, claiming that not the votes of individuals count, but only one vote from one side. We wish the matter to prevail and the truth of Christ; we want the voices and opinions of those involved in this colloquium to be noted and to prevail as far as they agree with the truth. Since both of these are intolerable to them and they do not want even a jot of the proceedings to be published, the matter is delayed, and as you see, nothing is being done. Now they are negotiating with us about a private colloquium with only one or two men involved, and it is certain that they will leave rather than act with us under such conditions. We must thank Christ for the truth finding so many witnesses everywhere.</p>
      <p>There is great hope for the Duke of Cleves. The children of Eric of Brunswick have accepted the Gospel by the order and guidance of their guardians and mother, even though Henry strongly opposed it. The Brandenburg Elector, which was previously incredible, is spreading the doctrine of the word throughout his dominion with singular zeal and even private industry. Finally, among the most barbarous peoples of the Lithuanians and Muscovites, the Gospel is now beginning to be desired.</p>
      <p>However, I will ensure that you know everything from the beginning, either by writing while absent or narrating in person; for I am composing a narration of the entire business conducted. This is also the reason why I write to you less often, intending to make up for this negligence most abundantly. Additionally, lacking a scribe and barely sufficient for noting daily matters, I can hardly think of writing before I return home, let alone touch it with such unfortunate fingers. But enough of this now.</p>
      <p>I beseech you through Jesus Christ, brothers, to truly remember our common ministry among us and to desire to conspire deeply in this most holy matter. It is incredible with what grace, humanity, and concord all the brothers here meet; there is a wonderful eagerness in everyone's eyes and speech. I pray to the Lord Christ that he may grant me this grace with each of you when I come, so that we may fulfill the common ministry with joy and gladness of our spirit.</p>
      <p>I believed that my lecture was immediately taken care of by you; you know how unexpectedly this journey happened to me when I suddenly departed from there, overwhelmed with thoughts of other matters.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord Christ that he may make us all one in him, with our hearts filled with true charity. Amen.</p>
      <p>Send this and the other letter to the brothers in Zurich; for I have written to Bern through Farel.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, farewell in the Lord Christ. December 22.</p>
      <p>S. Grynaeus, your brother.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed brothers in Zurich. Greetings. I seriously wish to excuse this delay in writing, brothers. It is incredible to say what has happened to me here; for while I daily expect at least some beginning of this matter, which was to be done here, so that I might have something certain to write to you, most esteemed and beloved brothers, while I neglect the other many uncertain things that are said and done here, so as not to bring anything uncertain to you, it happens that what is promised and expected daily as certain, I write nothing to you daily, passing over what is expected and promised. While this happens for two whole months and the matter always promises something in vain, I always prepare in vain, finally looking back, I see and realize that you indeed expected everything, but I have written nothing and, writing nothing to those expecting everything, have greatly erred. And I wish that some remedy for this error and fault of mine may be found even now!</p>
      <p>Certainly, I have waited in vain so far; for nothing is being done even now, unless something is done before it begins to be done. But here some lion roars at me and says: "That very thing," he says, "when nothing was being done, you could have more easily written that nothing was being done and, by informing us who were constantly expecting nothing to be done, freed us from false expectation and gained favor for your duty, as if people often gain great favor even from nothing, or as if you are not now forced, when you tried to write something, to finally write nothing." Thus the lion roars, but these things would truly be said if I had wished to write nothing or that nothing was being done to you, such men, in such great expectation of important matters, or if you could not have believed that nothing was being done. Therefore, I now seriously and not jokingly beg you not to blame the writer, which is nothing and nothing, for this fault. For it is necessary that nothing is done about that concord, in which neither side wants to concede anything of its right, nor even to hear that something should be conceded. About this matter, I will write everything to you diligently.</p>
      <p>But indeed, most beloved brothers, this nothing, which seems to be happening here, as I now finally understand, through the greatest fraud of the adversaries, brings us the greatest and most splendid matter. For soon it will be known that Satan, having undertaken to defend a rotten cause, will be exposed. And although the pious efforts of wise men here are hindered by the art and deceit of the adversaries so that the colloquium, as far as we know now, will not proceed, yet the Lord's business proceeds so manifestly that it is understood. For while all men are offended by the adversaries' open tricks, they are all refreshed and reconciled to us by our simplicity and faith. But about everything, as I said, I will write to you perfectly.</p>
      <p>All the good people here are held with great love and zeal for our churches and your entire nation, which can be observed from many things here. I commend myself to all of you, most beloved brothers. I am entrusted by everyone to greet you all as diligently as possible. I beg you to send both of these to Doctor Vadian. Farewell in the Lord Christ. December 22.</p>
      <p>S. Grynaeus, your brother.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men, the leaders and pastors of the churches of Basel and Zurich, brothers in the Lord, reverend to me. Basel.</p>
