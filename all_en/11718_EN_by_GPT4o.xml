    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for his silence due to the ongoing uncertainty about whether he and his companions can stay in Basel. Although they like it here, there is no need for scholars; [Oswald] Mykonius and [Bonifatius] Amerbach are doing their utmost, which is certainly thanks to Bullinger's letter of recommendation, and Mykonius has asked [Martin] Bucer if they could come to Strasbourg; if Bucer does not call them there, they plan to spend the winter in Basel. They trust in God's providence and intend to practice intercession for each other; greetings.</p>

      <p>Peter Martyr Vermigli of Florence to Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed for both piety and learning, grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>If it were the way of a Christian man to notice the negligence of friends in a human manner, I would indeed fear that you might be somewhat displeased with us for not having written to you sooner, so that you could at least be informed whether we were in good health. But since it is well known to us that you are guided by the most modest spirit of Christ, I now believe that you have not formed any harsh or bitter opinion about us beyond what has happened.</p>
      <p>However, I will now explain to you the reason why I have delayed writing to you for so long. We have been, and still are, uncertain about what our main business will be, since we have not yet been consulted by these people of Basel, nor is it possible to understand whether we will remain here, which, if it could happen, would be more pleasing to us than what is most pleasing. And while we were in such uncertainty, we always postponed writing to you so that we could write something certain. But since the matter now seems to be dragging on longer than it should, and it is not right for you to remain ignorant of our situation, we inform you by this letter that, by the grace of God, we are in good health and will take care to be even better.</p>
      <p>As for our situation, know that we greatly approve of the pleasantness of this city, the climate, the customs, and other things related to living here. However, there is such an abundance of those who teach various kinds of literature that no place seems to be left for us, and conversely, there are so few listeners that our work here seems less necessary. Nevertheless, it could not easily be said with what diligence and faith both Mykonius and Amerbach are handling our business. These men indeed show very clearly, not by words but by their uncommon zeal and diligence, which they constantly expend, that they are taking care of our affairs in every possible way, how much weight the letters had with them, by which you most diligently recommended us to them, and not just once; for in another letter, which you gave to Mykonius, you certainly wanted to distinguish us with that title (for you called us "the flowers of Italy"), so that not only did they regard us with great admiration because of it, but we also took on a great burden ourselves, if we wish to live up to such an excellent reputation.</p>
      <p>We do not recognize this in ourselves at all, but we attribute it entirely to your piety and sincerity of heart. Nevertheless, some benefit has come to us from it, for because of your illustrious testimony about us (as we think), Mykonius sent letters to Bucer in Strasbourg, by which he could find out whether there might be any hope for us there. Therefore, when Bucer responds, then we will be able to understand whether we will be here or in Strasbourg. For we have entirely decided to winter in Basel, unless Bucer orders us to go to Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, we will bear it with a cheerful and uplifted spirit, convinced that it has been arranged for us by God our Father through Jesus Christ, and we will not allow you to remain unaware, whom we uniquely respect in Christ (as is right). We also want you to always keep us in your thoughts, and may your prayers to God never forget us (if you love us), just as we always mention you in ours. In the name of Paul and the two young men who are with us, I send you the greatest greetings. We also send greetings to Lord Konrad Pellikan and Gwalter, the best brothers in Christ. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, from the Augustinian college, on the 3rd day before the Nones of October 1542.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the church in Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
