      <p>The negotiations between France and the Pope were in the process of peace. However, since Ferdinand, the Pope's captain, caused much harm to Octavio, the commander in Parma, and the Pope nevertheless wrote to Octavio about negotiating for peace, the aforementioned Octavius did not want to accept or break open a letter sent to him again by the Pope. Instead, he returned it to the Pope, saying that with one hand the Pope shows peace, while with the other he wields the sword to cause harm.</p>
      <p>Because of this, the Pope, being unwilling, thus broke off the intended amicable negotiations.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is said to have recruited 15,000 soldiers, but let them disperse again, keeping only the commanding officers. The Turk is said to be as strong at sea as never heard before, and there is great concern in Italy, which is why the Emperor and the Pope are securing the ports.</p>
      <p>The person who told me this news has seen letters from Saxony, dated the 11th of this month; they report that there is still no knowledge of the surrender of Magdeburg, as it is still besieged and holding out well. Dated as in the letters.</p>
