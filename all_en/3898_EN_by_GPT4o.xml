      <p>Greetings. I fear that with my more frequent letters, I may be more bothersome than is appropriate to you, my dearest lord and friend, who is occupied with more serious matters; however, it seemed fitting to respond now, so that you may be informed about the bundle of books returned to me. Therefore, I give you the greatest thanks for the booklet you published against the articles of certain inquisitors; I particularly appreciate the brevity and clarity in it. I have ensured that the remaining ones, which were attached to it, as well as the letters of Laurentius Agricola, were given to their recipients. I am now eagerly awaiting Mr. Martyr's work on the Eucharist; for, as I have perceived from other books he has published on the Eucharist, and from his commentaries on the Epistle to the Corinthians, I see (if indeed it is permissible for me to say what I think, not to judge the learned) that he is a pious and learned man, and most meticulous in handling those matters which come into dispute in this age. I have heard that he has also written commentaries on Genesis, but when they will be published, I would not be displeased to know. Here, everything is now in silence, although some assert that a civil war is most certainly imminent.</p>
      <p>No princes have arrived except those I recently wrote about, nor do I think anyone will come. Our diet seems to me to have the same outcome as that of the Pharisees in John 7: "And everyone went," says the evangelist, "to his own home." Our Emperor has made a truce with the Turk for three years, to whom he pays 30,000 Hungarian gold coins annually, and as long as he continues to pay beyond those three years, the Turk promises that he need fear nothing from him.</p>
      <p>Each retains what part of Hungary they hold. These matters have become known sooner than some would have liked, as the estates have not yet agreed on financial aid against the Turks. On March 16th, the French envoy presented what he had in his instructions before the Emperor and the estates; however, what those are, I cannot yet know. The princes of Saxony, the sons of Johann Friedrich, have published a confession of faith at the instigation of the theologians of Jena, in which they vehemently attack all who do not say what they say and deny what they deny.</p>
      <p>Astonishing madness of that nation, tearing at each other mutually. These are nearly all the things I thought should be written now.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg on March 20th, in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten the Younger. To the honorable and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and friend in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
