      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most esteemed and beloved brother in the Lord, along with 4 kisses. As for what to say about that Dodonean money, I do not know; it is indeed strange if his wife left so much money to our hospital as he claims to have left upon dying; for he has testified to me once and again that they are poorer than church mice. Therefore, I have no doubt that he is spreading lies, and this is the gratitude he shows to our most honorable magistrate, although I have not yet discussed this matter with the master of the hospital. You will understand what I have done with Mr. Burcher and what I have achieved from his letters.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Salisbury writes from England that the state of religion is well, thanks to God. However, I understand that a serious war is about to break out there, as the English join with the Scots, and in a certain battle, the Scots defeated the French with the help of English soldiers. The Lutherans are not only raging against us in a strange manner, but they are also completely furious. I cannot say more now.</p>
      <p>Farewell and write back when you have time.</p>
      <p>From France, I fear we will not hear any good news.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord to heal the aggravated matters and preserve His church. Meanwhile, farewell with all your family.</p>
      <p>When you recently wrote through Mr. Hegner, I was in the countryside; otherwise, I would have most gladly and faithfully offered you my services. I returned the next day, when he had already left.</p>
      <p>I wish to know what you have accomplished.</p>
      <p>Greet the friends. April 22, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Winterthur.</p>
