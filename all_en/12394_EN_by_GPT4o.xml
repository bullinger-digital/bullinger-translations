    <p xml:id="regest1">Happel has hardly any time, but still writes briefly to Bullinger in order not to fall under suspicion of laziness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The young scholarship holders of the [Zürich] church are making very good progress both academically and in their personal development. The [Zürich] people should therefore allow them to continue studying in Marburg next summer, so as not to interrupt their education halfway. Wandering around would also greatly harm the young people's morals and their wallets.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Happel thanks God for his [Hebrew] professorship. On January 18, he married [Katharina, née Eisermann], the daughter of the Doctor of Law and Vice-Chancellor Johannes Ferrarius, an honorable, diligent maiden. He received 400 gold pieces from his parents and the same amount from his father-in-law, as well as household goods. The wedding guests gave 75 guilders and a silver goblet. Happel and [Katharina] are well matched; he could not have found a better wife.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Happel recommends himself to Bullinger's prayers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander], to whom this letter should be communicated occasionally.</p>

      <p>Although I am hindered by the lack of time, which prevents me from writing to you extensively and diligently, as perhaps your kindness might expect, I have nevertheless decided to briefly set forth those things which I thought might somehow refresh and bring joy to you upon reading.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The young men, who are supported here by the Zürich church, are conducting themselves well, diligently applying themselves to their studies, and making significant progress both in their morals and in their learning. I am confident that they will return to you with praise and honor someday, provided they continue as they have begun, which indeed gives me great and certain hope. I sincerely advise you to allow them to remain here next summer, so that they can happily pursue their studies without interrupting their course when they have barely completed half of their journey to the intended goal. For how beneficial is it to have heard at least some part of dialectics, when one has not even properly tasted the whole?</p>

    <div xml:id="div3">
      <p>Indeed, frequent changes of place and travels do not so much cultivate and educate the mind as they exhaust the purse, leading to the forgetting of many things which you have previously learned with great effort. I omit to mention that they provide opportunities for many dangers and evils, invite drunkenness, fornication, and bring improper conversations to our ears and mouths, especially in public inns, where the dregs and refuse of the world often gather. What would the structures of stones and wood teach me? It is pleasant to hear, read, and listen to the statutes, customs, rites, and deeds of republics, but this is hardly granted to those who linger for a whole decade in some famous city. Where today is there a greater assembly and gathering of people, especially of students, where life is more dissolute, morals more corrupt, opportunities, occasions, incentives, and allurements to all kinds of vices greater and more frequent! To have seen and known good and evil is good for him who can discern between them, and with great constancy and prudence of mind, follow the good and flee and abhor the evil. But how easy it is for young men, not yet endowed and confirmed with certain and firm judgment, to err, slip, and be deceived here! However, let your judgment prevail in this matter! I write freely what comes to my mind.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As for me, I give thanks to the most good and great God for the condition of the Hebrew professorship with which He has adorned me. May He grant that I may uphold it well to the glory of His name! Amen. On January 18, I celebrated my marriage with the daughter of Johannes Ferrarius, Doctor of Law and Vice-Chancellor of this university: an honorable maiden of good appearance, remarkable moral integrity and sweetness, exceptional modesty and diligence. My parents contributed 400 gold pieces as a dowry; I received the same amount from my father-in-law, in addition to household furnishings. The wedding guests gifted us with 275 guilders and a silver goblet. I get along excellently with my wife; I believe I could not have found a more suitable partner for my character and all my affairs in our homeland, or even by the judgment of all who know both me and her. To the Lord be praise and glory forever! Amen.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest4">
      <p>These are my affairs, which I would like to be commended to your prayers to God. For I judge that it is especially necessary to pray when our affairs are prosperous and serene, lest they fall into some unforeseen storm and suddenly be submerged and collapse.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell and diligently greet Mr. Theodor in my name, to whom I would like these my letters to you to be occasionally shared, as indeed all things should be among good and learned men.</p>
      <p>Given in Marburg, February 8, 1546. Your devoted</p>
      <p>Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the Zürich church, my uniquely esteemed lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
