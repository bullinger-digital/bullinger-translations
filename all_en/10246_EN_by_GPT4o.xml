      <p>Praise be to God. Amen. May God be with you and with all of us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dear lord and brother. I have no doubt that your friendliness will be well known, as Bucer has come to us along with a learned man from Venice, namely from our lord Doctor Vadian. May God will and grant that we all be united in His praise and honor, oh may the faithful God grant this, for we are in need of it, I think. The peace of yours, or the peace of your lords and superiors with the Five Places, does not particularly please many people. May God turn it for the best. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Yll at St. Gallen, on the 30th day of April in the year of our Lord 1533.</p>
      <p>Niklaus Guldi, your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich, my very friendly and dear lord, to be delivered etc.</p>
