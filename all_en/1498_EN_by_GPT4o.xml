      <p>Greetings. The messenger from Geneva returned yesterday. Our council, to whom the Genevans also wrote regarding the matter of Hieronymus, could not address the issue today due to serious engagements. Therefore, the messenger will wait until tomorrow or perhaps until Monday. In the meantime, we have also written, but we will send it with the council's knowledge, so that no one might suspect us of anything negative because of Calvin. We are very grateful to you for providing us with your response.</p>
      <p>I will send it back with the next messenger. For now, I still need it. So that you can see how great the fire has already become and how many important people it has already involved, I am sending you a copy of the petition written or presented by the most illustrious prince, Lord Jakob von Burgund, to our council on behalf of Hieronymus.</p>
      <p>He, who was previously very close to Calvin, is now completely alienated from him in this matter. I am also sending letters from the same person addressed to you, which he sent to me: in which you will undoubtedly find more that will support Hieronymus's side.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us and quell these disputes: for I do not see any article of religion that could be more dangerously contested. And I greatly fear that the embers and sparks of this fire may fall into our neighboring churches. For many, being very curious, presume anything, especially in hatred of Calvin.</p>
      <p>I am also sending other letters from some people I do not know, addressed to you and forwarded to me from Geneva. I am also sending the preface of my booklet. I dedicated it to our treasurers.</p>
      <p>They are my fellow citizens, and their benefits towards me demand this. One of them was also the author of its publication.</p>
      <p>You will form the title according to your own pleasure. Perhaps the page will not contain everything I had put; therefore, you can delete more than I have deleted, if you wish. I would like to ask you to have two of those booklets bound there with pure gold externally applied and send them to me as soon as you can; for here we do not have suitable binders. I will pay the price immediately. Also send other copies, which I will distribute among friends, and take as many as you want for yourself.</p>
      <p>As for news, I have only this: that tonight, as I write this, the Rechbergers' little fire from Uri is here, and the march to Solothurn is strong. God have mercy, that we must endure in all these games! I fear we will receive the reward.</p>
      <p>If only we evangelicals could now go in peace! What happened in Baden, I do not yet know. Farewell and forgive me; for tomorrow, as I preach, I could not give more or better.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 5, 1551. All of ours greet you. Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich, my kind dear lord and godfather. Zürich.</p>
