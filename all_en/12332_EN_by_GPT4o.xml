    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich received three letters from Bullinger [not preserved] from a single messenger [...]. The [first two] letters reported to Frölich's dismay that the [Zurich] church could not send a minister to [Augsburg]; however, the last one pleased the [Augsburgers], as the Zurich council announced in it the dispatch of Johannes Haller despite their own shortage [of pastors]. The [Augsburgers] will express their gratitude in a separate letter. Haller will be stationed in [Augsburg] and not sent elsewhere. He is to arrive in [Augsburg] before the onset of winter. - Bullinger's handwritten manuscript with the church and [parish] order customary in Zurich is very welcome. Frölich will try to ensure that the [Augsburg] church aligns itself with it. Bullinger will receive a [gift] from the [Augsburg] council for this and his other services. - The secrets entrusted to him by Bullinger have been disclosed by Frölich only to the [two] mayors [Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot]; especially Welser hopes for a gradual strengthening of the friendship between the [German and Swiss Protestants]. - The unfortunate [Second Regensburg Religious] discussion is getting underway. The [Protestants] have appointed Philipp Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, Erhard Schnepf, and Johannes Brenz for this; as auditors, Magister Franz Burchard, Count Wolrad of Waldeck, Balthasar of Gültlingen, and Hieronymus Baumgartner; as assistants, Martin Frecht and Veit Dietrich: almost all outspoken Lutherans. They have received the explicit instruction not to decide anything against the [Holy] Scripture nor to approve anything ambiguous. Hopefully, neither the colloquents nor the auditors have been appointed from the party of the Emperor [Charles V.], so that no [religious] discussion takes place! - Perhaps soon envoys of the [Schmalkaldic] League will come to the council of [Zurich] and ask not to allow foreign soldiers to pass through the Confederation against the [German Protestants] nor to send auxiliary troops to the Papists against the Evangelicals, but rather to send help to the [Schmalkaldic]. In return, the Confederates will find help with the [Schmalkaldic]. Zurich should receive the embassy kindly. - Bullinger is annoyed that Frölich gave [Anna, née Adlischwyler] three gold pieces. Frölich only wanted to reimburse Bullinger's expenses, which were incurred by the [Augsburg] council due to the dispatch of messengers to Matthias Erb. - As a credible report on the Brunswick campaign, Frölich encloses a letter from Landgrave Philipp of Hesse to the Augsburgers. Later it was learned that horsemen and foot soldiers of Duke Heinrich [of Brunswick] wanted to pillage and plunder the peasants upon withdrawal. Therefore, the [Schmalkaldic] attacked them on October 23 [1545], killed over 100 horsemen, captured 18 nobles, including 6 canons, killed many foot soldiers, and forced them to withdraw in small groups. - In the tent of [Duke Heinrich], a whole box full of letters was found, revealing intrigues of many potentates, especially of the [Catholic clergy], which are also supposed to concern the Confederates. Therefore, the [Zurichers] should send an embassy to the [Schmalkaldic Diet] in Frankfurt, where on December 6 or 9 [1545] the evangelical German authorities will vote against holding a council, whether in Trent or elsewhere, and discuss the [continuation of their alliance]. - Duke Heinrich is imprisoned in Ziegenhain, his son [Karl Victor] in Kassel. [Heinrich] had, before the [Schmalkaldic] knew of his plan, gathered with the help of the Papists 4000 horsemen and 7000 foot soldiers; a number that rose to 20000 [men]. On October 18, he attacked the [Schmalkaldic]. After that, there was a truce, which [Heinrich] did not adhere to, which is why the enraged Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse proceeded to attack. Now [Heinrich's] helpers are being interrogated. - Greetings to Mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], Rudolf Gwalther, [Konrad] Gessner, and all [others] in the haven of scholarship. Frölich will always share significant news.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. I received three letters from you, venerable man, all at once with a single messenger, each of which is so friendly and pleasant that I completely lack the decorum and eloquence to respond. Therefore, supported only by your kindness, I will babble in response whatever comes to mind. Know then that the earlier letters from you somewhat moved me, as they announced that no minister from your church would come to us; however, the later ones filled us with great joy, as they indicated that the Zurich council, out of their own shortage, had chosen to send Lord Johannes Haller to preside over our church.</p>
      <p>Good God, with what eagerness, gratitude, and affection our council embraced such a great benefit! Believe me, this benevolence will be a pledge and a mark of perpetual friendship and faith between both councils, so much so that I do not know what the Zurich council could ask of us that we would not easily grant. The letters of gratitude from the Augsburgers will also testify to this. We will appoint Johannes Haller to our church in this city and will not send him elsewhere. He will be dearer to us than to be among barbarians, having been called from such a renowned college! As for me, I will ensure that he feels loved and respected by me not so much for his divine gifts of intellect as for my Heinrich Bullinger. You should instruct him not to hesitate to ask anything of me. Now it remains for him to hasten his journey to us before winter sets in.</p>
      <p>The manuscript of the imposition of hands and the Zurich synod's formula, written by your hand, is so welcome that nothing could be more so. I will ensure that our church also conforms to yours in this respect. Therefore, you will receive a token of remembrance from our council for these and other services you have rendered to us.</p>
      <p>The secrets you communicated to me in confidence, I have revealed only to the consuls; they, especially Welser, are very grateful, hoping that gradually a greater and stronger friendship and connection will be established between yours and ours. The colloquium, although poorly begun, is starting to progress. For this, our representatives are Philipp Melanchthon, Martin Bucer, Erhard Schnepf, and Johannes Brenz. The auditors are Magister Franz Burchard, Count Wolrad of Waldeck, Balthasar of Gültlingen, and Hieronymus Baumgartner; the assistants are Martin Frecht and Veit Dietrich: almost all are extreme Lutherans. However, they will leave with the express instruction not to commit anything against the scriptures or place ambiguities in place of agreements, but to handle everything openly. I still hope that neither the colloquents nor the auditors have been appointed by the Emperor's party, and that this colloquium will be cut short.</p>
      <p>Soon perhaps the envoys of our league will come to your council and ask that foreign soldiers not be allowed to pass through Switzerland against us, nor that the Swiss send auxiliary troops to the Papists against the Evangelicals, but rather that they provide us with assistance when we implore it, etc. In return, you will also have us ready to support you, etc. I wish that such an embassy would be treated kindly until the Lord adds more to this beginning.</p>
      <p>You are upset, among other things, that I gave your wife 3 gold pieces. I did not intend to match your generosity, but only to reimburse your expenses, which you incurred on behalf of our council by sending messengers to Matthias Erb, etc., as I explained to you quite honorably. Therefore, do not be concerned about this matter any longer, but continue in the affection of Laetus, who causes you so many disturbances, which he nevertheless does not wish to be so cumulative. Write to me in the future only when you are free from more important business.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Brunswick war, I cannot write a more detailed report than what my gracious lord, Landgrave Philipp of Hesse, the dear Josias, has written to my lord himself for fresh action, as the enclosed copy shows. It is to be believed. If you wish to hear and read about the side events and stories, many of which have occurred, they have also been printed. Since this writing, neither my lords nor I have received further information, except that Duke Heinrich's horsemen and foot soldiers, upon their withdrawal, wanted to plunder and pillage the peasants in the countryside; therefore, on October 23, our forces, with some horsemen and foot soldiers, attacked them, killed over a hundred horsemen, captured 18 nobles, including 6 canons, killed many foot soldiers, and finally forced them to withdraw and leave the country.</p>
      <p>In the tent of the tyrant of Brunswick, a whole box full of letters was found, revealing, as our gracious lord the Landgrave writes, the wondrous intrigues of many potentates, especially of the clergy.</p>
      <p>And, as I understand, it is also supposed to concern the Confederates. If it were convenient for your lords to learn something significant, they might safely send a delegation to Frankfurt around December 6 or 9. There, the Evangelicals, along with all the German authorities adhering to the word of God, will appear and deliberate against the execution of the Council of Trent or another similar council, and also discuss a union. I think your lords should be invited to come there. If not, they would still be gladly seen on the mentioned day, etc.</p>
      <p>Duke Heinrich is imprisoned in Ziegenhain, and his son in Kassel. Truly, great wonders of God have occurred. The tyrant had, with the help of the Papists, gathered about 4000 horsemen and over 7000 foot soldiers before we knew of his plan. Then he became strong in everything, up to twenty thousand. And when ours were not yet prepared, Duke Heinrich initially attacked them on October 18 and caused damage, which created some fear. A truce followed for a day, which the tyrant also did not keep, which enraged the Landgrave, and he boldly and bravely attacked. To the God of hosts be praise, glory, and honor forever! The swarm of priests has received a significant fright from this. Now negotiations are being held with Duke Heinrich's helpers; what and how far, time will tell.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Mayor Lavater, the city clerk, Lord Rudolf Gwalther, Gessner, and the entire haven of scholarship.</p>
      <p>If I hear any memorable news, I will always write to you. Farewell, my heart. November 12, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, G. Laetus, chief scribe of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, venerable churchman of Zurich, friend and brother.</p>
