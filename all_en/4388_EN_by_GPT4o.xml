      <p>Greetings. Today, early in the morning, I received your letter, honorable compater, and I thank you continuously for communicating everything to us so faithfully. Now I cannot write much, because I am not yet completely certain about the matters I could write about, and this messenger is in a hurry to leave, who might bring to your council what I was otherwise going to write. If you learn anything certain from faithful friends there, please let me know through this same messenger. There is only one thing that I earnestly ask of you, and I am prompted by some friends to do so, to inform me about what is happening among the people of Glarus.</p>
      <p>It is reported here that in some of their churches, idols, where they still remained, have been cast out, and from this, I do not know what danger might be threatening them from their neighbors. I have high hopes for the people of Valais.</p>
      <p>But I cannot write more, I am forced to close the letter due to the messenger's hurried departure. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 12, almost the first hour after noon. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his dear lord and compater.</p>
