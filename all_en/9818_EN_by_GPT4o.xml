      <p>Greetings. Although you might perhaps expect lengthy letters from me, I can write nothing else at the moment except to highly recommend the bearer of this letter to you, even though he is someone whom my letter cannot commend more than he can commend himself, provided that he is recognized for who he is. He is Mr. Merlin, a faithful minister of the Lord of La Val and the Coligny family, as well as the French church, which is now with us. He is a pious, learned, humane, and modest man, who is traveling to you not so much for the sake of accompanying his son as out of a desire to see and speak with you. Therefore, he asked me to give him a letter to you, so that he might dare to approach you with greater confidence, which I could not refuse to such a very dear and familiar friend of mine. I therefore pray that you receive him with your usual kindness, so that he may understand that I am also loved by you. I thank you greatly for your response against the papal bull spread in England; I have now read it in its entirety, and it is worthy of being read in other languages as well. I believe, however, that someone from your side will ensure it is also made available for the Germans to read. Regarding French affairs, which can indeed be known to us, you will learn everything from Mr. Merlin. Private matters are moderately well.</p>
      <p>Steiger has not yet returned from his Rotul vineyards; the wine yield with us would have been moderate, but the intemperance and immodesty of those Catholic people make it seem as though it has been given to us as an incitement of God's wrath. May the Lord avert all evil from us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 21st of October, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, my esteemed and dearest relative and compatriot.</p>
