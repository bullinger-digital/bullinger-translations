      <p>I bring my entire devotion and obedience to you, most esteemed father and teacher. Receive the state of my affairs and the great pains I am enduring. And if I did not regard you as my most esteemed father, I would never communicate my calamities with you so familiarly, and believe me, I have very few friends to whom I can safely entrust myself and my plans. Due to the utmost wickedness and treachery of my servant, about whom I wrote to you in previous letters, I have fallen into great anxieties. For he exposed my travels before all the Poles in Paris, revealed my plans, and aggravated the matter as much as he could. And those who were already angry and hostile towards me now finally pursue me to destruction. For they immediately dispatched letters against me to the bishops in Poland. Moreover, Calvin's commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, recently addressed to my king, has reached their hands. Encouraged by this, they dare anything against me. But I expected all that and would have endured it with a calm mind, for I know they sin against me out of ignorance. But they have committed other things against me that cannot be excused by any reason.</p>
      <p>They detained letters sent to me by the king himself and by other leading figures and common friends for a long time. They claim they did not know where I was and could not entrust them to the wind. But how will they excuse this? They intercepted many letters from them, violated and opened, and twice intercepted money sent to me. They think everything is permissible against a heretic. I remain silent about the insults they hurl at me everywhere. Having been informed of my arrival, they all rushed to Antwerp. They diligently search for and observe me. I, however, did not want to entrust myself to them, but I called for a conversation with one whose loyalty I did not doubt and whom I had supported for three years. From him, I learned of their plans and conspiracies. I know everything is conducted under the auspices of the archbishop, who wishes for my demise. I have not received letters to this day; they say they sent them to Strasbourg. I now suffer these things from those upon whom I have bestowed immortal benefits. They dealt imperiously with the Antwerp merchant, so that he would not give me any money. And if I had not received more than 50 Hungarian ducats 11 days ago, my affairs would have been in a very bad state. Here I incur great expenses. My doctor is the most unjust towards me, the noble servant much fairer, but those whom I honored now insult me, claiming that the royal name was profaned by Calvin at my instigation! They threaten terrible things, I feel the treachery of my brothers. I have not yet decided what I should do. I would not rashly expose myself to dangers. I cannot undertake long journeys, as my money will be consumed in a very short time. I fear being intercepted somewhere on the way. My plans are very disturbed, the matter cannot be explained, I expect help from God alone. I can hardly meet with Johannes a Lasco. He will secretly meet the king from Prussia. I have no doubt about the king's will towards pure religion and me. The power of the bishops is very suspect to me, I have no friends with me to assist me with advice. Cassander and Cornelius were displeased that I did not want to come to a meeting with the Poles. I did not consider it safe to put myself in the hands of enemies, especially in such a place. I do nothing without the advice of Lord Johannes a Lasco, I also wish to be assisted by your advice. I am greatly troubled that I have detained your money for so long and especially fear that I may incur the charge of ingratitude with you, from which I am far removed. For your piety, I pray and beseech you not to take it badly.</p>
      <p>I will indeed strive to compensate for my negligence with my utmost devotion and goodwill towards you. I earnestly and repeatedly ask you, when everyone's goodwill towards me has changed, not to diminish your goodwill towards me, but to always embrace me with your paternal beneficence. I have sent you three letters from Antwerp, I ask that our matters not be made known to everyone. I have arranged for the books to be delivered to Strasbourg by the first carrier. I cannot write more due to pain. I entrust myself and all my affairs to your faith. Expect the utmost devotion and services from me. I will not disappoint your expectation.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most holy teacher.</p>
      <p>From my hiding place in Antwerp, 13 days before the Kalends of September 1549.</p>
      <p>Your servant Florian from Warsaw by my hand.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful doctor of the Church of Christ among the Zurichers, most esteemed lord and teacher. To Zurich.</p>
