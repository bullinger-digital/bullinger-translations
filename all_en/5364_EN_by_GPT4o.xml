      <p>S. I foresaw (reverend father in Christ) already before, with what supports you would raise me up. But I am not faint-hearted; I thought, however, that I had just and suitable reasons to leave those places at some point, to which I was not sent except under certain conditions, and indeed of such a kind that they can no longer bind me. But let the Lord's will be done, to whom alone I have dedicated the course of my life; if, however, it were His will, I would wish to be freed from these troubles at some point. I do not desire honors, nor does light ambition trouble me; but there is something else I seek, namely a corner that serves studies and quiet; I leave the urban noises to those who consider everything better than solitude, which I uniquely delight in. But, as I said, let the Lord's will be done, to whom I dedicate myself and mine.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I feel both my health and my intellect weakening and gradually breaking down. The baths of Fäber (Baiae Fabarienses) are nearby and would suit me very well; but I am so exhausted that, even if I wanted to, I cannot visit them, and even if money were available, I could hardly be torn away from the church.</p>
      <p>Preaching, baptizing, visiting the sick, and many other tasks remain to be done. But what are six hundred other things that torment me, which I now omit, lest I be called a complainer. I move on to other matters.</p>
      <p>There were those who affirmed that Mr. Coignet was in chains.</p>
      <p>I was concerned for the good man.</p>
      <p>This is certain: the adversaries in Switzerland are raging and calling him a traitor and heretic. Yesterday, Dietegen from Salis (Dietägen a Salicibus), the Roman governor, came here, who, as usual, unloaded the wagons of lies he had brought with him. He said 12,000 Spaniards had come to France, and Condé was deserted by the Basques.</p>
      <p>Thus, these men are not ashamed of their vanity.</p>
      <p>But your letters arrive and dispel these rotten lies.</p>
      <p>In how many errors would we be involved if you did not teach us the truth. I send back everything and give you immortal thanks.</p>
      <p>I have nothing yet about the council; I expect daily what will be announced by those who have taken this care upon themselves. However, so that I send nothing about the council, I send my speech, which I ask you to read and correct at your leisure. Behold, how much I ask of you.</p>
      <p>I know your occupations and yet I add this burden to them. I first intended to write it so that it would be published. But since I am not entirely satisfied with it, I doubt whether it should be published; I leave it to your judgment, unless perhaps you recall the saying: "Cabbage twice cooked is death."</p>
      <p>The same things I handle, I learned from you as my teacher; but the method varies, and I think the Antichrist should be attacked with common forces. But some things are harsher against the papists than to be printed in Zurich (Tiguri).</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would not want anything to be removed from that rigor. If it does not seem worthy to be published, it is the same to me.</p>
      <p>At your leisure, give it to Mr. Rudolf Collin (m. Rhodolpho Collino), your relative.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, as happily and as long as possible. Chur, June 15, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>Those who come from St. Gallen (S. Gallo) affirm for certain that they are sending soldiers to Lyon (Lugdunum).</p>
      <p>Vergerius has left.</p>
      <p>On the second day after his departure, letters from the prince arrived with money.</p>
      <p>He is thinking of returning, which I infer from the fact that he dictated letters to us, which we should write to him after his departure, which he could show to the prince, in which we would express our regret at his departure and recall him to Rhaetia, namely because Rhaetia could not do without him. We did not write.</p>
      <p>These things to you.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich (Tiguri).</p>
