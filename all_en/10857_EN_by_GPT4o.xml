    <p xml:id="regest1">The understanding of the sacrament that Burgauer outlined in his letter pleases Bullinger and also agrees with Zwingli's teachings; he is surprised that Burgauer doubts this agreement and therefore asks for clarification. He calms Burgauer's agitation, which was triggered by the earlier letter from the people of Zurich, and promises him friendship as soon as he has justified himself. He advises caution against the French machinations. Greetings to Erasmus [Ritter].</p>

      <p>To Benedikt Burgauer.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Your letters were pleasing to me, dearest Benedikt, both because they most abundantly testify to your love for me, which is not ordinary, and which I wish to reciprocate equally, and because you have freed me from fear. For if you have done and said what you say you have done and said, you have not sinned at all. You openly confess that sacraments without faith confer no grace. You do not wish to promote these elements for your own honor; as with Doctor Jerome, it is not water, but the spirit that cleanses the soul. Then you clearly feel that the pious receive both the thing and the sign, and that by the benefit of faith, the impious receive only the sign, and therefore it is not necessary for the sign and the thing signified to be joined among the saints, among whom the thing justifies, even if the sign is absent, provided it is not done out of contempt, and thus in the sacraments, the thing signified, faith, the word, and the institution, from which all authority of the sign comes, should be especially considered, for without them it is nothing. So far, you have satisfied me. You should continue to teach these things simply and purely. In the third point, I still desire something. For you write: "If I had Zwingli as an opponent in the conceived doctrine, I would wish to resist him more wisely." For if you have read Zwingli's writings, as I do not doubt, you have surely seen that this most learned and pious man felt the same about the sacraments as you do, and which I have just reviewed from your writings. I wonder, therefore, what doctrine you are speaking of, in which you would wish to resist him. Do you feel differently about the sacraments than Zwingli, or did he assert something different than you? Therefore, explain what doctrine you are speaking of, so that I may understand you more correctly.</p>
      <p>Finally, I implore you by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, not to allow the disturbance of your mind, stirred by our letter, to be further agitated by your emotions. There is no reason to renounce friendship with anyone or to suspect anyone badly because of this. If any seem to have sinned against you, imitate the example of the Lord and forgive. Certainly, I did not perceive these things from your people, but from others, and indeed from those who favored you. If I can obtain this from you, I will count you among my friends and will write more freely to you in the future, and I give you the power to write anything.</p>
      <p>I now add this: Beware of the cunning of the French! Look to the law, to the testimony, to Christ, to the gospel, not to any king. I do not say this because I doubt your faith, but because I see that something is being plotted.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve us. Greet our Erasmus [Ritter]. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 12, 1536.</p>
