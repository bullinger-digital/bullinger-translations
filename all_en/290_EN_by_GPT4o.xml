      <p>The man you see here in person (most learned Bullinger) is from our League, which is commonly called the League of the Ten Jurisdictions; he comes to you seeking help and advice in his matter (which he will narrate in person). When we inquired about the reason for his coming here, he began by saying he has a son whom he dedicated to the study of the liberal arts; he does not have the means to support him, furthermore indicating to us that the League itself would give letters of recommendation to the magistrate of Zürich, if it were possible, so that he might be received in Zürich into that number who are supported by sustenance. This good man, I say, implored me not to deny my assistance. Since I could rightfully do so, I wanted to send my letter to you, asking that you, who can greatly assist in this matter, do not withhold your hand from him. Moreover, he was the administrator of canonical affairs; when they realized he had become a Christian, they deprived him of all his estates; hence he was reduced to extreme poverty. Therefore, whatever kindness you bestow upon him will not be placed in an ungrateful position. We have no news of new events here or from Italy; if you have any, please, as is your custom, inform us. Farewell. Give my warmest regards to your most honorable wife and your entire family in my name.</p>
      <p>Given on the 2nd of October, in the year 1548. without name</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful and steadfast leader of the church of Zürich, and his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
