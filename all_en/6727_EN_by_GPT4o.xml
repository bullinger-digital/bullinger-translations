      <p>Dearly beloved son, I pray to God that He grants you constant health, and I urge you to also pray to God and keep to the diet. I thank you very kindly for the calf and the kid, and I will eat it with Heinrich and Josias in your name. In summary, I thank you both, I cannot say more now; another time I will repay it as best as I can.</p>
      <p>I am truly sorry that Mr. Balthasar has been separated from his children; otherwise, since he has been sick for a long time, God has done well for his person.</p>
      <p>I have written my advice to my gracious young lord Hans Peter, that they should soon petition my lord to let them follow the benefice of John the Baptist; meanwhile, they offer to provide for the church with the help of neighboring preachers, or they should appoint someone to serve without pay, as you have done, until St. John's Day, or appoint a candidate with his usual stipend, etc. I otherwise very much want to do the best I can and may. Should the godparents complain to me.</p>
      <p>At this time, I have no more to write. God be with you. Given in haste on March 16, 1566.</p>
      <p>Greet Susanna, Elsbeth, and Regula also from all of us. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>If we are ordered to come here, etc. To my dearly beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, preacher at Berg.</p>
