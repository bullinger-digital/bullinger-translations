      <p>My willing service and all good things before. Especially honorable sir and kind, dear brother, I have received your letter concerning Mr. Heliam Buchsern, understood its contents, and upon your recommendation, I wrote to the pastor in Bischofszell with the request to try him and to have him recommended; for I also know nothing but good about him. I knew his late father very well, he was a very honorable, upright man and my particularly beloved friend; therefore, I am inclined to this his son for the sake of the father, especially since you give him such a good testimony.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, know that there is some unrest in Basel among the preachers. May God turn it to good. Some servants want to believe that Sulcer wants to introduce Lutheranism along with Brencianism to them in the matter of the Lord's Supper.</p>
      <p>Sulcer says he remains with the Basel confession, etc. Our gracious lords of Zurich have sent an honorable council delegation to them in January and have admonished them to unity and adherence to our Swiss Confederation's confession, issued in 1566, to which they have kindly listened to the envoys and answered that they would give a written response. This has happened these days, and the friendly content is: one should neither mistrust them nor their preachers; for what serves the honor and preservation of our religion, that they want to do; however, they consider it unnecessary to think further about our confession, since they have let theirs go out years ago and several times since, etc. Beyond that, we hear nothing less than that the unrest among the servants persists; for it is said that in the small town of St. Joder, he was asked to accept some Saxon articles, which he does not want to do; yet this is a floating rumor. May God make it good. Last Sunday, when my dear son-in-law, the late Mr. Ulrich Zwingli, came to the pulpit and wanted to preach, he was struck by the good (which had also been mentioned here before), was carried home, and thereupon peacefully passed away in God in the afternoon. Otherwise, around here, there is the plague and headache, from which some are dying, and there is great distress, that God's hand is upon us. May He be gracious to us and give us recognition and improvement of our sinful life, etc. God be with you. Greet all my lords and good friends.</p>
      <p>Given in haste. February 15, 1571.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, faithful sir Johan Kessler, schoolmaster in St. Gallen, my kind sir and dear brother. St. Gallen.</p>
