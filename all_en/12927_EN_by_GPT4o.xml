    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas is glad to have learned from Bullinger's letter [not received] that his letter [HBBW XIX, No. 2840], about which he has heard nothing more, has arrived safely. Thanks to Bullinger for having so kindly received the Englishman [John Hooper] and his wife [Anne, née t’Serclaes], as he learned from a letter from the two.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Now Bullinger has the opportunity to converse with the learned and pious Teodosio Trebellio, who is heading to Italy. He is traveling through Zurich because he wishes to speak with Bullinger about religious and political matters. Certainly, Bullinger will enjoy the conversation with this intelligent and orthodox person.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] There is nothing new to report. The people of Zurich will have long heard of the death of King Francis I. Just now, Jacques de Bourgogne, sieur de Falais, recounted how he had been written from Strasbourg that Emperor Charles V was planning a visit there. What this mysterious man is up to, Enzinas does not understand! Trebellio will tell more.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The two Zurich students [Johannes Buchter and Markus Wüst], who delivered Bullinger's letter to him, will be able to count on his help as long as it benefits them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, among others, to Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, Doctor Konrad Gessner, and Johannes Fries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Enzinas has so far deliberately not written to Bibliander, as he did not want to disturb him with trivial letters during his important work. Since he heard nothing from him, he assumed that he was still entirely occupied with the work he had undertaken when Enzinas was in Zurich. If only he were already finished with it, so he could fully devote himself to his interrupted work again! He knows that he is dealing with an inconvenient creditor who does not tolerate any delay in repayments.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings. Bullinger should share any news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] Enzinas would have liked to spend Easter in Zurich. Perhaps this will be possible at Pentecost.</p>

      <p>S. D. It was pleasing to me to learn from your letters that the letters have been faithfully delivered to you, about which I had no certain information; more pleasing still that you have kindly received the Englishman with his wife, as they testify in their letters to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now you will confer with Lord Theodosio, a learned man and very devoted to true religion, who, like all good men, loves you greatly for your doctrine and piety. As he now has a journey to Italy planned, he wished to come to Zurich to meet you and discuss with you matters of common interest, both of the republic and indeed of religion. I do not doubt that his conversation will be very pleasing to you, as he is a man of understanding and sound judgment.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I do not know what new things to write. I suppose you have long since heard of the death of the King of France. At this hour, Lord Fallesius announced to me that the Emperor is soon to come to Strasbourg, as is written from the same city. What this mysterious mind is planning, I do not quite grasp. You will learn the rest from Lord Theodosio.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>To the young students who brought me your letters, I have offered my services courteously and will not fail them in any matter which I think pertains to their benefit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Greet on my behalf all the brothers, Lord Father Pellicanus, Lord Theodor, Gwalther, Doctor Gesner, Frisius, and the others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have deliberately refrained from interrupting Lord Theodor so far, whom I knew to be occupied with more serious matters than to have time to read trivial letters, and because I understand nothing certain from him, I assume he is still wholly engaged in completing what he had begun when I was there. If only he were already finished with this labor and could devote himself entirely to the work he had set aside. He should know he is dealing with a difficult creditor who will not extend the debt beyond the prescribed time and will accuse him of breach of faith unless he fulfills the promise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell with the whole church, and if you have anything, share it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Basel, 10 April 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>I would have gladly been with you for this Easter festival, if it had been possible; but what I could not do now, I will accomplish, God willing, at the Pentecost festival.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
