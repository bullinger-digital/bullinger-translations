      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, my willing service to you at all times, etc. First of all, know that your letter along with the little calendar booklet has been well received; I thank you very much and ask that I may earn such and other things.</p>
      <p>I am otherwise much obliged to you; this package has arrived late for me, in which I believe you have a copy of the instructions that the electors and princes have sent to the royal majesty in France; it is a fine writing. If you do not have it, let me know; I will send you a copy. I have nothing more to say; since I found the messenger as he was about to leave, he delayed it by so much. May God preserve you with His holy gifts, amen, for the good of all Christendom. In great haste. Your willing servant Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly and well-learned sir Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, faithful servant of the Christian church, my honored, beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
