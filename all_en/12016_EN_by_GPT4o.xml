    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes briefly due to time constraints that he entrusted Bullinger's and his letter [to Martin Hentius in Kronstadt] to the reliable Oporin, and thanks for the book translated by his former student Diethelm [Keller]. The news about the Bishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] comes from a letter [from a third party to] Wolfgang [Wissenburg]; enclosed [the decision] on the religious peace with a request for return. News about wounded Spaniards from the imperial camp, who stayed overnight in Basel; regarding the report of an envoy [Alfonso Bonaccioli] - probably of the Duke [Ercole II d'Este] of Ferrara - about Emperor [Charles V], who is staying in the city of Saint-Dizier, which was not conquered but handed over to him, and wants to go to Ch창lons, but the way there is blocked; any peace offers would not be unwelcome to the Emperor. In Zabern, a new army is being mustered, allegedly against the Duke of Guise [Claude I of Lorraine], and people are in mortal fear due to lack of provisions and money. Moreover, an army directed against the Bishop of M체nster, which dispersed shortly thereafter and then regrouped in occupied villages, robbed all food, but could be driven away by the peasants elsewhere. In Italy, it is said that the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I] was defeated by the Persian [Shah Tahmasp I] with a loss of 50,000 men. If Theodor [Bibliander] does not yet know: [Guillaume] Postel has become a Jesuit in Rome and is learning Indian, in order to preach there one day; eight cities are said to have been converted by such monks.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The brevity of time compels me to write briefly. I have entrusted your letters and mine to Oporin. There is no doubt they are well entrusted. I give you immense thanks for the booklet. I am pleased that Diethelm (whom I educated from the alphabet) has progressed to the point where he can provide such a specimen.</p>
      <p>What I wrote about the Bishop of Cologne comes from the letters of Mr. Wolfgang. Regarding the religious peace which I am sending, please return it after you have used it sufficiently.</p>
      <p>The rest is as follows: Spaniards, wounded in the head and otherwise, have spent the night here, coming directly from the Emperor's camp. They say that in three assaults on the town of Saint-Dizier, sixteen hundred Spaniards were lost. The next night, an envoy of the Duke, I believe of Ferrara, was here, who said that the Emperor is now in the said town, not indeed conquered, but surrendered under not unjust conditions to the enemy. It is uncertain where he will go; he intends to proceed to Ch창lons, but the roads are so blocked and obstructed that he fears danger, for he cannot pass without harassment from the enemy; he fears, however, that he may be inferior to the enemy if he attempts anything. There is a town belonging to the Emperor not far removed, which he is considering whether to divert to and remain there for the winter. The envoy thinks that if anyone were to bring news of peace, the Emperor would not be unwilling to listen. A new army is being selected. The number is again large. A muster will be held at the Feast of Mary near Zabern. People are madly rushing to certain death; such is the scarcity of food, drink, and money. They say it is being prepared against the Lord of Guise, who has been devastating the Emperor's supplies until now.</p>
      <p>Besides this, the army that was prepared against the Bishop of M체nster and shortly thereafter dispersed, has been gathered again, occupying several villages of an unknown region, consuming whatever food and drink there was. Then, while attempting to occupy another place, the peasants in arms drove them out, killed them, and put them to flight.</p>
      <p>Thus now the Bishop and the wretched peasants are freed. It is reported from Italy that the Turk has been struck by the Persian and some other king; he has lost more than 50,000 men, and this is the reason why he is so inactive in Hungary today.</p>
      <p>Tell Mr. Theodor, if he is unaware, that Postel has become a monk of the Jesuit order in Rome. He is learning the Indian language so that he may one day preach Christ there. He says that eight cities in India have been converted to Christ by such monks. I have nothing more now.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 3, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, friend and lord in Christ.</p>
