    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer thanks for Bullinger's [Letter No. 2842] and apologizes for writing so briefly! He must now preach. Additionally, several letters had to be written to be sent with a preacher [Stephan Sch채ffer?] who arrived yesterday from Esslingen and is moving on today. They are looking for a successor for the pastor Jakob Otter, who passed away in Esslingen. Esslingen must pay a fine of 40,000 florins to [Emperor Charles V], and Reutlingen 20,000 florins.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Only now does Blarer learn from Konrad Zwick that since yesterday the Zurich councilor Georg M체ller is in Konstanz. Blarer has just sent the Zurich marriage laws, which were sent by Bullinger, with Zwick. Georg M체ller will bring them back.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blessing wish. Request for prayer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S:] More soon. There is nothing certain about Landgrave Philip of Hesse. The news of the defeat of Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach is confirmed by many testimonies. Greetings.</p>

      <p>For God's sake, please excuse me, because I truly, truly cannot write. Thank you for your faithful diligence. I must now preach. A preacher from Esslingen arrived yesterday. He will leave now; with him, I also have to write many letters. The good Jakob Otter has passed away. They would have gladly sent another. I don't know where to find one! Esslingen must pay 40,000 florins; Reutlingen 20,000 florins.</p>

      <p>Yesterday evening, I did not know that Mr. Georg M체ller is here. Now my cousin Konrad Zwick tells me. I have given him your marriage laws so that he can return them, so that Mr. Georg can bring them back to you.</p>

      <p>We are entrusted to God in time and eternity along with all yours. We ask with heart and faith for us, that we may be kept in grace. Dated in great haste, March 15, 1547.</p>

      <p>With the next message, I will write more. We have nothing certain about Landgrave Philip of Hesse, but the news that Margrave Albrecht has killed and lost so many people is true from many sources. God be with you.</p>
