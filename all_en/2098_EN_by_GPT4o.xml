      <p>S. D. I send you, most esteemed lord and godfather, our response given to the people of Geneva in the case of Servetus, along with excerpts from the books and writings of the same Servetus, as we reported them to our senate. If you wish to inspect these, you may ensure they are copied; if not, please return the original to me. I also send you a copy of the response from Basel and thank you for sharing it.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new, except that there are many and varied reports about Vercelli being captured by the French; some say the city was only plundered by the French and then abandoned, others claim it is still held by them; I have not yet learned anything certain. Today, merchants coming from Lyon reported to me that many peasants in Picardy were slaughtered by the Imperial forces, whose labor the king was using to repair Hedin. Thus, the most cruel tyrants alternately conquer and are conquered. We have nothing from Germany. However, they say the tumult between the Bishop of Augsburg and Baumgartner has been settled again. As for the Christians residing in the Italian prefectures of the Swiss, I hope our people will not fail to assist them and I will urge them strongly to do their duty. Our magistrate is currently in a dispute with the people of Fribourg over certain dominions of the County of Gruyères. A meeting will be held in Payerne on the next Sunday, where something will be decided about this controversy. The people of Fribourg were about to seize some forts by force; but our people, anticipating them, kept them at home until it is decided by law to whom they should yield. I fear that what once happened to the people of Zürich with the people of Schwyz may happen to these cities; for the people of Fribourg are very fierce, relying on the support of our cantons.</p>
      <p>From England, Francis Molineux, otherwise a Frenchman by nation, has come to us; he reports deplorable things about the state of that kingdom. He says Peter Martyr is in Strasbourg, and that three ships loaded with exiles have crossed to Denmark, and that the King of Denmark has granted them hospitality and churches in his kingdom. He reports about Mr. a Lasco that he wanted to leave on the same day he was departing, but was summoned to the queen, so he cannot know what is happening with him. The bishops of Canterbury, Gloucester, London, and Exeter are in chains, the Duke of Northumberland has been captured and beheaded, the Bishop of Winchester has been appointed Lord Chancellor and President of Parliament, and there is miserable confusion throughout the kingdom. But I do not doubt that you have more certain information about these things. Nevertheless, I wanted to write these things to testify to my loyalty to you. Farewell. All of ours greet you; greet your wife and your entire family in my name, along with the most esteemed lords, brothers, and fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 5, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I sent the bundle of letters you sent to Biel as soon as I received it.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, his lord and most esteemed godfather.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
