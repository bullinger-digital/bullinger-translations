      <p>Most esteemed father, I have received all your letters along with three copies of your most useful new work, for which Mr. Consul, Mr. Campellus, and I offer you our eternal thanks; if only the opportunity to repay you would present itself, which we will seize wherever we can. You will learn from Mr. Haller's letters what is happening in the Gantner case. I have never called that most arrogant man either a thief or a heretic, although he deserved both; I only drew a comparison to a thief and said that Gantner was caught in errors as surely as if a thief were caught red-handed. Hence, he and his malicious friends have accused me of calling him a thief. I have refuted this accusation, or rather this slander, before certain lords so effectively that they easily saw they could do nothing against me. I did, however, once call Gantner a patron and defender of heretics, which seemed less offensive to these belligerent men than if I had affirmed him to be a heretic himself. They are now afflicting our most pious Mr. Consul and the most innocent one. Pontisella, a fickle reed, does not know by what means to open the doors to ministry for his Gantner; he has allied himself more closely with certain people than befits a steadfast man; but you know what I have always desired from the beginning in this man.</p>
      <p>There is a persistent rumor that the signs of the peasants will return; it is said that the communities of the Rhaetian Valley have already agreed, and the people of Pr√§ttigau and Suprasaxony are said to be armed.</p>
      <p>They especially want to capture that great Peter and punish the envoys who do not properly execute the decrees of the communities. But due to corruption, they decide differently.</p>
      <p>Some want the treaty to be null and void, and I would have preferred that the purgatorial letters of the Zurichers had not arrived at this time; if they are spread, they will give many an opportunity to riot more fervently; if they are concealed, it creates danger for this city, as if the Helvetian evangelicals had suppressed purgations. But these letters are prudently written, to be communicated only to the rest if necessary, if it is free of danger. I have privately advised some not to spread these without wise deliberation and serious judgment. Your pagans could also become more bitter towards you for this reason. But may the Lord's will be done! If the signs return, as they are now said to be ready and not without a leader, although it is a rumor, it will create great danger for this city. There are those who think the approaching ones should be received as enemies, and perhaps those who have seared consciences. But what is a flea in the bite of Hercules? to invert the proverb. Should the innocent bear and experience the punishment of the guilty?</p>
      <p>I judge it more prudent to treat friends and allies amicably, and if there are those who have deserved to be punished, they should show themselves teachable in such a quantity.</p>
      <p>But I eagerly await your advice in this case, and if our people want to act hostilely, what should the ministers do to assert and preserve their sheep.</p>
      <p>I fear a great ruin, which our sins have deserved. By God's grace, I have conducted myself so far that no honest person, having been taught many times, could say I was the instigator of future disturbances. I neither advised nor dissuaded the treaty, made no mention of the envoys, and never brought up the Rhaetian cause since it was fervent.</p>
      <p>I only spoke against the diabolical arts and the most corrupt coins, by which the common people are miserably deceived, which you saw in that digression of my sermon, which I have not yet received. Therefore, relying on my conscience, and because I join no party nor add oil to the fire, I hope that the most good and great God will look upon me and my family most mercifully; but if in such great snares, to which I am exposed, in such great disturbances, which are at the door, in such great wickedness of this world, which has grown everywhere, something human should be endured or I should be circumvented by clandestine arts or finally completely oppressed, I humbly ask your most holy magistrate and you, my most merciful fathers, to always have paternal care and consideration for my children and my most honorable wife.</p>
      <p>I believe that in such disturbances, faithful ministers experience the cross and persecution, even if other causes are pretended. Many think and proclaim that we are the authors of all the evils of this world; hence, some arm themselves against us without conscience, intercept travelers, attack with bullets, etc. May the most good and great God be present with us with His grace. He can confound the plans of the wicked and gloriously protect His own even beyond the course of nature. Let us invoke Him with one accord, as if with a single impulse, to mitigate His wrath; to rescue and defend His church, to comfort and strengthen it for the eternal glory of His name, and may the immortal light of His radiance shine forever!</p>
      <p>Mr. Camp[ellus] and Mr. Consul send their greetings to you. Most quickly. Chur, February 25, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Th[obias] Ic[onius]. If someone did to one of your mayors as Gantner did to ours, they would be thrown through the blades.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich, to the pastor at the Great Minster.</p>
