      <p>Greetings. Just now, as night falls, I receive your letter, most honorable lord and dearest brother, in which you inform me of what is requested of us. We have read the letters of our dearest brother Beza, and what he asks of me, I have already addressed, to which I have devoted this entire day. I am writing to Basel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, and to the Rhaetians; I urge them to oppose the royal demands, that is, the request for troops by the Guises, and I share with them all the information I have received that should be shared. Theobald von Erlach has not come here from Bern.</p>
      <p>However, the Bernese magistrate has written to the most honorable council of this city; they are sharing their plans with each other, and I am quite certain that they agree to obstruct Frölich's plan. He is in a hurry and desires to bring troops to the Guises and the conspirators.</p>
      <p>Today, public prayers have been decreed in the council for all churches in the city and countryside; the day after tomorrow, a very serious edict will be promulgated throughout the entire dominion against those who wish to enlist in the military; recruiters are ordered to be brought to the city in chains. I hope a delegation will be sent to France promptly.</p>
      <p>If our neighboring allies continue to send an army, I fear a war will break out among ourselves; I see our people are anxious and diligent. After the assembly in Solothurn, which is to be held on April 26, our people will respond to the most illustrious Prince of Condé; I believe the Bernese will do the same. I wish the princes would hurry before the Belgians, Savoyards, and Spaniards arrive; I wish they would free the king, etc.! I cannot write more; for I am writing this late at night, having been exhausted from writing all last night and throughout this day. Let us pray to the Lord, that He may have mercy on us and protect us from evil.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, most honorable lord and dearest brother, together with all your fellow ministers. April 23, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Do not doubt our faith and diligence.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant increase!</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the church in Geneva, most honorable lord and dearest brother. [Geneva]</p>
