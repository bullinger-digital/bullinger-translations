    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds from memory to Bullinger's letter [No. 719], which he passed on to Bucer. No room should be given to discord; Capito has always maintained the friendship with Zwingli, established even before Luther's emergence, despite temporary differences of opinion. The people of Strasbourg, in view of the upcoming council, have made commitments to their religious allies regarding the agreement or at least the willingness to engage in dialogue [of the Swiss]. Contrary to Bullinger's fears, there is no intention of making concessions to the papacy. The book by an English bishop [Stephen Gardiner] against the rule of Rome over the church ["De vera obedientia ratio"] demonstrates the evangelical disposition of the king [Henry VIII]; the [Schmalkaldic League] have declared their agreement with the latter in rejecting the papal autocracy, and Bucer has also clarified his stance on this issue in the preface [to the mentioned book]. The dissemination of a letter from Bullinger by Bucer was done with friendly intent and for the benefit of the [Swiss] churches. Capito is surprised that, contrary to previous statements, letters from the people of Strasbourg to Zwingli still exist. He has already heard in Basel about the plans of the Solothurn ["bandits"], which Bullinger now also writes to him about, and has tried to dissuade them. During their stay in the territory of Count Wilhelm [of FÃ¼rstenberg], they had a defense pamphlet printed in Augsburg; with their criticism of the stance of Zurich and other Protestants, they have found an audience with some. Since none of them are currently in Strasbourg, Capito could not urge them to approach the council; such a step might prevent a violent action, which an unnamed powerful figure seems to support. He is concerned that the Genevans are now even willing to accept help from the French king; the [Schmalkaldic League] do not trust his professions of friendship but do not want to reject him in light of the threat from the emperor and the pope. He emphasizes once again the necessity of an early meeting.</p>

      <p>Greetings. As I was about to respond to your letter, it was not in my hands, and Bucer denies having it at his home, even though I sent it to him to read and have not seen it since. However, I will respond as best as my memory allows from what I read briefly.</p>
      <p>First, it is most pleasing that you finally write back, even if you do not respond to my letters. Let us not give place to Satan, who always seeks to sow discord among brothers! I believe you will not allow us to ever be divided. For before Luther emerged into the light, Zwingli and I communicated with each other about deposing the pope, even while he was still living in the hermitage. For both of us, through Erasmus's acquaintance and the reading of good authors, were developing some kind of judgment. That friendship has stood without interruption to this day. For I honor the deceased with no less service than I once did the living. Only a small disagreement intervened, because I did not agree with what brought us the last disaster, indeed I somewhat opposed it, for which reason I was considered by some among the Anabaptists. But he, being most prudent, wrote cautious letters to me, so that I would not entirely let go of the reins, infected by wrong opinions, if a literary frenzy were applied to one running poorly. Finally, although late, he acknowledged that my foresight or fear was not for nothing.</p>
      <p>Now the papal council is approaching, which our people reject for themselves, to whom we have pledged our faith at our own peril, and we are not yet regretting that you have been and are still in harmony with us. But if in any matter we have not yet agreed in all things, it can either be accomplished through dialogue or at least more fully understood what the difference is. We promised this to the brothers. And yet it moves us to either agree completely or from the discussion to arise something that we could plausibly argue why we have not agreed at this time. For we regard you and your churches with the sincerest mind even in private actions.</p>
      <p>As for what you write in your letters to me about concord with the papists, I assure you to be of a secure mind. For we have not yet come to such madness that it would come to mind that any hope of concord remains with that most confused monster. Nor indeed have we been so rudely tossed about in matters that we would not know what we can give and what they can receive.</p>
      <p>The King of England professes our gospel. One of his bishops wrote in the Roman vicarage that each magistrate is the head of his church on earth: the booklet exists. Then he asked our princes and cities not to consent in any way to the monarchy of the Roman bishop. They promised otherwise they would give nothing at all, whatever the council of Philip may propose. For Bucer has abundantly proved to the candid reader that he would concede nothing to those monsters, but had regard for our office, which we must, as much as possible, defend our cause with the most equitable laws. Therefore, he gives whatever seemed to be given, in his own name and privately.</p>
      <p>Regarding your letters to Bucer: He published them with the most friendly mind, to prove that you feel what you indeed feel, and so that the enemies would find no opportunity to harass your churches beyond others.</p>
      <p>Regarding the letters to Zwingli from our people, I am surprised they still exist. I was present, I dealt with the widow and with some friends. Then they answered most steadfastly that no letter remained, but were destroyed by fire. For I was most urgently demanding mine, because I feared, as the times were then, lest anything from them would further provoke the victors if they were published.</p>
      <p>As for what you add at the end about the exiles from Solothurn, I have previously taken care of it diligently. First, while staying in Basel, I heard there were four who were attempting such a thing. I strongly dissuaded them; with what arguments, you can easily guess. Then, when they passed through here in November, I gravely admonished two of them about how dangerous a web they were weaving, etc. I found them not mute; for they were rashly alleging letters, public defenses, transactions, pacts, and repacts as having been rescinded by some, and that the indignity did not pertain to them alone, but the danger to them alone. Meanwhile, while they were acting in the domain of Count Wilhelm, they showed a defense pamphlet printed in Augsburg, as they said. I think they scattered three or four copies here; for they are still circulating among some. Some wonder how it happened that the Zurichers, authors of the last pact, now consider those who appeal to that transaction as enemies. We here have promised the farmers most generously, and there is no doubt that our senate would have helped the wretched with all its might if they had stood by the agreements and pacts. Then they do not understand how the evangelicals consider those who demand the free preaching of the gospel as enemies from the agreement. We, however, understand well enough. For either the pamphlet is vain, or what was done by some is attributed to the whole senate. Indeed, other conjectures would also occur. But these things are nothing to us. For they are empty words, they will expire by themselves. I, having received your letters, have searched whether any of them are here now; for they often come here. But none are present, if my people have been diligent enough. I would have acted again and urged with all my might that they invoke our senate, so that they would not dare to undertake anything by hand after an action initiated before such a magistrate. For a certain powerful man gave them refuge with him. This Caspar Hedio and I know; for we heard it from his mouth while dealing with something else in person. I do not name the man, lest I be involved in danger at the same time. I am not born for arms, my vocation is also different, but I write this to you as a friend. Moreover, the same promised that he would soon arrange for them to live not so far from Solothurn and to conduct their cause. This matter would exacerbate that evil. For now, as I hear, they have not yet caused harm to anyone, and therefore hope and access to concord are easier. They are very rigid, but in the course of action, I hope, they would easily become gentle. Furthermore, I believe our senate has responded most appropriately to yours.</p>
      <p>Ah, how it pains me that Farel and the church of Geneva are in such great danger! A rumor is spread here by merchants that the Frenchman has promised them aid. A harsh remedy indeed, which they would not have accepted without doubt unless their affairs were utterly desperate. How will he protect the gospel for them, who persecutes the same so harshly among his own! Although now the Frenchman has offered friendship to our princes and republics through a legate and pretends to want to hear the sum of our religion from his learned men present, from which he does not so greatly differ. They trust the Englishman, as they were easily persuaded by the arguments contained in the booklet sent by Bedrottus. But they do not similarly trust the Frenchman, and yet they do not spurn the offered friendship, since the emperor and the pope urge the council and threaten the worst.</p>
      <p>I wrote the rest in previous letters. If you wrote anything further, I think it pertains entirely to this matter, that it may be allowed to decline the colloquy with friendship intact. I truly feel what I wrote above publicly, but most of all it is in your interest that we quickly and freely converse among ourselves. Commend me to the brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>January 17, 1536.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Capito.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, a brother to be respected in the Lord. [Zurich]</p>
