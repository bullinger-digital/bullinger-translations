      <p>Greetings. I send back to you, most esteemed lord and godfather, through the same messenger by whom I received from you, those Augsburg news.</p>
      <p>I will keep the rest until another messenger comes to me. For today, everything cannot be written down. However, tomorrow he leaves in the morning, and besides tomorrow's sermon, in which, God willing, I will begin the evangelical history according to Luke after finishing the Acts of the Apostles, many other tasks also press upon me.</p>
      <p>Today I also wrote to Mr. Calvin, and sent to him what Vergerius wrote about Mutius. For they are worthy to be known by all. Vergerius had written the same to me in the same words. Nevertheless, I thank you for your singular and most vigilant diligence: especially for the edict of the lords of Zürich sent to me. When ours has been copied, I will also send it to you. It does not encompass as much as yours, as you will see. The people of Lausanne found a scruple in it, on account of which they will again cause a tumult unless it is prevented. For those who blaspheme are ordered to kiss a cross marked on the ground with their fingers, as a sign of sin and displeasure. And this ceremony is not newly invented, but has lasted up to now under Berchtold without superstition, as far as I know. But they, being most superstitious, accuse us here of some superstition. I think it will have to be granted to them for the sake of peace, that in the French version, which has not yet been published, it be changed. The people of Geneva on the Lord's birthday ordered each of their citizens to work, thus wishing to testify their freedom in Christ, not without great offense to our people and also to many good people, who know that such freedom should be enclosed within the limits of charity and edification.</p>
      <p>Various rumors were spread here. I wrote to Viret to inform me of the cause and origin. Behold, while I write to him, Calvin himself writes to me about this matter, which I send here: which, when you have read, you will return. The plague is growing stronger in Lausanne, and especially has invaded the house where Jacob Bindschedler was lodging. Hence it was customary for the miserable people, that it was not allowed for him and at the same time for all others who were staying in the same lodging, to attend lectures for a space of six weeks nor to go out in public without a white staff as a sign of contagion. Therefore, after the maid died, the servant was also seized, and by Viret's advice, he left there with his fellow lodgers and returned here to me, intending to go back there again after the end of the six weeks. You will see that he did this by Viret's advice from his letters to me, which I send to you at Bindschedler's request. Meanwhile, while he is here, Tobler writes that the lord and lady, with whom Bindschedler had stayed, are also ill and that it is spreading in other houses as well, some are fleeing. But you will understand this more fully from Maler's letters, which he also sends to you there. The plague has ceased with the Lord's grace for some time among us; but in these days again a certain student from the college has been seized, although there is still good hope for his life. Thus we are in the hand of the Lord, so that, when we think ourselves most secure, He again arouses us to vigilance and prayers. Here you also have letters directed to Blaurer, which I beg you to send to him. Various things are also said here about that new Cimbrian army.</p>
      <p>Whatever it may be, I see nothing but crosses remain for us. Therefore, I do not wish to place any hope in any human aid anymore. Nevertheless, I thank the Lord and congratulate His people, for whose sake He is accustomed to raise up such unexpected means, and I pray from the heart, that He may preserve those who endure such great dangers for the glory of Christ. Amen. Convey many greetings from me and mine to your wife and family. January 13, 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, his lord and venerable godfather.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
