    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not know if Bullinger received Sebastian [Meyer's] commentary on the Apocalypse, which Rümlang sent to him for review; he himself is suspected of disloyalty by Meyer due to his dissatisfaction with Luther's writings and his criticism of Bucer, and now has to return the book. Hopes that the people of Zurich will publish a defense of their doctrine; intends to report orally soon on what the people of Bern think about it. Greetings. Asks to comfort the city clerk [Cyro], who was denounced by Meyer in connection with the doctrine of the sacraments. Luther's [Schmalkaldic] Articles have been submitted to the pastors for evaluation; he dislikes that the altar sacrament is spoken of in tropes.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You know, most learned Bullinger, what I have discussed with you about Sebastian's Apocalypse and that I also sent it to be reviewed by Quirinus; but you have not responded at all, so I have often doubted whether it was delivered to you. Quirinus asserted, when I inquired about it from him, that he delivered it in good faith. Meanwhile, since you have not written anything, Sebastian suspected it was intercepted and has often discussed it with me. But because we have not agreed so well recently on Luther's writings, which do not satisfy me much and I expect much clearer and more complete ones, he almost does not hide certain animosities, by which I am not at all disturbed; he has no occasion. I openly say that I was deceived by Bucer, as I thought and believed that Luther had conceded something; but his letters do not report this. Moreover, he recently took the opportunity to complain to me about the Apocalypse and almost accused me of treachery; he also demanded the book back. Therefore, I ask that you send it to me through a reliable messenger as soon as possible and at my expense, so that the book may be returned to him, and he cannot complain about me.</p>
      <p>I would gladly write more if business allowed leisure. I ask that you write what you are contemplating. I wish the apology to be published so that your opinion may be known to all. But I have decided that I will soon go to Zurich and present our plan in person.</p>
      <p>Our city clerk, my most faithful brother and friend, Erasmus, and I especially, send you many greetings. I wish you would write to our city clerk and console him over the affliction he recently had with Sebastian concerning the sacramental truth in front of the more private ones, where he was attacked in many ways, and do not hide, if you write, that you did this at my urging. We are very united and of the same mind. It would be most pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>I ask that you keep what I write secret and hidden, so that I do not seem to be divulging secrets; otherwise, it would be hardly safe to write.</p>
      <p>Farewell greatly and greet Theodor a thousand times in my name. The booklet of Luther's articles, which he prepared for the Mantuan council, has been given to our churchmen to judge, and I am displeased with what is said about the sacrament of the altar without any resolved trope. I await what they think about it, and I will write. Consider it kindly.</p>
      <p>In haste. Given in Bern, at the fair of Lucia in the year 1538. Yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and respectable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant and foremost churchman of Zurich, his not at all ordinary lord and friend.</p>
