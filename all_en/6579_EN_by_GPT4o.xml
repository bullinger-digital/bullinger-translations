      <p>Greetings. I received the wine through your relative Theodor and I give your kindness the greatest thanks for this, which I will repay if I live. I am very surprised why I receive nothing from you, which I am eagerly expecting.</p>
      <p>I am now in mourning and not slight sorrow: after the death of Gwalther's wife, soon my beloved Elisabeth fell ill and on the third day she happily entrusted her spirit to God; she was the wife of Mr. Simler.</p>
      <p>Now my daughter Anna, the wife of Zwingli, is also at death's door, in whose house I am writing this. What God has decided about me and my other family members, He knows; I am prepared.</p>
      <p>If I depart from here, I ask you to ensure that my children receive the money from SÃ¼leri, which is owed, etc. Farewell forever, most esteemed brother in Christ; my grief does not allow me to write more now.</p>
      <p>Because I am human, I console myself in the meantime with the promises of Christ, and that my daughters expire in the sincere confession and invocation of Christ.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for us. November 23, 1565.</p>
      <p>Lavater and Zwingli, who are attending the dying, greet you. Greet Mr. Consul and friends.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
