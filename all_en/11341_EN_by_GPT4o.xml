    <p xml:id="regest1">Impatiently awaits a letter. Since Konrad [Gessner] is staying in [Leukerbad] and [Béat] Comte is rarely at home due to his medical practice, he has temporarily moved to Claude Chanisieu's boarding school in Morges at his invitation, where he continues to learn French, among other things. Urgently needs three crowns to buy necessities for the winter; what he is owed by Oporin [for the Pollux translation] will not be received before Christmas. According to rumors, Emperor [Charles V] has married Mary [Tudor], the daughter of [Henry VIII], and is inclined towards the Gospel; in France, troops are gathering against the English king, who is allegedly already invading France. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You cannot believe with what hope and expectation, most revered father, I long for your letters. For upon receiving them, I hope both my situation will be happier and my peace of mind more secure.</p>
      <p>As for the state of my affairs, you should know that it is quite fortunate. Our Conrad [Gessner] has gone with his wife to the baths at Leukerbad, and my lord, Count [Béat], is rarely at home due to his medical practice, which he exercises, so I have temporarily moved to Morges, two hours' journey from Lausanne; for Claude Chanisieu, a very learned man and known to me familiarly in Basel and Strasbourg, has compelled me with his prayers.</p>
      <p>He has a school there, or rather a college, not unlike our monastery's chaplaincy. A few young students are supported there, partly by their own means, partly by the stipend from Bern. Among them, I am treated very well. I have fellow scholars who are learned men and especially benevolent to me. The study of the French language is progressing successfully along with other studies.</p>
      <p>But I earnestly ask you, most esteemed father, to send me three crowns as soon as you can through the abundance of messengers, so that I can purchase wood and other necessities for the winter, for I expect nothing from Oporin before the feast of the Nativity; then, however, I hope to receive enough to cover the expenses incurred in the meantime. This is the only thing I now request from you, and I promise not to ask for anything else for the whole year; but now I cannot do without it any longer, so I ask that, if messengers are lacking, you send it to Bern or Basel to Otto, so that it may be forwarded to me from there.</p>
      <p>The rumors about the war are varied here. It is said that the Emperor [Charles V] has married Mary [Tudor], the daughter of [Henry VIII], and has inclined his mind towards the Gospel, which seems scarcely credible to me. In France, soldiers are gathering against the King of England, as most suspect. Some say the Englishman has crossed into France with an army. However, nothing certain is reported.</p>
      <p>Please convey my most familiar greetings to your wife and mother, along with all your children. Farewell, dearest father, and always keep me commended to you.</p>
      <p>In Morges, 17th day before the calends of September 1539.</p>
      <p>Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered father.</p>
