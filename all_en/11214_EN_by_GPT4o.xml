    <p xml:id="regest1">Bonifacius Amerbach has asked him to recommend a talented boy [Heinrich Hindermann], whom he has supported so far, to Bullinger, so that he can be educated in his hometown of Zurich; after the remarriage of his stepfather [Peter Kriesi], he can no longer stay in Basel. Myconius requests to forward Luther's commentary on Psalms 51 and 130 as well as Johannes Sturm's writing on the establishment of schools to St. Gallen [to Vadian]. The Elector of Mainz [Albrecht of Brandenburg], Duke George of Saxony, and another prince are said to have asked the Pope through an embassy for the release of the lay chalice and priestly marriage.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Today, Doctor Bonifacius Amerbach came to me; he recommended this boy, whom he transferred from the tailoring trade to letters a year ago due to his noble intellect and even supported at his own expense, so that I might recommend him to you, if there is any way you can keep him in his studies. He has received very commendable praise from his teachers, so there is hope that he will be of use someday.</p>
      <p>He is from Zurich, as you will hear from him, and his mother recently died here, and his stepfather has married another woman, so there is no longer a place for the boy with him. However, the expenses exceed Amerbach's means, so he asks through me that you, through your lords, assist this promising intellect if possible. Since the boy is talented and there is a need for learned and good men in the future, I also ask that you willingly do what you can for this boy.</p>
      <p>I beseech you to send the package you see to St. Gallen; it contains, do not doubt, Luther's commentary on Psalm 51 and 130, and then Johannes Sturm's work on the establishment of literary schools.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that the Elector of Mainz, Duke George of Saxony, and another prince have sent an embassy to Rome, asking the Pope to allow these two articles: that the people may communicate under both kinds and that marriage be permitted to priests; otherwise, they say they cannot keep their people in obedience. Consider what will happen if the embassy is confirmed.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 9, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most learned Antistes of Zurich, his venerable lord in the Lord.</p>
