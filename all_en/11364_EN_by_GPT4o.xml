    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for only now responding to his two letters [No. 1310 and No. 1313], and encourages him to persevere despite hostilities. [King Francis I] of France persecutes Christ, and [Henry VIII] of England scorns the [evangelical] knowledge. During the capture of Castelnuovo by [Khayr al-Din] Barbarossa and a Turkish advance on Valeria, the Christians suffered great losses, while the princes simultaneously lead a carefree life and are occupied with reinstating the Antichrist in Germany; the devil should take them along with their pope. Contrary to a rumor that reached Froschauer [in Basel], Bullinger and Megander are of one heart and soul. Adam Frey is staying at the inn "Rothus"; the council will decide on the matter concerning him and his wife [Agathe Studler]. Myconius should deliver the letter to [Hans] Vogler to the steward of the Steinen Monastery, [Felix] Eiermann. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have sinned, my dearest Myconius, for not having written anything to you for such a long time. In the meantime, I have received two letters from you, which were very welcome to me. Believe me, what comes from you is dear to me. Therefore, I am all the more grieved when I hear that things are being imposed on you and yours that you would not want. I truly grieve and more than grieve that Satan has been sent upon you. May the Lord soon place him under your feet. In the meantime, I believe we must fight against him with constancy and fervent prayers to God. The Lord will not fail you, believe me, who has always resisted the proud and given grace to the humble. Therefore, be of strong spirit. For the more insolently the foolish exult and boast of victory and consider themselves secure, the closer they come to the goal where they will stumble.</p>
      <p>I would never advise that Basel be abandoned because of certain wolves; rather, I believe it should be clearly stated that you do not wish to yield to anyone, so that they do not conceive any hope and become even more insane.</p>
      <p>The kings do what they have always done. The French king persecutes Christ. The English king rejects the known truth. The Lord will soon reject both. Barbarossa has occupied and taken back Castelnuovo, a port near Ragusa on the Dalmatian coast, with 6000 Spanish soldiers and several thousand Italians killed, etc. Furthermore, Turkish leaders have made an incursion into Valeria not far from Betonion and have taken away several thousand Christians, with many killed and trampled. Thus, indeed, that beast is allowed to revel in Christian blood, while in the meantime our princes play, revel, dance, and consult on how to expel Christ from Germany and reinstate the Antichrist, so that they may fully (completely) smell the air and not only kiss the feet. May the devil take them along with their pope!</p>
      <p>Froschauer informed me that some rumor has been spread among you about a disagreement between Megander and me. Know that this is completely false. We all agree well, we have one mind and one voice, one heart and one love (thanks to God).</p>
      <p>Phrygio is staying at the inn with the sign of the red house. The council will decide on the matter concerning him and his wife. More on that later.</p>
      <p>You will give the letter written to Vogler to the steward at Steinen, Eyerman. You will greet Lord Grynaeus from me most diligently. October 25, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother.</p>
