      <p> Greetings. I received the gift sent to my wife, most esteemed man in every way, and I am amazed at the benevolence of the most gracious council, since there are no benefits from me that would cause them to love me so much. However, I will try in every way to conduct myself so that they will never regret their love and support for me. I also ask you to thank the most honorable council on my behalf. In the meantime, be assured that I have not received a single hair, whoever besides you and yours might have offered it. For I have not been accustomed to it, indeed I have consistently rejected honorary gifts offered by cities and most distinguished men, and I will not accept any, God willing, as long as I live. The Archbishop of Canterbury and several leading men of England offered, Bern and Augsburg offered, others offered; I never accepted even a penny from anyone. There are many and very just reasons why I act this way. - In the months of January and February, I wrote twenty sermons, a copy of which I send here. I pray that you kindly accept this small gift. God willing, I will prepare four more Decades, in which I will address other most necessary commonplaces of evangelical theology. </p>
      <p> There are no copies of Calvin's response here; what I sent you, I received from Calvin himself. On the twelfth of this month, a great synod will be held in Bern. All the ministers of the churches of the Bernese dominion have been called there; after eight days, the French or Savoyard ministers will also appear. Therefore, Musculus remains in Bern to attend the synods. </p>
      <p> I return to you the shared papers on the English parricide, written from Antwerp, and I give you great thanks. Friends from England weave almost the same story in the same words; but I have nothing more than yours. May the Lord turn everything to the glory of His name. I await what else friends from Antwerp will write; for you promise to share them with us. </p>
      <p> May the Lord grant you wisdom and the ability to resolve the controversial issue among the Swiss. Farewell. The lords consuls and fellow brothers greet you. </p>
      <p> Zurich, March 7, 1549. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. Return all enclosed letters to the most distinguished man, Mr. D. D. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. D. D. Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord. St. Gallen. </p>
