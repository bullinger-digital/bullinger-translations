      <p>Greetings. I commend to you these brothers in the Lord. They seem to understand piety. They wish to become acquainted with your church, and then return to France, as it seems, with the intention of transferring all their belongings to us.</p>
      <p>You should encourage Vogler to listen to the holy sermons daily, and then to repeat them to someone. This meditation on the word of God will, I believe, help his spirit to receive stability.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, my most beloved brother. April 24th.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To my esteemed friend and brother, Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
