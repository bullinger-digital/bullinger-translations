      <p> Greetings. I have never envied nor do I envy my Martyr (friend) for the great benefit, which you write he acknowledges to have received from you, but I have often congratulated him greatly, as he himself can testify, as many times as I have praised to him that city, church, and the most pleasant company of learned men, and I did this so that, since I could not keep him here, he would more willingly set out there. Therefore, I do not envy him this good fortune, but I greatly congratulate him, and I congratulate him all the more because I have understood from both your letters and his own that he is very content there. Nor have I ever doubted, from the time when I myself experienced your and the other learned men's humanity, service, and piety there, and you and the other pious men in turn... know my faith and sincerity and my respect for you, I have not doubted, I say, that just as I hold you partly in the place of fathers, partly of brothers, so you in turn have held, hold, and will hold me in the place of your friends. Nor do I fear in the third place that I am not loved by Mr. Peter in my absence as I was in my presence, just as I do not respect and cherish him any less absent than I admired and revered him present, since I am not unaware that souls truly bound by the bond of friendship cannot be separated by the separation of bodies. Therefore, as you first write, since I am a sincere friend of Martyr, I ought to congratulate him rather for that benefit, which he acknowledges to have received from you, than to grieve that he has left us or to be angry with you for having taken him from us, I do this indeed very willingly, but in spirit, not entirely in the flesh. As for what you say in the second place, that my heart has not been torn away, but transferred to Zürich, because Zanchi resides in your hearts, although he is martyred in Strasbourg: I do indeed believe that I adhere to your hearts, which have the power to draw all to you, but where... Therefore, I cannot see that my heart has been torn away, nor transferred to Zürich... much more than before I gather that my heart is in Zürich, both passively (so to speak) and actively, passively indeed, because I am loved by you (as you write), actively because I in turn love you and always keep you in my eyes, and indeed now much more (as I said) than before, when with Martyr taken from us, you also transferred me entirely there. But what you write in the third place, that the distances of places cannot separate souls, and you wish me to tacitly infer from this that Martyr, now staying and remaining in Zürich, is as much mine as when I enjoyed him in Strasbourg, you write most skillfully and acutely, most learned Bullinger; for I am not torn from him in spirit; but here lies a fallacy, for although we are not separated in spirit, we are separated in body, and therefore I do not enjoy him, he is not now entirely mine as he was then, unless you except that because all things are common among friends, therefore he is no less entirely mine now than yours, because you, who are entirely mine, enjoy him entirely. But a certain gloss says, namely as far as it can be done. But it cannot be done that I, being in Strasbourg, enjoy Martyr as you enjoy him in Zürich. Therefore, he is not equally mine as yours. Otherwise, you would have wanted to leave him in Strasbourg; for if all things are common among friends, he was equally yours here with us as there with you. Therefore, I will not concede that he is as much mine as then, unless you also concede that he was as much yours then as now. But if you concede this, there will be something in which I can accuse and blame you. But we have joked enough. Therefore, I am grateful for your consolation and encouragement to strive... and that you cite from the sacred writings both examples and authors, and I sincerely thank you through Jesus Christ and earnestly ask that you assist me with your prayers. Believe me, I am here as if in a desert; for neither do I delight in the company of all, nor do all delight in mine; so much can the disagreement of one article in religion do. But what you write about Martyr's good health and the happy attendance at your school for his lectures has brought me not a little joy, since I cherish both that school and church and greatly desire and wish that Martyr may be pleasing to you and himself be well. I will always cherish you and your entire family. Therefore, farewell and rejoice, but first greet in my name your three sons-in-law, their wives, and your whole family. I will add here your Rodolph, when I happen to see him, I do not cease to advise, ask, urge, compel. However, I say to you alone, Mr. Bullinger, it matters greatly where each one lives and whose company they enjoy, especially when... tender and planted. I very rarely see your son... he is a boy and tender, flexible to both evil and good; young people need the best moderation and discipline, and he who spares the rod hates his son. But to whom do I say this? I - carry owls to Athens. As far as I am concerned, I will never fail him; I would wish him, however, to be with some professor, an honest and learned man. Here is Dasipodius, your Swiss, he would yield to Rodolph in greater honor and utility. But you are a father and indeed most prudent and that is enough. I did not wish to be so lengthy; but my respect for you, and also my love for your son, has carried me thus far. Therefore, again farewell and consider my words as those of a good friend. </p>
      <p> I could not write to Mr. Martyr or to anyone else nor did I have anything to write. Therefore, you will greet both him and other good and learned and friendly men in my name. </p>
      <p> Strasbourg, September 24, 1556. </p>
      <p> Zanchi, entirely yours. </p>
