    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] A few days ago, Francesco Stancaro set off for Augsburg. He actually intended to travel through Zurich to see Bullinger, but that was not possible because he found a fellow traveler [...] who did not want to go via Zurich. Stancaro left a copy of his Hebrew textbook ["Ebreae grammaticae institutio"] for Bullinger, which Curione is now sending through this reliable messenger, the young student [Caspar Herwagen]. Surely, Bullinger will appreciate this friendly gesture from Stancaro more than the gift itself!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Johannes Gast recently conveyed Bullinger's greetings to Curione and showed him the letter of recommendation [not received] for the two young Zurichers [Johannes Buchter and Markus Wüst]. Curione was pleased to gather from it Bullinger's correct opinion that all Zurichers are welcome to him, especially those who are recommended by Bullinger, as they will indeed experience. The two students can therefore count on his full help and support.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Huldrych Zwingli the Younger recently earned his first academic degree, as is customary at the University of Basel. Curione urged him not to be content with honors (as many people do) but to strive for virtue itself. Zwingli will surely heed this on his own and through the encouragement of good people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] There is hardly any news. There is said to be great unrest in Strasbourg. Does Bullinger know anything certain about Emperor Charles V and Elector Johann Frederick of Saxony?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings to the whole family, also from Curione's wife [Margarita Bianca, née Isacchi].</p>

      <p>Caelius S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus sends greetings. Our Stancarus, most learned Bullinger, returned to Augsburg a few days ago. However, since he was about to set out and had a companion who did not intend to travel through Zurich, he left with me the Hebrew grammar textbook, which he published here, and instructed me that, since he himself (who greatly desired) could not come to Zurich to greet you, I should send it to you and greet you on his behalf. Therefore, having found a reliable messenger, this diligent young man, I send the book to you and convey Stancarus' greetings to you. You, with your humanity, will value not so much the gift as the spirit and goodwill of Stancarus towards you.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, Gastius recently conveyed your greetings to me and handed me your letters to read, from which I understood that you recommend some young Zurichers to me. In these letters, it was most pleasing to learn that you feel that all Zurichers are dear to me. For this belief of yours about me is neither false nor vain; this will be felt and understood by anyone from your people, especially those recommended by you, who wish to use all my resources! And as for those you recommended to me, I will gladly do whatever I can to help them and promote their studies.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Your Zwingli and ours too recently achieved the first academic degree according to the custom of this academy. I have encouraged him to strive for virtue itself rather than the insignia of virtue, as many achieve the insignia of virtue without virtue. No one can achieve true and solid virtue without those insignia. And I hope he will do so, both by his own nature and by the encouragement and advice of good people.</p>

      <p>I receive no new news here, except that Strasbourg is said to be in great turmoil. If you have any certain information about the Emperor and the Saxon, I beg you to inform us.</p>

      <p>Farewell through Christ, and greet your family in my name and that of my wife. Basel, the second of May, 1547.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, the most holy and vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, a singular brother and friend. Zurich.</p>
