      <p>Greetings. The arrival of Lelio was pleasing to me, as he brought your most welcome letters. He reported nothing but common matters, having been brought by Mr. Celio; for there was no leisure. While I return these, I will ask for something.</p>
      <p>The consul briefly told me from the Baden assembly that neither he nor the other Confederates would send anyone to the council, as during the consultation, letters from the King of France arrived, strongly dissuading them from leaving when called; for whatever was done here by the Emperor and the Pope would lead to a more severe dissension of our Confederation, and so that our republic might more easily perish in due time through the other. This writing strongly broke the papists' proposal, which they had conceived for the council for the sake of common peace; for they vigorously pursued that peace.</p>
      <p>Gastius had said about the council that it was again postponed to the first of May; I believed it; now I hear something else and I believe this: thus the Emperor urges from the persuasion, which I recently mentioned, that he would not prevail against the Turk, as long as this Lutheran heresy remained in the German cities due to his negligence. Thus that man is blinded either by his priests or by his own malice or by both. What you signify about Peter Martyr is very pleasing; for I wish that man to live for the use of the church as long as possible. I was unaware that the other two had fallen ill.</p>
      <p>Two from Augsburg, who were with you, had gone down to Strasbourg, I believe, to go to England. The day before yesterday they returned; I sent someone to inquire about the people of Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>They responded that the Emperor had imposed nothing on them either good or bad; therefore, they are now quite calm. As for the people of Magdeburg, it is reported for certain: a few days ago they erupted again and completely stripped the enemy of three camps and returned to the city rejoicing.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman barely transports cargo ships through Germany today, whatever it is that has been reported.</p>
      <p>It is miserable that those two brothers are so fateful to the Christian world, not only to Germany. I believe more and more in Brother Egidius, who said, while I was still in Zürich, to Sesler the baker: "As long as those princes of Austria are lords in Germany, it will be unfortunate forever."</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family and brothers, especially Mr. Pellican. Basel, October 8, 1551.</p>
      <p>I give thanks for your sermon, now sent twice; it pleases. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the people of Zürich, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
