      <p>S. P. D. I have diligently received the letters you wrote along with the news and the catechism, which I could not inspect due to the brevity of time, for which reason, most esteemed Bullinger, I give you immense thanks, as you so kindly share the news brought to you from various parts of the world. However, we have not heard a word about all these matters; for now, everything has been silent for almost two months. As a result, nothing is currently offered to write to you about. If Sulcerus has anything, he will undoubtedly share it. Recently, Hieronymus Wolf from Augsburg flew to us, who, although he is very familiar with the Fuggers, by whose stipend and table he is supported, could not report anything new to us. However, the people of Frankfurt will provide us with some things, as the fairs are approaching, from which if anything is brought, we will diligently share it. Farewell with your wife and the whole family, safe and sound for us and the church of Christ for a long time. I will diligently take care of the package to Mr. Erb through Westhemer, who was recently called by Prince Gregory to the ministry of the church in a village near Richenwyl. Farewell again. In Basel, hastily, as it appears, August 31, 1553.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>For the most acceptable gift, I give and hold immense thanks to you, until the occasion for reciprocation presents itself to us.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the city of Zürich, a great friend.</p>
      <p>To Zürich.</p>
