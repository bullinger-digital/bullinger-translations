    <p xml:id="regest1">Paravicini turns to Bullinger with his request because he assumes that Bullinger spares no effort when it comes to the honor of God and the education of the youth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">He recommends a relative, a respected, good, Christian man, like no other in the Valtellina, who seeks the honor of God more than that of men. He has many sons, including the thirteen-year-old [Martino], who resembles him and whom he would like to have instructed in the evangelical doctrine. However, since he cannot find a suitable teacher in the Valtellina, he wishes to inquire with Bullinger whether his son could be taken in and taught alongside Bullinger's sons. He would cover the incurred costs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Bartolomeo Paravicini supports this request and asks Bullinger to comply with this wish if possible. Bullinger's correspondent Camillo Renato will send a letter of recommendation for the father and son.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Paravicini has nothing more to convey than the request to take in the boy for one, two, or more years. He awaits a response. God protect Bullinger!</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings and all good things beforehand, worthy, highly learned and honorable, gracious lord, Master Heinrich. Although I reluctantly place any request in your hands, nevertheless, since I am assured that you are of such a disposition that, where the honor of God and the virtue of the young are concerned, you do not shy away from any effort, I have decided to write you this present letter.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Through which I wish to make you understand that here is a cousin of mine, who is truly a man who can appear before the honorable people, a good Christian, like no other in our Valtellina, who seeks the honor of God more than the honor of the world. He has many sons, among whom is one who resembles his father, truly virtuous, who is 13 years old. His father wishes to have him learn the evangelical doctrine, and because there is no one here who is suitable to teach such a doctrine to the boy, he has thought, if you, being a good servant of God, would be willing to take him into your house and send him to school with your sons, then he would gladly pay you whatever is agreeable to you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>And therefore I wish to ask you, if you would be willing to do the best for him and (if it were possible) to take him in with you. The virtues of the boy and his father will be written to you more clearly by Master Camillo Renato, whom you know well through letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Nothing more, then I wish to ask you once again, if you would be willing to do the best and take him in for one year, two, or more, as God wills. And I await your response. May Almighty God protect you. Dated at Caspano, on the 27th day of February, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom's willing servant, Bartolomeo Paravicini, at that time the table companion of Bartolomeo Aman KÃ¶chly.</p>
