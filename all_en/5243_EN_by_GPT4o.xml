      <p>Greetings. Lord Scipio has obtained from our most honorable lords, through your intercession and ours, what he desired; therefore, he has reason to thank you; for he has found our lords to be most gracious, as he himself will testify. I would therefore wish that, if ever the occasion permits, you would either thank the councilors yourself or at least sprinkle something in German in your letters to me, from which they could understand that their services, which they have most promptly rendered, have been pleasing to us and to other pious people. Yesterday, Vergerius came beyond all our expectations and spoke of many things; he preferred to risk this journey rather than neglect such important matters (so he says, I have not yet heard what it is) which he has undertaken to handle. I will observe everything diligently and will write to you most diligently.</p>
      <p>You will keep this to yourself, so that I may be allowed to experience more; I will remain silent for a while, until the matter of truth is dealt with and I am no longer permitted to remain silent due to my religious duty. These things briefly and suddenly. March 27, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>Please, read this letter and then ensure it is delivered to Rodolph Collin, your relative. To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
