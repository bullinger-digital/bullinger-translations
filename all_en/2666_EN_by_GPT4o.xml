      <p>[The grace] of God through our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, [dear] brother in Christ, with you, yours, and all of us, [that] we may believe in Him alone and His truth, eternally, amen.</p>
      <p>Highly gifted, faithful servant of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and dear sir, I have received your letter from Zurich dated July 9th with the sermon in print, which your love has sent regarding the Catholic universal doctrine and the undoubted old faith, and I thank you most highly for it. I do not know how I should repay you, and I find it the pure truth that whoever does not have grace in Christ to believe in his merit can never be saved; for no man is born with so much good in him that he can save himself with good works or his diligence and blood; he must be helped by the payment that Christ made on the cross. But whoever does not believe that the suffering and death of Christ are sufficient for his sins, for him it is not fully paid; it is not a sufficient and complete God for him, with which the sacrament of bread and wine, why it becomes his way in faith, is received in salvation and with the other signs worldly according to the order. Those who have the grace of God have eternal life; but for whom the death of Christ is not completely sufficient for their sins, which they are in repentance and sorrow, they will never do, but seek and must have other ways, works, or means for it, for them Christ did not die, and they go to hell, to us eternal life, as the pope now does from their brought, self-interest, good life while doing, wants to let the gospel not arise among us as much as possible, for them we will truly pray, according to the same the will of the Lord, as he teaches us in the Our Father, to happen. The priests in England with their followers have let a young lord [king] die; the same kingdom has been given to a s... alone so that the pope, idolatry service is maintained and the truth of Jesus Christ is driven out with force. The Lord can still have mercy on them and help. So you, who openly believe and confess the Gospel of Jesus Christ, also do not, while we show the judgment of Jesus Christ, that many are called, few are chosen. We want to thank God the Lord all the more for his grace. It is true, many preach the gospel, let... so the best want to be, with running; let that not worry you... brother.</p>
      <p>The devil does not rest; but through the grace of God, let the good come out, let the need go. There we would like, those who do not care about it, to pray to God the Lord, that he will keep us until the end, which is short, will. I have not yet been out in the country with the highly learned Dr. Conrat Ga√ü[ner]. When I come there, I will make acquaintance. In the diet, which has now been going on for 6 months, nothing has yet been arranged; priests are pulling up, would like to have a dispute and peace between the imperial majesty and France, intending thereafter to maintain the more against the evangelicals. The princes hold strong, want everyone to have freedom, not to be subjected to the pope or his doctrine. Where it will end, should come out in 4 to 6 weeks. For they have grace from God, will not deviate from it. If it should come to a move, it cannot go well. With us, all means are used, how one must go away; but God has so far had mercy on us, preserved his word alongside the devil's doctrine of the antichrist in Rome. For the grace we, who believe in the gospel, still and constantly pray.</p>
      <p>Pray to you friendly, brotherly, and serviceably, would you pray for our churches in Augsburg with your community, for me as a fellow servant of Jesus Christ, his household, truly, that the almighty God may keep us in these dangerous times in faith and in Jesus Christ his holy gospel eternally and temporally until the end of this miserable life and especially pray for me and mine. I will do the same for you and yours. Let nothing that is done out of necessity be challenged. For your and my faith are grounded on the death of Jesus Christ and his truth alone and on no one else, to forgive sins. Thereby we want to remain until the end and through his merit possess eternal life, find us in the kingdom of God in a short time.</p>
      <p>Where I can serve you, dear sir, be it for the promotion of the gospel of Jesus Christ, in whatever it may be, as far as I can, you have, yours, me completely willing and inclined. The priests cannot bear me, that I recognize their cause out of the grace of God, must yet, as long as my lord and God grant, endure.</p>
      <p>As they say, they want to end the diet in 6 weeks, draw up the religious article in Speyer, that each party sends their learned there, to handle further.</p>
      <p>It is a move, whether peace with France will be, that they are strong enough for the truth. God will preserve it.</p>
      <p>What then those from Cologne let go out in print, have here, take back for it and swear at hand and want to deny the truth, the sacrament of Jesus Christ, maintain the pope's idolatry; one must commend it to God the Lord, as it then goes in the Netherlands, that the king of France withdrew from Mariaburg with 200 ways profaned from the imperial camp, you will already know.</p>
      <p>With that, be greeted by me, mine, and all yours, commended to God the Lord in his grace.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, July 5, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your willing brother in Christ, Hans Welser.</p>
      <p>To the worthy lord and leader in the gospel of Jesus Christ, Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my dear lord, to hand.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
