      <p>S. I, reverend father in Christ, have nothing to write; for nothing new is brought to us from Italy. I assume you understand the French matters from Mr. Coignet; for he himself wrote to our envoy last week and among other things mentioned the marriage initiated or certainly to be initiated between Charles, the son of the Emperor, and the Queen of England. He adds that the Saxon, the son of the captive, is gathering large forces, and there is some hope of peace between the Scots and the French. Furthermore, the Pope is considering coming to Milan after Easter and waiting there for Emperor Ferdinand, whom he will send into possession of the empire with his coronation. I assume you already have all this information.</p>
      <p>However, since you command me to write, I thought it necessary to add these things, so as not to send empty and meaningless words. Our envoy hopes to soon obtain a mission from the king; he doubts whether he will return. He has already offered me, not once, in the name of Mr. Augustin, not the king, but himself, one or two books which he wishes to leave or even deposit with me, his friend, as a token and pledge of friendship, so that upon his return he may use them with me in common.</p>
      <p>I indeed acknowledge the humanity of the man, and indeed I would especially need this from a father. But I am uncertain whether it is permissible for me according to your laws, although I consider it permissible to accept a gift from a friend. I believe our Gesner receives many such things from foreign friends, nor does he give them for free, who used my entire library while he was here, which was always open to him and his household. But so that I do nothing rashly, which might later be a disadvantage to me, I thought it necessary to ask you first. Therefore, I await your judgment on this matter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the horse, what should be decided? The smith has had it in the stable for 14 days, and furthermore, he has treated it for 4 whole weeks; for this, he demands 1 crown, yet he thinks he is offering it to us very cheaply. The little horse is very old and has no more than one eye.</p>
      <p>Mr. Philipp holds it at the market; he demands nothing at all; yet nothing less will cost more, and the little horse has no buyer.</p>
      <p>If you now hand over the animal to us, dead or alive, so that we can get what we can from it, even if it is now 4 florins, to pay the smith, or if you want us to send it away and then sell it at the door or cheaply? You take the choice. Those young gentlemen, about whom you speak, promise much but deliver little; for they hold to the old saying: Promising is noble, keeping is bourgeois. If you would thus hand over the horse to us, then write with just 3 words; we will not trouble you further.</p>
      <p>These things in passing.</p>
      <p>All of ours wish you well.</p>
      <p>Convey our greetings to all of yours.</p>
      <p>Chur, 19th of February, 1560.</p>
      <p>One would have to see if the French gentleman would like to buy it; then he would ride it to France. This as a joke.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
