      <p>Most illustrious prince, most gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Lord Christ, King of kings and the only savior of the human race, bless your highness and preserve it in all happiness forever! I received and read what your highness sent through the most distinguished man, Mr. Martin Cechoviz.</p>
      <p>I also heard him discussing the whole matter. He also faithfully delivered letters written about the business of Blandrata to be recognized, so that I now testify to your highness that he has very well fulfilled his mission. However, to respond briefly to more important matters, I first pray to the Lord that his power may be with your highness in those warlike tumults and that he may cause the ferocity of the barbarian nation to be restrained, and that he may not repay his people according to their merits, but according to his mercy, and deliver them from all evil, which we will obtain from him with constant prayers, I hope. Just as we deeply regret that the people of God are harassed by barbaric wars, so I can hardly express how much those domestic contentions disturb me, which seem hardly able to be ended, especially those in which they are set against each other, who ought to fight with one spirit and one soul against the adversaries of the gospel. Therefore, I fully approve of that singular zeal of your highness, which you devote to the holy pacification of the churches, nor did I think I should be difficult in granting your highness's request to write to Mr. Calvin, my singular brother and friend, that, as much as piety and sincerity allow, he may accommodate himself to us in the pacification of the Blandrata case. At the same time, I humbly pray to the Lord, in whose hand are the hearts of men, that he himself may direct this business to the glory of his name and the salvation of his church. As for the fact that Georgius Blandrata complained to your highness that I was unwilling to hear him in his case and to seek with Mr. Calvin the pious, useful, and universally beneficial conditions of peace, so that he was forced to refer the matter to the Italian church, which is in Zürich, and to complain there and leave it attested by his public letters, he has indeed complained unjustly to your highness. Blandrata came around the end of May for the Pentecost holidays in 1558 and was in the city for several days, when I did not know he was present, nor had I ever heard or known anything about the man at that time. However, he had approached the most distinguished man, Mr. Peter Martyr, my esteemed godfather, with whom he had discussed many things about the business of the adoration of the Trinity and the true divinity of the Son of God.</p>
      <p>And Mr. Martyr was the first to inform me that there was a man in the city who had left Geneva because he was unwilling to subscribe to the confession of its church, and who held erroneous views about those mysteries. He added that he had indeed discussed various matters with him on that very subject, but without any fruit: therefore, he advised me to be vigilant in my office lest he sow any corrupt seed in our church. Mr. Martyr could testify more copiously and distinctly about all these things if he were at home. But now he has been summoned by royal letters to France to a colloquium on true religion instituted by the church and the most distinguished senate of this city. May the Lord grant him his Holy Spirit so that he may fulfill his office with much fruit. Finally, when some told me that Blandrata was thinking of leaving, he approached me casually and accused Mr. Calvin of many things in my presence.</p>
      <p>But, to be honest, I was most indignant at this, because the merits of that man for the pious and his piety, and finally his sincerity, were most evident to me.</p>
      <p>In addition to this, during the conversation, I seemed to perceive what Mr. Martyr had previously warned me about, that he did not sincerely believe about the Son of God, whom he repeatedly called the Son of the Most High and uniquely sought to be given to him, namely to introduce some inequality between the Son and the Most High. I certainly affirmed that the Son is in all things coequal and consubstantial with the Father, and that I admit no degree, greater or lesser, in the adoration of the Trinity, as is expressed in the Athanasian Creed.</p>
      <p>When he seemed not to value this, I confess, I broke off the conversation. He threatened to write against Mr. Calvin and was breathing other fierce things of that kind. At that time, I heard of no means which he thought would lead to repairing concord.</p>
      <p>I certainly submitted to his threats, saying that there were already enough contentions in the church of Christ, which if he continued to multiply, God would be the avenger. He indeed departed with dire imprecations.</p>
      <p>However, as for the fact that he complained to the Italian church which is in Zürich about me, that I was unwilling to hear him, and left it attested by his public letters, I first learned from your highness's letters. I did not know this until now.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I would have responded to the church about those complaints, and now that I have learned this from your highness's letters, I approached the most distinguished man, Mr. Bernard Ochino, pastor of the Italian church and my esteemed godfather, and asked what accusations or complaints Blandrata had brought against me before the Italian church, or what public letters he had left against me? The old man replied that this seemed entirely new to him, that he knew of no letters of Blandrata deposited with the church, nor had the church ever met because of Blandrata. The most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Wolphius, a fellow minister and faithful minister of the church, accompanied me to Mr. Ochino, and heard him say this.</p>
      <p>If Blandrata complained or deposed anything before private persons, I think this has nothing to do with that church or with me.</p>
      <p>I wanted to explain these few things to your highness on my behalf, so that you might understand what is true, or what has been done in this matter. Now, if Blandrata has sincerely repented, and now wishes to appear to have put forward those things he discussed in Geneva and here for the sake of testing and learning, if he now sincerely acknowledges our doctrine and faith to be pure, if indeed he has subscribed to the Polish confession, as the brothers and fellow ministers gathered in the Pinzovian synod testify, and if he glorifies Christ Jesus as coeternal and consubstantial with the Father, we indeed praise the Lord, and sincerely pray that he may confirm him in this true faith. But if he still hesitates in these matters, and confesses those things which must be confessed clearly and distinctly more obscurely and ambiguously, the Lord must be prayed to grant him to speak more freely and clearly, especially since the suspicion of evil has grown so much. Therefore, your highness must be careful lest under the pretext of your piety he harms the purity of true religion and the church of Christ. Your highness has evident examples among some Roman princes.</p>
      <p>For indeed, the flattery, adulation, and simulation of certain very cunning men, trying to inspire Arianism in many, have greatly harmed the church of God, where they most tried to benefit it. Indeed, the most beautiful concord is among brothers, and God is the God of peace: yet for the sake of concord, he does not want sincere truth to be endangered or lost, nor does he approve of agreement with men who are insincere in faith, nor does he disapprove of struggles that are undertaken and committed for the sake of asserting his sincere truth.</p>
      <p>And indeed, this is not a light matter but of the greatest importance and our salvation. For if Christ the Lord is not the true God, coeternal and coequal with the Father in all things, I do not see how he can be the head of the church, the savior of the world, and thus Christ, the same universal king and high priest of all ages. Therefore, the Jews and Turks have prevailed, and their faith is better, and the Christian faith will be in vain. However, your highness understands these things, even if I do not urge them, and your exceptional piety knows what is appropriate to do in this matter, and sees that I write these things more for the sake of the matter itself and the pure doctrine of faith to be preserved and asserted than for the sake of attacking the person of Blandrata. For I have never hated this man who has never offended me privately, nor do I wish him ill, if indeed he confesses the same Christ with us with a sincere heart. A certain Valentinus Gentilis recently composed and published a confession of his faith, who in the same public writing petulantly attacked the Athanasian Creed. There are not a few others of this kind who permit themselves anything against God and the mysteries of faith, but especially they try to revive Servetus, the most impious man, whom several ages have not borne more impure, and to raise Arianism from the brothels of the Turks, indeed from hell. These must certainly be diligently observed and every care taken lest they, being reborn, disturb the churches, and finally defame and corrupt them. May the Lord Jesus destroy all false doctrines with his Holy Spirit, preserve his pure truth, and convert all scrupulous minds eager for new and worst things to himself. May the same merciful and gracious Lord preserve your highness with your whole family, and bless and enrich you with every spiritual and bodily blessing. I ask your highness through the Lord Jesus to kindly consider this my response and to have me commended to your humanity, who otherwise am most devoted to your excellent piety and in all things in which I can serve your highness, I sincerely wish and desire to gratify and please you.</p>
      <p>Given in Zürich on the 30th of September in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>I detained Mr. Martin for three days, both because of my various business and because my health is not entirely firm. Most devoted to your highness, Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious prince and lord, Mr. Nikolaus Radziwill, Duke of Olyka and Palatine of Vilnius.</p>
