      <p>Copy of the Bernese letter: "What displeases us in your confession [...] may you not stir up a new tragedy for us. Farewell. Brothers and ministers of the Bernese church."</p>
      <p>Now consider for us, dearest brothers Myconius and Karlstadt, whether they have sincerely understood us. Who from all our confession could have even suspected that we dreamed, even in a dream, what they pretend we assert about the distribution, as if the body of Christ is naturally united with the bread and is first distributed through the symbols. Therefore, also declare to them the sincerity of our confession. For we too are now striving to prove this to them in writing as friends. In the meantime, you will consider these writings as yours. We could not hide this from you, who are more deeply engraved in our hearts. If you see anything placed without truth, simplicity, and true concord, we ask again that you freely advise us.</p>
      <p>Farewell and remember us in your prayers.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, etc.</p>
      <p>Read this letter only with Karlstadt.</p>
