      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I could not have heard anything more pleasing than that England is at peace and that the Protector, the honor of the English kingdom, is still unharmed. What I wrote, I received from a veteran who was in the town of Calais when he was summoned by the royal majesty. May those who wish ill upon pious men perish. But what can be hoped for from the English, who have been perpetually seditious, as their historians also write.</p>
      <p>I am glad that Peter Martyr is doing well, and that his Propositions on the matter of the Eucharist are being printed with you; it will be a welcome thing to all who love true religion, so that the deceit of the Tridentine fathers may appear even to the simpler ones, who know little how to judge in true religion due to the innate superstitions they have absorbed from an early age, and you also know the customs of the people.</p>
      <p>Magdeburg has peace confirmed by the Emperor's letters, although not all the soldiers have been dismissed. This soldier has ravaged the lands of the bishops and is troublesome to the peasants. The Archbishop of Mainz was with us accompanied by three horsemen, but he hid secretly. A departing servant said: "This night the bishop had enemies," and so he left, received with no honor by our senate. This Maurician army is an enemy of the bishops of Würzburg, Bamberg, Mainz, and Cologne.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Mainz wants to gather in Hagenau; but few give their name to the priests, and today a rumor came to us that this army is in the small town of Höchst, not far from Frankfurt, on this side of the Rhine. Germany will have various disturbances this year. What do you think Maurice is planning? For they say he was summoned by the Emperor; but he requested a public safe-conduct, and the Emperor replied: "What need has the Elector, whom the Emperor favors and whom the Imperial Majesty has raised to such honor?" But he does not want to trust the Emperor's promises, just as the wolf did not trust the peasants.</p>
      <p>I will write about Gutschick next week, for he has been adjudged by our officials to the axe, and what pertains to it, whom I think will undergo punishment next Saturday. However, I will not hide from you what he has done when it has been made public. Farewell and love Gastius, who prays for a happy and fortunate year for you and yours. Basel, January 7, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>Musculus from Augsburg has this: Huberinus has been placed in the house of Held to preach at St. Anne's; he has three accomplices of the same wickedness.</p>
      <p>It is written about the captive Elector that there is suspicion that he was given a potion not of life, but of death; for it is said that he is lying mortally ill or certainly is dead.</p>
      <p>It is written about the fratricide Dietz that, unhappy with life, he took his own life with a noose. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
