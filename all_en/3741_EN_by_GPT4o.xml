      <p>May the salvation of God and the light for the revelation to the Gentiles be with you, so that in His light we may finally see together with you all that desired light, Jesus Christ, our Lord and God. Amen. Reverend elder, it was long desired, when I sent both my letters and the books of the man of God, the reverend father Caspar Schwenckfeld, to you from the Swabian Baths of Bad Urach, that your affairs, which at that time did not allow you to read anything, may now finally become so leisurely that you may read through, judge, and discuss these few writings of the man and another brother with a candid and sound judgment, and consider them well, whatever they may be, even if it is perhaps the least, which is nevertheless the greatest of all, as it is divine, whatever has proceeded and been granted by the gift of Christ the Lord, and thus also become more certain about the state of our blind affairs and the deplorable fate and treachery of religion, so that you may also pray with us to the Lord, that the kingdom of Christ, the Son of God, may become more widely known in His holy spirit. For our pains are increasing, if not our teachers, inflated by their philosophical knowledge and supported by secular power, as their predecessor Luther once took such great spirits upon himself, as a great star declining from Christ and heaven to earthly matters, especially to the image of the beast with his panacea god and Maossi Dan. 11. May Christ, the King of Glory, grant that the grace of His spirit and its strength may finally triumph over the abyss of all errors, chaos, and the abyss. May the Lord also grant that what is intercepted by the highest magistrates and evangelical pontiffs with their practices, edicts, and threats may be printed by your presses, which earnestly obstruct the ways of the Lord. All power, printing, audience, and responsibility have been stripped from us, and their clamor, indeed prejudices, calumnies, sycophancies, and lies have been marvelously elaborated and are most open, our learned scholars do not delight in reading our common German, they burden us with their most unjust prejudices, and our theology today is for the most part rhetoric, eloquence, dialectic, αυτοσ εφΗ, the reputation of primacies, heroes. Princes depend on the words of scholastic doctors; the people, however, stand under the jurisdiction of the magistrates, so that there is a perpetual change and metamorphosis among us according to the daily altercation of pulpits, chairs, diets, colloquies, alliances, so that all the foundations of truth, which are undermined by so many human efforts, finally lie in ruins.</p>
      <p>But the Lamb and the patience of the saints of God will conquer in the victory of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, to whom be glory, honor, and kingdom forever. Amen. Our learned do not like to hear today about the spiritual kingdom of Christ, the King of Glory, nor about His holy spirit and that of His Father. Almost everything with them is external, the word, the church, the mysteries, and today the letter reigns, where it would be so good. There are also not a few who do not understand or grasp our matters; there are also some censors who are devoid and inexperienced in our German language, who, like almost all others, depend on the false narratives and mere calumnies of others with their judgment. May God the Lord forgive them when His light of truth becomes known to them and leads them back, amen. Farewell well, consider well what I have written with a weak hand, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Hastily from the Castle of Wagegg near Kempten in the Second Raetia, October 27, 1558. Johannes Wilhelm von Laubenberg, Lord of Laubenbergstein and Wagegg, counselor of the Roman Imperial Majesty, but as if in the reproach of Christ.</p>
      <p>The voice of the second beast is now powerful among the Lutherans; for they speak monstrous seductions against Luther himself and his doctrine, which was first published and treated. They speak as if they were lords of faith, a tyrant's executioner in spirit. Blessed are those who die in the Lord. A diet has been announced for the month of January.</p>
      <p>Some evangelical heroes rage with edicts and inquisitions, as do their papal consorts, so that after the diet is completed, nothing remains for us but the cross, the sweet wood, which imitators of the magistrates of cities and towns will later follow. And it seems the same, that the Lord Christ wants to go to the field for victory and triumph in the blood and patience of the saints, etc. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Greet the unknown honorable brothers of yours in Zurich in my name and the reverend Blaurer in Winterthur, or wherever he may reside.</p>
      <p>Write back, if it seems good to you and you have the leisure, to the hands of the lithotomist of Lindau, Caspar Stromeyer, or his father-in-law, the senior lithotomist and ophthalmologist Ulrich Angelberg. That priest Brentius has been given over to a reprobate mind, although he fears us, being truly aware of his own guilt, for I have dealt with him in person as a theologian... I think a pig to Minerva, yet driven by the spurs of the most acute philosopher Melanchthon or rather by his heroic reputation, he unwillingly hands over his brothers and pious men, who seek Christ and His kingdom; for our courtly masters of the people are no different from the slaves of the Babylonian harlot. My strength is not sufficient to write to you as I should about these men of blood, who do not have feet to announce peace, Christ. Therefore, may they fare well, and may all who hope in our pious and gentle only master, Christ the Lord, be blessed, amen, to whom be glory again and again. I would very much like you not to disdain to read and even reread these little works sent; for I also set aside many affairs to peruse any booklets for the sake of discovering the truth. All Schwenckfeldian things please me greatly because of the Christian modesty, candor, and simple piety of the man and the direct aim of his doctrine, that Christ may be preached, that He is the Lord Himself and all in all. The writings of this holy father are pure, clear, and bare; if our doctors were not so superstitious and ulcerated because of their doctoral dignity and pride, and if they were not ashamed to learn, they would not indeed gnaw with a theological tooth and such petulant confidence at those beloved gifts of God in this most excellent man. That they now entrust everything to the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>Forgive, I beg you, the importunity of the letters; for what I have written, I have written and entrusted to your faith with a faithful and open mind; nor would I wish that these letters should inconvenience or harm anyone, just as they should not harm me either. To the reverend lord and senior bishop Honorich Bullinger in the metropolis of the Zurichers, his esteemed friend. Quickly.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
