    <p xml:id="regest1">The messenger [...] thanked the Confederates in Lucerne on behalf of King [Francis I] for their generous military support in times of need and promised them assistance from [Francis I] and his sons [Henry and Charles] if needed; [Francis I] is near Reims like the Confederates and has a mighty army, as [Jean de Villars, Seigneur de Blancfossé] reports from Solothurn. Saint-Dizier surrendered peacefully to Emperor [Charles V] on [17th] August, who is now advancing further into France, while [Francis I] confronts him near Paris; a battle would be harmful, no matter who emerges victorious. It is unclear whether King [Henry VIII] of England is besieging, has conquered Montreuil, or even has an agreement with [Francis I]. [Hayreddin] Barbarossa will [exploit the situation]. [Henry of] Brunswick will still have his way. If the Germans trust the Emperor, they are lost; perhaps the Diet [in Worms] will achieve something better. The sick [Diethelm] Röist was near death; Bullinger will settle the matter entrusted to him with the doctor [Jakob Ruf], who is currently staying in Baden. He requests the transmission of his book "The Hope of the Faithful" to [Hans] Welser, to whom he also intends to dedicate his commentary on Luke.</p>

      <p>God be with you, dearly beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Recent news from France is as follows: On August 27th, the king sent his envoys and credentials to Lucerne. He thanked the Confederates for not abandoning him in his times of need, but instead sending him such a strong and handsome (impressive, large), also willing force, as he has never received from the Confederates before. He will never forget this, and if the Confederates also need help, he will send his sons to them in person or with comforting words (French flattery). He is near Reims, and the Confederates are there too, etc. Further reports from the Frenchman in Solothurn state that the king has a force of 60,000 strong on foot, 10,000 riflemen, and a more powerful armored force than he has ever seen in France, etc.</p>
      <p>The city of Saint-Dizier surrendered on August 18th; those who were inside were allowed by the emperor to leave with their belongings; it is said he lost about 6,000 men there. This city previously belonged to the emperor, and the French took it; therefore, the emperor has not yet advanced far into France. Now he may well be on his way to France and the king's territory. However, the king has encamped to meet him before he reaches Paris. If they are to fight, it is a miserable and considerable loss, no matter which side wins; for there is great danger on both sides. May God prevent it, if it is not prayed against His will.</p>
      <p>I cannot write anything certain about the king of England; some say he has besieged Montreuil in Picardy, others say he has conquered it, some say he never came there and has an understanding with the French.</p>
      <p>Barbarossa will take advantage of the situation, and it is to be pitied that the foolish princes are so furious that they do not feel the wounds they receive from strangers.</p>
      <p>The Brunswickian will still do his deed in due time, while he is still so much spared and overlooked.</p>
      <p>If your people trust the emperor even a little, they are lost. That colloquium might provide an opportunity to move and consult more. I too wish from the heart for the closest bond of peace among our people, but I do not see how it can be tightened. If it pleases the Lord, I pray that He may pave the way. I entrust this matter to Him.</p>
      <p>Lord Röist is almost bedridden from a severe illness. Pray that this man is not taken from our republic. I will deal diligently with the surgeon when he returns. He was called to Baden by a certain patient; when I wrote this, he had not yet returned. As soon as he returns, I will urge the man.</p>
      <p>I wish you to send this German booklet "The Hope of the Faithful" to Consul Welser and commend me to him. My books of Commentaries on Luke will be dedicated to him when, by God's grace, I have completed them. For I love him sincerely for his excellent gifts and his remarkable virtues. May the Lord preserve him. I did not send you any copy, for you have the Latin in the 12th book of Commentaries on Matthew.</p>
      <p>I commend you to the Savior Christ, whom you will pray for me. Zurich, August 31, 1544.</p>
      <p>Greet the most illustrious men, brother Consul and Zwicky. HB.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Ambrosius Blarer, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Constance, his most esteemed lord.</p>
