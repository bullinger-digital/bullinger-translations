      <p>Explanation of the gift.</p>
      <p>All estates are outside (outside) of paradise, after the fall and set in hardship (toil); only the holy marriage was instituted before the fall in all the well-being of man, not by angels or other holy servants of God, but by God himself.</p>
      <p>The Lord said: "It is not good that man should be alone; I must make him a helper who is with him" [Gen 2:18]. Therefore, marriage is ordained by God for man's comfort and help, and not to trouble his joy and peace.</p>
      <p>Two and not more in marriage should be one body and cling to each other inseparably and love each other. For the Lord formed man from the earth and the woman from the rib of his side, not while he was awake, but while he slept.</p>
      <p>The woman's regard, comfort, strength, and support should be the man. For she is made from the man's pain. Behind the man and without his knowledge, she should undertake useful and excellent things. She is the weaker vessel, taken from the man's side and not from the head.</p>
      <p>The man is the head, just as in the head is all reason and care for the whole body, so the man should dwell with reason by the woman and lead her with wisdom in friendship. The woman is taken from the side and from the heart and not placed at the feet.</p>
      <p>The woman is not made from the clod of the earth, but from the man's side and pain, so that she should cling (urge) to her origin and love him. Conversely, the man should also love the woman as his own flesh and live faithfully with her.</p>
      <p>Here, however, beauty and form should not be considered, as they are, but what should be considered in marriage is that each is the other's flesh and pain and that they are both one body. For this reason, the woman was built from the sleeping and not the waking man.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they should well consider the word of the Lord: "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife" [Gen 2:24], and that Saint Paul exemplifies the highest love to the married, the love of Christ and the church, where each gives itself for the other in death. Therefore, no one can henceforth find it strange and new that Paul so confidently says: "Marriage is honorable among all, and the marriage bed is undefiled. But fornicators and adulterers God will judge" [Hebrews 13:4].</p>
