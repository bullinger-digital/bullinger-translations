      <p>Revered lord and father, my humble service with the offering of all honor and goodness is prepared for you beforehand. Since I know that my two honorable mayors have received your letter, trusted its content, and understood it well, they have also instructed me to thank you very kindly with the offering of all honor, love, and goodness. And since they both write to my gracious lord Mayor Müller, they earnestly request you to deliver the letter to him personally and not let it fall into foreign hands, and also ask Mr. Müller to remember their persons only in a secret and trusted manner. Since a God's house writes to the six places collectively and the matter is so very difficult, in my opinion, the city of Zurich has a strong reason and occasion to now handle it together with the other places. There you can suggest to the messenger, who will be sent by the six places, the means that have been proposed by Mr. Landammann Bäldi, with the exhortation that they should refer to them in their dealings. Otherwise, our matters are confused, and this city is heavily distressed, and may God protect us from rebellion forever. We have corrupt companions who previously followed the wars. They would be very well pleased with unrest; waiting for some game, they are day and night by the wine, have their own host, feasting at Mr. Batten's; carrying all sorts of weapons under their clothes, some also their firearms. But God always gives grace. But one should hurry with the message so that nothing harmful is undertaken. If the God's house comes to the field once, it will cost little; for one has enough to do to keep the peasants from the God's house at home, and if there are any wise, sensible people, they are then unclean, for whom misfortune would be good, and they provoke and challenge the God's house people. Mr. Batt has not come; they think his people have seen the game under the eyes and have settled the matter. He has been with the Bishop of Constance; from whom Landvogt Dietägen says that he has armed 300 arquebusiers and 200 horses under the pretense of blocking the pass; I cannot know how it is with him. May God have mercy on us and not give us according to our deserts. Always do the best; for it is not a small matter. If we achieve victory, then you and all the evangelicals of these lands will have it better; if God wants to punish us, then may His avenging will be done. I wrote to you two days ago with a certain Fleming; I think you have received it. Please, urge the matter, so that your people send and indeed promptly. No one is more unfortunate than here in this city; I can well say, quod hactenus cum bestiis depugnarim. Many things are nothing but eating and drinking early and late; non ducuntur argumentis et rationibus, sed ea sequuntur, quae venter et ingluvies dictat.</p>
      <p>What if you also wrote to Mr. Legate Mr. de Bellievre and urged him to consult public peace for both his and our sake and to be an authority to Batto (for he has more influence with him than I would like), so that he does not reject tolerable means. For what does Beatus want to do in the fortress, when he is not safe day and night, when the peasants come and take him away by force or subject him to torture? If the legate wrote to Beatus or to Carlinus, it would be very beneficial. Farewell, reverend father in Christ. Chur, April 9, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>I have otherwise not pawned a single thing (the opposing party has secretly pawned their jewelry): where the body remains, there the goods also remain.</p>
      <p>Please, make every effort in all ways, that men favoring religion and loving peace and experienced in matters are sent. If the consul from Cham were present, he could best promote the matter. Mr. Consul Müller could hardly involve himself in these matters. Farewell. After I wrote this, know that both consuls consulted me about their writing and were initially of the opinion that the legates of the six places should come at the first opportunity; but when they thought that the God's house would not convene before the feast of Corpus Christi, they deleted what was written, that they should come as soon as possible, and rewrote the letters. So set your good will at home, when they come. But I say freely and in the opinion of the other consul: it seems to me before God that they should come soon, at the latest within 14 days, at most. There are many and very serious reasons. Things cannot be accomplished in 8 days. When the messengers come, then the things are first written out, and it would be good if the messengers rode to each point in particular, as they have also done before in the French matter. Otherwise, little will be accomplished; we have had so many wasted days here, even if we had/have Corpus Christi in between; for I truly fear that the matter will not hold. Add: if one delays and the five places become aware of it, they might also send their messengers; it would be even worse to handle. I did not want to hide this from you, and at the same time, I urge you most earnestly to press the matter, the sooner the better, etc. Hurry for God's sake with your message, before the five places make a practice to the contrary. These things must be accelerated, so that the plans of the enemies are anticipated and prevented, etc.</p>
      <p>What if you had been the author to Mr. de Bellievre, that he himself also came here for a few days? His interpreter told me that he advises the Beatinis in every way to accept tolerable means; but his authority is not so great; he wishes very much that the lord himself were present. You could therefore write something in that sense, not as if from me, but from yourself; for I also intend to write, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, April 9, 1566.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
