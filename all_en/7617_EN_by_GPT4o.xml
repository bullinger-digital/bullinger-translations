      <p>S. We have absolutely nothing that you do not already know. Regarding Condé and his preparations, nothing is reported except that the roads are so blocked that those who most wish to cannot join him. You know that Alba's letters were intercepted, in which he advises the governor of Burgundy to gather and borrow as much money as he can and to keep it for future use. He also instructs through Rollense that the Swiss garrison be stationed in Burgundy. These matters are now being discussed in Baden.</p>
      <p>Our commission is that the Burgundian alliance does not require what they are asking for, furthermore, the Burgundians are continually troublesome to us both at the borders and in other matters; moreover, they do not keep what they have promised, especially regarding the supply of salt. Therefore, they will ask the Swiss to ensure that the Burgundians do what they ought to do; otherwise, our people will consider further what needs to be done. I have not yet heard anything from Salodurum (Solothurn); I do not think our envoys have returned yet. The recruitment has been forbidden under penalty of life, honor, and property, so that the officials are to seize the life and property of those who run away, wherever they are found, and hand them over to my lords. If the Thurgauers do not run away, the people must be exhausted in a remarkable way. - I am waiting to hear what has been brought to you from Frankfurt. I gave your letters to Dr. Steiger; he thanks you greatly, as do I, for the gift sent to his little child, our godchild.</p>
      <p>He will write to you himself shortly. Regarding the alliance that Ehemius writes about, you know how our affairs stand and how impossible it is to obtain this from our people. Therefore, it is better not to mention this matter at all. Steiger also advises the same. Otherwise, it has been entrusted to our people in Baden (Mülinens and Hofer) to consult with the other cities on how Condé can be helped in some way, whether in terms of money or soldiers.</p>
      <p>Our people here will do whatever seems appropriate. I wish the others would do the same! The grape harvest is now beginning here; therefore, most people are absent from the city.</p>
      <p>Steiger is at home and sends his regards to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 28th September 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Please ensure that these letters attached here are delivered to Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
