      <p>Greetings, esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I learned during this journey that you were troubled because I suspected something false about you. I beg you to forgive me for this; for I see and acknowledge that I was wrong. But the reason was that you did not express the true reason in your letters and added that it did not seem to you necessary for your presence, since you had abundantly expressed your confession in writing and could not offer anything more, as you do not know how to peddle the word of God. Hence, what else could I conclude but that you did not wish to meet and judged us as those who would peddle the word of the Lord? For we were asking for a meeting beyond that written confession of yours and in it, that you would offer more than you had given, especially as far as words are concerned. For I seem to see that you acknowledge the matter itself. If you had even hinted that it was not possible for you to come without the people from Bern and Basel, since I had suspected that very reason would be an obstacle, I certainly would not have been disturbed. I now beseech you to pray to the Lord, that He may fully unite us.</p>
      <p>I will write more from Augsburg, and about our meeting somewhere. For I either see nothing or it is very necessary for us to meet more often and to discuss the matters of our religion more thoroughly.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently and commend me to the most pious men, Leonhard.</p>
      <p>TÃ¼bingen, 15th of February.</p>
      <p>Martin Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the best and truly learned man in the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother.</p>
