    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to the unexpected departure of the letter carrier, he cannot respond as Bullinger deserves. He requests to be sent Konrad Pellikan's explanations of the Apocrypha, Bullinger's works, especially the commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, and Zwingli's annotations on Leviticus, the other books of Moses, and the letters of Paul. He hopes that the evangelical truth will prevail in his homeland. He will send a piece of linen as a gift in the autumn. He encourages Bullinger in his efforts for the Reformation.</p>

      <p>Grace and progress in Christian zeal.</p>
      <p>The departure of our messenger was so sudden and unexpected, most learned and upright Bullinger, that I could not even prepare my pen, let alone thank you for the benefit you provided and your most gracious response, or respond to it as it deserved. But I will try elsewhere, if the Lord permits. In the meantime, accept this unpolished note as a token of my memory and recognition of your kindness.</p>
      <p>Ensure that I receive what Konrad Pellikan added to the Bible, which others consider apocryphal, through this messenger. Also, your works, which I thirst for immeasurably and indescribably, especially on the Epistle to the Hebrews, and any others you have published either long ago or recently. I see the hearts of many brothers here being not only kindled but utterly inflamed and consumed by your holy, learned, and elaborate writings in Christ. We thank the Lord, who through you communicates His sacred mysteries to us who err, with steadfast truth and pure and truly Christian modesty. If there are any notes by the pious and learned Zwingli, a man of holy memory, on Leviticus and the other books of Moses, as well as Paul's epistles, I beseech you to ensure I receive them.</p>
      <p>I hope, indeed I trust in the Lord, that Christ will soon reign even here in our cold corner of the Alps. Pray to God for those who err, yet recognize the true way of God through the benefit of you and those like you, and strive to follow it, unless hindered by the heavy burden of the flesh. But with God as our guide, we will soon gird our loins and walk, carrying the lamp of the divine word in our hands, following Christ, with the Antichrist and all his pomp and tyranny cast aside.</p>
      <p>In the following autumn, you will receive with this messenger a piece of linen as a gift, so that you may continue to admonish the erring Bartholom채us of his duty, encourage him towards Christ, and briefly do what you always do, which is to lead to the heavenly homeland, rejecting the worldly kingdom.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, most upright Bullinger, may He strengthen you in His work. We pray earnestly and constantly for you, that He may complete what He has begun in you for the benefit and progress of the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>Waltenhofen, not far from F체ssen, in the year of the Lord's Ascension 1535. Dictated and sent in the deep of night.</p>
      <p>Bartholom채us Bertlin, minister of the church there, yours and truly yours.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word in the church of Z체rich, faithful and prudent, his honorable teacher and lord in Christ.</p>
