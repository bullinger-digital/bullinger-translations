      <p>S. D. Two of our young men, Hyler and Bumann, behaved very badly with you; therefore, upon their return, they were thrown into prison and sustained for eight days on porridge and water.</p>
      <p>After being released, they were severely reprimanded by the magistrate and the school prefects, but after their punishment, they were received back into favor. We fear that they have burdened themselves with debt and are not faithfully disclosing to us the names of their creditors and the amounts owed.</p>
      <p>Indeed, on account of you and your intercession, I called them, and I remonstrated with them; they, being astonished, replied that they owe R. Berchtold and others and will promptly ensure that they are paid. I would prefer you to request from the creditors the notes, which not only list the total debt but also the reasons for each expense, and send them to me; for I would carefully consider what should be done in these otherwise doubtful matters. For I do not think they will faithfully disclose how much they owe; you could accomplish this without any trouble, if indeed the sexton, with whom they stayed, collects the names of the creditors and each debt and entrusts them to you. If you send them soon enough, I will act as quickly as I can; otherwise, I promise nothing certain.</p>
      <p>These are my thoughts on them. I would not burden you, otherwise occupied with the most serious matters, unless you had first addressed me on this matter and I was pained that the people of Zürich are being accused, etc.</p>
      <p>For some time now, rumors have spread that the Pope will send two cardinals to Switzerland; I have no certain information, yet I do not doubt that the Antichrist will try everything to regain the seats lost in these lands. What is your opinion on your bishop from Laufenburg? When do you intend to install him? These are indeed the tactics of the members of the Antichrist to harass you and us. We are particularly harassed by the people of Schwyz and Glarus because of the castle of Wädenswil, which our people have legitimately purchased and hold by the best right. However, my lords must go to court tomorrow at Einsiedeln; Mr. Hab and Mr. Jörg Müller are appointed, Cham and Spross are councilors, Aescher is the city clerk speaker, and Reinhart is the scribe. Farewell forever; I cannot say more. The last day of May 1550.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, my venerable brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
