    <p xml:id="regest1">A sub-teacher [...] at a school [in the County of Riquewihr] was granted permission by Prince [Georg of Württemberg] to visit his hometown Ravensburg. However, he does not wish to travel directly through the Black Forest, but rather through Switzerland and via Zurich, to learn about the local landscapes and customs. Erb takes the opportunity to send a letter through this world traveler, similar to Pythagoras.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Erb received Bullinger's benevolent letter [No. 2424] with the receipt issued by the widow [Marta, née Blarer] of Erasmus [Schmid] on April 23.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [Elector Friedrich II.] of the Palatinate had introduced the German Mass following the Wittenberg model last winter. Now he has replaced it with a simple communion service. It is said that the Mass was simultaneously abolished in Frankfurt and the Palatinate. However, images and statues of saints were not removed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- There is a rumor that Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg has raised an army of 12,000 soldiers. With this, he intends to reclaim Piedmont for Duke [Charles III] of Savoy in the name of the Emperor [Charles V]. If this is true, the Bernese would have cause for concern.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The outlawed and exiled nobles who supported the Brunswick criminal [Duke Heinrich] are ravaging Saxony and Hesse with fires and robber bands.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The participants of the [Second Regensburg Religious] discussion believe that they will soon be recalled by the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [At the Council] of Trent, there is a discussion on whether the Hebrew or the Greek Bible should be preferred.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Erb initially did not believe the rumor that [Johannes Hoffmeister] had been captured. However, a traveler from Regensburg to Colmar [...] wanted to bet with someone [...] ten crowns that this was true. Erb will keep Bullinger updated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- When the Emperor asked [Landgrave Philipp] of Hesse at their meeting in Speyer when he would have lured everyone into the [Schmalkaldic] League, he replied that he was only missing one person, namely the Emperor; to which the Emperor responded that he would not join misguided people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Tomorrow, Erb will travel to Strasbourg on a matter concerning the Prince [Georg]. Perhaps more on this later.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Greetings, also to [Rudolf] Gwalther and [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you. A young man here, a sub-teacher at our school, eager to visit his homeland, was granted permission by the prince but did not wish to travel directly through the Black Forest to his people in Ravensburg. Instead, he chose to travel through Switzerland to see the mountainous region, its customs, and studies, especially Zurich, the renowned city of the Swiss. Therefore, having a certain occasion to write through this traveler (who, like Pythagoras, explores foreign lands), I did not want him to greet you with empty hands, lest you think him a wanderer or me forgetful of you.</p>

      <p>Your letter was returned to me with the receipt of the widow of Erasmus on April 23, a most ample testimony of your benevolence and your pious and well-disposed mind towards me, to which I am unable to respond adequately (although you, sharply reproaching me, think I am vainly excusing my ignorance), etc.</p>

      <p>The Elector of the Palatinate abolished the German Mass, which he had instituted with all ceremonies during these winter months according to the Wittenberg model, last week, restoring the institution of the Lord's Supper to its simplest form. Hence, the common saying has now arisen: "The Mass in Frankfurt and the Mass in the Palatinate have ceased together." However, idols still stand there, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>There is a persistent rumor that Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg is raising an army of 12,000 common soldiers, which he is said to lead in the name of the Emperor to the Piedmont region, to restore the Duke of Savoy to his country; if true, this would be somewhat concerning for the Bernese.</p>

      <p>The rumor that the monk from Colmar had been captured was long spoken of, but I laughed at it. Now, however, it gains strength as it goes: For the day before, someone coming from Regensburg to Colmar spread the very true rumor, wanting to bet with someone else for ten crowns if it were not so. Once the truth is discovered, I will inform you of this matter.</p>

      <p>The prince of the Catti, meeting the Emperor in Speyer, was asked by him when he would have drawn everyone into his league. The Catti replied with a jest: "Oh lord, the Emperor, I lack nothing more than one man." When the Emperor inquired who that was, he replied: "Your Imperial Majesty, I would also like to have among the pious people." They say the Emperor, smiling, said: "No, no, I do not come among the misguided people." But the Catti was dismissed in peace and returned to his own, etc.</p>

      <p>Tomorrow, unless the Lord prevents it, I will go to Strasbourg on matters concerning our prince. Perhaps more, which I will write about later.</p>

      <p>Farewell to you and your household and the church of God. Greet Gwalther, Pellican, and the other saints, etc.</p>
      <p>In haste, from Riquewihr, on the first of May 1546. Yours, Erbius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful overseer of the church of Zurich, my esteemed patron and lord.</p>
