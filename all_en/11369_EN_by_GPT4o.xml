    <p xml:id="regest1">Has rarely written, as he is busy and because the opponents [in the dispute over the university regulations] are suspicious, but he hopes that this storm will subside, and assures him of his friendship; they are also being troubled again by the plague. There is hardly anything to hope for from the English King [Henry VIII]; Gryn√§us advises writing a reminder letter to Cranmer and inquiring with the Englishmen staying [in Zurich]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have written to you less frequently at this time because both our occupations have hindered us and because I did not want to stir anything unless the Lord Himself had given it to us here. There are many who think we are stubborn due to the confidence of our own. I hope this storm will eventually settle on its own. I implore you by the Lord to believe that I am a most devoted friend of your church, your name, and your authority. I know before the Lord that I sincerely love you all there in the Lord. The plague is beginning to test us here again. You will pray to the Lord to defend His church against the most powerful enemies.</p>
      <p>Regarding the King of England, see, my dear Bullinger, what we can hope for; these kings are monsters and portents of men. It is worthwhile to write to Cranmer, if he can be brought back to the right path. From these English guests, make sure to diligently learn about everything.</p>
      <p>Farewell now in the Lord Christ, who keeps you safe. Greet Theodore, Leo, Pellican, and all the brothers in Christ for me diligently.</p>
      <p>S. Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>To his friend H. Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
