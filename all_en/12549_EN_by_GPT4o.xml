      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter, most illustrious man, will be a living letter to you; for I was too exhausted to write what I wanted. I thank you for the recent letter, which I have shared with Mr. Haab; for it seemed to be very useful. I am expecting your letter at any moment. If I receive any news from Lower Germany, you will not be unaware of it.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>July 16, 1546.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Joachim Vadian, my ever-honored lord.</p>
