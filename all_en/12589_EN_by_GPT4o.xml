      <p>Our delegation has been to Nuremberg. When the six secret lords wanted to hear them, they requested to be heard by the entire council, which was granted. When asked for clarity on whom they would support, they assured us of their assistance to the best of their ability, so they should be left in peace. However, the delegation was not satisfied and demanded a Lutheran. I do not know what the response was. Our people also made it known during the recruitment that they are well aware that the community is well-disposed. The Emperor's army is stationed near Landshut, while the Italians are near Moosburg, etc.</p>
