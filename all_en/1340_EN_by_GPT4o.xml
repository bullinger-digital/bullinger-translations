      <p>Greetings. We have read your letters and we give thanks; for we see your diligence in the affairs of the church and your faithfulness towards us.</p>
      <p>It is hardly possible to repay in kind; however, the intention is to repay on occasion, whenever it may happen. Your advice is pleasing in despising all things that belong to the Pope, as of the Antichrist, a man driven by the worst and most disastrous devil. The arguments are also pleasing, by which you disapprove of our going there, whether we are called or not; you assert that you have been called; no one has called us. Indeed, concerning this matter, I asked the consul yesterday; he replied about the letters that yours had sent, not a word about us. Here two things immediately occurred: first, nothing was given to our envoys in the recess, as they call it, except a mandate, in which only the prelates are mentioned; secondly, they seek through this a greater division among us, if ever we can be overcome, lest we be the cause of so many wars; for they say thus: we are the reason why many kings and princes start wars; if we were not there, from whom they hoped to be victorious, they would seek peace by all means.</p>
      <p>As for the arguments, we cannot know what others will say; it seems to me that our people will not be displeased. I have given it to the scribe to read with the prohibition not to disclose it to anyone until the time of common consultation. What about the Five Cantons? Here I am very doubtful, because nothing pleases them that is yours, as it is most correct. I recently had a certain Uri, my sister's son, a man who seemed prudent; from him, I understood how much the people of Uri, I say, liked the papacy and how much they disliked all who contended against it. Among other things, he used these words: "If anyone wanted to consider us as non-Christians, he would certainly not be heard favorably by us."</p>
      <p>Someone else shortly after counted great men among the Five Cantons, who would do anything for the salvation of the papacy. These people must be well considered if we want to persuade them that we act out of truth and not out of fear; for now, some boast that we distrust our cause, not considering with what kind of people the action will be. For you know that the Pope, the most hostile of devils, does not consider us heretics, but infidels, and he hardly allows himself to consider the unlearned taught by us as heretics and not also as infidels, while he himself is not only a heretic and infidel but a devil, and if anything worse than a devil can be said or be.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we are in this, that we may consult henceforth, what should be answered if our senate refers anything to us about those matters. We will press whether by any right, either secular or ecclesiastical, one who is condemned should come when called to the condemning judge and thus commit himself to be voluntarily killed, where he is defended by divine right; then, whether he should appear, where one is compelled to deny his God against his conscience to his eternal condemnation, and finally, among other things, whether he should believe him who with this present attempt wants nothing else but to make the Swiss more enemies. For this is true even with the Pope denying and all the papists; it does not matter that Julius III flatters himself that he wanted to be called for the favor of the Swiss, after it is certain that no Pope ever wrote more cruelly against them than Julius II, in whose name the third thinks he has sought favor with them. Julius's letters are still held by Johannes Edlibach from his father, with whom I once saw them, nor does it matter if the Pope says the contrary and says it proceeds from true love; for what is more manifest than that he seeks himself and the defense of his seat in this way? for he now asks for soldiers from the Confederates as from the sons of this seat and establishes the same thing as before, namely a greater separation among us. You also know what resulted from the Milanese war, where part of the Confederates openly supported the Frenchman, the other part the duke, whence the Swiss acquired a very bad name, which will not be abolished in any age, although one person may have sinned and also suffered punishment. I now keep silent about the other evils that grew from there. In sum: all the powers are in this, that we may be divided, and the Emperor especially, who has been meditating on that crime for thirty years and more.</p>
      <p>We will also press that so many kings refuse to come to that council; six are counted besides the princes: the French, the English, the Scots, the Danes, the Swedes, the Poles. Why does he not call them, why does he not command them, why does he not excommunicate those who refuse? These are the most wicked iniquities that are being done, instituted to cast out Christ, who will stand in his time and will conquer. Farewell always with yours in the Lord. I wish all our common friends well. Basel, July 13, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, the president of the people of ZÃ¼rich, his brother and fellow minister in the Lord, to be revered.</p>
