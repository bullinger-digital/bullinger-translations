<letter xml:id="file7577"><body><div><p>Greetings. After a long and anxious wait, my brother, one of those from your side came bringing a sheet written in German and asked me, since I have dealt with this matter with you so far, to continue to explain in Latin what is contained in the paper.</p><p>When I asked for a signature, he replied that it was very dangerous to send letters with names subscribed; for if these, as sometimes happens, were not well taken care of or intercepted, it would be over for their lives and fortunes, and since I could not obtain anything else from him, because he had no other instructions from his people, so that you would not be held in suspense any longer and to finally have a certain response, I accepted the offered paper and from this I explain the opinion of their response or advice as follows: The reason we are not sending anyone to the conference at present is that, while we were asking for a day and place to be designated for us to meet, things were such that we could have met without suspicion, but now with matters in France not only tending towards new disturbances but also turned to them, since everyone's minds are alert to what each one says or does, we could not undertake and complete the journey without grave suspicion, especially since we have many looking at us.</p><p>Furthermore, since the plague is spreading in Geneva and the roads outside Geneva in France are not safe, our people sent there could be intercepted and thus we would be thrown into extreme danger, meanwhile neither advice nor help could be brought to the afflicted matters.</p><p>However, so that the p. i.* may see that we are well disposed towards him, we give him this advice, which we were going to give in person: if he understands that new soldiers are to be requested from the Swiss by the king, let him send an envoy to the 13 Swiss cantons, who should, however, deal individually with the Zurichers, Baslers, Constance, Berners, Schaffhousers, Appenzellers, etc., explain his cause and innocence to them and ask that soldiers not be granted, and add through the orator those other things which seem to be in his interest, then they will want to exert all effort so that the p. i. may see that he has good friends and supporters, and that they will give advice and assistance according to the nature of the matter. This is the essence of that writing on the aforementioned paper, indeed spread out in more words, but containing nothing else nor more. However, I beg you, my lord and brother, to have me excused; I would have preferred that they had not written and affixed their seals; but they excused themselves as it is explained.</p><p>And indeed from the beginning, as I wrote to you through Bernaud, I thought that with our affairs as they currently stand, they could not proceed further; yet they continually burdened me with greater expectations and finally gave this response and indeed through me. I have done what I could so far, beseeching that it be kindly received from me, who sincerely favors the cause and wishes it well, praying to God with all my heart that He may take it up and protect it.</p><p>Farewell.</p><p>In the evening of the day on which I wrote the two letters before, August 24, 1568.</p><p>Your Bullinger.</p><p>Since in my writing, which I gave to Bernaud, I expressly put some of their names, I beg you to erase or tear up the writing itself lest it might bring immense harm to them.</p></div></body> Note: The abbreviation "p. i." is left as is because its meaning is not clear from the context.</letter>
