      <p>Greetings. I cannot at present do what I would like, partly because, unaware that those envoys are leaving tomorrow, I set out today a mile and a half from the city together with our Musculus to Paul Rasdorffer, who betrothed his daughter to Matth채us Wipf from Winterthur.</p>
      <p>Now, having returned at nightfall, tired and breathless, I understand that they will depart tomorrow for the assembly and that my case has also been recommended to them.</p>
      <p>Others are coming from those who were recently chosen; for in the meantime, Claudius Maius was sent to the Valaisans, who are causing great disturbances. Now come Mr. Johannes Rudolf von Erlach and the drummer Tormann. I am writing by order of our senate to the senate of Z체rich, and I write in such a way that all of ours are aware of what I write. I do not think I will offend anyone, unless they are very peevish and unjust. May the will of the Lord be done; I await to know what He has decided about me. About all other matters, as I wrote, I will write again, as I expect those envoys to stay a long time in Baden due to the abundance and seriousness of the matters to be dealt with there. Writing about the Valaisans is superfluous, as you will hear more certain things from the envoys in person.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet your family and all yours from me and mine. Musculus and his whole household also greet you. Bern, January 23, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Z체rich, his esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Z체rich.</p>
