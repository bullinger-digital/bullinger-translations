      <p>S. I received your letters written on the 1st and 6th of this month and I am grateful for your kindness towards me. I have not heard anything from France except that good men are hopeful about both religion and the reformation of political matters. Your writing was most welcome; only the opportunity is awaited, which holds much importance in all matters. One of the king's chief advisors promises not to let the opportunity pass. I have not yet decided to send mine.</p>
      <p>You will see it more polished; I added a hypothesis to the first part about the certainty of religion, etc., and I distinguished the political part better with sharp points.</p>
      <p>They write from Italy on September 26th that a Medicus from Formia was made pope on the 26th, another rumor about a cardinal from Mantua; but afterwards many difficulties intervened, and it is not yet known in Lyon who will be created. Regarding what you write about the post, I know what I promised you, and I will fulfill it.</p>
      <p>I wrote to everyone from this city up to Italy, as I was instructed, that the king no longer wishes to pay them any wages, as their services are neither necessary nor will be useful.</p>
      <p>But I think I will manage that they enjoy their wages and the post under these conditions, that they return the letters I write to the envoy of the Grisons, to those who will travel to Chur by horse or boat, and that the envoy ensures they are delivered by a messenger to Baden. This will not be difficult for him.</p>
      <p>In the matter of pensions or any other thing, I would not want to violate or disregard the most sacred laws of your most honorable city, nor is there any reason to fear that I would ever want to attempt anything in this matter, even if I had a mandate, and I think that what I am doing here, the king will approve of everything; for I know how much he himself and his advisors and the princes of France have formed an opinion of me, by the grace of God, who will use it, I hope, for the glory of His name. When the treasurer comes with the pensions around the end of this month, I will visit you to fulfill the expectation of my long-standing desire. Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, October 9th.</p>
      <p>One of the presidents of the Paris court was imprisoned, not in the name of religion, but uncertain, suddenly died and is believed to have wanted to give up and expel his soul no less impiously than courageously. Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
