      <p>My friendly, willing service with the offering of all honors and goods before, gracious, dear sir. If I were a good Latinist, I would have written to you myself the news that is enclosed here, which was sent to me yesterday by a distinguished gentleman, who is my good friend; however, I have had it translated into German by my interpreter, in which you will find the news and important matters of the Spaniards, which one should not always believe; especially when they speak of money, they have the habit of boasting about having a lot of money. Be that as it may, it is held for certain and I have been credibly informed that the King of Spain is making all the preparations necessary for war, as much as possible, with the intention of overthrowing the church of God in the coming year. However, we will see that it will turn out for him as it has for others who wish to fight against God. I did not want to withhold all this from you, and if you have any news from Hungary about the Turks, my request to you would be to share it with me; likewise, I will always do the same with God's help, whom I sincerely pray to keep you well.</p>
      <p>Dated Erlenbach, the 30th of October, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted friend, Pierre de Grantrye.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the holy word of God in Zurich, my dear sir and good friend. Zurich.</p>
