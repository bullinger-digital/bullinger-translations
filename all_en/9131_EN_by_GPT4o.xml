      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you the day before yesterday, reverend father, through Ricaud from Lyon, and in those letters, I intended to include those which were written to us from Geneva about that Ricaud's mission. But just as I was about to seal the letters, I learned from Ricaud that the same was also being written to you; therefore, I removed those from my letters and kept them with me. Furthermore, yesterday yours were delivered to us, to which were also attached others to Mr. Steiger with some news, which are almost the same as those we also have here. I cannot respond to these now, except to send you what Carpenter wrote and ask that, as soon as you have read it, you return it to me; for the copy is not mine. Meanwhile, we await the outcome of the assembly.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you, especially Steiger, Hagenbuch, Manuel, etc. MÃ¼linen and Gravenried are in Baden. Bern, December 14, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
