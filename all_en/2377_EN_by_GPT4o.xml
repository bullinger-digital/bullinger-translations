      <p>S. The reason I have not yet responded to your most welcome letters, most learned and pious Bullinger, is not due to my laziness or my occupations, which, although I am never free from them, do not distract me from the duty of writing to a friend, but it must be attributed to the scarcity of couriers. I do not know why it is easier to find messengers to Strasbourg, Venice, Lyon, and other far-off places through whom I can send my letters than to Zurich. Therefore, I must make an effort to find some way through Constance to write to you more often; for I greatly desire this for many reasons, especially because of the new tyranny of the Lutherans, who partly strive to rage and partly to adapt the hook to papism, although they loudly proclaim they will do otherwise. Whatever seems to me almost impossible to bear becomes lighter when I pour it into the bosom of a friend who can alleviate my feelings in this matter and benefit the cause.</p>
      <p>Recently, by common consent and in all parishes, the matter of the supper was discussed, and concerning the real presence, which they stubbornly grasp, there was the same mind and voice of all, so that if anyone does not believe in that real, quantitative, and corporeal presence, they consider him unworthy of the Lord's supper. For this reason, they diligently urged that no one who thinks otherwise should approach the altar, which they call the Lord's table, because he would bring judgment upon himself, and lest anything remain that pertains to this most impudent fable, some urged that they should bend their knees to the bread, so that not only would they recall transubstantiation through that identical proclamation: "This is my body," but also approve that idolatrous adoration through the bending of the knees. Therefore, they carefully command that no one should take the bread in their hands, thinking that the dignity of the ministers depends on this, that it is allowed for them to handle the signs of the sacred thing, which is denied to the people. But they hardly urge the distinction, by which the people are commanded to consider the ministers who preside well, the elders are worthy of double honor. It is great folly, therefore, to summon and attract that which the ancients forbade, when you could avoid it, to use Cicero's words, and to live almost at home but among the rich overflowing with greed and every kind of luxury, among widows swelling and itching like stags in September, co... measuring their authority by the dignity of the carnal supper alone, they render themselves most contemptible. The people do not visit the Lord's supper according to their words, but according to what each has stored up in their deep mind.</p>
      <p>But concerning the mode of presence, their discord is concord. Some among them say with, others in, a third under, and thus the greater part exhibit the body of Christ with prepositions and in the category of quality to be eaten; few speak of quantity, but yet there are those who consider it circumscriptively and definitively. But hardly one among ours, since the rest are unskilled in dialectics, very few understand the substance and quantity, the predications. For what does it matter about the material and form, about which they are not concerned, because they deal with the matter among the unskilled.</p>
      <p>Concerning baptism, Mr. Gallus, formerly of Magdeburg, now bishop of Regensburg, has stirred up a remarkable tragedy among the Neuburgers, which Jonas had previously stirred in the deformation, I meant to say reformation, of the church of Regensburg. For he called some pastors, with whom he conferred, whether children should be rebaptized who were not previously fully immersed in water, but only sprinkled. The same Gallus secretly wrote to Prince Otto Heinrich, offering his services after the reputation of the ministers. But the prince estimated the lion from the claws and judged him to be such as he really is and did not wish to use his services.</p>
      <p>One of ours said a few days ago that he would take a middle way in declaring the gospel about the lepers, namely that he does not want to reject confession like the enthusiasts nor approve it in the enumeration of individual sins like the papists, but nevertheless to confess, so that they may obtain private absolution, which he says is necessary for salvation. He added that if anyone denies the corporeal presence of the body of Christ in the supper, he denies the omnipotence of God.</p>
      <p>To what end are all these things, my Bullinger, except that we gradually recall and ratify the tyranny of consciences, lay snares for the people of God, whom he sees free from such butchery by his blood. There is no need for lynx eyes, since it is easy for the bleary-eyed and barbers to see where these so foul things tend. I write these things so that I may consult with the good and pious on how to counter the growing tyranny.</p>
      <p>For I hear that Illyricus, and indeed I know that he stirs up more than Claudian thunder against the enthusiasts and openly attacks Brentius, because he did not wish to rage against the sacramentarians and because he has again taken care to put to rest the Osiandric logomachy.</p>
      <p>Someone wrote to me that Illyricus, in the name of the Wittenbergers, fights with spear and shield in that little book against the enthusiasts. The gospel will not be promoted until the mouths of those who poorly distinguish between the sign and the signified are stopped. Ah, how I wish the voice of the sacraments had long since perished and that, as it truly should, the sign had succeeded in its place.</p>
      <p>I send you a list and ask that you be engaged in my name in obtaining the books noted on it, at whatever cost and however great the expenses; I desire three copies of the latest booklets and, if possible, more.</p>
      <p>A new Calepinus is available in Geneva; I expect two copies of this, only one of each of the others. Whatever you spend for the books, for the transport likewise, for the enumeration of those whose services you use, I will repay with the most grateful mind.</p>
      <p>Maximilian came when the people of Strasbourg had already sent another and indeed learned one; but I retained Maximilian and obtained a worthy and fat condition for the other. The foolish parent of Maximilian burdened his son with labor and anxiety, and me with excessive expenses. But I will treat Maximilian liberally. I give you and the rest and the school and the ministers of the word great thanks, I will also repay each if I can. Maximilian has pledged himself to me for two years, etc.</p>
      <p>At first, the arrogance of the French was very troublesome to my Raphael; but now he has learned to endure their insolence. He diligently advised me in his letters to me to have Gesner's matter recommended. I would greet you and other excellent men most dutifully and humbly in his name.</p>
      <p>Gesner, as soon as it can be done, should send me a copy before the work is published. Fugger promises his services in soliciting the privilege, but all is in vain unless the imperial authorities have a copy beforehand. I will leave nothing undone by which I can promote this matter.</p>
      <p>Lord von Freiberg, with whom I have stayed for several days in Munich, loves you greatly and sends these letters to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger, and place me in the book of friends, for I am not allowed to say more. The courier will leave immediately. Gallus, by delaying, lost many things, which he will scarcely recover with the greatest danger; by proceeding, he would have accomplished much greater things. Again, farewell. Augsburg, August 28, in the year etc. 54.</p>
      <p>Your Gereon.</p>
      <p>I ask that you respond quickly in love and do not hesitate to steal a little time from your serious occupations to write to me occasionally.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, my most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
