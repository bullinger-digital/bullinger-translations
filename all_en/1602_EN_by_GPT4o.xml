      <p>Greetings. The reason I am responding to your letter dated the twenty-fourth of February from Zürich after a year is partly due to my occupations and partly due to a certain negligence of mine in this kind of duty, which I candidly confess clings to me. But since it is better to perform a duty late than never, now you shall receive a response to everything.</p>
      <p>You are dealing with two causes with me, one public and one private. As for the public matter, namely that I should be a consultant to prevent the royal majesty from sending a delegate to the Council of Trent, there was no need for me to advise against something that never occurred to them: but rather I thought it necessary to give advice that, just as our adversaries now hold their councils in Trent to confirm errors, so should his piety deign to offer his assistance, so that in England or elsewhere a synod of the most learned and best men might be convened, in which the purity of ecclesiastical doctrine and especially the consensus on the sacramental controversy might be discussed. For this purpose (because he judged it to be most useful to the Christian republic) I sensed that his majesty's mind was very inclined. Therefore, we must not allow ourselves to fail the church of God in such a necessary matter. I have written about this to Lord Philipp and to Lord Calvin, and I pray that you consult on how this synod might be most conveniently gathered either in England or elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The private matter you wrote to me about was to resolve the controversy between Lord of London and Lord Hooper of Gloucester, about which it is now too late to respond: for I know well that you heard long ago that this controversy was resolved and completely removed.</p>
      <p>And Lord Hooper is held in such esteem among us that he is now designated as the Bishop of Worcester; and at this time, when the assembly is gathered with us in London, he lives with me in my house in the closest union. May the Lord Jesus govern and protect you with His Holy Spirit. Farewell. Lambeth, March 20, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted in paternity, T[homas] of Canterbury.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Zürich church, let these letters be given.</p>
