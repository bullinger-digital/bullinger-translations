      <p>My friendly greetings with all due respect and good wishes to you, especially, dear sir, I thank you very kindly for all the honors and kindnesses you have shown me previously and recently during my stay with you in Zürich, with the assurance that I am indebted to you and yours in loyalty. My dear wife thanks you very much for all the courtesy and honor you have shown her, as well as your honorable daughter, who has taken care of her and shown her the beautiful works and sights; she intends to send her a bathing gift; however, there is nothing special here; she also did not know what would please her.</p>
      <p>However, she sends her this enclosed piece of gold, so that she may have something pleasing as a bathing gift. I have received your last letter along with the news from Frankfurt. God willing, they are true. I have no news here except that I see all the people here rushing to Einsiedeln like raging swine into the sea. May Almighty God turn their blindness into clarity. With this, I commend you to His divine protection.</p>
      <p>From Baden in Aargau, 26th of September, 1572.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, God willing, I will ride from here to Bern. Your ever willing servant, Johann Steiger wrote.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, pious, honorable, and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the divine word in Zürich, my especially dear sir.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
