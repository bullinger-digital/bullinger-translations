      <p>London, 17th day of November 1549.</p>
      <p>PRAISE BE TO GOD! Greetings and best wishes. Your most kind letter, my esteemed lord, dated the last day of August, I have just received two days ago, along with a small package of letters for Lord Johannes Hooper and some of your other brothers and friends, which I immediately delivered to those to whom they were addressed by you. As for my own letters, to write briefly: first, I give great thanks to your charity, for you do not cease to encourage me to the study of piety and to dissuade me from the excessive cares of this world. For we ought, I confess, to admonish each other with such mutual writings and conversations. I am glad to hear of the agreement between you and Lord Johannes Calvin on the matter of the sacraments; nor do I doubt that Lord Hooper will allow me to read the same shortly. I will very gladly deliver your greetings to Lord Bartholomäus Traherne and Lord Bernhard, as soon as I can, and I will ask them in your name, as you wish, that although you did not have the leisure to write to them now, they should not omit the duty of writing to you for that reason. I have conveyed your many greetings to my wife in your name, and she reciprocates your piety, and most affectionately wishes you to make good progress in the sacred letters for the glory of God and the edification of the church.</p>
      <p>She has been suffering greatly from severe illnesses since August, so much so that we all despaired of her life for a long time. But the Lord lives, who leads down to the grave and brings up, and now He has given her a little time to breathe, so that we have begun to conceive some hope for her, that she will soon be better and will finally recover.</p>
      <p>For this, I pray you and all your fellow believers and brothers there to deign to pray to the Lord diligently. For first she suffered long from suffocation of the womb, then from fainting spells for almost an entire week continuously, and finally up to this day she has been gravely suffering from a quartan fever.</p>
      <p>Regarding the present state of our kingdom, I know that you are informed by the letters of our dearest brother Johannes Burcher. In short, we still hope that Christ will remain with us, although a month ago it seemed to many that He intended to go further, even beyond the sea. But the power of the Lord is made perfect in weakness. You will greet Lord Pellicanus, Lord Bibliander, and others who know me there, especially Lord Butler along with his wife and your most pious spouse. And to Lord Butler, if it pleases you, you will give this printed paper enclosed here, so that he may read and interpret it for you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe with us for a long time. Amen.</p>
      <p>Yours, RICHARD HILLES.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the Zürich church, and my especially dear friend, let these letters be given. Zürich.</p>
