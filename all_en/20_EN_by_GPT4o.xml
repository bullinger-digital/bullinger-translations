    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should also send the enclosed letter to Francisco de Enzinas in Basel at the request of their mutual friend Hieronymus Sailer. The friendship between Sailer and the learned and sociable Enzinas makes it not seem strange that they frequently exchange many letters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Vadian is aware of the need for recognition of Antronius [Abbot Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee]. He is astonished that the excessive ambition and mindset of this man have strayed so far from his monastic vows. However, he knows that the abbot was far more devoted to Emperor Charles V than other powerful princes and has remained in this stance, unless he has become fickle in the meantime. In recent years, he has collaborated admirably with the imperial forces. However, Vadian does not know if this was only in his own name or also in others'.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Reports from [St. Gallen residents staying] in Lyon indicate that King Henry II of France has moved some well-equipped units of cavalry and infantry to Lower Burgundy, which they call Bourg-en-Bresse. Some believe they are meant for defense, but there are also other speculations. Many think of Strasbourg and believe that the French king has set his sights on this city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">It is said to be certain that Charles V is gathering the dregs of Italian and Spanish soldiers, who were previously scattered in the Swabian cities, against Württemberg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">It is also reported that the entire Danube region, previously under the control of Elector Palatine Ottheinrich of Palatinate-Neuburg, has been sold or at least pledged by the emperor to the Bavarian Duke Wilhelm IV. Wilhelm IV is said to have paid Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, 20,000 guilders for this, which the emperor gifted to this deserving hero.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">It is terrible how the [imperial] garrisons in Nördlingen, Bopfingen, Giengen an der Brenz, Dinkelsbühl, and Ulm continually violate the women, children, and servants. May God put an end to this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Reliable news arrives daily that Charles V will not attack the Swiss Confederates as long as he cannot divide them through bribery. The reports carry the fear that a large bribe has already been paid by the emperor. Vadian himself does not know what to make of it. May God prevent a division of the Confederates! Secretly, the rumor circulates (and this is only entrusted to Bullinger!) that a city of the Confederation has already made concessions to the emperor. It is reported with regret that one must be wary of betrayal and separation if Bern has already turned to the emperor. May God prevent it! However, Vadian rather thinks of Lucerne, from where a change in the mayor's office is reported. He fully trusts the old faithful places and adheres to the verse by Ennius, as quoted by Aulus Gellius, that rumors should not be placed before the common good.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Greetings. Bullinger should share the news relevant to St. Gallen [from the Baden Diet].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Sailer, our mutual friend, earnestly requests you to ensure that these letters, enclosed with mine, are delivered to our Dryander in Basel. For he has a great friendship and familiarity with such a learned and agreeable man, so it is no wonder that they frequently exchange many letters with each other.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have understood Antronius's ambition. I am amazed at the man's excessive desire and mindset, which is far removed from his profession. However, I know that he has long been more inclined towards the emperor than any other powerful prince and has not changed his opinion, unless he is as fickle as a leaf in the wind, as they say. For he has collaborated admirably with the imperial forces in recent years. Whether this was in his own name or on behalf of others, I do not know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Our people write from Lyon that the French king has sent some well-equipped cavalry and infantry units into that sloping or submontane Burgundy, which they call Bourg-en-Bresse. Some think they are meant for defense. Others suspect different things. Many are thinking about Strasbourg and are convinced that the city is dear to the French king.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is said to be certain that the emperor is now gathering the dregs of the Italian and Spanish military, previously scattered in the Swabian cities, and sending them into the Württemberg region.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It is also reported that the entire region along the Danube, which previously belonged to Otto Henry, Count Palatine, has been sold or at least pledged by the emperor to William of Bavaria, as they say. Several letters written to our people consistently assert this. For it is said that the Duke of Alba has already paid twenty thousand gold coins for this, which the emperor has given to this hero, not without reason.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>It cannot be lamented enough how terribly the garrisons in Nördlingen, Bopfingen, Giengen, Dinkelsbühl, and Ulm continually behave with women, children, and servants. May God change this. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Trusted people write daily: As long as the Swiss Confederates do not allow themselves to be divided and bribed with money, the emperor will not easily attack or undertake to fight them, etc. They write similarly, as they fear that a large sum of money has already been sent by the emperor to the Confederation to cause division. Whether there is any truth to this or not, I cannot know. May God faithfully prevent division among us. It is also written very confidentially and in complete secrecy (which I only reveal to you) that a prominent city of the Confederation has already turned its eyes and made some promises to the emperor, etc. And it is reported with some sadness, as one must be bold enough to say, that a large hole has already been made in the bear's skin and that one must expect division and betrayal or at least desertion. May God faithfully protect us from this. I have thought of Lucerne, whose mayor is rumored to have been removed from office by our people. However, I promise myself the best and most faithful from all the Cantons, so much so that I have claimed for myself the entire verse of Ennius about Flaminius, which Gellius has in his "Noctes Atticae": For he did not place rumors before safety.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell, and if there is anything from anywhere that you think concerns our city, I beg you, do not withhold it from me. St. Gallen, January 23, 1548.</p>
      <p>Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most candid man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed bishop of the illustrious city of Zurich.</p>
