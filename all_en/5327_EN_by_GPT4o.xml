      <p>Greetings. I beseech you, most illustrious and dearest godfather, to remember me in the appointment of ministers of the word of Christ.</p>
      <p>You know my misery, especially in the matter of grain with so many children, and since there is now no hope left with Th√§lliken, I would wish to go to Steinmur and act as the successor to the excellent Hiler in the ecclesiastical office. The place would be entirely suitable for my family to sustain them.</p>
      <p>In my place, another good brother can be elected, as the offspring would not be so numerous, etc. Give me your name and holy voice in the election; for it is of great energy, and my soul will live both in you and in my Lord Christ. May He take care of you, I pray from the heart.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily.</p>
      <p>From Oberglatt, May 18, in the year 62.</p>
      <p>Laurenz, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent minister of God, Heinrich Bullinger, the most circumspect pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed godfather, etc.</p>
