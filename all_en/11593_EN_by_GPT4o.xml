    <p xml:id="regest1">Understood that in Grynäus' lecture on the Lord's Supper according to 1 Corinthians 11, it is initially about the signs, then about the life-giving flesh of Christ, which is eaten through faith, which is a life-giving action of Christ in the believers. Grynäus deals with the signs only very briefly, therefore Bullinger immediately turns [1.] to the question of the life-giving flesh. He knows well how Cyril of Alexandria taught about it and what the Council of Ephesus decided in this regard, but reminds that the heretics Eutyches and Dioscorus also referred to Cyril; however, the Council of Chalcedon adhered to the distinction of the natures of Christ. Leo [I the Great] and especially Vigilius [of Thapsus], but also the Holy Scripture and even Cyril himself have expressed themselves in the same sense. That Christ's flesh gives life is valid only insofar as it is united with the divine nature of Christ in the person of the God-man. Some one-sidedness in this question is based on the attempt to pave the way for certain other teachings, but the middle way must not be abandoned here. The Holy Scripture teaches that "eating" stands for "believing," which Augustine, who has always been recognized as an authority by the Church, also confirms. The figurative way of speaking clarifies that Christ lives in us and strengthens us through faith. Bullinger rejects sophistries like the statement that faith is only the instrument to partake of life and admonishes apostolic simplicity. [2.] On the Lord's Supper: Bullinger considers the talk of a real, substantial offering of the body of Christ to be harmful; although the believer in a certain sense really eats the true flesh of Christ, it should be spoken of in a biblical manner. The starting point is Christ's work of salvation, of which we partake through faith; this is proclaimed to the believers through preaching and sacraments. God has added signs to the word, which convey the same thing in a different way, but the external and internal, earthly and heavenly must not be mixed. The holy act of the Lord's Supper is instituted by God to seal his promise, to remind us of the Lord's death, to present the heavenly gifts to faith, to unite us into one body, and to call us to thanks and praise. The Lord himself instituted it, and with regard to the author, we receive the meal as if from God's hands. It is about the promise, as in preaching, that Christ died for us, not about the promise of his physical connection with the bread; Christ is present and works life-giving in the hearts of believers, but faith does not need a physical presence. Bread and wine were called body and blood because of their similarity to what they represent, as Augustine also teaches; but Christ's body remains, like the sun, in heaven. He instituted the rite as a seal of his promised benefits. This also reminds us of his sacrificial death, not only as something past but as an event that concerns us. It is important to ensure that, as in the early Church, a clear distinction is made between sign and signified. Moreover, through the meal, we are united with Christ and with each other into one body, and finally, it reminds us of our duty to praise and thank. [3.] On the objections discussed by Grynäus: Bullinger decisively rejects his considerations on the body of Christ, as he compares Christ with the sun in the sky but follows the false doctrine that the body of Christ has no fixed place. With the reference to the connection of both natures, Grynäus seems to want to attribute properties to the body of Christ that exceed our understanding; but one must not follow either Nestorius or Eutyches here, but must adhere to the correct distinction of the natures, which is not called into question by the conception of Christ from the Holy Spirit. The exaltation "above all heavens" does not mean that Christ's body is freed from limitation, but emphasizes the contrast to humiliation. Christ is in heaven, where according to his promise we will also be. His "name above all names" points to his dominion; according to his human nature, he remains nevertheless created and nameable. This corresponds to what Vigilius writes about the name of Christ: Christ remains the "Son of Man" even in heaven. The non-localizable body of Christ is a fiction; the words of institution deal with the true body, which was given and now dwells in heaven, while Christ works independently of place in those participating in the meal. This doctrine is scriptural and agrees with the faith of the fathers. If Christ, by virtue of his divine nature, walked through closed doors and over water, this does not contradict the human limitation of his body. The fathers who lived before Christ's birth were not only nourished by the word but enjoyed the whole Christ in faith in the word that was to become flesh. Finally, Grynäus' interpretation of unworthy eating is unclear; whoever does not believe receives only the sign; Bullinger hopes that the Basel Church will also remain faithful to the clear teaching of Oecolampadius in this regard. He apologizes for his frank words and asks Grynäus to refrain from publishing his lecture. In view of Grynäus' accompanying letter [No. 1549], he renews the complaint about his illegible handwriting.

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have read your dictations on the 11th chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians about the Lord's Supper, Grynäus, my beloved and most esteemed brother, and as much as I could grasp with the limitation of my understanding, I understood that you first deal with the signs and their differences, then assert that the flesh of Christ is life-giving, as it is consumed to give life, and is eaten by faith, but that faith is not merely the understanding and apprehension of the matter proposed by the word, but also the heavenly, effective, and life-giving operation of Christ in the faithful.</p>
      <p>[1.] I am not unaware that the question about the signs and their differences is laborious, which you would undoubtedly have treated more thoroughly if you had not believed that those few things would suffice for your purpose; therefore, I thought I should move on to the subsequent discussion about the life-giving flesh of Christ. I know, most learned Grynäus, what Cyril of Alexandria decreed about the life-giving flesh of Christ against the doctrine of Nestorius together with the synod that convened at Alexandria, and what anathemas he made, how he was criticized by Theodoret, bishop of Cyrus, and how he was refuted by him in turn; again, what the synod that gathered at Ephesus defined through the work of the same Cyril. Meanwhile, I am also not unaware that, while he argues subtly enough and somewhat obscurely against Nestorius - whose doctrine no sane person ever approved as sufficiently rash - he provides Eutyches and Dioscorus with ample opportunity to depart from the orthodox confession. For while the unfortunate are held by excessive reverence for Cyril and see with what zeal and fervor he urges and defends the union of the natures of Christ, refuting and attacking their division, they are finally led to say that because of the unity of the person, there is also one nature in Christ; hence they departed from the property of the natures and affirmed that even the divinity suffered. I do not here invent anything to the discredit of the excellent man Cyril. For the martyr Vigilius explicitly testifies that the Eutychians, relying on Cyril's authority, produced various testimonies for themselves from him; although they abused them, it is nevertheless clear that Cyril, with his subtle disputation, provided these wretched people with ample opportunity to stumble. Therefore, the synod of Chalcedon was convened under the emperors Valentinian and Marcian, and 630 bishops and fathers gathered and decreed in this manner: "We confess one and the same Christ, the Lord, the only-begotten, to be known in two natures without confusion, without change, without division, without separation, the distinction of the natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather the property of each nature being preserved and concurring in one person and one substance, not as divided or separated into two persons, but one and the same only-begotten Son, God, Word, Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
      <p>You have undoubtedly seen what Leo the bishop wrote most learnedly and piously about this question in his letter 5 to Flavian, the bishop of Constantinople, also in letter 53 to Leo Augustus and to the Palestinians in letter 41. However, the holy martyr Vigilius surpassed him in faith, diligence, and purity, who published five most learned and pious books on the same subject. I would indeed wish that the writings of these most holy and learned men were as frequently and diligently handled by some as they gladly use the testimonies of the most obscure author Cyril. The Lord indeed said in John: "He who eats me will live because of me" [John 6:57 (Vulg. 58)]. But if anyone wishes to abruptly conclude from this that it is proper to the flesh to give life, in my opinion, he can hardly be acquitted of the crime of mixing the natures and their properties.</p>
      <p>Christ indeed gives life, and indeed wholly, as he is both God and man; nevertheless, each of the natures in him retains its own character. Hence life is properly of Christ, but insofar as he is God; for insofar as he is a true man, he is also given life by God. For he did not say rashly and without cause in the same John: "As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father" [John 6:57 (Vulg. 58)]. Then he adds: "And he who eats me will live because of me" [ibid.]. And again: "The flesh profits nothing; it is the spirit that gives life" [John 6:63 (Vulg. 64)]. This pertains to what the ancients discussed about the communication of idioms. Add to this what Cyril himself says in book 4 on John, chapter 24: "The nature of the flesh itself cannot give life by itself. For what would it have greater than the nature of the deity? Nor is it understood to be alone in Christ, but it has the Son of God joined to it, who is substantially life. Therefore, when Christ calls it life-giving, he does not attribute to it the power of giving life as he does to himself or to his own spirit. For the spirit gives life because of itself, to whose power the flesh ascends through union. But how this happens, we can neither understand with the mind nor express with the tongue," and what follows.</p>
      <p>He teaches similar things in book 11 on John, chapter 22, towards the end. Therefore, it would be safest in this matter if someone acts moderately here and does not allow himself too much, lest, while fleeing Scylla, he falls into Charybdis. Therefore, I extol these golden words of the holy martyr Vigilius in every way and observe them as a Cynosure, by which in book 2 Against Eutyches he rightly defines the Lord's discourse: "When we say the Lord suffered and died, let Nestorius not be afraid, because we say it according to the union of the person. Again, when we say the Lord neither suffered nor died, because he is altogether impassible, let Eutyches not fear, because we say it according to the property of the nature, and more we do not say, but the scriptures speak. For the apostle handed down that the Lord suffered, saying: 'For if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory' [1 Cor. 2:8]. Again, it is taught by apostolic authority that God did not suffer. For the apostle Peter says: 'Christ suffered in the flesh' [1 Pet. 4:1]. Therefore, suffering properly pertains to the flesh according to nature, but to the Word according to the person, because the person of the Word and the flesh is one and the same, and therefore God both suffered and did not suffer: suffered according to the union of the person, impassible according to the property of the nature." These are the words of Vigilius. Therefore, I confess that the flesh of Christ is life-giving according to the union of the person, I add that it is not life-giving according to the property of the nature. If this is granted to me, I accept the word: "the flesh of Christ is life-giving," and I ask that it be clearly explained, so that it may not be an occasion for any wicked fall. But if it is denied to me, Grynäus, I do not accept it; for I know what those obscure expressions and their licentious use have brought forth for the church, what sects and how many quarrels they have stirred up. Moreover, if the authority of Cyril is objected to me, if the doctrine of Nestorius is imputed to me, I oppose Cyril to Cyril himself along with Leo and Vigilius, I also deny with all my heart the foolish doctrine of Nestorius, indeed I bring forward for myself the teacher of the Gentiles Paul, who teaching to properly express and confess the property of the natures says in Romans 1: "Paul, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures, concerning his Son, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was declared to be the Son of God with power" [Rom. 1:1-4]. Behold, the apostle Paul has provided us with these formulas to explain this mystery, namely: Christ is the seed of David according to humanity or the flesh and is the Son of God according to divinity. To these, indeed, it is permissible to add: Christ is mortal and not life-giving according to the property of human nature, but immortal and life-giving according to the property of divine nature. Nevertheless, Christ is the same and not divided, yet there is one nature of divinity in him, another of humanity. For as it is irreligious to separate the person, so it is sacrilegious not to discern the natures, but rather to confuse them. Whoever is the author of the ecclesiastical definitions or dogmas has collected this matter into a few sentences, for he says: "We do not confess two Christs nor two sons, but one Son, God and man, whom we therefore call only-begotten, remaining in two substances, as the truth of nature has bestowed upon him, not with the natures confused nor mixed, as the Timotheans wish, but united by association. Therefore, God assumed man, man was transformed into God, not by the convertibility of nature, as the Apollinarists say, but by the condescension of God, so that neither God was changed into human substance by assuming man nor man into divine by being glorified into God, because the change or convertibility of nature causes both the diminution and abolition of substance." Thus far that author.</p>
      <p>I have explained these things to you somewhat more extensively, so that I might confess to you frankly, copiously, and clearly my faith in this matter, in which some, in my opinion, seem to lean too much to one side; perhaps because it seems to pave the way for some of their other doctrines to be elevated.</p>
      <p>I believe that one should proceed neither to the right nor to the left, but in the royal way. The rest will be said in its place.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the doctrine of eating the true body of the Lord by faith is the ancient teaching of Christ, his apostles, and the universal church throughout the world. For the Lord Jesus himself used "to believe" or "to trust" and "to eat" or "to drink" for the same thing, which we prove by these testimonies: "I am the bread of life," says the Lord, "he who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst" [John 6:35]. What could be said more plainly than this? For where he had said: "he who eats me shall never hunger," there he replaced "to eat" with "to come." After a few sentences, he says: "Everyone who has heard from the Father and learned comes to me" [John 6:45]. And Paul: "He who comes must believe" [Heb. 11:6], whence he understood one for the other and put "to come" for "to believe." And more significantly: "He who believes in me," he says, "shall never thirst" [John 6:35]; but he would have said: "He who drinks me shall never thirst," unless he had used one for the other. Likewise: "This is the will of him who sent me, the Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day" [John 6:40], and: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day" [John 6:54 (Vulg. 55)]. Behold how everything agrees and through the same steps one arrives at immortality. Again: "Amen, amen, I say to you," says the Lord, "he who trusts in me has eternal life" [John 6:47], and: "I am the bread of life" [John 6:48], "he who eats of this bread shall live forever" [John 6:51 (Vulg. 52)]. And again: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him" [John 6:56 (Vulg. 57)]. But in 1 John 4 [15] John, imbued with the same spirit, says: "Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God." Likewise, John 15 [4] the Lord says: "Abide in me, and I in you." "Abide, I say, in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love" [John 15:9f]. Whence John in his canonical letter: "He who keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us" [1 John 3:24]. But this is the spirit of the sons. All who believe are sons of God; therefore, "to believe" and "to eat" are the same and are used for the same thing. And although these things, because they are divine, are held firm enough by themselves, I could nevertheless produce innumerable sentences of the holy fathers who think the same; but I will be content with the testimony of one Augustine. Therefore, in his Tractate on John 25 on these words of the Lord: "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent" [John 6:29] etc.: "This is therefore to eat the food," he says, "which does not perish, but which remains unto eternal life. Why do you prepare the tooth and the stomach? Believe, and you have eaten." However, this holy man explained not only what he felt in his own age, but he explained the sense of the catholic church. Moreover, he was always of such faith and authority in the western churches that Pope Celestine testifies about him and says: "Augustine, a man of holy memory, whom we always had in our communion for his life and merits, whom no rumor of sinister suspicion ever touched, whom we remember to have been of such knowledge that he was always held among the best teachers even before by my predecessors." This Celestine lived around the year of the Lord 430 under the reign of Theodosius and Valentinian. Hence it is surprising with what face or confidence some dare today to elevate the authority of such a man, which was plainly sacrosanct to the ancients throughout the church. But such are our times, and thus we are accustomed to repay good grace to those who have deserved well.</p>
      <p>Although indeed "to believe" or "to trust" and "to eat" or "to drink" are used for the same thing by the Lord, yet the speech is more splendid and august, and also more pleasing and clearer to us, when it is clothed and adorned with allegory. For by the comparison of things we arrive more rightly and easily at the true knowledge of things. For we gather the unknown from the more known. Therefore, in the present case, wishing to teach why and for whom he came into the world, what fruit comes to us from it, how it is to be received by us, and what is the power of faith by which the Lord is received, Christ could not propose it better and more vividly than by the allegory of food and drink. For just as food and drink give life, strengthen, and preserve the body in the body, so the incarnate Word, the Son of God and the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, is the bread, food, or nourishment of the soul. For Christ alone gives life, saves, and preserves in every good work, who alone gives that we may will and do good things.</p>
      <p>But food does none of this in a person by mere sight and touch, unless it is also consumed; thus Christ will give life to no one, will be saving to no one from the fact that he hears the preaching of the gospel about Christ, unless he also believes. For by eating, food becomes one's own, is transferred and digested, so that it may suffice for life and strength. Therefore, by faith, Christ becomes ours, by faith he communicates all his goods and gifts to the faithful, gives life and suffices strength, and works effectively and thus lives wholly in his own, namely when we believe that Christ was incarnated, died, and was resurrected for us and therefore his life is ours, his innocence is ours, and the whole Christ is ours. For thus he prepared himself as food for us and therefore died, partly to satisfy divine justice for us, partly so that we might have faith in him and not doubt the benevolence and grace of the Father. For Paul argues thus: "He who did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?" [Rom. 8:32]. And the Lord himself: "The bread," he says, "which I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world" [John 6:51 (Vulg. 52)], that is, this will sustain and preserve the world, that my body is to be given for the world. For as often as it comes to the mind of a sinner: "You are wicked, with the wicked there is no commerce with the most pure deity, therefore you have perished," so often the most pure flesh of Christ, given into death, our righteousness, sanctification, satisfaction, and redemption, commands us to hope well. For thus the faithful reckons with himself: "Unless you were pleasing to God, he would not have made his only-begotten a victim for you." From this benefit, therefore, he dares to cast himself into the mercy of God and to give himself to his grace, whence he becomes a partaker of the most precious dish. Now indeed, as food by its power invigorates, nourishes, does not idle, so Christ works in his own, is felt, nourishes, and lives, and thus faith itself, the gift of God and the working power of Christ, does this.</p>
      <p>For the scripture attributes life both to Christ living in his own and to true faith, through which he lives in his own. For Paul from the prophets: "The just shall live by faith" [Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11; Heb. 10:38; cf. Hab. 2:4]. And the Baptist: "He who believes in the Son has eternal life, he who does not believe will not have life" [John 3:36]. The Lord himself also says explicitly: "This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent" [John 17:3]. Again, the apostle John writes: "This is the testimony, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He who has the Son has life, he who does not have the Son of God does not have life" [1 John 5:11f]. Moreover, the Baptist has just said that he who believes has life [John 3:36]. Most clearly of all, Saint Paul to the Galatians: "I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me" etc. [Gal. 2:20].</p>
      <p>From all these things you easily understand that we confess the true eating of the true Christ with the apostolic church, and we confess that the eating itself is faith; by faith we do not understand mere speculation and knowledge or understanding, but at the same time the effective operation and vivification of Christ in us. For first faith understands and apprehends, then having apprehended, it adheres and participates in the power and goods of him to whom it adheres. Because therefore it adheres and relies on Christ, the Son of God, it participates in his power, and thus faith itself, because it is the power and operation of Christ, gives life, when the life of Christ becomes ours, so that the prophets and apostles truly said that the just lives by his faith. Therefore, in my opinion, those seem to be too subtle who almost with a contentious rope placed in the middle cry out that the eating of the body of Christ is not faith, but the consequence and effect of faith. Thus indeed it also seems subtle what you write: "Faith is the instrument of participating in life, it is not life." By the same reasoning, it will follow that faith is not righteousness, but the instrument of participating in righteousness. How much difference do you think there is between righteousness and life, and between justification and vivification?</p>
      <p>Surely the prophets and apostles taught with great constancy that the just lives by faith, that faith is life and righteousness. Or do you think that the apostles examined the place of causes with such curiosity and diligence or distinguished the differences of things with the point of a needle? Therefore, I would wish, most humane Grynäus, that you and men like you, learned and not only exercised but also accomplished in every kind of doctrine, would study apostolic simplicity more than philosophical subtlety.</p>
      <p>Indeed, these dictations of yours and all your other writings are learned, erudite, but meanwhile too subtle. Therefore, I praise the sublimity of your genius, the gravity of your diction, the ornaments, the exquisite structure of your arguments, and finally the spirit of philosophy everywhere exerting itself; meanwhile, however, while everything is too laborious and elaborate, they have obscurity and in obscurity their own dangers conjoined. Indeed, your writings require a most attentive reader, lest he anywhere fall away from himself, unless they find a most learned and exercised one, who is wise by himself and who has nothing to learn. Therefore, I praise more the simplicity joined with purity in theological matters. For it is not in vain that the works of the prophets and apostles were proposed to the world in common and simple diction. Indeed, the divine Paul glories that he came to Greece, where disciplines always flourished, not with the eminence of speech and wisdom, but with the simple preaching of the crucified: "For my speech and my preaching," he says, "was not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God" [1 Cor. 2:4f]. I do not write these things because I wish barbarism to be brought back and all erudition to be relegated into exile, but because I wish excessive subtleties to be tempered by the simplicity of the Holy Spirit. For thus we will use a pure style of speaking, but nevertheless common and alien to all subtleties.</p>
      <p>[2.] You then come to the Lord's Supper, in which you think and teach that the very flesh of the Lord and the very blood of the Lord are essentially offered really. But I truly hate from the heart these words "substantially," "essentially," "really," and "corporally," and if there are any others similar to these, in the matter of the Lord's Supper, nor will I ever use them in this cause as long as I live. For I know that more harm than benefit grows for the church from them. Histories testify what disturbances they have stirred up for 500 years; the experience of our age also teaches what utility the church expects from them even today. In a certain way, it is indeed true that the faithful really eat the substantial flesh of Christ. For the true and natural flesh of Christ and no other was given for us unto death, and of it and no other did the Lord say: "My flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink" [John 6:55 (Vulg. 56)]. Then faith, by which the flesh of Christ is eaten, relies not on an imaginary thing, but on a true one. For it is not the thought of Christ's passion that liberates us, but the very passion of the Lord, which we apprehend by faith to have been done for us, etc. But when it is thus brought forward: "The body of Christ is eaten really corporally," who in our age - except for a few long exercised in this cause - does not understand that the body of Christ is eaten corporally by a miracle and not spiritually by faith? Hence, therefore, I do not see what can be born except the disturbance of the churches. You say: "Therefore we command the mysteries to be explained to the churches." The condition is very pleasing, but we want such an explanation that explains, not entangles; we also want and ask for plain words and sentences not ambiguous and obscure, so that the hearer may understand clearly what is in this matter, what he eats or what he does not eat.</p>
      <p>We think, however, that this is the way of explaining the mystery of the Supper both the clearest and the safest and most salutary, if we follow the way proposed in scripture.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it must be taught seriously and with utmost faith, who Christ is, what he contributed to the world by his death, that is, what is the fruit of his passion and how this fruit is applied and communicated to us. But Christ is true God and man, consubstantial with the Father according to divinity, consubstantial with us according to humanity, who came into the world to redeem sinners. For the whole world was subject to sin and consigned to eternal death, from which it could not be liberated except by the innocent death of Christ. Therefore, the death of Christ contributed to the world that it reconciled sinners to God and gave life to the dead. Moreover, that redeemer willed that all men should become partakers of this grace, redemption, and life through faith in him. Therefore, he applies his merit to the faithful through faith. Hence, as many as believe that Christ suffered for them and that Christ has become theirs, are inserted into Christ as branches into the vine, communicate with Christ in all goods, especially life, so that they live in Christ and Christ in them. And this indeed is the true and only way of salvation, which is announced to men and retained by the preaching of the word and the exercise of sacramental signs.</p>
      <p>I will not now speak of the word, since it is evident that we speak of the word of the gospel and the external ministry, which the internal teacher makes effective. To the word and the preaching of the gospel, the Lord added sacramental signs, not to do anything other than what he did with those, but the same thing, although in a different way. He willed that life and the communion of all goods in Christ through faith be announced to the world by the word. He instituted that this same thing be signified by signs, except that words are poured into the ears. But by signs, the things announced are in a way presented to the eyes. However, he would undoubtedly be considered insane here who would mix the word and what is signified and announced by the words, so that the hearer would not know what the word is, what also is signified by the word, nor could he discern any longer because of that mixture what is proper to God and what to man, what to the internal or external teacher.</p>
      <p>Hence, those do not seem to think rightly who in the Lord's Supper mix everything in such a way that the participant cannot discern between earthly and heavenly things, between those things that are perceived by faith and spiritually, and those that are perceived by mouth and sacramentally.</p>
      <p>The Supper is truly a sacred action consisting of words or promise and prescribed rite, instituted by God for the church for this purpose, to seal the divine promise, to retain the memory of the Lord's death, to present the heavenly gifts to be received by faith with visible things and to set them before the eyes, finally, to visibly gather us into one body and to remind us of our duty, especially of thanksgiving and praise. In this description, I think, there is nothing obscure.</p>
      <p>We have said that the action is the Supper, and not just any, but sacred, as it is divinely instituted for the church. For the Lord says: "Do this," namely what he himself did first: "And he took bread" etc. [Luke 22:19; 1 Cor. 11:23f].</p>
      <p>And the apostle testifying that it was divinely instituted for the church says: "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you" [1 Cor. 11:23]. He would not have delivered it to the church unless he had received it to deliver. Hence we further gather that the Lord's Supper is to be received from the hands of ministers not as men, but as from God, when the institution and author are to be regarded here, not the minister. Now indeed what kind of sacred action it is and what the mind of the author is, this also does not seem to be obscure from the fact that it is added that it consists of the word or promise and the prescribed rite.</p>
      <p>But the word and promise here is no other than what is proposed in the preaching of the gospel, namely that the Son of God gave his body for sinners unto death and shed his blood for the remission of sins.</p>
      <p>In the preaching of the word, he commands this to be believed, here he commands it to be received and eaten, namely to believe that it was done for us, that is, he commanded us to enjoy it and live in it. Therefore, the promise proposed here is not what some believe, that the Lord promises to be in the bread corporally or to convert the bread into his body transubstantially, or that he wishes to adhere and be eaten with the bread invisibly and yet really, but that he gives his body for us unto death, sheds his blood for the remission of sins.</p>
      <p>For there is no other presence of the Lord in the sign by the power of the sign than in the word by the power of the word to be established here. But the Lord works life-giving salvation in the hearers and is not absent from his word, but acts and lives present in the hearts of the faithful.</p>
      <p>Thus indeed the Lord is not absent in the celebration of his Supper. For by his faith and spirit he lives in the saints, that is, he communicates to his own the fruit obtained by his bodily death, namely life, the redemption of sins, and every good. And as in the preaching of the word no piety commands to dispute about the bodily presence of the Lord in the word, so no religion demands that the flesh of Christ be present either visibly or invisibly in the celebration of the Lord's Supper. "Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many, δευτέρου - secondarily or again - he will appear without sin to those who wait for him unto salvation." You undoubtedly recognize the words of the apostle in Hebrews 9 [28]. But even the evangelical centurion hears from the Lord himself about his faith: "I have not found such great faith in Israel" [Matt. 8:10; Luke 7:9]. But what kind of faith was that? He believes that the Lord by his power, if he wills, can heal his servant, although he does not come into the house corporally.</p>
      <p>Therefore, our souls are saved by the death of Christ, provided we believe from the heart, so that it is not necessary for the body of the Lord to be present at the Supper either miraculously or in any other ineffable way corporally.</p>
      <p>What is objected to the word of the Lord: "This is my body" [Matt. 26:26 par.], can be explained from the comparison of other sacraments and the nature of sacraments. Circumcision is called a "covenant" in Gen. 17 [11], the rite of feasting in Exod. 12 [11] "the Lord's Passover." Sacrifices are called "sins" and "sanctifications," baptism "the washing away of sins," but because of similarity. Hence Augustine said that sacraments are called by the names of the things of which they are sacraments. Testimonies exist in the Epistle to Boniface 23, to Euodius 102, and in the Tractate on John 63. Therefore, bread is called "body" and wine "blood" because of similarity, not because of a miracle or nature. For bread is the sign of the body and wine of the blood. For the body of Christ remains in heaven like the sun and yet pours its life-giving power into the hearts of the faithful, so that they truly and fully participate in Christ himself, the true God and man, but not corporally, spiritually and by power. These things about the promise.</p>
      <p>To the promise is added the rite as a speaking picture, and that speaking which is represented by the rite. The prescribed rite is, nor is it permitted to invent another as far as substance is concerned. He prescribed this rite, he commands to gather in assembly, in this to take bread, to break, to distribute, etc.</p>
      <p>But what this rite speaks as a silent picture, we will understand from the consequences. First, it publicly and outwardly seals the divine promise and the very benefit of God to us. Indeed, the faithful are sealed in the spirit as a pledge in 2 Cor. 1 [22], to which because of our weakness (for nothing external by itself is completed or perfected) he joined an external ceremony, by which - as often elsewhere - he imitates the custom of men, who, if they promise a valuable thing, do not think it enough to have promised, unless they also seal it with tablets and a seal. Therefore, the Lord instituted this rite of the Supper as a seal of his benefit for the church.</p>
      <p>Hence we believe that the tablets and seals, witnesses of the divine benefits of the church, are brought forward as often as the sacred Supper of the Lord is celebrated. For by this the Lord signifies and attests that he has given himself for us unto death, etc., that he has become entirely ours, that he wills and desires that we enjoy him; therefore, he commanded to eat, to take in hand, to break, so that we may know and nowhere doubt that all things of Christ are ours.</p>
      <p>Moreover, by this rite and manner, the memory of the Lord's death and resurrection, the compendium of God's benefits, is retained in the church. For he himself instituting this sacred thing said: "Do this in remembrance of me" [Luke 22:19; 1 Cor. 11:24f]. And Paul: "You proclaim the Lord's death until he comes" [1 Cor. 11:26]. But that memory is of a thing that pertains to us most, and not of a past thing that pertains nothing to us; although the past thing is signified to us, namely the passion of the Lord. This, however, is represented and as it were proposed anew to the eyes of the mind to be contemplated. Visible things also allude to invisible things and in their own way speak before us what was done once and elsewhere. The bread is broken, the wine is poured: These speak of the body of the Lord broken for us and the blood shed. Indeed, we break the bread because we bear the guilt of the death of Christ; for he himself bore our infirmities and carried our sins. I do not wish to pursue more copiously and laboriously here what the spirit and analogy suggest to pious hearts here.</p>
      <p>However, it must be diligently explained to the church here that, just as two things are to be considered in the sacraments, the sign and the thing signified, the earthly and the heavenly, the visible and the invisible, so each remains in its own nature and substance, its own property being preserved and not communicated to the other, except by the communication of the sacrament and idioms. Those who mix these things with each other obscure the sacramental cause; they sin more foully who, having evacuated the signs, wish everything to be substantial. The ancient church from apostolic tradition distinctly distributed to Christ his ministry in the sacraments, to the ministers theirs, and so also to the signs and the things signified. You know what Augustine discusses in the Tractate on John 5. Moreover, we are gathered into one body in the Lord's Supper. First indeed by faith spiritually with Christ, of whose members we are made and partakers of all good.</p>
      <p>Then with the church, to which we are visibly connected by the public profession of our faith, which we open to our brothers in the Supper, also promising faith and duties of humanity to our fellow members. Of which communion the apostle spoke in 1 Cor. 10 [16f]. Finally, we are admonished by this rite of our duty, that mindful of whose body we have been made members, we live holy, unblemished, and in unfeigned love, but especially that we praise and give the greatest thanks to the redeemer for the benefit bestowed by God. Thus, I say, I believe the matter of the Supper can be explained as simply as possible and the church can understand what is done and eaten here, when it knows beautifully how to distinguish between faith and the benefits of God, finally between the word and the signs, when it understands what is to be attributed to the signs, why this rite was instituted, what it signifies, and what are the other considerations of this.</p>
      <p>[3.] I now come to your objections, which you treat, build, and destroy: You institute a discussion about the body of Christ, which indeed could not displease more. You say the body of the Lord is present in the Supper not locally and circumscriptively, but by power and virtue. You add an elegant simile: "For if the body of the sun, being far away, is present by power, how will Christ, the same man and God, lack his power among us?" Indeed, you say this truly and rightly, if you understand the true body of the Lord according to its nature and property to act far from us in heaven, but to be present by its power, that is, Christ remaining in heaven by his body to work the effect of his passion in us. But you seem to follow something far different, namely that Christ received into glory is now contained by no place, and thus that body exempt from all locality is at hand. But I know, most dear Grynäus, who first spread this doctrine in the church, who still strive with hands and feet that it be received as true and orthodox, which nevertheless the sons of God will never do. And would that they had done something better and more useful when they proposed that doctrine to the church, along with it infinite questions and quarrels never to be ended. But I also pray the Lord to open the eyes and mind of my Grynäus, that he may judge more rightly about these things sometime. For it is a new doctrine, believe me, most beloved Grynäus, which they teach that the body of Christ received into heaven is contained by no place and has been made unplaceable. For the apostolic scripture and the ancient church distinctly taught and believed that the true body of the Lord assumed into heaven remains a true body in heaven, and so true that it acts truly and corporally in a place and is not diffused through all things with divinity. I will be able to prove this clearly, copiously, and irrefutably with divine and human testimonies if necessary. But at present, I will respond to yours.</p>
      <p>You write that the body united in one person with God exerts life-giving power ineffably in all things and is present by its power in all things. In which argument I conjecture that the main thing you rely on is that you say the body is united in one person with God. Because the humanity is united with divinity, therefore you think you can more rightly conclude that the body of the Lord is more widely diffused and extended than common understanding perceives. This navigation is indeed difficult and full of dangers. For from here Nestorius threatens shipwreck, from there the rock of Eutychian madness promises itself. But for me to have a safe and secure navigation, I will go most safely in the middle, and I confess that there is one indivisible and inseparable person of Christ, but the natures meanwhile are distinct in their own property cohering in the union of the person not mixed. Hence I confess that Christ, true God and man, is present in all things, but according to the divine nature, not present in all things according to the human nature, and that ineffable union does not cause anything alien to the property of a true body to be attributed to the body of the Lord, unless it is done by the communication of idioms, not by the confusion of natures. "This flesh," you say, "was conceived of the Holy Spirit ineffably." I do not deny it, but what will you conclude from it? Nevertheless, it is true and human flesh that was conceived, although it was conceived of the Spirit. Locally he was contained in the womb of the Virgin, he grew in his own growths, and after a certain time elapsed, which men are accustomed to be born, the most holy Son of God was brought forth into the light. "Above heaven," you say, "and all locality and inclusion and above the reason of nature it has been exalted." That I finally deny and deny again. You prove: "For what place is above all heavens? And what law and condition of nature, where no name exists?" To which, as far as I understand, you allude to the words of Paul, which are read in Eph. 4 [10] and Phil. 2 [9]. Why do you not add a third testimony, which some use: "What eye has not seen and ear has not heard" etc., 1 Cor. 2 [9]? I am indeed surprised that the first authors of this doctrine did not impose the doctrine on firmer supports. For those places, on which they seem to rely, are plainly twisted from their genuine sense. And the scripture elsewhere everywhere teaches that the Lord Jesus has been received into heaven, whence it is likely that Paul to the Ephesians did not wish to place him outside heaven, but rather used an amplification by which he wished to signify that the body of the Lord, which was previously indeed cast down to extreme ignominy, has been received into the highest glory. For the apostle opposed two members to each other: "That 'he ascended' what is it, but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?" [Eph. 4:9]. And he adds: "He who descended is the same who ascended above all heavens" [Eph. 4:10]. He opposes "to descend into the lower parts of the earth" and "to ascend above all heavens" to each other. But who concludes thus: "Christ descended into the lower parts of the earth, therefore he had no place on earth"? For all understand that Paul understood these things as a figure of speech to mean the utmost humility and dejection of Christ. Why then do they conclude: "Christ ascended above all heavens, therefore he is not in a place, because what place is outside and above all heavens?" Why do they not understand that Paul here wished to say nothing else than what he more significantly put in Phil. [2:9]: He exalted him into the highest sublimity?</p>
      <p>Therefore, through my rusticity and simplicity, not at all philosophical, I firmly believe that the blessed flesh of Christ ascended into heaven and remained in heaven, not outside heaven, or, as I would say more significantly in German, für den himel ußhin elatam esse. For the truth pronounced: "Where I am, there will my servant be also" [John 12:26]. But we will be in heaven, not outside heaven or above heaven, outside all place, that is, nowhere. But Paul, the vessel of election, distinctly said: "Our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Savior" [Phil. 3:20]. To which agree in all things what he also taught in 2 Cor. 5 [1]. To these, these I believe and know, indeed I am certain that I believe rightly and truly, and I believe from the heart what I profess. But see for yourself, Grynäus, where you learned what you so confidently teach: that Christ has been exalted above all heavens and that there is no place above all heavens.</p>
      <p>The Lord in the gospel says: "In my Father's house are many mansions (if it were not so, I would have told you); now I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there you may be also" [John 14:2f]. Behold, what can be said more clearly? "In my Father's house," he says, "are many mansions." "Mansions," I say, he says, "are," and "are in my Father's house." But the Father is in heaven. He adds: "I go to prepare a place for you." Why then do you say there is no place? Moreover, lest you answer that we have a place, Christ does not have one, the truth also says there is a place where Christ is. For he adds: "I will receive you unto myself." Behold, not just to me, but more significantly πρὸς ἐµαυτόν, to myself, he says and adds even more significantly: "that where I am, there you may be also." "Where," he says, "I am." Therefore, Christ is in heaven as in a place. But we will be in heaven as in a place. The truth said this, it cannot be otherwise. Since these things are altogether so, Grynäus, I can hardly say how much your statement offended me.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the place of Paul in Phil. 2 [9] plainly does not teach that by exaltation Christ according to human nature has stripped off all human condition or that we cannot now speak of Christ assumed or give him any name or even assign a place; but as he prefaced the humiliation of Christ with words wonderfully appropriate and humble and creeping on the ground, so he subjoins his glorification with plainly grandiloquent and almost ethereal words, indeed he himself explaining adds: "that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth" [Phil. 2:10]. Thus, I say, he exalted the name of Christ above all names, which he declared to be the one whom heaven, earth, and hell revere, the Lord, I say, of all creation; indeed "that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father" [Phil. 2:11]. We must confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, and indeed the Lord of all, the liberator and defender, of the same power and glory with the Father; which does not detract from the glory of the Father, as the Arians complained, but to the glory of the Father. For he himself said in the gospel, John 5 [23]: "He has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him." And again John 17 [5]: "And now, Father, glorify me with the glory which I had with you before the world was." But he had from the beginning the glorious name of God, which is above all names. But through incarnation and the ignominious cross, the divine glory in Christ seemed both obscured and taken away; therefore, the Father restores and illuminates the Son by resurrection and assumption into heaven. Thus, I say, he gives him "the name which is above every name" [Phil. 2:9], declares him to be the Lord of all things. For thus also Peter in Acts 2 [22-36] after expounding the true resurrection and ascension of Christ to heaven subjoins and concludes as Paul the colleague: "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ" [Acts 2:36]. Therefore, Paul by "the name which is above every name" understood the blessed name of the Lord God and eternal glory. But you interpret as if no name can be given to Christ in glory or no place assigned, and you err plainly. For the apostle did not mean that. Certainly, according to the divine nature, no one has given any name to Christ. But because the human creature in him was not annihilated by clarification nor absorbed by divinity, but remains a true creature and a true body, it can be named by name.</p>
      <p>Listen, I pray, Grynäus, to what the holy martyr Vigilius, bishop of Tridentum, writes about the name of Jesus existing in heaven in book 1 Against the Eutychians almost at the end: "But perhaps while he was still on earth," he says, "he was of both natures, but after he ascended to heaven, he began to be of one, the divine; and what then does the name of the Son of Man do there, if the nature of humanity is not there? How is an empty name ascribed to an existing thing? Or how does the truth of the name remain if the property of the nature is absent? Finally, he says: 'When the Son of Man comes in the glory of his Father' [Mark 8:38]. And again: 'As the lightning comes out of the east and shines even unto the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be' [Matt. 24:27]. And again: 'When the Son of Man comes, do you think he will find faith on the earth?' [Luke 18:8]. Daniel also: 'Behold,' he says, 'one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven' [Dan. 7:13]. If therefore the nature of humanity is lost, why is its name to be recounted? Or because a name was needed, and the thing of the name as not necessary was to be rejected? Thus let those who are not ashamed of their error and folly be foolish. But the Lord Jesus Christ, to show that the nature of our kind was not consumed, truly calls himself the Son of Man, according to which he also intercedes with the Father for us according to the words of the apostle John," and what follows in that author. Now indeed the place of the apostle in the Corinthians is not to be twisted to place, but rather to be explained about the greatness of joys, which the very context of the diction demands.</p>
      <p>Again, you add that Christ sits ineffably at the right hand of the Father and heap up many other ineffable things, so that you may more conveniently infer that Christ is contained and present ineffably in the Supper, namely that true body unplaceable.</p>
      <p>However, I have demonstrated above clearly enough, I think, that the mode of the presence of Christ is plain, simple, exposed, and therefore effable, and that so many and such subtleties are sought here without necessity, which, if anyone examines more diligently, he will find conflicting, indeed vain. You say that the faithful participate in the body of the Lord in the Supper really and that it is truly present. Then you immediately dispute that the body of the Lord received into heaven is unplaceable, so that from there you build that the body of the Lord is present in the Supper, but not locally, that is, the body of the Lord, which you have invented, is present. For the scripture shows no such body in heaven as you show; but the words of the Supper teach nothing of this. For the truth says: "Take, eat; this is my body, which is given for you" [1 Cor. 11:24]. If anyone therefore presses you here and says: "The Lord said: 'This is my body, which is given for you,' what kind of body do you assert the Lord to exhibit to his faithful in the Supper?", what will you answer to this? If you answer according to the words of the Supper: "the body of the Lord, which was given for us," they will say: "Why then is it necessary to add: 'not locally and circumscriptively'? Was indeed an unplaceable body given for you?" If you answer that an unplaceable body is exhibited, they will say: "But that is not given for us nor did the Lord speak of it in the words of the Supper." Moreover, if the body exhibited here is not comprehended by place, consequently it has no quantity, whence it cannot be a body, a human and true body, such as the sacred letters testify that Christ had from the resurrection, the Lord himself saying: "A spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see me have" [Luke 24:39]. And Saint Augustine to Dardanus ep. 57: "Take away the spaces of places from bodies, and they will be nowhere, and because they will be nowhere, they will not be. Take away the bodies themselves from the qualities of bodies; there will be no place where they are, and therefore it is necessary that they are not." But if that unplaceable body is not a true body and yet it is shown to be such in the Supper, indeed a human figment is shown in the Supper and not the true body of the Lord to the faithful. However, if the Lord has a locatable body in heaven and this is present in the Supper, it is present locally. But a true body cannot be present in many places at once, therefore according to the truth of the body the Lord cannot be present in all the churches throughout the world.</p>
      <p>Therefore, by this reasoning the true body of Christ will be taken away from the Lord's Supper and it is taken away by the very disputations of those who wish to draw it into the Supper. But see into what straits their thoughts and subtleties cast them. How much more rightly, simply, and solidly do we believe when we profess that Christ the Lord, true God and man, acts in one place of heaven according to the truth of the body, but by his power, by which he is the Lord and redeemer of all, he works life and righteousness and lives in all who celebrate the Supper by faith throughout all the churches in the world. For as one sun suffices for the whole world and illuminates the whole world while it is carried through the heavens, so one Christ suffices for all the faithful. For he acts and lives present by his power in those who are celebrating the Supper at once and at the same time.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he is present to them by operation, although he resides in heaven by his body. This reasoning is drawn from the scriptures and can be demonstrated by the scriptures; it has nothing absurd, nothing self-contradictory. The pious understand these things and the faithful know what kind of presence of the Lord it is. In the same way, all the ancient and orthodox fathers taught and believed. Saint Augustine at the end of the epistle to Dardanus 57: "Do not doubt that Christ our Lord, the only-begotten Son of God, coequal with the Father and the same Son of Man, by whom the Father is greater, is present everywhere wholly as God and in the same temple of God as the indwelling God, and in some place of heaven because of the mode of the true body." Fulgentius also to King Thrasamund book 2: "We see the true humanity of Christ, which is local, as the true divinity, which is always immense, to be intimated by apostolic doctrine.</p>
      <p>For to show that the body of Christ, the true man, is locally contained, the apostle Paul says to the Thessalonians [1:9f]: 'You turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus,' showing him to be coming bodily from heaven, whom he knew to have been raised bodily from the dead. Therefore, he says again: 'Our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus, who will transform our body' etc. [Phil. 3:20f]. [...] John also confirms this truth of the body of Christ coming from heaven, saying: 'Behold, he comes with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they who pierced him' [Rev. 1:7]. In the book of Acts of the Apostles, his bodily ascension is thus intimated: 'And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight' [Acts 1:9] etc. Therefore, since the flesh of Christ is shown to be local without doubt, yet his divinity is known to be everywhere always by the testimony of Paul, who says to the faithful: 'Do you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me?' [2 Cor. 13:3]. But how could he speak in him if he was not in him? Or how did he ascend bodily into heaven and is preached to be in his faithful on earth if there is not in him the immensity of divinity, which can fill heaven and earth? For Paul says to the Corinthians: 'Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?' [2 Cor. 13:5].</p>
      <p>And to the Ephesians he says: 'That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith in the inner man' [Eph. 3:16f]. [...] Therefore, the Son is in heaven and dwells in us on earth by that presence of his immensity, by which the Father and the Holy Spirit dwell in us" etc. The testimony of the holy martyr Vigilius agrees with these, for in book 4 Against Eutyches he says: "According to you, either the Word is contained with his flesh in a place or the flesh with the Word is everywhere, since one nature does not receive in itself something contrary and different. But it is different and far dissimilar to be circumscribed by place and to be everywhere; and because the Word is everywhere, but his flesh is not everywhere, it appears that one and the same Christ is of both natures and is indeed everywhere according to the nature of his divinity, [...] to be created and not to have a beginning, to be subject to death and not to be able to die; which one thing is from the nature of the Word, by which he is God, another from the nature of the flesh, by which the same God is man. [...] This is the catholic faith and confession, which the apostles handed down, the martyrs strengthened, and the faithful keep until now." And thus far indeed from Vigilius.</p>
      <p>You continue in your dictations and ask: "If, because Christ is a true man and has and keeps a true body, he is therefore included by the rules and laws of natural and bodily conditions, why did he ever do anything more than a man, who was always a true man, did? Why, as Saint Augustine indicates, could he do whatever he pleased with his body, enter through closed doors, walk on the sea?" etc. These are yours, to which I answer that the Lord Jesus is bound by the rules and laws of natural and bodily conditions according to the nature of the human body, but is free according to the nature of divinity. Why then did he do anything more than a man? Because he was not only a man, but also a true God and is. But why could he do whatever he pleased with his body, as Augustine said? He did not do with his body what he could, but what he willed and had to do. For he never made the truth of his body suspect. To the place of Augustine, which is in De agone christiano, cap. 24, your John Oecolampadius, indeed mine and Christ's, responded in his response to Luther's confession. You know otherwise how the matter stands about the closed doors. And Saint Jerome also disputed about these in the epistle to Pammachius against the errors of John, bishop of Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>But Hippolytus, bishop and martyr, in the book he wrote against Eutyches and Nestorius, says: "Christ coming into the world appeared as God and man, and his humanity is easy to understand when he hungers and is weary etc., but his divinity when he rebukes the troubled sea and walks on the sea" etc. I have thus far responded to your disputation about the body of Christ received and assumed outside all heavens and therefore unplaceable.</p>
      <p>After these things, you also touch on the question of the eating of the body of Christ by the ancients and ours, those, I say, who preceded the incarnation of Christ and those who followed. But you write that Christ before the incarnation gave life to the fathers as fire, after the incarnation the same gives life to us as heated iron. "Before," you say, "the Father gave life through the Word, now the same Father gives life through the incarnate Word, and Christ cannot be divided thereafter." But I do not believe that he was to be divided even before. For the Father gave life to the fathers through the whole Christ, true God and man. Surely they believed in him not as the Word, but as the Word to be incarnated, whence the Lord fed them with the flesh of Christ spiritually. For the promises are most plain: Gen. 3 [15]: "The seed of the woman shall bruise the seed of the serpent"; Gen. 22 [18]: "In your seed all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed." Therefore, by faith in the Lord Jesus to be incarnated, they were saved, and thus they were fed with the flesh of Christ. For the truth said of Abraham: "Abraham saw my day and rejoiced" [John 8:56]. What, I ask, day? The light of the gospel, the day and time of salvation, which Christ perfected by incarnation, passion, and resurrection, finally also by ascension into heaven and the gift of the Holy Spirit. And the apostle: "All the fathers ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them. But the rock was Christ" [1 Cor. 10:3f]. Therefore, just as we eat Christ, so they ate; we eat by faith, so they ate. The food is the same for both, namely Christ, true God and man. Both believe in Christ, true God and man, except that they believed in him to be incarnated, we believe in him incarnated. Yet they do not eat differently, nor do we. They do not have a different food, nor do we. Not only did the Word without flesh give life to the ancients; the incarnate Word saves us, but both are saved and blessed by the whole Christ, whom John therefore called "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" [Rev. 13:8]. I have as a supporter of my opinion Saint Augustine, Tractate on John 45, not to mention the opinions of others now.</p>
      <p>Finally, you dispute, Grynäus, about those who eat the body of the Lord unworthily, and indeed you weave everything subtly as always. But I see the apostolic truth purely and simply teaching that those participate in the body and blood of the Lord who remain in Christ by faith and love. For the Lord himself: "He who eats me," he says, "abides in me, and I in him," John 6 [56 (Vulg. 57)].</p>
      <p>And the apostle John in his canonical letter 1 [6]: "If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth." Hence dignity and indignity are estimated from living faith and feigned faith. Because therefore the impious and hypocrites lack faith, they do not communicate in the body of Christ; they indeed communicate in the sign, but they lack the fruit, just as Saint Augustine says that such people eat the body of the Lord sacramentally, 22 De civitate Dei cap. 25. I think you know what the most holy and vigilant bishop of Basel, John Oecolampadius, wrote about this cause in his books; in which, having diligently examined and weighed everything, I would wish that you would not vary from him, so that your church may always retain the same doctrine.</p>
      <p>These things I had, most learned and most esteemed brother Grynäus, which I was pleased to comment on your dictations. But I pray by the bond of our friendship and by Christian charity itself, that you do not take offense at me here for my freedom and rusticity. I wrote these things tumultuously and hastily and perhaps imprudently; nevertheless, I love you from the heart and therefore wished to dissimulate nothing, but to deal openly with you and to clearly explain those things that displease me in your opinion.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I am well aware before the Lord that I have indulged nothing here to affections, but have done everything out of love for truth and simplicity. Moreover, I pray your humanity not to publish these dictations of yours at present. We have adversaries, as you know, not few, but also keen-eyed and sufficiently inclined to calumniate; they might perhaps find something to criticize.</p>
      <p>And the minds today and the age are such that it might be better to reserve it for another time.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the letters you added to your dictations, none of us could read; we therefore pray that you write more distinctly, clearly, and better, if indeed you wish to be understood by us. This is our old complaint about your cacography; would that you would finally allow yourself to be persuaded!</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, my most dear Grynäus, and always pray to the Lord for us. Zurich, July 26, in the year of the Lord 1541.</p>
      <p>Greet diligently my Myconius.</p>
