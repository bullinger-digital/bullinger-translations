      <p>S. P. If I have nothing in these turbulent times that consoles and refreshes me, at least your letters do, of which I have received two with great joy; for they are learned and pious, so much so that they can entirely recall the earthly and mundane to the heavenly and spiritual. Therefore, continue as you can; for I do not wish to burden your just labors and continuous other duties. However, you will write to a friend who will consider everything in the best way, as he should. I cannot and should not respond to you by letter regarding those Five; however, know from me that it was done neither by fault nor by the will of a higher power.</p>
      <p>The rest we will discuss in person sometime, and, I hope, soon; for from the Baden Diet, where I will be on Tuesday, if leisure and infinite business allow, I will visit your lords and you to greet you.</p>
      <p>For there is nothing I desire more than to speak freely with you about everything. In the meantime, believe that I, who wish well to the lords, will do and procure what will be in the interest of their majesty and theirs, as diligently as the most diligent, and if I cannot do everything, the rest will be given by the Lord in time. Nor is it, as I recently told Vergerio, that some urge with such force, for they rather lose the matter than promote it, as if they wanted to immediately retract someone from an open and certain shipwreck against the will of the gods and winds with force and quarrels. Therefore, from contention arises vengeance, and thus they cut off all paths for the more prudent. But enough of that. By the grace of the gods, everything is well with us, and the king prepares great armies against infinite intrigues with many friends, and briefly believe that his majesty is in excellent agreement with the German princes; I mean those who love their country and freedom. The rest you will understand from the letters of the lords.</p>
      <p>If anything is offered in Gadde, you will have it from me; I will expect the same from you. Farewell, excellent good man. Given this Saturday in Solothurn.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassefontaine.</p>
      <p>We have certain letters that the Emperor is at his end; but because he is a wicked beast, few dare to believe it.</p>
      <p>To the excellent man, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
