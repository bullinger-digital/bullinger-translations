      <p>Most illustrious prince, most gracious lord. May the Lord Jesus protect you from evil and bless you and yours forever.</p>
      <p>I received your letters, written on the Ides of April, in the month of June, and indeed with the greatest joy; I congratulate myself that my letters, written long ago, are pleasing and approved by such a great man.</p>
      <p>The services rendered to your nephews are not so great as to deserve such diligent thanks. However, we are encouraged by this gratitude to show greater diligence towards your people. I certainly gladly received into my house that Johann Myszkowski, a noble and excellent boy singularly commended to me by your grace. I received him, I say, along with Caspar Malinowski, his minister, into my care and indeed as if they were my own sons. Our Tretius, a most faithful man and dearest to me, will explain everything about the price and other matters of that kind, as well as provide an account of what is happening and being done among us. As for the rest, I urge your holiness, most holy prince, as I advised in my last letters, to continue in the true religion and confession of the Christian faith, and to assist it diligently and, as much as the Lord has granted strength, to be careful that it is neither polluted nor hindered by either the papists or the Arians. For both are most harmful enemies to the pure faith, turning the minds of many away from the truth and entangling them in various not so much errors as pains and torments of conscience.</p>
      <p>Nor is it necessary for me to argue this cause at length with your grace, since you have there many sincere teachers and also our Tretius here, a learned, pious man and entirely free from sects, whom I commend to your grace, and I wish you, most illustrious prince, with all yours, to be very well. I also give the greatest thanks for the pelt given to me in your name by Tretius; I will take care to show myself grateful in turn by my services towards your nephews.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 14th of August, 1567.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious prince and lord, Lord Stanislaus Myszkowski of Mirow, Palatine and General Captain of Krakow, Ruthenian, and Slomniki, etc., my most gracious lord.</p>
