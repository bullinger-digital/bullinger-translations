    <p xml:id="regest1">Could only report briefly through Adam Frey [No. 1310]. Contrary to his hope, the unrest has intensified during his absence, and now he finds himself facing severe hostility along with Markus [Bertschi], Grynaeus, and other well-meaning individuals, behind which Karlstadt stands; if the Zurichers do not recall him, he will plunge the Basel church into ruin, to the delight of all opponents of the pastors, whom he wins over with his lukewarmness. This letter is to be burned.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote through Adam Frey, as best as I could. I had thought that if I were absent for a short while, the whole matter would settle down in the meantime, but when I returned, I found everything more turbulent. I tried to address the issues through private complaints at the highest levels and ended up risking my reputation, not just mine, but also that of Markus and Grynaeus. I dare not approach anyone about these matters, nor complain to anyone; those I dare to approach are in the same predicament as us. All the best among the leaders are in the same danger.</p>
      <p>He, than whom the city has nothing more sacred, I fear, is consumed by grief. This, with how much fear you do not know, I write to you; for Karlstadt has so many evil spirits that he knows everything. He is the leader of all destruction. O God, what a disaster; how much evil you were freed from through me, while I dragged the devil here against the will of the good. He is still yours; recall him, so that the destruction of all good may be prevented. Those who wish us and the gospel ill for one frankness use this evil. He allows himself to be led, due to his nature, which is why he has the reputation of being the best, most learned, indeed the savior of the school and the gospel, and the title, while in fact, he is such as Wittenberg accuses everywhere. So you understand where his praise comes from: He is called kind and sweet-talking, who reproves no one, lets everyone remain (l√§sst jederman bliben) and is brief in preaching and finally wants us oppressed with great applause from our enemies, that is, those who cannot bear the salt and light of the gospel. Anabaptists, papists, the dregs of the whole city, false evangelicals, that is, those who pretend faith without the fruits of works to please God, and whatever is of this kind, listen to him. And many who listen to none of us praise him nonetheless, because he opposes us. But what happens? Whatever he impiously commits is, if the gods please, imputed to us, so that they would gladly accuse us of being seditious. In short: We expect evil at every moment. "Leave," you say.</p>
      <p>We cannot; we are so enclosed. "Where?" I dare not say. "Beware," you might think, "that hatred dictates something." It is pain; for what he does against me, I can bear through the grace of the Lord, but what he does against the church, I cannot ignore.</p>
      <p>After reading this, you will give everything to Vulcan (burn it); for if kept, it will bring harm. Farewell with yours and grieve with us, praying earnestly to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, October 4, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To his Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
