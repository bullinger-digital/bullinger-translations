    <p xml:id="regest1">Veit Dietrich gave Matthias Erb the [enclosed] book [“To the Christian Church in Regensburg”]. In it, he fights against a specter and at the same time takes the opportunity to slander those whom Luther calls fanatics. Erb thanked Dietrich and described what he wrote about the worship of Christ in the Lord's Supper as intellectual sophistry. He would have sent Bullinger the letter if he had had time to copy it. If Dietrich responds, Erb will forward his letter and Dietrich's response to Bullinger. It is as if the [old] Entellus is being challenged by the [young] Dares... Erb sends the booklet so that Bullinger and Gwalther can determine what kind of defender Luther has gained with this young man. - Dietrich invents a new form of worship: Not the [elements of] bread and wine are to be worshiped, but rather the physically present Christ within them! Bullinger can well imagine what circumstances and absurd [customs] will arise from this! Dietrich seems to have developed some new understanding from the usual course of worship. Bullinger should share his opinion. Wherever Dietrich argues with scripture, Erb can follow him; but no longer where he "Lutherizes" and teaches a worship of Christ in the Lord's Supper. - [Appendix 1: Erb to Dietrich, November 8, 1545:] [Johannes] Ulstetter brought Erb Dietrich's letter without the booklet, as he left it with Bucer and [Kaspar] Hedio in Strasbourg for reading. Erb, who has now received it, thanks him for it. If he were to publish books, he would send one to Dietrich. Unfortunately, Erb is not a scholar; he always postpones his publications until the new year. - Erb approves of the duel taken up by Dietrich against the Regensburg opponent [Paul Hirsbeck], who spoke so shamelessly against the Lord's Supper. Since he is no longer among the living, he may give Dietrich his answer on Judgment Day. It is at least something to fearlessly confront a mute, unarmed specter that has already fallen victim to the Lord's sword, even if some think there are better things to do. But if Erb has understood correctly, Dietrich is waging a double war, like Hercules once did: On the one hand with the fanatics (called "Schwirmer" by the Nurembergers), on the other hand with the Regensburg specter, which turns a deaf ear to Dietrich, even if he were to shout as loudly as Stentor. - The word "Schwirmer," which sounds barbaric to the ears of a South German, is sacred to the North Germans (who are as hard as rocks), especially since it serves them to discredit and frighten their opponents. Unfortunately, there are many imitators who like to mimic their teachers and shout nothing but “fanatics” and “Schwirmer” from the pulpit, convincing the people that the Upper German churches consist of monsters, even though they know neither the views nor the creeds nor the orders [of these churches]. - If Dietrich loves his brothers and God's people, he should strive to think, write, and teach what serves the peace of Jerusalem, and not be content to listen to the statements of his teachers like one bound before the sirens until the end of his life! Dietrich should not remain as foolish as his teachers and follow them blindly. If only he would realize that his harsh words achieve nothing! May God save him from Charybdis! - How can Dietrich substantiate the worship of the sacraments with Holy Scripture, even if he emphasizes that it is not the elements, but the bodily, essential, and naturally present Christ within them that is to be worshiped? Both the Greek and Latin mass celebrants admonished the people with the words “Sursum corda.” But Dietrich calls for looking not upwards, but at the altar! Every celebrant thus believes that Christ is everywhere, whereas Erb thought he was at the right hand of God! For the sake of the salvation of the redeemed, Dietrich should not see Erb's writing as a declaration of war, but as an encouragement to further reflection! - [Appendix 2: Addendum of an undated letter from Erb to Bullinger:] In the previous letter, Erb failed to mention the practice advocated by the Nuremberger Veit Dietrich a few years ago of receiving the Lord's Supper kneeling. What is this but the worship of the goddess Ceres and the god Bacchus? The church is going downhill! Bullinger should warn his colleagues about this.</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you. Veit Dietrich, the preacher of the Sebald Church in Nuremberg, gave me this booklet as a gift. He struggles with a specter and, under this pretext, slanders the Schwärmer, whom Luther calls fanatics, as the book itself states. I wrote back to him, thanking him for such a magnificent gift, and with remarkable wit, I criticized him, especially regarding the worship of Christ in the Lord's Supper. I would have sent a copy of the letter, but I did not have time to transcribe it. When he responds, I will send both my letter and his, perhaps like Dares to Entellus, etc. The reason I am sending this to you and Gwalther now is so that you may understand what kind of defender this young man will be for Luther.</p>
      <p>He especially invents a new form of worship, namely that the bread and wine and the signs are not to be worshiped, but rather He who is present bodily, Christ. You can easily understand what inconveniences and absurdities will follow, which I simply pointed out to him, etc. It seems to me that this good Theodorus has derived some opinions from the rational aspect of divine matters or, as human minds often do, has given birth to something new. Therefore, I pray through the Lord Jesus Christ that you make me certain of your judgment of his booklet. I recognize the truth in it where he proves his points with scripture. But where he "Lutherizes" and teaches the worship of Christ in the Lord's Supper, nothing seems to me to be plausible or in any way consistent with the truth.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Hastily, as the courier is pressing. Erb.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Veit Dietrich, November 8, 1545.</p>
      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you. Your letter, dear Veit, was delivered to me by Ulstetter, who returned from a difficult journey, but without your booklet, which you had sent. For he had left it in Strasbourg with Bucer, so that he could read the last four gatherings, as you had instructed. Finally, it was also read by Hedio and returned to me as if by right of return. I truly thank you for this gift. As soon as I publish books, I will send one to you (unless I respond with Alsatian wine) with greater fervor. I also fear that I may disappoint your expectations. I am such a man of unrefined and unlearned mind that I postpone all my works until the new year, until they are polished. Therefore, I will take care to respond to you in some other way.</p>
      <p>I was pleased with the duel you undertook with the Regensburg adversary for the many slanders that a very impious and superstitious man shamelessly spewed against the holy institution of the Lord's Supper. Since he has long since gone to the shadows, perhaps on the Day of the Lord, if God permits, he will respond to you, etc. However, it is something to be bold and fearless, to wrestle with phantoms and shadows, and to be a scribe against the mute. Is it not a great virtue to fight with unarmed enemies who have long since been pierced by the sword of the spirit, even if some think that better exercises could be found for the hours? Therefore, see what you have published! I truly (if I have correctly understood your booklet) think that you, like a unique Hercules, have a dispute and war against two: First against the Schwärmer (who are now called Schwärmer by the Nurembergers for the sake of euphony and good pronunciation), and second with that Regensburg specter, which will henceforth, even if you play the role of Stentor, listen with a deaf ear.</p>
      <p>The term Schwärmer is unusual, indeed barbaric and Gothic, to the upper Germans (who rightly know the German language), although it is sacred among the slanderers. Therefore, some think it was invented by barbarians and Goths (who are as hard as rocks, and, if I may say so with pardon, insensitive). Others think that this term was invented (which, however, does not seem plausible to me) to make it appear that they have shed all humanity, and that which they have hitherto testified as irreconcilable adversaries, they disapprove and criticize with unheard-of slanders and this unknown and hateful term. It is clear to all that many of your people, who have no regard for the teachings of their teachers, have nothing else to shout and clamor from the pulpit than Schwärmer and Schwärmer, even though they have never seen or heard the institution, confessions of the ministers, and the order of our churches, which all condemn and proscribe!</p>
      <p>Brother Veit, things are going badly with yours! Finally, the common people have been persuaded by these malevolent ones that the upper churches do not have men, but nourish the most monstrous creatures. It would not be difficult for me to prove this with one or two examples, but with many.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you are a lover of the brothers (as I hear) and the people of Israel, think, write, and teach what leads to the peace of Jerusalem! Do not grow old at the words of the teachers as if at the Sirens' rocks! Beware, I beseech you, of those things that will be of little benefit to Christian charity and faith, but rather the seed of all dissension! Teachers sometimes become foolish. Disciples sometimes become foolish and more devoted to the footsteps of their teachers, and, having despised solid truth, serve human affections. And so it happens that the blind lead the blind.</p>
      <p>For we are all mortal, blind, and ignorant, deceived by self-love, endowed with many affections. Finally, to each his own is beautiful. Rarely does anyone depart from the saliva once imbibed (even if somewhat rebuked by conscience). O Veit, Veit! You have proven little so far with dry words. We must pray to God to deliver us from this Charybdis!</p>
      <p>As for the worship of the sacrament, I cannot help but ask you, from where or with what scriptures do you wish to prove it, even if you deny that the sacramental signs are to be worshiped there, but that Jesus Christ (who with his real, substantial, and natural body lies hidden under the signs) is to be worshiped. What is this new doctrine? The mass celebrants (Messzelebranten) once exhorted the people to true worship in public liturgies among the Greeks and Latins with "Sursum corda," the people responding: "We have them with the Lord with open hearts"; and indeed they sang rightly.</p>
      <p>And now you do not command upwards, but to the altar you command the hearts to be directed and say: "Behold, here is Christ on the altar substantially and locally, or, if you prefer, bodily." Another in another temple: "Behold there!" I thought Christ was to be worshiped simply at the right hand of God, as the same Christ taught to worship the Father in spirit and truth: "But you," he says, "will pray thus: 'Our Father, who art in heaven'" [Mt 6, 9]. Or do you think the Father is to be worshiped in heaven, but the Word of the Father, namely Christ, true God and man, when he is present bodily and locally, as you say, is to be worshiped on the altar? Either I do not understand your booklet at all, or you have not explained the highest matter of piety very clearly and perspicuously, so that I can understand. Therefore, I earnestly ask you, dear Veit, for the common salvation of the elect, not to consider these things written by me for the sake of disputing, but for investigating.</p>
      <p>To this I am urged by the glory of the one God and his Son Jesus Christ. I also know, and am therefore certainly conscious of my own lack of knowledge and foolishness. But consider that sometimes a fool speaks appropriately...</p>
      <p>I had neglected to mention in this letter something worthy of observation: The communicants have been persuaded to kneel; this was not previously in use. What else is this but to worship Ceres and Bacchus? This fiction was devised a few years ago by Veit Dietrich of Nuremberg, with whom I have remonstrated. Do you see where the affairs of the church are finally heading? You will inform the brothers of this ridiculousness, etc.</p>
      <p>ME.</p>
