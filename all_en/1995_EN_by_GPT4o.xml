      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, I received your letters along with those that Mr. Bassafontaneus was sending, and together with the example of the brief (as they call it) papal document and also with the catechism of England; however, those which you write you wrote the day before, I have not yet received. I give the greatest thanks for so many services: may the Lord repay you. Good God, how timely that brief came! What do you ask? I hope because of this matter that messenger of the Antichrist will not enter the territories of the Lords of the Grisons; their minds were so moved and troubled when they heard that the pope was thinking about prisons, tortures, and punishments to be exercised in these places where he has no jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>I learned from elsewhere that all these things are happening because of your Vergerius, whom they pursue with deadly hatred, not without reason, thanks be to God, and unless He preserved me in these territories and in the very border of Italy, I could not at all escape either their daggers or guns or poisons. The pope openly said in the consistory that he must strive with all his might to destroy me. But the Lord will destroy him and will save me. The Valtellina Valley is getting worse every day; the plague is indeed thickening. May the Lord help His own.</p>
      <p>Everyone thinks that this year there will not be very good wines there because of the frequent rains; therefore, I am arranging for you, Heinrich Bullinger, some old wine, which I will soon send to the court of the Grisons; for I do not forget you, nor is it fitting, since I love and respect you so much. If only I could accomplish something excellent for you someday!</p>
      <p>For two very serious matters, I sent two messengers into the heart of Italy, whom I hope will be back in at most 15 days. But I must stay here until they come; however, when they arrive, I will mount a horse and come straight to you, for many reasons. In the meantime, ensure that my letters are safely delivered to Mr. Bassafontaneus; they are indeed of great importance, as you will soon know. I also ask that you take care to send another small package to Mr. Gratarolus along with the crown, which Mr. Nicolaus Mora will give you in my name. He is my friend and indeed pious, and I commend him to you, if you can help him in any way there. I ask my Josiah to write to me if he has received the small box of my books from Basel and if he has sent it to the court. I greet him from the heart, as well as Lavater and Zwingli, your sons-in-law, and all the colleagues and all the brothers; pray for me.</p>
      <p>A very learned man recently escaped from the prisons of Genoa, who lived in that stench for two years because of his confession of the gospel.</p>
      <p>The man's name is Aurelius Sytarcha; I hope you will see him soon. He announces that the Turkish fleet is besieging Elba. It is an island between Italy and Corsica, under the rule of the Duke of Florence; the fortress is indeed very fortified. If the Turk captures it, no fleet will be able to navigate those seas, and in the meantime, it will not be well in Rome or Babylon. This is certainly to be lamented by us.</p>
      <p>I was very pleased with what you wrote about the catalog published in Florence, and when I come to you, I will have it printed. Now I am sending it back for two reasons: so that you may take care to have it copied for the printer, who will not easily read your handwriting, and so that you may change that little preface to me for my sake. I fear that my Italians may interpret those first words as if you complain that I am accustomed to being troublesome and importunate to you and not at all dear. But I think I am dear to you, given your humanity, and this, I wish, my Italians to understand. Farewell, brother. May the Lord Jesus bless your great labors. Pray for me with the whole church. Certainly, I am in the greatest dangers, which I fear little, because I recognize it as a gift of God.</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, September 3, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>I sent letters to Fontaneus through the hands of Mr. Baionensis. To you, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
