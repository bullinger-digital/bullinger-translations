      <p>Greetings. I received the two letters you sent, dear brother, as well as those you included from Augsburg, and I thank you very much for this service. However, since there is nothing in your letters that requires a response, I will save whatever time I would have spent writing for both of us. I am sending my brief response to Brentius's lengthy and fluid Recognition; I hope that, if I do not benefit readers much or at least somewhat, I do not harm anyone. I pray to the Lord to bless my labors.</p>
      <p>I would gladly hear your judgment on this work of mine. You will find errors in many places; the corrector is indeed a poor corrector; but they can be corrected from the context. I have added some errors at the end... I have collected, etc.</p>
      <p>The assembly at Baden is only just beginning today.</p>
      <p>May the Lord, who alone can avert evil from us, turn it to good! Never have I been more anxious than now; there are many things that frighten me; but in the meantime, I am strong in the Lord, whom I sincerely pray to have mercy on us. It is amazing how those bloodthirsty men are eager to rush to their own destruction.</p>
      <p>May the Lord restrain them!</p>
      <p>Farewell and diligently pray to the Lord for our peace.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers in Winterthur and the mayor, as well as your brother, your son, your sister, and your nephews.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 25, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>When you have leisure, write back.</p>
      <p>This might be the last book I send to you; for I hope the Lord will soon grant me rest. But I rejoice that I have shared with you all the books I have published in my ministry, and have given them to you as to my most closely connected brother; you will kindly appreciate my most willing intention.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer in Winterthur, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>September 6, 1564, I have repeated.</p>
