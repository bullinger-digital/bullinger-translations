      <p>Greetings. I am greatly encouraged by your letters, as your opinion completely agrees with mine; I now await what you will write further, after you have examined that monstrosity more closely. I am sending the entire Interim, which you will clearly see how beautifully it holds together, although it tries with astonishing and thus execrable artifice to combine light with darkness and Christ with Belial. The copy is exceedingly faulty, so that in some places it is not even possible to guess what the author's opinion is; if you wish to have it copied, ensure it is done as soon as possible and return the original; for our envoys have sent it there in haste, and the senate has permitted me to send it to you, but on the condition that we receive it back with the next messenger, since we too must carefully examine all these individual things that are being imposed on us to be observed at such great peril to us. I am now also awaiting the opinion of the ministers of other churches, to whom I have written about the same matter, so that with the opinions of many compared, the explanation of the truth may be either clearer or more confirmed. I hope there is no one who could think that this abomination could be accepted by any sincere Christian, since the latter part entirely reeks of papism. And if only the Emperor were so perceptive as to judge from the first part how ineptly the papist elements are sewn in here, we would certainly not have an unkind ruler.</p>
      <p>Since the last things you received, our people have written nothing, nor has anything else been brought that is worth writing about; we do not know whether other cities have responded to the Emperor, but we will soon find out.</p>
      <p>The French kingdom, bloody with Christian blood, will not stand any more successfully than those other kingdoms hostile to Christ's kingdom. Pray for us, my venerable and dearest brother, that He may graciously grant our Christian soldiers courage worthy of them, so that by their endurance and faith in Christ, the prince of the world, they may conquer. I do not think it happened without divine counsel that the adversaries have inserted into their articles things so absurd and alien to the purity of the gospel. Thus we know what we have eaten and whether we want to be white or black.</p>
      <p>I thank you most diligently and greatly for your last letters. I commend to you this young man from our region, whom his father, a senator and an excellent citizen, will also commend to you in person; for he is a boy on whose behalf I have already written to you, so that, with your intercession, he might be received by our Wolphius into the company of his young men, to whom I now also commend this one and three others, and indeed also the others who preceded them there, with as much diligence as I can.</p>
      <p>The most excellent and learned man will deserve with his paternal education and the instruction of our boys not only our blood, but our entire church and city, as if no one else ever did, and I do not think he will find our people ungrateful for such great benefits. Greet the man reverently and dutifully in my words; for I fear I cannot write to him now.</p>
      <p>On the next Saturday, a strange unknown man, dressed in black in the Italian style, was in the Eagle, having come from Augsburg in two days. Another good stranger spoke to him, among other things asking how things stood with those from Konstanz in Augsburg, etc., to which he replied that they were not yet reconciled; for if they do what is demanded of them, they will soon be dismissed. But it is the same for them whether they achieve reconciliation or not, for they are ruined people. To this the other said: "That is bad, and how does that come about?" This one replied: "It is certain that the Emperor will attack the Confederates; then they too will be ruined." The other said: "Oh, I do not think that from the dealings and writings so far, that the Emperor has such intentions." To this the first one further said: "As surely as I stand before your eyes, so surely it will happen, and the Confederates will regret it," etc. He also hurried greatly and asked about the nearest to Baden, etc. Therefore, we must be vigilant.</p>
      <p>Letters have arrived saying that England has defeated the Scots; but it cannot be known for certain. The Sea Cities, it is written from Basel, are said to have been defeated; but we cannot believe it, for Prem is still in Augsburg. We have also heard nothing about any armament on their part beforehand. May the Lord of the world grant us here so much peace that we may remain by His pure word for this short time and thereafter attain eternal peace.</p>
      <p>The letters to Marcellus, etc., will first be sent to the bailiff in Kloten, so that they may be delivered to him promptly.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
