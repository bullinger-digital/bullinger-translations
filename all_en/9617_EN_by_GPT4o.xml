      <p>Greetings. Although I have been seized by a most persistent weariness of all things in this difficult time, most reverend father, I cannot refrain from always writing something to you about our affairs, and that for excellent reasons. First, because I recall that you have often requested it, and secondly, because the use of your excellence is both pleasant and necessary to me, and to be enjoyed while it is possible. Moreover, the times are such that they compel me to be more troublesome to you, otherwise occupied. Therefore, forgive me, most honorable father, if with my foolish letters I am less supportive of your arduous business; I certainly support you in spirit. The most honorable consul recently reported to me about Gantner, that he promised a better mind, if only he could be free in the matter of the supper and not be compelled to its celebration. However, there is a law of the land that those who are affected by public duties must also celebrate the supper publicly in the assembly. Hence, when it was objected to Gantner, with what face he dared to ask this, who had hitherto been a minister and ought to have been an example to others of valuing the sacraments highly, the cunning and sly man replied: that he was not sufficiently prepared and worthy to grasp such a mystery. Upon this, the magistrate asked, therefore, with what open crimes he was so burdened that he considered it necessary to abstain from this eating. He continued to say that he was not sufficiently approved nor worthy, etc. Many wanted him to stay and not be expelled; however, in the end, the response was given: unless he wished to agree with us in all things, he should leave.</p>
      <p>To this, he, threatening, wished to appeal to the tribes, that is, to the popular votes of the citizens, in which he placed his prow and stern, as he knows well the minds of his own; but the opinion of the more secret council prevailed. Now it is expected when he will return and prescribe new laws to his superiors, whom he wonderfully misleads.</p>
      <p>As I sensed the lust of the Swenkfeldian man, I publicly taught our people what Swenkfeld thinks about the perfection of Christians and from where this nausea, which he has begun against our supper, arises for him. They want to have this: do this and you will live, before: do this in remembrance of me. Therefore, they argue that one must abstain from the supper unless one feels that perfection within oneself, etc. But they care little for what is sound and drawn from the very sources, unheard and rare things are now demanded. - Among the eternally blessed is our Pontisella, a senator and schoolmaster of this city, who, having been exempted from that long-standing controversy and called by the Lord from this valley of tears, departed to the heavens yesterday at half-past two in the afternoon. I, most sorrowful, closed his eyes in the presence of the senators, the consul Willi, and the judge of this city, Balthasar Hertner, and the rest of the great crowd. He first suffered from side pains and thought too late about applying remedies. As long as he could speak, he professed the constancy of true faith with his mouth and heart and openly said to me, when I was alone with him at his bedside, that he knew and recognized the goodness of God, by whose benefit he was confined to bed, so that he might descend more deeply into himself and know himself. To this, I added that it is also done for us as an example, etc.</p>
      <p>- Today, from Poschiavo and other places in the Valtellina, both messengers and letters arrive, announcing the incursions of foreign monks into the Valtellina against the laws of the lords, whose lusts the communities themselves no longer wish to bear. They therefore ask the lords to also fulfill their duty. The Bishop of Como sent an inquisitor to Sondrio, who began to exercise his function in the name of the bishop successfully and fined a certain man from Sondrio because he lived on meat during this Lent, and sent him to the idol of Loreto, so that by this pilgrimage he might atone for his sins. This was reported both orally and in writing, brought in the name of his community by Jacob Paravicini, whom the Upper Engadine sent here.</p>
