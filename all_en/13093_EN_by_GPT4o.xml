    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The Zurich city messenger Melchior Schlosser, who delivered the present letter dispatch [including letter No. 3045], brought two letters from Lindau to Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard late in the evening of October 16, 1547: one from the city council, the other from Hans Vogler the Younger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The next day, at three o'clock in the afternoon, the two aforementioned letters were returned to him. And since these had nothing to do with the interests of the Count, he was accordingly not paid a messenger's fee, although he demanded such in an improper manner and complained about this in the presence of some officials of the city of Basel. He was made to understand that he was not quite in his right mind, had complained unjustly, and should now take the Count's response [No. 3045] along with the certificate issued to him by the chancellery, stating that no messenger's fee was given to him, and disappear!</p>

      <p>With the same intercessory writings, he was dispatched again the next day around three o'clock in the afternoon. And since the aforementioned two letters, which he brought here, did not concern my gracious Lord, etc., at all, his messenger's fee, which he then demanded impetuously and with improper words, was not paid here (although he complained about this to the officials here), but he was informed: He might have a mistaken mind; he complained unjustly; he should take the response from his grace, along with a certificate from their grace's chancellery, stating that his messenger's fee is still outstanding, and leave! Dated Basel, the 17th of October, year, etc., 47. Stier S.</p>
