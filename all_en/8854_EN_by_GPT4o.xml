      <p>Greetings. I am writing these brief notes solely so that our Müller does not come to you empty-handed and without my letters. He can explain everything about our affairs himself. I am tired from frequent and lengthy sermons these days, which makes me lazy to write; moreover, various illnesses do not so much afflict me as they render me almost useless to myself and others. Right now, I feel great pain on my right side and from my bladder.</p>
      <p>I received your last letter from the distinguished gentleman, the treasurer, who explained what he knew and is expecting more from you, from whom I would also expect, if I did not know how burdened you are with tasks, so I do not wish to double your labors and troubles. If you can do something conveniently and in your leisure, do it; you will gratify us both.</p>
      <p>I diligently investigated your affairs and your standing with your people, and what your people have understood. They replied that you are in authority, loved, and held in high regard by all good people, which greatly cheers both the consul and myself. No complaints about you have been reported to them; no one has accused you before them. As for the letters you sent me during this entire time from the Martinian assembly, I have carefully preserved them. I also remember you sending a bull; but when you requested it back, I returned it without delay, neither copying it nor having it copied, as I knew it could be found with you, and now I would like to inspect it more than I did then. That bull has ruined the Rhaetians; for the pope is the son of perdition and the man of sin, and they have rightly done in the Bündnerland (Grisons) not to let their fiefs to the pope in Rome. What right does he have (besides robbery, imposture, and extreme impudence) to other people's fiefs and goods? The foolishness and superstition of deceived people have allowed him this until now; therefore, the religious prudence of sane people should take it back and wrest it from his hands, etc.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and keep you from evil. Farewell forever. Zurich, April 4, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
