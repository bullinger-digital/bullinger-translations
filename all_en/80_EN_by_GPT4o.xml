    <p xml:id="regest1">Duke Ulrich of Württemberg's [regency in his duchy] is [endangered by the complaint of King Ferdinand I.]. The rumor that Emperor Charles V has taken the matter into his own hands is not true. However, according to recent reports from Augsburg, he is said to have scheduled two days of negotiations under the chairmanship of the Archbishop of Cologne, Adolf III of Schaumburg, [in Ulrich's legal dispute] with the king. Furthermore, Ulrich is likely to have to leave his country after the soon-expected verdict or be allowed to stay only under unreasonable burdens. The latter is likely to happen because [the king and emperor] would otherwise fear that his son Christoph of Württemberg [might lay claim to the duchy].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">The wedding of the king's son Maximilian and the emperor's daughter Maria is to take place soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">According to credible letters [from Augsburg], the emperor is dismissing the envoys and estates under the condition from the Reichstag that they will immediately reconvene at the place he will determine at its conclusion. It will certainly be Strasbourg, as this would give Charles V a pretext to interfere in the affairs of this city as well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The [Lindauers] will continue to want to appoint Johannes Haller as pastor, as the [pastor from Augsburg proposed by Bullinger] Michael Keller recently passed away. There is a great shortage of preachers everywhere. The good pastors will gradually die out with their congregations. After that, pastors, congregations, and churches will all be bad: Everything is deteriorating!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Charles V has ordered the city of Ravensburg to reinstate Gerwig Blarer, the abbot of Weingarten, and the former, [old-believing] clergy of the city, as well as their compensation, the return of the parishes, and the church properties within the next six days. Additionally, the old-believing Ravensburgers are to be allowed to attend mass again. If not complied with, the city faces the imperial ban. May God stand by [the Evangelicals] in these serious hostilities!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">The city of Ravensburg is being sharply attacked by the emperor because, contrary to the Worms [Reichstag decision of August 4, 1545], they introduced the [Reformation on October 12, 1545] without a general council having convened. However, this only happened because they were enlightened by divine truth [after signing the decision]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">A distinguished man [N.N.], who freely associates at the emperor's court and table, reported to someone [N.N.] these days from Augsburg that the emperor will not reconcile with the people of Konstanz unless they humbly ask him to do so. Otherwise, their oppressive situation will not change. Moreover, they may suffer a drastic punishment this spring. [As far as from Augsburg]. Great fear, misery, and distress are looming over the world everywhere!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">The people of Konstanz have just received the imperial safe-conduct letter [on March 28, 1548]. This is [regarding the safe return journey] so vague that some are seriously concerned. Caution is therefore advised!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Bullinger is to pray for the people of Konstanz and all true believers, so that God may let them partake in His wisdom and counsel, so that they do not deviate from His guidance and are not deceived by the deceit of the children of the world [Luke 16:8], but are eternally preserved due to their own integrity and that of His spirit.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">The Swiss Confederates are to be congratulated on the princely generosity of "their" King Henry II of France. May they use this good for the glory of God!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">Blarer asks for Bullinger's opinion on the enclosed copy of the imperial safe-conduct letter. This confidential document must not be copied, as Blarer could otherwise get into trouble. He therefore asks for its return. He has learned by chance that a messenger will deliver letters from the Konstanz council to Zurich. He knows nothing about their content but can send his letter with the messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">Bullinger should, if possible, forward the letter enclosed in the envelope [of the present letter] to Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">He should also report on Octavien Blondel, who, as Blarer recently learned, was burned because he violated the papal laws.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">Greetings to Bullinger's family, colleagues, and friends.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[Enclosure:] Charles V calls on the mayor and council of the city of Konstanz to send envoys to Augsburg. They are to humbly ask for mercy, as the people of Konstanz participated in the war actions of the Schmalkaldic League and have not yet submitted. The envoys are to wait [in Augsburg] for the imperial decision [on reconciliation]. The emperor grants them free passage to Augsburg and back to their homeland with this letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">All estates and members of the empire, the territorial lords along with their subjects and dignitaries, as well as all officers (including the cavalry and foot soldiers!) are commanded to grant the Konstanz envoys and their companions free passage to the emperor and not to harm them, nor allow anyone else to do so. [In case of disregard] the imperial ban is threatened.</p>

      <p>The situation with the Duke of Württemberg is quite dangerous. There was a rumor that the emperor had taken the matter into his own hands, etc. But it is nothing. It is now written from Augsburg that he has scheduled two court days against the king before the new Archbishop of Cologne and will soon give the final verdict. However, it is believed that the duke must flee the country or remain under such burdens that he will never be happy again. Since there are also some concerns about the young one, they might want to leave the old one under intolerable conditions.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The wedding with the emperor's daughter and Ferdinand's son Maximilian is to proceed and be held soon.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It is also written, as is credible, that the emperor is allowing the envoys and the estates to return home from the Reichstag, but with the condition that they must reappear immediately upon further requirement of his majesty at the place he determines. It is generally believed that he will soon summon the estates back to Strasbourg and conclude the Reichstag there, so that he has an excuse to also intrude into Strasbourg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Magister Michael Cellarius, preacher in Augsburg, has recently passed away peacefully in the Lord. It is likely that they will appoint Haller again. The shortage of preachers is evident everywhere. The good shepherds, along with the good sheep, will die out. Among the successors, shepherd, flock, and stable will be alike: Everything good and righteous is falling away, and the worst is always coming afterward.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The emperor has sent a serious, very burdensome mandate to those in Ravensburg, that they must reinstate the abbot of Weingarten in their city, allow him the parish, reinstate the chaplains who have left, return the church property, chalices, monstrances, and whatever else belongs to it, and also allow their citizens and inhabitants who are still of the true, old Christian faith to remain undisturbed in their religion and worship, etc. And all this within six days, under the highest disfavor of his majesty! God help! What great, heavy crosses and temptations are these!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The emperor is pressing those in Ravensburg so hard because they have undertaken many innovations during and after the past war. Likewise, they agreed with the emperor at the Reichstag in Worms (before the past war) along with several other cities and estates not to undertake any innovations in religion until the convening of a council. They have not kept this. This is true, but they should not have kept it, as they were later better informed and enlightened by God with the recognition of the truth.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>On our behalf, a distinguished man from Augsburg wrote to someone: "The people of Konstanz will not be reconciled unless they humbly appeal to the emperor's majesty. And if they do not do this, they will always remain in this burden. Moreover, they might still face an irreversible punishment this spring," etc. This person is daily at the emperor's table, has free access to him. Thus, nothing is ahead in the world but great fear, misery, and distress.</p>

      <p>Now we receive the imperial safe-conduct, which is so arranged that some are very frightened by it. For it has something dubious about it, which requires careful attention.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Pray for our people with all the pious, that He may kindly impart to them the spirit of wisdom and His counsel, so that they do not deviate from the rule of His will, and that He does not allow us to be deceived by the deceit of the children of this world, but eternally preserve us in our own simplicity and that of His spirit.</p>

      <p>I send you in confidence a copy of the safe-conduct with a friendly request that you examine it most diligently and share with me your judgment and thoughts on it. I truly do not know why my lords are dispatching this messenger. I have become aware of it by chance. Send me the copy back and, by our friendship, ensure that no one copies it, lest it be to my detriment.</p>

      <p>We, Charles, etc., acknowledge that the old mayor and council of the city of Konstanz have appointed and dispatched their envoys to humbly seek grace and favor from us, due to the recent military exercise in which they, along with others, have been disobedient and persisted, and to await our decision on it. We have granted and given them free safety and conduct to come to and from us (until they are obedient again). And we do this hereby in the power of this letter.</p>

      <p>Therefore, we command all and every one of our and the empire's estates, members, authorities, subjects, and relatives, in whatever dignity, status, or condition they may be, as well as all our superiors, lieutenants, standard-bearers, commanders, and soldiers on horseback and foot, earnestly and strictly with this letter, and we want them to allow the aforementioned envoys and their companions, whom they will bring with them without danger, to come to us freely and safely, and not to harm, hinder, offend, or burden them, nor to command or allow anyone else to do so in any way, as dear as it is to everyone to avoid our and the empire's severe disfavor. We mean this earnestly. Given under our printed seal in our and the empire's city of Augsburg on the seventeenth day of the month of March. In the year, etc., in the forty-eighth year of our empire, and the thirty-third year of our reign, etc.</p>
