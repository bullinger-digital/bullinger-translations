    <p xml:id="regest1">Has returned [from TÃ¼bingen] and conveys greetings from Ambrosius [Blarer], who is heavily burdened by his office. Requests to ignore Bucer's letter and to await Luther's response [to the letter from the reformed cities of the Swiss Confederation], from which he expects some results in light of the outcomes of the Diet of Schmalkalden. Is concerned that Bucer does not let the concord issue rest and, through his actions, brings discord among the Swiss churches. Advises to adhere to the previously presented confessions and to avoid the appearance of distancing from Zwingli and Oecolampadius. Recommends writing to Bucer only after Luther's response. Does not believe in the success of the concord in the form desired by Bucer and regrets the interference of the Strasbourg people in the Swiss deliberations. Greetings.</p>

      <p>May the salvation and peace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>I have returned home safely, my dear Bullinger, and I bring to you, Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and the other good people countless greetings from Ambrosius, which he fervently prays to the Lord for you. Our dearest brother is certainly safe, but he is burdened with many labors, which he could not bear without the Lord's hand. Therefore, pray for him. In this way, you will pray for the common progress of the churches.</p>
      <p>Now, as you request, that I should not conceal what I think is worth reporting to you, I would do this gladly and deservedly. But if your letters did not give me the occasion, I would certainly have nothing worthy of mention. But now I advise, ask, and beseech you by all that is sacred, to disregard whatever Bucer has written, and to await Luther's own response, from which you will hear if anything further needs to be discussed. Matters were different before the Schmalkalden assembly, and different after it, and I do not doubt that Luther will be more reasonable than you can now persuade yourselves. All your anxiety is in vain before you hear what he has to say to you.</p>
      <p>If anything needs to be done with Bucer in the meantime, see that you act cautiously. I had hoped from the dear man that he would let the matter rest a bit; but it is not to be. I have two great concerns: First, that he is doing too much now, and second, that I am very worried he will create discord among you. And it seems to me that this has already happened to some extent. That is why he always mentions Basel, St. Gallen, etc., in his writings, as those with him, and Zurich, also Bern, as those against the matter. I have written to you more than once and write again (again): If your churches do not see eye to eye and act in unity, you will ruin yourselves and other people. Therefore, I also dislike Bucer's actions in this case, that he courts some churches and dares to attach himself to them, and speaks so sharply and entirely odiously of the others. Would to God that the matter would stand still for half a year and that one would leave another alone without annoyance! Perhaps it would be better handled thereafter.</p>
      <p>I do not want to judge Bucer's letters to Luther now; they speak for themselves. Regarding the proposal made to you again, I do not know what to answer, except that it does not seem advisable to me to deviate from your confessions already given twice or thrice. You have one, which you sent here to Constance for the assembly; you have two from Basel. If a sound sense cannot be gathered from these, I do not know what can be given by you. But if you respond entirely according to Bucer's prescription, you will do this not without the suspicion of retraction among all nations. Furthermore, how renowned the name of your fathers and teachers Zwingli and Oecolampadius has become; you must see to it that you do not depart from them, as they have handed down the truth so simply and candidly. And where have they or you ever said that one receives and eats only bread and wine in the supper, or that Christ is not present in the supper, which is his work? Therefore, if you are to confess these points now and in such a manner as if you had not confessed them before, you will slander yourselves and your teachers, but it will be valid where Luther and his followers confess that Zwingli and Oecolampadius held the sacraments rightly. But if you are now to swear to the confession prescribed by Luther, you will seem to depart from the simplicity and truth of your predecessors in this matter.</p>
      <p>So I do not answer Bucer now, but wait for the answer until Luther writes. If Luther then ever wanted a signature of his articles from me or something that I could not do without suspicion and a bad conscience, I would then ask him to let me remain by my confessions. Otherwise, I would not know what to do for him. I also do not know what else to advise you at this time, but I will think further, and if something good occurs to me, I will let you know. For God knows that the matter is of great concern to me.</p>
      <p>The good man Bucer has come to believe that heaven will fall if the concord is not established exactly in the form and manner desired. If it is God's will, then let it happen. But I have never believed it and still do not believe it. I would like to write to you further about it, but I know nothing more. May the Spirit of Christ lead you into all truth. Amen. Oh, it was a bad thing that the people of Strasbourg broke off your discussions by some force. For from this, freedom has been taken from you, so that your assemblies have not been without confusion.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my heart, my dearest brother. Whatever you have written to me is buried in good faith with me. I ask the same of you.</p>
      <p>May 16, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Greet for me those whom Ambrosius also instructed to be greeted at the beginning of the letter.</p>
