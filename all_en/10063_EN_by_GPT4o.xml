      <p>Greetings in Christ, my brother.</p>
      <p>I have always read and approved the books of Vigil. However, I am surprised why you ask me to explain this: "Philip, whoever has seen me has seen the Father" [John 14:9], since it has been explained by many before. Furthermore, while you confess the unity of the Trinity, you keep me within the boundary that I myself love. It is certain that Christ is not speaking of a physical vision; for the Father, being spirit, is not seen with carnal eyes.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the discourse is about knowledge. Now, the divine nature is more sublime than for its majesty to be knowable to us in its essence. Thus, only the Son knows the Father. It is sufficient, therefore, for our smallness now to recognize the ineffable goodness of God, which, by recognizing, we believe, are justified, and become blessed. For to what goodness is faith directed? Who is not blessed with faith in the most benevolent God? In this knowledge, therefore, let us progress, and charity will also grow in us, and an abundance of various virtues will overflow. Thus, it will be possible to reach the Father through the Son. And if we know how much the Son, who suffered for us, loved us, we will also know how much the Father loves us, who gave such a Son for us.</p>
      <p>Let us see, therefore, whether the context of the words can bear this meaning. He says: "I go to prepare a place for you" [John 14:2]; indeed, in the house of the Father, by reconciling us and interceding with the Father, he prepares what was predestined. Indicating that he will return and make us participants in his glory, he adds: "I will come again, so that where I am, there you may be also" [John 14:3]. It is the work of ineffable kindness and mercy to lead us by his humility to glory and by his death to life. Who does not see supreme love in this? Now, however, they had been taught about this, that the supreme glory of God is that to which he was going to pass, therefore they knew the Father, to whom he was going, in some way, and they knew the way to it through Jesus crucified, although Thomas, unknown to himself, cries out: "we do not know" [John 14:5]. But Christ explains and says: "I am the way, the truth, and the life" [John 14:6]. Is it not, when you recognize these things in me, that I am the truth and the teacher of truth, the life and the author of life, that I will rightly be the guide and way to the Father? You see so many good works and miracles in me, you recognize even in death the zeal for doing good. Who will ever declare the most indulgent Father as I do, who am no less prepared than he to deliver myself to death for you, so that his love may be revealed? Certainly, even now from the works of power you have come to some recognition of him and have seen; for they are not of the flesh. Here, Philip, not yet satisfied, looking to earthly things and imagining grossly, is given a greater confirmation of the words. For he adds: "Have I been with you so long" [John 14:9], doing good and working divine miracles, and do you still ask such things? Behold, I, as I am the brightness of the divine nature and the character of the Father's substance, so also by doing good I reflect the Father. Behold, you have access to the Father, whose so clear works you see in me. Do you not see the goodness of the Father in me and my goodness in the Father? Indeed, even the works testify to this, by which I lead you to the Father.</p>
      <p>This interpretation does not seem useless to me, yet I do not reject what Bucer or Cyril note in the meantime. However, I will also hear you discussing this matter more fully.</p>
      <p>Farewell and commend me to the venerable Lord Abbot of Kappel.</p>
