    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian would have liked to be more helpful to the printer's assistant [Franz] Spitz, whom Bullinger recommended in his letter [not received]. However, Spitz eventually had to realize that his expectations were unrealistic. Due to the circumstances, he could not inherit more after the recent death of his mother. Despite her great poverty, she was admitted to the hospice and cared for and well-nourished there for three months until her last breath. Before that, she had dissolved her household so as not to be admitted to the hospice empty-handed. Nevertheless, she sent her son four guilders and a coat to Zurich. Spitz ultimately showed gratitude for the care shown to his mother.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The news about Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony is confirmed. It was also conveyed to the St. Gallen merchants by credible men. The council had a report made from these letters for the Zurich council, which Bullinger will also receive to read.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] That Martin von Rossem, feared by all the inhabitants of the southern Netherlands, is said to have been defeated by the people of Bremen and the Hanseatic cities! This is said to have encouraged Landgrave Philipp of Hesse to resume the war. The southern German cities are also pleased with the news and wish for nothing more than to put an end to the devastations committed by the Spaniards! Only Constance lives up to its name. There is still hope for good from Strasbourg. The old Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, however, has knelt before Emperor Charles V. May men soon arise to restore the innate courage of the Germans!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Martin Frecht wrote only briefly [from Ulm]. Even though he expressed himself with caution and restraint in view of the many spies, he still proved to be full of hope. He sends his regards and warmly recommends himself to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Vadian reads with pleasure the writing [sent to him by Bullinger] from Cologne. How courageous is this venerable old Archbishop Hermann von Wied! He is probably the only German who deserves to be called an apostolic successor. May the Lord preserve him for better times!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings. Vadian will return the writing [from Cologne] as soon as he has finished reading it. He cannot read it in one go, as he is constantly interrupted by official duties.</p>

      <p>S. P. D. I would have gladly assisted the printer's assistant, whom you recommended to me in your letters, if I could have in any way. However, he himself experienced firsthand that he was greatly deceived by someone with the promise of a large inheritance supposedly left by his mother. She, however, due to her extreme poverty, was admitted to our hospice and was generously cared for and nourished for nearly three months until her last breath. She sold part of her belongings so as not to be admitted empty-handed, sending four guilders and a coat, which I believe she valued at five guilders, to her son in Zurich. Regarding this matter, even Spitz himself acknowledges that whatever was denied to him was due to urgent reasons, and he recognizes that a great deal of kindness was shown to his dear mother by our compassion.</p>

      <p>The victory of the Elector Prince is certain, and our merchants have received the news from very reputable men, as it happened. A summary of these letters was sent by our council to the Zurich council, which will also be given to you to read.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>That Martin von Rossem, who was a terror to all the Belgians until now, has been defeated with great loss by the people of Bremen and the German maritime cities. It is said that this has encouraged Hesse to take heart and prepare himself to sustain the war. The cities are said to be eager and desire nothing more than to relieve the dire destruction caused by the Spaniards. Meanwhile, only Constance will bear the praise and reward of constancy. There is good hope for Strasbourg; however, it is said that the old Duke of Württemberg has kissed the Emperor's feet. May there be those who gloriously vindicate the ancestral virtue of Germany, recalled by postliminium!</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Frecht gave a note rather than a letter, full of hope, but cautiously circumspect and lacking the usual freedom, which is not surprising in such a gathering of spies. Nevertheless, he sends his regards to you and all yours, and earnestly desires to be counted among your friends.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I read with pleasure the book sent from Cologne and rejoice that the venerable old Archbishop Hermann von Wied persists with such assurance in the glory of Christ amidst adversities. He is the only one in almost all of Germany whom I see as worthy to be considered a successor of the apostolic function. May the Lord preserve him unharmed for joyful and auspicious events. Amen.</p>

      <p>Farewell and love me. I will send the book once I have finished reading it; continuous reading is not allowed to me by frequent business. St. Gallen, the ninth day before the calends of April, in the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of Zurich, a lord and friend to be greatly honored.</p>
