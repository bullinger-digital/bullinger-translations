    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for his letter and for the response [of the Swiss Confederates] to the Imperial Estates; would like to meet with him in the next eight days, but for certain reasons not in the proposed Grießenberg, but in Stammheim or another location. Plintenburg was captured by the Turks. Reports from Piedmont indicate significant losses of the imperial troops [in the Battle of Ceresole]. There is no news from the Imperial Diet, except for a recently sent print [“The Electors, Princes, Counts... truthful and consistent report”] by [Philipp of Hesse] to [Konstanz] about the deeds of Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, which Blarer will convey. Wants to return the response of the Swiss Confederates to Bullinger at the upcoming meeting, after having shown it to others after the deadline set by Bullinger; it is said that Bern did not agree. Bucer, after a short stay in Strasbourg, has returned [to the Imperial Diet] in Speyer at the request of the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied]; he reports on secret peace negotiations of the princes directed against the Protestants; regrets that the Protestants failed to win [Francis I.] for an alliance against the Turks through peace mediation, and doubts the fulfillment of the promises demanded by the Protestants regarding religious practice. Bullinger does not need to worry about the [paid] messenger; he should suggest a place [for their meeting]; greetings. Forwards the dispatch of Sixt Birck [with his writing “Judith”].</p>

      <p>Especially beloved lord and trusted brother.</p>
      <p>Your letters have reached me well along with the response to the Imperial Estates, and since I would personally like to be with you again for not insignificant reasons and speak with you in person, and you have suggested Griessenberg as a place where this could happen, which, however, for reasons you will hear from me, is not convenient for me, my friendly request to you is, since you are well acquainted with the places and towns between here and Zurich, that you suggest a place approximately halfway where we could meet, with consideration of the day and the lodging where we might meet, so I will certainly arrange to be there at such a time, whether it be in Stammheim or another place, wherever seems most suitable to you. If it were halfway, it would be most convenient for us both to be there at noon and settle our matters, and then each could return home in good time the next morning. I would very much like, if it were also convenient for you, that our meeting not be delayed beyond the next eight days and that we could settle our matters on Cantate Sunday or the following days. I will say here that I must go to Griessenberg; no one will ask further. You will also find a pretext. May the dear God arrange everything with grace to His praise and glory. Amen.</p>
      <p>We have news that Plintenburg has already been captured by the Turks and many people have been killed. May God have mercy on His poor Christendom!</p>
      <p>The imperial forces are being written to more harshly about what happened in Piedmont, as the reports of the Swiss Confederates indicate, namely it is written in haste to Brixen and Innsbruck that over 15,000 of the imperial forces have perished, but very few of the French, etc.</p>
      <p>We have had no other news since that day, except that now a print has come to my lords from the Landgrave, which was read before the Imperial Estates, in which the deeds of Duke Heinrich of Brunswick are included; it will soon be read to you as well, it only arrived last night, I have not yet seen it myself.</p>
      <p>I will personally return the response of the Swiss Confederates to you, if the Lord helps us to meet. The eight days have just passed, after which you allowed me to share this letter with other honorable people; otherwise, I would have sent it to you now; it is said that Bern did not agree to this letter.</p>
      <p>Bucer has come home to Strasbourg for a few days and has now ridden back to Speyer at the insistent request of the Archbishop of Cologne. He writes to me among other things, that there have been certain secret negotiations about peace between the monarchs, where great harm is sought for us. Then he adds after some: "Our people could have achieved this peace for their own good, if they had known how to act rightly and had dared. For if the French envoys, who were solely seeking peace, had been admitted, it could easily have been achieved that France, completely detached from the Turks, would have joined us against the Turks, whereas now it is being pushed away from us to the Turks, to our great harm. Our people are seeking to establish such a peace in Germany that the preaching of justification, full communion of the sacrament, and marriage are admitted everywhere and that everyone is also free to follow our entire confession. What they will achieve, I do not know; perhaps something in words, in reality, as much as the world can grant to Christ." Tell the messenger nothing about this and do not concern yourself with him; he is now in my business. But let me know exactly the place and day convenient for you; I will certainly find myself there with God's help. Give all your household many kind regards, also my gracious lord Rösten my very willing service with the offering of all good. The Lord be with you temporally and eternally.</p>
      <p>Given on May 4th, in the early morning, 1544. Am. Bl.</p>
      <p>I am sending what I received yesterday from Sixtus Birck addressed to you.</p>
