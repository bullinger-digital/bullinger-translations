    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Emperor [Charles V] has risen and has written to the [Protestant] cities of the Swiss Confederation. The Zurich authorities are sending a copy of this letter through the present messenger [...] to the Basel council. Myconius will be able to review it with the Basel city clerk [Heinrich Ryhiner]. Bullinger never believed the rumor of the Emperor's death, even though it was reported to him by significant persons. The Emperor's letter comes from Rothenburg ob der Tauber and is dated December 5. It can hardly be a deception.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] At the Baden Diet, the Five Places inquired about the punishment of the Swiss mercenaries who went to [the Schmalkaldic] war. Back then, when their own mercenaries went to France, it was not an issue, but now it is! They offer to uphold the alliances and the peace of the land. However, Basel and Bern want the Five or the Nine Places to also promise them protection if they were attacked because of their religion. The Nine Places included the concern in the resolution. Bullinger has already written about this [in No. 2708].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] A Lucerne and a Freiburg envoy [Wendel Sonnenberg and Petermann Cl√©ry] have been sent to the French King [Francis I] regarding various concerns, so that he may prevent and mediate a bloodbath in Germany.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings to [Johannes] Gast, who should send the wool for embroidery or a message about it, preferably with this messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Myconius wondered why Bullinger wrote regarding the planned wintering of the Imperial troops in Hegau, "we shall see what comes!" Bullinger meant by this famine, scarcity of food, and also unrest in the Confederation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Myconius should not believe everything the merchants say. Although [Hieronymus] Sailer is an honest man, he is too easily convinced by the trivial rumors conveyed to him by his merchants. Myconius should not tell anyone this and should rather trust Bullinger as an [information] expert!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [Later entry by Myconius from a letter by Matthias Claudius to Francisco de Enzinas, St. Gallen, December 17, 1546:] [Hieronymus Sailer], Claudius's employer, instructed him to add the following news to an already sealed letter: Both armies are in Franconia. The alleged death of the Emperor is vehemently denied by the Imperialists, but it is reported as confirmed by the [Schmalkaldic League]. If this is true, we will soon hear wondrous news! However, if the Emperor is still alive, then hopefully the Confederates and the King of France will mediate peace between the [Schmalkaldic League] and the Emperor.</p>

      <p>S. D. The Emperor has risen and has written something to the evangelical cities. The Zurich authorities are sending a copy of this letter through this messenger. You will be able to see everything with your city clerk. I never believed he had died, even though significant and serious men have consistently testified to me in letters. His letter is dated at Rothenburg ob der Tauber, December 5, unless this too is a deception; which I do not believe.</p>

      <p>At the Baden Diet, the Five Places have inquired about how to punish the mercenaries. Now is the time; when they were in France, it was not the time. They offer to uphold the alliances and the peace of the land. However, Basel and Bern want more, namely that the Five or Nine Places also protect them in their faith. The Nine Places included this in the resolution. I have also written about this in previous letters.</p>

      <p>Two envoys from Lucerne and Freiburg have been sent to the King of France regarding various concerns, and to remind the King to prevent bloodshed in Germany; that he should intervene, etc.</p>

      <p>Greetings to Gast, and tell him, if he wants to send the wool or a message about the wool for embroidery, he should or can do it with this messenger. God be with you.</p>

      <p>You wonder what I meant when I said, if they winter in Hegau, you will see what will happen. What? I thought there would be famine and scarcity of all things, and also unrest in the Confederation!</p>

      <p>Do not immediately believe the news from the merchants. Mr. Sailer is a good and truthful man, but his merchants often deceive him with vain rumors, which he then spreads and shares with trusted people. But what is brought to this good man is often found to be false. Do not show this to anyone. Trust the experienced master. December 20, 1546. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother. Basel.</p>

      <p>After the previous writings and sealed letters, my master instructed me to add this news: Both armies are in Franconia. The Emperor is said to be truly dead, which is strongly denied by the Imperialists, yet our people write here that they have discovered it with certain evidence as a true and certain fact. If this is so, many and wondrous new things will be heard in a few days, but if his death is not true, we hope the Swiss and the King of France will intervene and mediate peace between our people and the Emperor. St. Gallen, December 17, 1546.</p>
