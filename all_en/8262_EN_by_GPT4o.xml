      <p>S. Our Zwingli recently left us so hastily that he would not give us even one hour; I had written to my brother on the same day. Therefore, since I had nothing else to write, and at that time the Savoyard affair was not yet concluded, I let him leave without my letters to you. However, I thank you for yours and especially for the kindness shown to all of us at Königsfelden, that you did not spare yourself but undertook such great labors for our sake, that you were willing to come there for us; if we can do anything for you in return, command us and you will find us most willing; [especially for the gift sent to my daughter, for which both the groom and the bride thank you very much and wish you and yours all the best]. The father-in-law also thanks you very much and sends his warmest regards in return. The same is done by the other gentlemen to whom I showed your letters.</p>
      <p>The Savoyard affair was finally concluded on the fifth and sixth of this month. First, peace was established between the Prince of Savoy and the Genevans for twenty-three years; meanwhile, all disputes and demands of both parties are suspended. The main points of the peace are as follows: 1. That they are satisfied with each other and do not break the peace with violence; 2. That the duke allows them to trade freely from his land. 3. That if he wishes to enter Geneva, he does so only with his usual court retinue, behaves hospitably with his people, and pays for everything, while they in return behave honorably, friendly, and peacefully; 4. That they maintain the status quo, what and how it has been since my lords took over the land; 5. That they are duty-free with their goods and money in his land like the Confederates, but that they declare everything they bring and do not commit any fraud or deceit in this matter. The Genevans hesitated for a long time on this last article, but finally accepted it after their departure. You have the main points. On this, my lords have also renewed the old alliance with the House of Savoy and extended it for 20 years, so that the peace with Geneva is extended by three years. Furthermore, it is agreed on how to deal with each other in all matters, customs, rights, etc., and that one should call him "the mountain" in his land, if someone wants to attack him beyond what is right and fair (whereas before all ways should be sought to avoid this). 2. That one is not obliged to help against anyone related to our religion, nor against his subjects if unrest arises among them because of religion; 3. That he also sends 2000 horsemen and some foot soldiers at his own expense at the request of my lords. That is almost everything; but you will understand it more precisely from the lord of Cham, to whom, as I think, my lord Schultheiss of Mülinen has written all the proceedings; for he is of this opinion. Therefore, I have nothing to add to this, except that I pray to the Lord that these things may be favorable and salutary for our republics and churches.</p>
      <p>There was hesitation about whether it was permissible to make such a treaty with an adversary of religion; but since it contains nothing impious, it was agreed by all the wise that not only could it be done, but it should be done; thus it was concluded by common consent.</p>
      <p>Among the articles of the treaty, it was also added: if any of the prince's subjects wishes to change residence because of religion and move to these parts, he is allowed to do so with all his belongings, only that he gives the usual departure fee, etc. While these things were being negotiated here (you will be amazed at these people), a certain great lord came (so he presented himself) in the name of some Savoyard exiles, but he had no legitimate and regular commission or instruction from anyone, only burdened with letters from Beza. He complained most gravely to the senate and us about the injuries inflicted daily by the prince on his faithful subjects, and recited many things, which were later found to be very vain.</p>
      <p>He tried by this art to hinder all the peace negotiations; but when he saw that he did not find ears and his arts were recognized, he suddenly left without greeting any of us, whom he would have gladly incited.</p>
      <p>I do not willingly write much about Sager; it pains me that such things befall him after his death; for he always loved me and seemed to be a man who loved justice and had a moderate character, especially when he was governor of Aarberg, and this very thing elevated him, so that he was soon raised from that governorship to the highest tribunal (we call it the Venneramt). There he raised his crest a little; for he was prudent, wise, and eloquent; dignity and authority were added to these. He was also made an aedile; there he began to treat public laborers and workers more harshly and to attract many things to himself beyond the old custom, which did not previously adhere to these offices, such as both brick kilns and the like. At the same time, new riches flowed to him; for in the past plague, his only brother, the governor of Thun, a wealthy man, died. Since he had no children, that only one, together with his wife, became the heir. His wife also died about a year and a half ago, and he married the daughter of Wurstenberger, a rich and very beautiful young widow. This happened in January of the previous year; but in this state, he did not complete a year; for he suddenly died on December 7th, after having dined at home and gone to bed; seized by a violent fate, he uttered only this: "What will happen to me?" After that, he could not give any other sign of sense, neither by voice nor gestures; finally, on the next day towards evening, he expired in this agony. A few days later, various rumors began to spread about certain specters that were troublesome to those passing by his meadows at night.</p>
      <p>A certain man complained that he was thrown into the nearby hedge and severely injured; others spoke of lanterns that seemed to be seen around those places where bricks are made; the servants, who fed those public horses that were under his control, were forced to change the barn and stables; so much did that terror infest both them and the horses.</p>
      <p>Finally, a certain simple, known, honest, and pious man, while fertilizing his master's meadow, which was near Sager's, saw his image from afar through the snow, which was still there, approaching him. Forgetting his death, he thought him alive. When he approached, he began to utter certain things obscurely, which he did not understand; for he says he could only recognize this one thing, that he mentioned the poor: "Poor people, poor folk." Then he, astonished, remembered that he had died and said to him: "If you had treated the poor well in your life, you would find it now." There he began to swell so much that he seemed to want to burst, and his mouth to burn, from which a hot breath blew over him, from which he began to feel so ill that he lay down for many days afterward. Finally, that one seemed to let his long clothes fall behind him, and under him, the hedge and trees seemed to bend and lower, and so he vanished. This he also affirms to have seen when summoned to the senate and the consul and in private to anyone. Since that time, we have heard nothing more.</p>
      <p>His wife, however, who was pregnant at his death, has recently given birth to a posthumous child. You have that story in brief, which I ask you to keep to yourself; for his relatives and connections are powerful, who do not like such things to be spread.</p>
      <p>As for Steiger, I know no other title you can assign to him than the one you usually do, unless you perhaps want to dedicate something to him; there it should be added that he is the lord of Rotulus or Rolle, "Schultheiss of the city of Bern and lord of Rolle." Otherwise, no noble title is given to him, although that lordship is not only a noble lordship but also a barony. The Savoyards call him a baron, and especially his subjects. Erbius, our old friend, has written to us these days and also sent these, which are due to you, which I wanted to add to mine. Although decrepit, he still tries to change his residence; I think he will move to Mulhouse.</p>
      <p>With the soldiers, it has come to this outcome: each one, after being severely reprimanded, was accused of their life and property and their life and goods were acknowledged to my lords, placed in the church on a Sunday before the whole congregation, to which he belongs; there they had to make the confession, of which I send you a form here, as it is used with one here. This has brought much fear among the people. With this, it has ended everywhere without bloodshed. It is thus a formula of ecclesiastical discipline, which is often and much used with us in other cases, such as with the Anabaptists, blasphemers, drunkards, idlers, etc.</p>
      <p>Send me back the note.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing now. This Batavian from Delft, a very learned young man, was recommended to me by Beza, and for this reason, I also commend him to you. Farewell. Greet all yours and ours. In Bern on Pentecost day 1570.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>I wish to know who it is that thinks John worthy of flogging for daring to ascribe eternity to the Son of God. I have forgotten whether you told me this about Blandrata or someone else. I would also like to know where or in which book he writes this and whether this book has been published and under what title. I do not inquire in vain.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and compatriot, to be very lovingly honored.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
      <p>The treaty of the Bernese with the Prince of the Allobroges. Peace with the Republic of Geneva. Sager.</p>
      <p>Their soldiers and discipline.</p>
