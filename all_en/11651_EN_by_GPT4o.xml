    <p xml:id="regest1">In his last letter [No. 1605], he hinted more at the conditions [in Graub√ºnden] than described them and still does not know where to start; they have begun to admonish the pension recipients, but the evil is so deeply rooted that it is difficult to eliminate; the fine gentlemen blame the pastors, who have been opposing the [receipt of pensions] with God's word for 18 years; everyone is allowed to freely spread lies about the pastors and gossip against them as they please. An Augustinian brother [Agostino Mainardi], an excellent Master of Theology, who has converted [to the Reformed faith] and settled in Chiavenna, has received from Comander Bullinger's commentaries on the Pauline and [Catholic] letters [HBBibl I 84f or 91]; request for a bound copy with price information as well as news about Emperor [Charles V] and the Empire. Greetings, also to Bullinger's colleagues.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. A few days ago, I sent you a letter, esteemed Bullinger, in which I hinted more at the turbulent state of our affairs than described it, and even now I cannot describe it; for I do not know where to begin. The common people have begun to admonish the pension recipients. But this evil cannot be corrected; it has sunk its roots so deep that they cannot easily be uprooted. Meanwhile, all the blame is cast upon us, the ministers of the word, by those men of war, those plunderers, who have done nothing except that we have always opposed this crime with the word of God for eighteen years. But it is free for anyone to speak against us, to lie and babble whatever comes to their mouth. We, abandoned to the Lord, earnestly ask to be helped by the prayers of the brothers, so that we may be delivered from these troubles someday. A certain Augustinian brother, an excellent Master of Sacred Theology and a man of proven life, has come to our parts, namely to Chiavenna. I was compelled to give him whatever I had of Bullinger's commentaries on the letters of Paul and the other canonical letters. Therefore, I earnestly request that you do not take it amiss if I wish to use you as an intermediary in this matter, so that I may find Bullinger's work on all of Paul's letters and all the other canonical letters in a larger format and bound after eight days. And I will send the price at the same time; but first, I ask to know how much it should be, so that I may send precisely what is sufficient. If you have any news about the Emperor and the affairs of the Empire, please write a few words. Farewell, dearest man. From the court of Rhaetia, the last day of February 1542. Give my warmest greetings to the brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and primary brother.</p>
