    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Ludwig Lavater stayed in Basel until the [17th of November, the] day after Othmar's Day, because there were rumors both about a war [in France] and about an outbreak of the plague in Paris, as a result of which the university there would be closed and the professors as well as the students had left. Lavater, who gives the impression of being reliable and prudent, was unsettled by this. However, to not lose any time, he did not want to return to Zurich, after there had been so much deliberation there about the place of his further studies. Initially, he considered Tübingen, Wittenberg, and Strasbourg. But Myconius advised against it. Then he thought of Toulouse. But Myconius also advised against it, especially since only foolish and backward doctors work there, who do not offer instruction in rhetoric and dialectics, so that the youth do not fall into "heresy" as in Germany. This was reported a year ago with full seriousness by a legal scholar [...] from Toulouse in Basel. Lavater finally decided on Orléans. Upon his departure, he asked Myconius to inform Bullinger of this, so that he could also inform his father [Hans Rudolf].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] During his stay in Basel, Lavater stayed at the inn "Zur Krone," where also imperial loyal nobles were lodging. He became aware of how much these people hate the Confederates and what swine they are. Thoughtfully, he once said, it seems to him as if these people, who are such indecent blasphemers, hate piety and goodness, and are drunkards, could easily be defeated by the Confederates if they attacked them, as long as the latter did not follow their example and kept God in mind.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The nobleman [Friedrich] von Reifenberg recently received a letter advising him to leave Basel, as there would be an attack on the Swiss. A citizen [...] from Neuenburg am Rhein, who came to the [Martini] fair, complained that he had to accommodate eight soldiers. Similar rumors are coming from Rheinfelden and the [other three] Rhine towns [Säckingen, Laufenburg, and Waldshut]. A young man [...], who attends school in Basel and returned a few days ago from his home in the Kinzigtal, reported how everyone there is proclaiming that they will crush the "milk-eaters" [i.e., the Confederates]. You can see how this corpse [Emperor Charles V.] is gradually encircling the carefree, even naive Confederates! And suddenly he will attack them from all sides and subjugate them! Myconius is concerned about the security in which many are lulled, about their dulled minds, their greed for money, and the hatred they harbor against Christ. Let us pray unceasingly!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings, also to Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [P.S.:] Bullinger should understand that Myconius had to give vent to his displeasure.</p>

      <p>S. Lavater stayed here until the day after Othmar's Day due to various rumors that had arrived, now about war, now about the plague raging in Paris, and about the school being closed and the lecturers absent, with the students dispersed. These things put the young man, who seems to me to be very good and sincere, in doubt. However, he had decided not to return to his homeland at this time (from which many consultations arose about where he should go), so as not to be forced to waste time. He had thought about Tübingen, Wittenberg, Strasbourg. I dissuaded him as much as I could. Toulouse came to mind. Again, I dissuaded him, because there they only produce foolish doctors and barbarians. For all good letters and good disciplines, especially dialectics and rhetoric, are banished from there for this reason, so that the youth do not fall into heresies, as can be seen in Germany. Thus, a certain legal scholar from Toulouse seriously said in our city a year ago. Finally, he thought about Orléans and concluded that he would go there, and while saying goodbye, he asked that I explain this to you, as his father. I accepted, and now I do so willingly for his sake, for you and his father. I ask that you consider this favorably.</p>

      <p>During his stay here at the sign of the crown, where noble imperialists lodge, he learned how much these people pursue the Confederates with hatred, and what swine they are. For he once said to me with a serious face: "It seems to me that these people could be defeated with no trouble if they went to war with us. They are so morally inept, blasphemous, enemies of all piety and goodness, always drunk with wine, only let our people beware of such swinish evils and observe these things in them and have God in their eyes!" So much for Lavater.</p>

      <p>Besides this, there is the noble Reifenberg, to whom letters sent a few days ago say: "Leave Basel, for the Swiss will be attacked!" From Neuenburg am Rhein, a citizen was here during the fair, who with lamentation complained that he was ordered to provide lodging for eight soldiers. The same rumor is from Rheinfelden and the four Rhine towns. In our school, there is a young man who came from his homeland in the Kinzigtal these days. He says everyone is boasting: If they want to crush the milk-eaters once. (to slaughter) You see how they try to encircle us gradually without us knowing, indeed not believing, until with everything prepared, they suddenly invade and oppress us from all sides. Indeed, I fear for us both because of the security I see and because of the stupor I feel, add to this the greed for gold and the hatred many have for Christ. Let us pray without ceasing!</p>
