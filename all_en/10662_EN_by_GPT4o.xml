      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Time and again, I trouble you with my friends, intercede with you on their behalf, and commend them to you. I beg you not to be angry with my importunity. This poor Lepusculus, a learned and pious man, comes to you, who, having once burdened himself with another's debt, is compelled to continually struggle with poverty. The people of Bern have turned him away. Therefore, the poor man has nothing with which to live with his children. Therefore, if you can, help by showing mercy to a man not unworthy, or at least console him with advice.</p>
      <p>I am most grateful to you for the book. What can I say? Erasmus displeases me entirely. I am displeased with what he writes in "Ecclesiastes." I said, if you did not understand, that his opinion is tolerable to me, but intolerable to our age. I agree with you in all things.</p>
      <p>Regarding other matters, I bid you to be at ease.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>August 2, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, dearest brother.</p>
