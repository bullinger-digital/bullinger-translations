      <p>Greetings. I hope that my letters, most excellent man, written to you not so long ago, have been delivered. Now there is nothing to add to them, except that in France the persecution is growing more and more intense. The Guise brothers, mortal enemies of Christ and His gospel, are in power.</p>
      <p>The others, to whom Christ is well known, conceal and feign everything, overwhelmed by the cares of this world and blinded by the desire for earthly things. Recently, many were arrested in Paris, who had gathered in the house of a certain noble lady for a sacred assembly.</p>
      <p>The King of Navarre and the widowed queen are also said to be concealing everything, though I do not know how true this is. Therefore, I see that those sayings of eternal truth are very true: How difficult it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God, and also: "Do not put your trust in princes, nor in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation" [Ps 146, 3 (145, 2f Vulg.)]. I see, therefore, that this cause has been left in the hands of Almighty God, who will undoubtedly protect and promote it against the will of all the wicked in the meantime. For all of England has embraced Christ, all of Scotland has received the gospel and expelled the French, who behaved arrogantly (as they usually do).</p>
      <p>For this reason, they were once expelled from the Kingdom of Naples and from Milan, etc. Some fear that war will be renewed between England and France; but since our merchants have not yet returned from Frankfurt and have not yet brought letters from England, I will write more extensively about these matters later. My son Christophorus was ill in Treviso with Mr. Hieronymus de la Gessia in August. I hope he has recovered.</p>
      <p>I sent him money through a citizen of Zurich traveling to Padua this month and also through Augsburg, so that I think he lacks nothing. However, if he is in need of one or two crowns, I ask you to lend them to him if you learn of it. I also ask you to send these letters addressed to him promptly and safely.</p>
      <p>All of mine send greetings to you, our Johannes, and all of yours. May both your father and Mr. Rodolphus and Mr. Traversus be well.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on St. Michael's Day, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Laurentius Lumaga has faithfully paid the money entrusted by his father and owed to me on account of Hector, etc. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, most worthy commissioner of the County of Chiavenna, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chiavenna or Samaden in the Grisons.</p>
