      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters, most esteemed lord and godfather, once again. I received one set three days ago through our courier, and the second set yesterday through this local messenger of yours. I immediately shared everything with Lord Steiger, my close confidant.</p>
      <p>He reported what seemed appropriate to the senate. Now I am sending back to you the letters from the people of Chur to the king, and also the later ones from the people of Glarus.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Rhaetians, our people, motivated by the example of yours, also wrote to them and excused themselves for those letters written from Baden to them; for our envoys affirm the same as yours, that they did not consent to any document in the manner those pensioners interpret. They are still awaiting a response from them. What our people are now writing to yours, I do not yet know; for an extraordinary senate meeting was held today, as a new magistrate is being elected; however, I believe you will learn this from your own people. Steiger returned everything to me and only instructed me to convey his greetings to you and to thank you on his behalf. I immediately forwarded the letters pertaining to Geneva there, as a Genevan courier was conveniently present when they were delivered, and he took them.</p>
      <p>As for French affairs, apart from what we recently received from Mr. Gracilius, we hear nothing that deserves any credence. If the Austrian matters are as you understand them, undoubtedly greater evils will follow, and perhaps the avenging Lord will eventually punish that intolerable insolence of the princes and nobles; for humanity itself can hardly bear it any longer, no less than that of the priests and pontiffs. I would have already sent the problems of Aretius; but I have only one copy finally inscribed to me, which I would gladly send to you, just as Mr. Steiger, to whom the work is dedicated, offered his own copy; but soon, either tomorrow or in the coming days, Blasius Marcuard, my son-in-law, will bring me more; then I will fulfill my promises. I also wish to send you a corrected copy; for it is astonishing how much our printer in Lausanne has blundered, and I suspect it is due to the poor handwriting of Mr. Aretius; therefore, do not be weary of the delay.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write now, except that I commend you to the grace of God along with all yours, whom I earnestly ask you to greet on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 19, 1573.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you and collectively thank you very much for your work and your booklets, and they mention you with the utmost reverence.</p>
      <p>Your singular Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
