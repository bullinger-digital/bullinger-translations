      <p>If indeed Mr. von Andelot has fallen, we believe that too much has now been done; for Mr. Charles and others have asserted that he was the most outstanding among the rest. Our envoy and interpreter are trying to suppress all these things;</p>
      <p>There is a very fierce dispute between Mr. Vogler and Mr. Wisenbach with the mint master Karlin, and even the integrity of reputation is being contested; for Karlin is said to have withheld some letters, I don't know which ones.</p>
      <p>Chur, very quickly, January 4, 1568.</p>
