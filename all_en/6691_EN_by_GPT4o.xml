      <p> Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, since I was so certain of having a man who would deliver your letters to me, I could not refrain from informing you briefly that Lampert, about whom you write, is no longer in the city; therefore, I could not accomplish what you desire. But as soon as he returns, I will inquire into this matter. I have no certain news about Italian affairs. I hope that my two letters have reached you. I sent the last ones to you through the son of Nülen, Hans Nülen, and I absolutely believe they have been delivered, as it is very important for you to know what is being written. Today, some ministers of the churches of the 10 Jurisdictions, summoned by us, were here with us. They affirm that what was done by the envoys at the assemblies in favor of the Five Cantons was done without the knowledge of the communities. Therefore, I hope that many good people can be better informed; to this end, it would be very significant if the people of Zurich and others would write modestly, about which I also wrote to you before. Since our downfall is connected with your misfortune, this whole matter must not be handled carelessly. </p>
      <p> I informed you recently about Venetian affairs. We have no news from Germany, nor from France. We are eager to know from you what is happening in Augsburg and in France. Bäldius wrote that peace has been concluded between Maximilian and the Turk; but in Basel, something different is written. Please inform us of the truth, if your duties allow. Those who come from Venice report from afar about the greatest preparations of the Turk. Farewell, reverend Father in Christ. </p>
      <p> Chur, 15th of February, in the year 1566. </p>
      <p> Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend Father in Christ. Zurich, to Mr. Bullinger. </p>
