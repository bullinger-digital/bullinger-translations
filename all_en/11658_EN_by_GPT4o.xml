      <p>Our friendship, goodwill along with everything that we can honor, love, and do good, beforehand.</p>
      <p>Highly and well-educated gentlemen, especially true patrons and beloved friends and brothers, we have well recognized your very diligent and earnest efforts to provide us with a worthy and capable teacher without delay, following the harmful and lamentable death of our pious and faithful leader, Mr. Rhellikan. We have noticed and understood that you are no less concerned about this than your own affairs, for which we wish to express our high thanks to you, our beloved, as we rightfully should, with the offer of all service and faithful acknowledgment. We would like to ask you to continue, as before, to be committed and to look after our church with true diligence, so that the work of God, which has been planted among us by pious, capable, and learned men, may continue to grow healthily and remain in lasting existence, and that Satan may not bring his perverse seed among us, leading us into divided opinions (contrary to what we have learned so far), as some have assumed and would have gladly undertaken. However, we pray that the Lord will graciously preserve us in His true given and still enduring teaching, as we do not doubt it at all, since we clearly see and feel His fatherly support in you, our beloved lords and brothers. Although it is embittered and openly attacked and refuted before our eyes, it must not confuse us, but our comfort and confidence, heart and mind in this and other cases, must remain firm and steadfast in unity of faith with God, who is the founder of true love, friendship, and peace, towards you, regardless of anyone. Please also assure Mr. Michael, our current preacher, along with the schoolmaster, of all good things towards us; they will not feel otherwise behind us. The grace of the Lord be with us all.</p>
      <p>Dated in Biel, on Monday after Judica, in the year 1542. The mayor and council of the city of Biel.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-educated, venerable, pious gentlemen pastors, preachers, and readers of the city of Zurich, our especially true lords and friends.</p>
