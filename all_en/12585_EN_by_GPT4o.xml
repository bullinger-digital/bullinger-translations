    <p xml:id="regest1">Yesterday evening, Junker Hartmann [III.] von Hallwyl returned tired from the camp of the [Schmalkaldic League]. The Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse tasked him with delivering greetings and news to Bullinger. However, since night had already fallen and Hallwyl is already on his way to Bern today, he asked this Haberer to convey the following to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Yesterday, when he took a break in Baden, he spoke with the Burgundian envoy [Jean Mouchet], who is on his way to Zurich, as he feels that [this envoy] is spreading lies and making unfounded claims. Therefore, the Zurich authorities should be vigilant. To ensure this warning arrives in time, Bullinger should forward the letter sent with the official Zurich messenger and enclosed with this letter to the Zurich councilors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- On August 10, the camp moved from Donauwörth towards the Emperor [Charles V.], who had left Regensburg amidst plundering.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- On the same day, the Bavarian town of Rain surrendered, allowing the [Schmalkaldic] troops to pass through.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Duke Wilhelm of] Bavaria has twice given ambiguous responses to [the Schmalkaldic League] and is looking for excuses. By August 10, he should have given a clear statement. However, since [Hallwyl] left the camp on the 10th, he could not report anything further on this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- On August 5, a trumpeter [...] and a nobleman [... von Plato] were sent from Donauwörth to renounce obedience to the Emperor. However, the Emperor has not yet declared war on [the Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Before leaving Donauwörth, some companies were sent to Swabia to occupy the monasteries, seize their benefices, and abolish the mass. The [monks and nuns] who remained [in the monasteries] will be allowed to stay. However, those who fled will hardly be able to reclaim their income.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Hallwyl reported on the war preparations and up to 120 large and small cannons on wheels. The South German contingent has 63 companies, the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] and the Landgrave have 52 or 53. Bullinger is already aware of the cavalry. The Landgrave said he almost has too many troops, especially since 1000 horses and 4000 foot soldiers from Northern Germany are still expected.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The Elector Palatine [Friedrich II.] is sending [Duke Ulrich of] Württemberg 800 horses. Although the latter [due to his gout] cannot walk, he has ridden as far as Dillingen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The Landgrave took Hallwyl's son [...] into his service.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- When Hallwyl dined with the Landgrave eight days ago, the latter said he had nothing to lose in this war. For if he wins, it is solely for God and his Church; if he loses, then he dies for the Lord. Thus, he is a winner in any case. However, his enemies and the Emperor do not have such certainty. Allegedly, the Emperor always regrets [the war] and claims he is not ready for it. But for the Landgrave, this is just the ruse of a warrior.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- The Landgrave also spoke about Bullinger and Zwingli. He inquired about the [Second Kappel] War and lamented [the fate of] Zwingli, whom he considers pious.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Upon departure, he asked Hallwyl to write to Bullinger. He should call upon the councilors, pastors, and the population of Zurich to pray for victory over the common enemy and the Antichrist. The war is indeed the cause of all those committed to the true teachings of Christ. It is not [as the Emperor claims] the result of a rebellion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Hallwyl believes that the Emperor will not attack but plans to entrench himself in an impregnable place and then intends to wear down [the Schmalkaldic League] by waiting until they run out of money. If this is the case, the [Schmalkaldic League] plans to besiege the Emperor and, with the other part of the troops, take over the lands of the enemies. They also intend to demand money from the Emperor's previous financiers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- According to Hallwyl, the [Schmalkaldic camp] behaves piously and disciplined. He also dined with the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony]. None of the princes drink or swear. Hallwyl's servants assert that no one (not even at the court of [Duke Ulrich of] Württemberg) forced their master to drink.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- There are said to be ten princes in the camp. Hallwyl could name nine of them: the Elector [of Saxony] with his brother [Johann Ernst of Saxony-Coburg] and his son [Johann Friedrich II. the Middle], Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse], [Duke Ulrich of] Württemberg, [Duke Philipp I. of] Brunswick-[Grubenhagen], who had previously marched against Duke Heinrich [of Brunswick] and his son [Karl Viktor], [Duke Franz] of Lüneburg, and another prince, whose identity Haberer is no longer sure of (perhaps it was [Wolfgang] of Anhalt).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Haberer requests a friendly reception of the letter. Greetings, especially to R[udolf] Gwalther, to whom Haberer wrote last week; was the letter delivered?</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>May the grace of our dear Lord Jesus Christ increase and be eternally with you, beloved, friendly, and honorable sir. Last night, Junker Hartmann von Hallwyl returned home from the imperial camp. As he had promised the Landgrave of Hesse to deliver his high and friendly greetings to you along with some instructions as soon as possible, and since he was tired and the night had already fallen, and the time was too short for me to wait for any writing, and he had to leave for Bern again today, he asked me to convey these matters to you in writing; which I am also inclined to do with joy, if my memory serves me well. As much as I can remember, the matters are as follows.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Firstly, he asks you to be informed that when he rode to Baden yesterday and stopped there, he spoke with the Burgundian envoy, who indicated that he was going to ride to Zurich, and he held a conversation with him, in which he perceived that they are dealing with falsehoods. He requests that you inform your lords and warn them to be cautious and vigilant about them. He says they are spreading lies everywhere. And to ensure that this warning reaches you in good time, he thought it good to send this letter to you via your lord's post, hoping that you will convey it well and that your lordship will not take it amiss.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>On the 10th of August, the camp broke up at Donauwörth. They are moving to the right hand towards the nearest in Bavaria, following the Emperor, as he left Regensburg, having shamefully departed and plundered several private houses in the end.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>On the mentioned 10th day, the city of Rain, which is in Bavaria, surrendered without resistance and allowed the imperial troops to pass through.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Bavaria has twice given ambiguous answers and sought excuses, which the Christian allies do not want to accept. On the past 10th day of this month, they were supposed to give a final and clear answer. If not, he is already declared their public enemy. The young lord rode out on this day. Therefore, he does not know any further about the answer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>On the 5th day of August, a trumpeter was sent from Donauwörth with a nobleman to renounce the Emperor. However, he has not yet renounced them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Before leaving Donauwörth, several companies of soldiers with 100 horses were ordered to march south into Swabia, to take over the monasteries and register them, also to abolish the mass everywhere this time. Those who are found waiting at home will be allowed to stay and be graciously received. But those who have fled will hardly be able to return to their own. May God grant them victory, so that they may achieve this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>He tells me about a remarkable armament and assembly of large and small pieces on wheels up to 120, the Upper German contingent 63 companies, the Elector and Landgrave 52 or 53 well-equipped companies of soldiers. You already know about the cavalry. The Landgrave himself told him that he is followed by 1000 horses and 4000 foot soldiers from the Netherlands, so that he now considers the number of troops to be too many.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Elector Palatine is sending Württemberg 800 well-equipped horses. And, although Württemberg cannot walk due to gout, he has ridden up to Dillingen. There he intends to stay.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The Landgrave has shown favor to the aforementioned von Hallwyl and accepted his son into his service to wait on him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>When he, von Hallwyl, lastly, eight days ago, dined with him, the Landgrave, in his tent and the troops had already moved on, he, the Landgrave, verbally said that he has nothing to lose in this war. And further, in response to von Hallwyl's question why, he answered: Because if he wins, he wins solely for the Lord and his Church; but if he does not win, then the war is the Lord's, and he dies for the Lord; and therefore he is always a winner. Such certainty, however, his enemies and the Emperor do not have. Furthermore, he said, it is said to him that the Emperor is not prepared; he hears it reluctantly; he would prefer if he were prepared according to his will. However, he does not rely on these sayings, for the Emperor is a warrior; without doubt, he will not be found unprepared, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>After that, he came to speak about you and also about Master Ulrich Zwingli of blessed memory, and inquired about the same war, among other things, saying how much he regretted it; he was a pious man (meaning Zwingli).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Lastly, when he, von Hallwyl, wanted to take leave of him, the Landgrave, he asked him, for God's sake, to write to you and let you know that you should call upon all lords and brothers (the pastors) and the common people of God to earnest prayer, and urged to pray faithfully for them, that He may give them power, strength, and might, also to be victorious against their and our enemies, to overcome them, and to deliver the people of God from the oppression of the Antichrist, also to inform your lordship and everyone that this war is not only theirs, but also ours and of all those who have accepted the sound doctrine of Christ, have disregarded the Antichrist, and are not taken for their disobedience, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>He, von Hallwyl, also believes that the Emperor will not deliver a battle, but will entrench himself in a great advantage, intending to wear them down with time, to empty their purses and make them weary of war. If that is the case, they intend to entrench themselves strongly enough against him, and with other troops to move around and take over all his and their enemies' lands, and see if those same ones will also give them money for their undertaking, who have so far given money against them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Otherwise, he says that everything is going very well with them, they lead a disciplined, Christian, and serious government, with earnest preaching and praying to God, that He may be gracious to them and grant them victory. He also dined with the Elector, but neither drinking nor swearing was noticed at any prince's court. Likewise, his servants say that no one has forced him to drink anywhere (neither at Württemberg's nor at other courts).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>It is said that there are ten princes in the camp, who are now together, he, von Hallwyl, knows nine, the Elector himself with his brother and son, Landgrave, Württemberg, one from Brunswick, who was previously with them against Duke Heinrich and his son, one from Lüneburg, and another one named to me (I have forgotten if he is from Anhalt or what his name is); he could not name the 9th, but he could see him well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Such things I wish to be received by you with the best intention. For where I can show you love and service, I would be glad and not hold back. Greetings to your household, all good lords and brothers, especially Lord R.</p>
      <p>Walther, to whom you should also open this and tell him, I wrote to him last week, and I wonder if he received the letter.</p>
      <p>May God's grace be with you all eternally! Amen.</p>
      <p>Given on Tuesday, 17th of August 1546. Your reverence's always willing servant Hemann Haberer, landscribe at Lenzburg.</p>
