    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over the zeal with which action is being taken against the monks of Rüti. One is dealing with cunning people, which is why one must be well prepared. Konrad Lüthard should have expressed himself more cautiously. The monks should be summoned to the synod either by Stumpf or the Dean of Uster, or by both, where they will hear the charges.</p>

      <p>Heinrich Bullinger of Bremgarten, chief pastor of the church in Zürich, to Johannes Stumpf, minister of the word in the church at Bubikon.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I am pleased with your zeal, with which you pursue hypocrisy and malice in the most depraved monks. We will make an effort to curb the audacity of these most cunning men. It will be your task to fortify each point so that if they deny it, as they are ashamed of nothing, they can easily be convicted. We are dealing with cuttlefish and Protean tricksters. Therefore, it is fitting to be well prepared. We could not erase anything. For we do not know what is probable and what is merely plausible. We would have wished our brother Konrad to have spoken either more prudently or more modestly. But since the word, once spoken, flies irrevocably and envy aggravates the cause, we could do nothing at present but to beg pardon for an error otherwise not malicious. However, it seems that the monks should be summoned and called either by you or by the Dean of Uster, or by both. If they are present, they will hear the charges. If they scorn the synod, their case will be all the more burdened.</p>
      <p>May those ministers who trust in Christ with you fare well in the Lord. Remember your ministry.</p>
      <p>April 28, 1534.</p>
