      <p>Especially beloved lord and brother, I have delayed longer than appropriate in writing to you because of the bandits. I know this: When your letter reached me, I showed it to Crispin Fischer - since he had a cousin among the bandits - which greatly delighted him, and he thought they would receive it with great thanks and make an attempt. Thus, I made your opinion known to them as surely as you are reading this letter, but since then I have heard nothing more from anyone, nor have I learned where they are, where they are staying, or what their intentions are. I also do not hear that their lords are complaining about them anymore; everything is quiet with us. Now I know well that they do not despise your good lord's loyalty and friendly offer, and they also want to excuse themselves to those who offered to speak on their behalf, but another plan must have occurred to them, to leave the country for a while, perhaps hoping that their opponents would cool down and later, when it is seen that they are not pressing charges, they might come to a good resolution sooner. I suspect they have been accused before the 10 places more than they are guilty, but I do not know. I also have no doubt that if they let themselves be seen somewhere in the country again, they will not despise your proposal. I would have long liked to write a satisfactory answer, but it has not come to me, wanting to excuse them and myself with this.</p>
      <p>With this, entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>Given on the 29th day of November in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bercht. Haller.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his dear lord.</p>
