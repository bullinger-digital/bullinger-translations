    <p xml:id="regest1">Mainardi thanks for the [„Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio“] composed by the Zurich church against Luther. - The meal (cena) taken by the Early Church before the sacrament, which Camillo [Renato] referred to as "epulum" in his letter [No. 2279], Mainardi considers not obligatory, as in his view Christ did not give instructions about this meal (cena) in contrast to the sacrament of bread and wine. Even though Paul assured [1Cor 11, 23] that he had received from the Lord what he had passed on to the Corinthians, Mainardi believes that Paul was thinking of the sacrament and not the meal (cena), especially since Paul thought it better to forgo the [public] meal and take it at home, rather than shame the poor and discredit the church. Christ probably also meant the sacrament and not the meal (epulum) when he instructed the disciples to partake of bread and wine. Mainardi therefore believes that the church is free regarding this meal, to decide according to time, place, and [congregation], even if the apostles and the Early Church took such a meal following the example of that meal at which Christ [introduced the sacrament]. Mainardi asks Bullinger for an opinion. - Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my brother and lord, in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>I gratefully received and read the booklet of your church against Luther's assertions, which you kindly gave me as a gift, and I thank you for remembering me. As for what our Camillo writes to you about the meal or, as he calls it, the feast, which the early church observed before taking the sacrament following the example of the apostles and the Lord, I have no doubt that it is permissible; for, as I understand it, our Savior did not command about that meal as He did about the sacrament of bread and wine. Although Paul asserts that he received from the Lord what he passed on to the Corinthians, I believe that this should be understood about the sacrament, not that meal, since he judged it better to leave it and eat at home rather than shame the poor and despise the church. And Christ Himself, when He commanded what should be done with the bread and wine taken by the disciples, also meant the sacrament, not the feast. Therefore, I consider the church to be free in such matters, and although that meal was practiced by the apostles and the early church following Christ's example, we and Christ's church, being free, can vary and change according to times, places, and the qualities of people, which the Lord and Christ Himself did not command. I have said what seems to me, defining nothing rashly. You, in your piety and kindness, will not hesitate to offer your opinion and teach us for God's sake. I also earnestly ask you to greet my most esteemed lord and father, Lord Pellikan, in my words, and farewell in the Lord Jesus. Chiavenna, November 3, 1545. Your Agostino Mainardi.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend in Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Most excellent bishop of the Zurich church. In Zurich.</p>
