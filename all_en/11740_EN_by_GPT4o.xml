      <p>H. Bullinger to Stumpf.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>You are wondering how I like what you have written about the Zurich area? So much that nothing could be better. But I do not wish to say anything in person and praise a most dear friend to his face. I pray that you continue. I have added some things, which you will find; once you have used them, please return them. For I sincerely wish to promote your undertaking, not just to help. Nor will I spare any effort or expense, as far as my modest means allow, etc. The division into 13 books seems to have more clarity, grace, and evidence.</p>
      <p>Therefore, continue to follow the order you have established. I am expecting your section on Germany and what you have completed. I read with great pleasure what you send.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you and your wife safe. Zurich, 24th November 1542.</p>
