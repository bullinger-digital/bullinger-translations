      <p>Your letter dated January 11th was delivered to me yesterday by Andreas the courier.</p>
      <p>You complain in it about my and Mr. Musculus's silence; I believe, as far as I am concerned, that I have meanwhile satisfied you, since I have written once and again in the meantime; Musculus is now writing. I am now expecting a response and advice from you.</p>
      <p>I have explained what is being done about my vocation, how the delegation was established, and in what way it was hindered so that it did not arrive at the appointed time. From your letters, I have now understood what was done in the Wedischwil case by the 4 Cantons of Zurich, and I immediately communicated this to some; what will happen now, I still do not know, whether they will soon send delegates or not. Perhaps this matter will accompany those delegates who will depart for the Baden Diet.</p>
      <p>I wish the matter to be expedited so that I can establish something certain about my affairs.</p>
      <p>They promise splendid things, but only privately. The treasurer's illness greatly hinders everything from being done as it should; along with him, everything that pertains to the church and the school is languishing. I do not refuse anything with them, I show myself accommodating to everything, although I have clearly told them that I cannot leave my position in Zurich unless they treat me more liberally.</p>
      <p>They therefore want to first have the consent of the lords of Zurich, and then establish the stipend, although, even if they were to establish it now, it would not be appropriate for me to negotiate with them without the knowledge of the Zurichers. I therefore leave everything to the Lord's discretion; wherever it seems fit to them, I will serve.</p>
      <p>I hope the most honorable council of Zurich will neglect nothing that will be beneficial to the church and to me. I hope that the obedience I have shown them so far is not buried with them, although I easily suspect that I am being pushed by some Bernese with no less zeal than I am being received by them; yet I do not care. May the Lord's will be done. Would that we all seek nothing but the glory of God!</p>
      <p>As for the Wedischwil case, our people also have their excuses; for they think that, since they are laboring under great envy among the Pagans, their intercession would have harmed you more than it would have helped. However, they will present themselves at the next diet, as I do not doubt, accommodatingly. Others add other things. My sides burst when I hear of the internal quarrels between these most illustrious cities on both sides, especially at this time, when they alone among all the Swiss republics not only agree in religion but have also abstained from that foul alliance. May the Lord reconcile our minds and give us the spirit of concord! There are those who think the Pagans flatter you out of hatred for the Bernese, and indeed it is not unlikely.</p>
      <p>In Wallis, the Matzens have been raised; there is great concern about unrest, for the sake of the union. There was one in France, young Mr. Peter Heimgartner, who helped make and seal the union. When he came home, the people rose up, intending that he should provide for himself within 6 hours; they want to seek him out at home. He has brought the best of it and has retreated; it is not yet known how it will go. My lords have written urgently, offering mediation; the messenger has not yet come. Otherwise, there is no news, except that it is said that the Bishop of Augsburg has traveled on the road to Rome to the Pope; it is said to be certain. Greet your wife and your family, Mr. Gwalther, Zwingli, and all the other brothers from me and all mine. We are all well, both in Musculus's house and in mine, by divine grace. Farewell. Bern, January 17, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>About the people of Biel, listen, please, if you do not know, to the wonders: They have, neglecting both your letters and mine, received Jacob Funcklin from Constance, a young man quite confident in himself, as I hear. By what suggestion this was done, I do not know, and so I am very surprised. Thus, once again, our hope, which we had conceived for Mr. Gervasius, has been frustrated. We must pray to the Lord that, if it pleases Him, He gives us counsel and means by which we may assist his need.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
