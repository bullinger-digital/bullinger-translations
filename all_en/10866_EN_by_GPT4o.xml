    <p xml:id="regest1">Warns Bullinger against being too credulous towards Benedikt [Burgauer]. A council member - likely Mayor [Hans] Ziegler - has attempted to win the council over to Lutheranism, after Burgauer, citing letters from Bullinger and Jud, claimed that it was about to become generally accepted; Burgauer boasts of Bullinger's approval of his doctrine, but could only have obtained his consent by denying the statements objected to by Ritter and Peter [Schnyder]. The letter bearer is a trustworthy councilor.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>It seemed to me that it would not be ungrateful to you if I advised you to act prudently with the letters you write to Benedikt, as he does not interpret them with the candor you intend. You strive to win him over with your humanity; however, he becomes more obstinate. Therefore, keep this in mind:</p>
      <p>It happened these days that someone in our council gave a speech: "Behold, my lords, I have long warned you not to adopt Zwingli's doctrine. But I could achieve nothing; for you have wholeheartedly embraced that opinion. Now, however, many princes, all cities, and some of the Swiss with their preachers reject that doctrine and have defected to Luther. So, do you alone wish to persist, without the power to defend it?" etc., with many other reasons by which he tried to persuade the council to defect to Luther. Who it was, I do not know; but I suspect it was Ziegler, Benedikt's patron, from your letters and those of Leo, who pronounced this about you. Thus, your shape-shifter interprets; for Benedikt publicly boasts of his opinion, which he disputed in Bern, revoked in Schaffhausen, and now claims to return from the dead, pushing yours down. Therefore, he also preached publicly, as you have received from Peter Louffensi and my letters, not as he excused himself; for I do not doubt that if he had written the truth, you could not have approved of his actions. Now he imposes your approval on everyone, but does not add that he presented lies to you.</p>
      <p>But more on this another time; the messenger was in too much of a hurry; he is a tribune, a sincere man, with whom you can discuss whatever you wish.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>23rd of May, 1536.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and brother.</p>
