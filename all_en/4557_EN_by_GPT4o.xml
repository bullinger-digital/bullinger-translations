      <p>Greetings. I give great thanks for your advice, that if that little book of Pinceri, if it is sent back to him, cannot be printed by the next fair, rather it should be printed by you and the edition should not be delayed any longer, and with your permission, your observations on the same should also be sent back to him with the printed book, which I know he will accept with the most grateful mind, since he wrote that he willingly wishes to subject himself to the judgment of learned men among us. Otherwise, certainly, if it were sent back to him, I fear not only that I would not receive it back from him so quickly, so that it could be printed in time, but perhaps I would never receive it back.</p>
      <p>After it was sent back to me by you, I showed the same to our Doctor Wolfgang, who, after a few days, which he spent reading it, responded to me in this way (for I will gladly share his judgment with you as well): I read the entire little book on the Lord's Supper, for when I began, the beginnings attracted me with some unknown sweetness, the following parts invited me, so that I could not rest before knowing the end. Therefore, I found it such that, in my judgment, I would consider it absolutely worthy of being printed, lest such a pearl remain unknown to anyone.</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen or read anyone who has had such well-known reasons for both sides, who has disputed so distinctly and aptly about each part of this controversy, and that without any insults, which is very rare today. Except that the author's name is not added: if it can be added in any way, make it happen, so that we do not seem to act against the law of our magistrate. Even if he gets angry, as long as he does not sin.</p>
      <p>These are the words of Lord Wolfgang.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will prepare myself all the more eagerly to print it, and I will not delay any longer, unless until I am informed whether at least one or two of Philipp's letters to Calvin can also be extracted from him through your efforts. I also thank you for this, because you say you have already written to him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, whether they are obtained from him or not, it is enough for me that you give me the power to publish yours, which with the judgment of Philipp to the Palatine will be beautifully attached to this little book of Pinceri, and thus, that it may reach the hands of many, the little book of Pinceri will provide an opportunity, which perhaps would otherwise be neglected by many due to the novelty of the writer, and the envy or even nausea of the argument, which has been treated by so many until now, and is also heard badly by many. I am sending back to you your letters, just as I received them from Erastus.</p>
      <p>But so that you would not have to do without them, as soon as I received your letters yesterday, when I understood that you wanted them sent back to you from Erastus, I copied them all along with your little preface: in which if you want to change anything, you will send back to me that alone more easily than all the letters together. For I have decided to add it to the little book of Pinceri, unless you take another course of action.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beg you to send me whatever you want to change in your little letter prefixed to them, also at the first opportunity. I am indeed sorry that Brunnemann came to me about to set out for Heidelberg. I did not have certain serious and very necessary things to write to him, and unless some courier offers himself to me within a month going there, I am forced to send a personal courier there at my own expense. See if any of yours might go, please direct him to me first; I will gladly add some support for the journey. I am very sorry about the disturbed state of France and all the more, the greater the hope I have long since contracted that it will be better in the coming days. But we will pray to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he may have regard for the glory of his name and help his church so miserably endangered. Farewell and forgive me; for I have been too troublesome to you with the prolixity of my trifles.</p>
      <p>Basel, November 25, 1560.</p>
      <p>Johannes Oporinus, yours sincerely.</p>
