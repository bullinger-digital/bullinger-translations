      <p>Duke Maurice, who was reported dead, is said to still be alive, as was written to Captain Schertlin. It is also said that on Maurice's side, the Count of Heideck, two from Brunswick, and one from Mecklenburg have perished. Initially, it was said among us that the Margrave's horse was found in the forest and his cloak, etc. But now it is said that he is captured and, by Ferdinand's command, has been taken to Wolfenb√ºttel in custody. It is also reported that 22 banners from Maurice's forces have been captured by the Margrave, with about 800 taken prisoner. However, the exact number of those slain is not yet known among us; it is, however, well assumed that there were many casualties, as the battle lasted almost an entire day. There is also talk of a day that is to be held shortly by Ferdinand in Eger; many believe that there will be an alliance formed, with which they will oppose Philip, who is said to have arrived, to elevate himself to a Roman king or emperor after his father.</p>
