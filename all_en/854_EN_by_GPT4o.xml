      <p>Greetings. Since the common cause, about which I write to you on behalf of our entire class, has been explained to you sufficiently in detail, both in the common letters of the class and in those copies which are sent to you in the name of the same class, I did not think it worthwhile to comment on it at length with you. I only wanted to ask you to consider our freedom and familiarity, which we use with you, in a good light, and not to begrudge us the effort, indeed not for us but for the Church of Christ, which we ask of you. It would have been far more pleasant for us, and much more advisable for the peace of the church and the quiet of all of us, if this entire controversy, for which we now appeal to you, could have been resolved and settled between us and our brothers, the ministers and professors of the Bernese church, in such a way as we initially hoped and expected, and indeed you seemed to promise in your letters to me on this matter. For you wrote that you had no doubt that we would easily obtain from our brothers what was fair. We indeed considered what we were going to ask as fair, as what was most fair, so that we judged nothing less to be feared than a rejection, especially with you as a patron and intercessor, and that among those with whom we are not unaware of how much you are valued in authority and favor. We know indeed that your patronage was not lacking for us in such a fair and uncomplicated cause, nor that of our dearest brother, to whom you had written for this reason. But although I do not doubt that each of you did what you could, we have not achieved as much as we had hoped.</p>
      <p>Before we brought this cause to our brothers, we indeed wondered at such a suggestion against us, made without hearing us and on such important matters.</p>
      <p>But we were much more amazed that, after hearing us, they were so unwilling to retract their previous suggestion, especially since they had everything at hand, and the senate was so fair and favorable to us, and we had communicated all our plans with them through our own delegation, and had explained the whole matter, in our judgment, both in writing and orally, so clearly and familiarly. I have no doubt that our brothers thought they were acting in the best interest of us and our churches with their later suggestion. But it seems very different to us, who are present in the matter and see with our own eyes and handle with our own hands how pernicious such a suggestion is to the churches entrusted to our faith and to our schools and studies, and how our assembly is deformed by it. We experience without a doubt how dangerous it is to pass judgment on an unknown matter, and how little it suits the ecclesiastical ministry to want to administer distant churches with their own advice, neglecting those to whom their particular care is entrusted. But indeed, because we are certainly persuaded that nothing was attempted by our brothers with ill intent, but was procured with pious zeal, good hope nourishes us and makes us bear this more lightly, until another more suitable occasion offers itself to repair what has been scattered. In this matter, since your intercession and patronage will be of great importance, we implore your help: which we would have done long ago, as you can know from the time when the letters, which were sent to you by the common counsel of the class, were decreed. But certain things intervened which prevented them from being sent to you earlier, which would be too long to recount.</p>
      <p>I had some other things to write to you, which pertain more particularly to me: from which I will refrain for the present, lest I overwhelm you, already almost overwhelmed by our writings. For if this cause which we are pursuing turns out as we wish, there is hope for the best in all other matters in the future. All of ours send you their most dutiful greetings. Farewell. Lausanne, March 8, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zürich church, brother and colleague, most esteemed.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
