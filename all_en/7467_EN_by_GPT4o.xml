      <p>Greetings. Daniel Schram, a Silesian, who presents you with this letter, has been recommended to me by letters from Mr. Beza and the master of the court of the Palatine prince who resides in Geneva. We received him here with as much kindness as we could, and from our conversation, we discovered him to be an excellent young man worthy of honor. He is traveling to Italy for the sake of his studies; he is focusing on jurisprudence. I wish to ask you to recommend him in my name to those distinguished men among you who can assist him on his journey, either by writing recommendations to friends in Italy or by pointing out a convenient route and journey. I will not add more to this; for I know you will act on your own accord and do not need spurs. He will be able to explain various matters about France to you. Beza writes nothing else through him except that things are still turbulent in France, as there are those who do not want peace, whom the king will bring into order, and there is hope for solid peace; however, all the storm of war is certainly about to fall upon Belgium. May the Lord also be present in these matters and keep us all safe!</p>
      <p>Farewell to you as well, along with your household and all our friends, whom you will greet all and each by name and in order.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 25, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>"Count of Egmont has as his wife the daughter of the sister of the Palatine prince, hence the assistance, etc.?"</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
