      <p>Greetings, beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Our fellow brother Widler will give you letters written to my distinguished friend Schl√ºsselberger of Neuburg; in them, I write certain things that I would like to be faithfully delivered to him, and since I know that you have certain people traveling to Neuburg every month and 14 days, as our Lyner has often told me, I am sending those letters to you and I ask you, by our friendship, to take care of them diligently. If you give anything to the courier to ensure more careful delivery, I will faithfully reimburse you, once you inform me of what you have spent.</p>
      <p>From France, nothing but sad news is announced. However, I know that God's help begins where human help ends. Let us pray to the Lord, that He may graciously hear those who trust in Him, even if He does not hear those who trust in the arm of flesh, and that He may protect us.</p>
      <p>Greet your son, my honorable lord, the chief scribe, and all our fellow ministers and friends.</p>
      <p>Write back, I pray, whenever you have leisure, etc. I wrote this very quickly.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Zurich, November 16, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Kessler, my singular friend and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen.</p>
