      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your letter along with the money for the books purchased from our Oporinus. The bearer of the letter will be able to inform you of the news circulating among us.</p>
      <p>In Heidelberg, a papist mass was held, to which only two old women came on the first day, and on the second day, only one appeared; the priest was indignant and went back to his village, barely escaping the sight of some people. King Ferdinand is enlisting twelve cohorts, with which he will either destroy the Turk or suffer a disgraceful retreat. The papists boast about the reinstated mass and ceremonies; I wish they had no other joy. Margrave Ernest of Baden has called some of the more learned priests to him to explore what they think of the Imperial Interim. Our little hare writes from Augsburg that he will soon fly to us, I do not know for what reasons he is moved to prepare his departure. A bird of remarkable size, which at once eats 3 pounds of meat, has a crooked beak, large feet, and was caught by a farmer; for it could not take flight, as it is still young.</p>
      <p>Some think it is a bustard, others a large young vulture. A painter has depicted it. This should also be included in Dr. Gesner's book of wildlife, if he does not already have such a species of bird. A huge crowd is rushing to that village, almost a mile away from Basel, to see that bird.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 30, 1548. Greet Dr. Theodor, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his ever-honored teacher.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
