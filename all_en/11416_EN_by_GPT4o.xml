    <p xml:id="regest1">Gregor [Mangolt] will keep the boy with him, but thinks that excluding him from school was too harsh a punishment. The Bishop [Johann von Weeze] is cunning, and the people of Konstanz must beware of his schemes; asks Bullinger to pray for their steadfastness. Holds Bullinger in high esteem and thanks him for his services. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>I have handled the case of that boy you sent with as much faith and diligence as I could with our Mangold. He will keep him with him for a while, until he finds some way to better provide for him. Gregor, and indeed we too, think that the boy was treated too harshly, as he should have been given other punishments rather than being immediately expelled from the college, never to be readmitted.</p>
      <p>Many things of this kind are committed daily by those of that age, which can easily be corrected with education and proper instruction. But I think Mangold will bear what he cannot change, as long as others, who owe no less to the boy, also do their duty.</p>
      <p>Regarding the bishop, what you write is true. He is a very cunning fox, more so than can be believed, and he will cause trouble, especially for our city. Yet we are consoled by the fact that it is easy for the Lord to destroy all the wisdom of this world at once, which He will do if we depend on Him alone and His counsels, which we also hope to obtain through your purest prayers. Ah, my Bullinger, beware of ever ceasing to intercede for us with Christ, so that He may grant us minds worthy of Him, lest the people of Konstanz disgracefully or servilely do anything unworthy of their steadfastness. We are in great danger, and Satan is fiercely testing us, as if sifting us like wheat. Would that our faith may not fail!</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Savior Christ, my brother and my honor, and do not doubt that I love, respect, and venerate you as scarcely anyone else, since divine gifts and tireless zeal for helping the churches of Christ are so eminent in you. You have deserved so much from me that I never think I can give due thanks for your remarkable benevolence and abundant benefits, with which you continually adorn me and mine. May the heavenly Father, who is the horn of all abundance, fulfill my part here and most graciously enrich you with all His goods!</p>
      <p>Farewell again. All those whom you have ordered to be greeted send their greetings to you in return. May your wife, children, brothers, and all our friends be greeted in return.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, March 15, 1540. Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the man of outstanding piety and most distinguished learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most fortunate Antistes of the Church of Zurich, to be observed and cherished as a lord and brother.</p>
