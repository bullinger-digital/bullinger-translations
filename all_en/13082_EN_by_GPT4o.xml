    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Müller hopes that Haller has now arrived safely in Zurich. He deeply regrets that Haller had to leave Augsburg due to the dire circumstances. However, considering Haller's safety, it is certainly good that he retreats to Zurich for a time until the situation improves. May God grant this! Many good people are deeply saddened by Haller's departure, and Müller also mourns this blameless man.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] As soon as things improve, Müller would welcome it if the Zurich council, Bullinger, and also Haller himself would support the latter's return to Augsburg, to bring joy to the faithful Christians. For it is likely that the Augsburg council will again request Haller's return in the event of an improvement. Bullinger should then advocate for this, also for Maier's sake. He will be grateful to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The negotiations on imperial matters are currently stalled. In Augsburg, the plague is increasing, which is not surprising given the many people staying there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blessing wish.</p>

      <p>My friendly and willing service beforehand, especially to you, dear sir and brother. I assume, my dear brother and former neighbor Johann Haller has now happily and well arrived with you. However, I truly did not like to see that the situation of these evil times has forced him to leave here. Nevertheless, for his personal safety, there is nothing more certain now than that he is with you for a while in good security until the situation improves (which I hope to God for). But I tell you, many good-hearted people here are deeply saddened by his departure! I have also lost him as my faithful, well-mannered (decent), and blameless household member with great reluctance.</p>

      <p>As soon as the Lord grants better times, I would wish that it would be convenient for the honorable council in Zurich, for you, and for him to send him back here to cheer up the pious Christians. For I think that then an honorable council here will again request your superior for his return. If that happens, I ask you to promote this most faithfully, and that you also keep me in good recommendation. For I am ready and willing to serve you, etc.</p>

      <p>The negotiations on imperial matters are still in deliberation and undecided. The plague is increasing considerably; and it is no wonder, as there is a remarkable crowd of people here.</p>
