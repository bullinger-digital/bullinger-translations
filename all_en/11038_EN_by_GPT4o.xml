    <p xml:id="regest1">He is well along with his family and hopes the same for Bullinger. He wrote after the last [Frankfurt] fair but received no reply; he would at least like to exchange greetings. He offers his services. He has nothing new to write; Rudolf [Gwalther] will report. Konrad Köllin, [Bernhard] von Luxemburg, Arnold [Halderen] von Wesel, and [Johann Matthäus] Phrissemius are dead. [Francis I] continues to arm against the Emperor [Charles V] and has taken some places; the Duke of Guelders [Charles of Egmont] allows the French troops to pass, and the German princes do not seem well-disposed towards the Emperor. A papal nuncio [Peter van der Vorst] has come to Cologne; he is supposed to announce the council in Mantua to the princes, but the times are too unsettled for that. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Dear Heinrich, kind friend. I am, along with my household and friends, in reasonable prosperity and health, praise be to the Lord. To hear the same from you and yours would always be a special joy for me, etc.</p>
      <p>In the last fair, I sent a letter to you. I do not know if it was delivered; since then, I have not received any from you. Not that mine contained anything special, as some do, but according to the promise, if I had nothing else, I would only write "farewell" rather than not write at all. I would like to have the same from you, regardless of whether the carrier lost my letter or it was not delivered, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear Heinrich, I wish, if it were our situation, to have closer and more conversation together. But if that is not possible, believe me freely: If I could do anything to please you, you would find my unreserved diligence in it, etc.</p>
      <p>I have no news of this kind; Rudolf [Gwalther] should report better than I.</p>
      <p>Conrad Köllin, preacher monk, has died, as has the Luxemburger. Also, Arnold of Wesel and Phrissemius, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, the Frenchman is in intense war preparations against the Emperor even to this day, and has also conquered some places and spots from him. The Duke of Guelders allows them to pass back and forth through his land, those who serve the French. Nothing is heard here about what the Emperor's plans (measures) against this are. It seems to me that the German princes are not very loyal to the Emperor. May the Lord grant peace.</p>
      <p>Recently, a Roman legate from Mainz has been here in Cologne, who, as they say, has announced to the princes that the council will be held in Mantua. But I cannot believe that it will be well received, given the war affairs and other circumstances of the current time.</p>
      <p>With these few words, I want to commend you to the Almighty this time, and I ask you to convey my greetings to your brother, Mr. Hans, and your wife. I wish that I were with you for more than just a few hours.</p>
      <p>Given in Cologne, on Pentecost day, in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Your kind Dietrich Bitter of Wipperford.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my particularly kind friend, to be delivered.</p>
