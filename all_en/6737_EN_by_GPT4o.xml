      <p>Honorable Lord and Father, I have previously written to you, by someone from Bruck; I hope the letters have now reached you. However, as the response from the Godshouse from the Upper League came today, it states the following: if a Godshouse consents to the right, they want the writing of the Godshouse to be sent to the communities. Thus, the Godshouse's writing, in which they complain about their grievances, has never been sent to the communities, and they have also previously denied them an oral audience. Thus you see, in what kind of republic I am involved; it is very corrupt. I have no doubt that the Godshouse will become even more hasty. It is an oligarchy. Otherwise, it is still quiet. Dr. de Bellievre has come to Solothurn; the interpreter is traveling there.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, on the Saturday before Mid-Lent; I did not have the annals.</p>
      <p>Let me know sometime what happened with my letters in the senate.</p>
