    <p xml:id="regest1">Since your pastor Peter [Rümeli] has withdrawn his resignation and [Markus von Knöringen], the Abbot of the Reichenau Monastery [and parish priest in Frauenfeld], has given his consent through the bailiff Burkard von Dankenschweil, they now also ask Zurich to allow them to keep Rümeli.</p>

      <p>Reverend sir, when Pastor Peter, our preacher, wanted to leave us, which we regretted not a little, we approached him with friendly requests to stay with us. After much discussion, he agreed, but on the condition that he would have your advice as his commanding lord. We have therefore turned to our lord bailiff (since we have a decision from our gracious lords, the Confederates, that the lord of Ow should provide us with a preacher who is agreeable to the bailiff and honest people) for help and advice. He directed us to the bailiff of the lord of Ow, and we presented our request to him; for he, the bailiff, heard no complaints about the preacher and also observed a respectable, quiet conduct. This matter was then brought to the lord of Ow through his chief bailiff, Junker Burkart von Dankerschwil. He wrote to his bailiff in Frauenfeld at our request and desire, since no complaints about the preacher had come to him, expressing his will and opinion that he should continue to serve after the coming year of St. John the Baptist; he will ensure that his maintenance, as he has had this year, will continue, and the holders of the parish benefice, whoever they may be, must give him this, etc. Our mayor Federli also recently spoke with you in Zurich about this matter, as you left the church together. It is our earnest request and desire: Since the bailiff and the lay judge have no complaints against him and he is dear to us and well-liked, and since no one has left or withdrawn from us since he has been with us, and we would like to maintain what serves the promotion of truth, if we had support and protection as our adversaries do. We hope for this, since we are involved in legal disputes for our lords, the Confederates, you will, with your advice, as we trust you, also before our gracious lords of Zurich, not take this man away from us, but rather direct him to stay with us and continue to teach us faithfully and paternally as before. We are obliged to you in all good things, etc.</p>
      <p>Given on Good Friday in the year etc. 36.</p>
      <p>Hans Maler along with other believers of the holy word of God in Frauenfeld.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the honorable city of Zurich, our gracious lord and friend.</p>
