      <p>Greetings. The fact that I write to you less frequently, most illustrious and upright brother, I do not deny is sometimes due to my negligence. However, it is true to say that scarcely a third day passes without my wishing to write something, if the opportunity were at hand. But for almost the entire month, no one has set out to you to whom I could safely entrust letters.</p>
      <p>The king's envoy indeed generously offered his services to me for the sake of our old friendship, but I scarcely dare to trust him unless greater necessity compels me. For although he is an honest man, the role he plays often makes him forget what he owes to Christ. Now, through our friend Liner, I was going to write at greater length, if my health had allowed: but the pain in my side has attacked me more sharply than I could bear, so I am not equal to the task. As for Vergerius, who obtained a legation for his nephew for the sake of gaining profit, I want you to laugh with me at the impudence of this busybody. Either no religion will be established in France, or this head of doctrine will remain safe.</p>
      <p>Would that there were as much confidence in the main issue. The King of Navarre is no less sluggish or pliable than before.</p>
      <p>He is a generous promiser: no faith, no constancy. For although he sometimes seems not only to throw out manly sparks but to spread a bright flame, he soon vanishes. When this happens repeatedly, he is to be feared no more than a legal prevaricator.</p>
      <p>I add that he is entirely given to Venus.</p>
      <p>However, a matron skilled in these arts has brought forth from her boudoir something to ensnare his mind. This story is also flying around on the lips of children.</p>
      <p>I have rebuked him no less freely and severely about these things than I would any one of our flock. Beza treated him no more mildly, but while he patiently swallows our reproaches and does not flare up, he thinks he has somehow fulfilled his duty. The faith of Admiral is certain to us.</p>
      <p>Our colleague, whom I sent to him, works diligently to encourage him, without consulting anyone, so that no part of the envy might fall on the senate. He preaches openly with a large audience not far from the king's palace.</p>
      <p>All the adversaries shout that such audacity is not to be tolerated. The queen gently prays that he desist, but with no success.</p>
      <p>He has resolved to try anything rather than turn back, and he even did not hesitate to tell the queen that all remedies would be in vain unless I am summoned. It is truly incredible how fervently our people hasten to greater progress.</p>
      <p>Pastors are demanded from us everywhere with no less zeal than priesthoods are sought in the papacy; they besiege my door, asking to be led, as if I were to be petitioned in courtly fashion, and they strive among themselves with pious emulation, as if the possession of the kingdom of Christ were peaceful. And indeed, as far as we can, we wish to comply with their desires; but we are utterly exhausted, indeed long ago we were forced to squeeze the dregs from the workshops of craftsmen, if any were found lightly tinged with letters and the doctrine of piety. We indeed dislike the impulses, which are more than difficult to moderate.</p>
      <p>In many towns, because no private houses could accommodate the multitude, they have taken temples for themselves, and although they preach everywhere in Aquitaine without tumult, we would have preferred them to follow what has always seemed more useful to us. Nor are they frightened by the harsh edicts, by which the king orders all buildings where meetings have been held to be utterly demolished, and all who have gathered to be punished as seditious. But Aquitaine has greater freedom.</p>
      <p>The Parisian court, which extorted this last edict, thunders against our people with the greatest possible fearsome violence. In twenty cities or thereabouts, the pious have been slaughtered by the furious populace.</p>
      <p>No inquiry was held about the murders except at Beauvais. Yet in Paris, when the mob tumultuously attacked the house of a certain noble and wise man and, aided by friends, he repelled that storm, because twelve were killed and forty wounded, a decree was soon issued that he be summoned and, unless he appeared within three market days, he would be condemned in absentia.</p>
      <p>Now certainly is the time to pray to God, if ever there was, that he may remember his miserable flock and miraculously and quickly come to calm the storms. Perhaps shortly some change for the better will be announced; but if it happens, you will recognize a miracle. Meanwhile, we must be prepared to endure worse things.</p>
      <p>Farewell, etc...</p>
