      <p>Greetings, most excellent Lord Bullinger. I have finally arrived in Chur, almost overwhelmed by the flooding rains. I delivered your letters and spoke with the ministers of this church, including Lord Myconius, about my business; I find them somewhat lukewarm, either because of their nature or because the matter seems too difficult for them, especially since it has been rejected by you Swiss. However, they have not taken away all my hope that I will succeed. If I had Bullinger here, without a doubt the matter would succeed as desired; for I have experienced your authority, counsel, and wisdom, and how uniquely you love me. I fear that I may have to stay here much longer, until I have spent the rest of my money. I am wonderfully expecting everything from you that I earnestly requested in my letters while I was in St. Gallen. Show yourself to me as accommodating as you have in all other matters; for they will be not so much pleasing as absolutely necessary for me. Do not allow me to return to Italy without them; I will make sure that you receive much more from me in return. - The one who usually writes to me recently indicated that the most powerful King of Africa is setting out with great preparation and a huge fleet to attack Spain, and that Prince Doria has gone there with his galleys.</p>
      <p>Those maritime cities are making frequent raids against Brunswick. Maurice and his brother Augustus are provoking each other with continuous hatred up to the point of extermination. The Hungarians and Spaniards are exhausting themselves with daily skirmishes.</p>
      <p>In Venice, the persecution against the saints of God is becoming more severe; but what will happen, God knows.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a copy that was sent to me; once you have read it, I would greatly wish for it to be attached to these letters that will be delivered in Basel. It will be greatly appreciated by Captain Saertelin.</p>
      <p>If you have any news, please return the favor; send letters either to the ministers in Chur or to Doctor Augustin in Clavenna. Greet on my behalf Pellican, Bibliander, Cualther, and Gesner, and the rest of the church. Meanwhile, farewell in the Lord and love me. If Froschauer has received those copies in Geneva, you would do me a great favor by ensuring they are sent towards Clavenna.</p>
      <p>From Chur, the last day of June 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Baldassare Altieri.</p>
      <p>Let the letters be sent to Basel as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich, most esteemed lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
      <p>Postage paid.</p>
