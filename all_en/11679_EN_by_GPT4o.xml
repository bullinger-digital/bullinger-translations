    <p xml:id="regest1">Is not disappointed, but surprised that Johannes Haab and not Hans Rudolf Lavater [ZÃ¼rcher] became mayor; for the mayoral election in Basel, there is no convincing candidate in sight. Thanks for the news; fears that [the Swiss Confederation] could suffer harm and that the preachers might be held responsible. Some expect an attack on the Confederates after a victory of the imperial troops over the Turks and France and regret the [negative] response of the Diet [to the request to participate in the Turkish campaign]; perhaps God will have mercy if the people repent. Johannes Hospinian is said to have departed again, as he must provide [witnesses] for his planned marriage. Myconius is pleased about the recovery of Bullinger and his colleagues and hopes for Leo [Jud]. The unrest in Venice is said to have been triggered by Pope [Paul III], the French [King Francis I], and the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I], who doubted Venice's loyalty to the alliance. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I do not say that I am disappointed with my wish not being fulfilled, for I do not envy Haab's happiness; but I am surprised that the other did not precede by many parasangs. May the Lord turn it for the good! I am glad to hear that you have good hopes for him; I also pray that nothing disturbs this hope. With us, too, a consul will be elected next Saturday.</p>
      <p>There is no one in the whole city whom I could even name; families are so lacking. Someone must be given from heaven; therefore, I am compelled to implore divine support.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for the news you filled me with; for I knew nothing at all about what you mentioned. I explained it to some; then they said: "We indeed heard it before, but we did not want to be authors of uncertainties," from which I understand the certainty of things.</p>
      <p>However, I fear that we may suffer some harm because of the allies. But what then? Many will say it is because of the gospel, as it has caused dissension among us. If this is proven, it will be over for us who preach the gospel.</p>
      <p>None of our neighbors have gone to the military, from which there are those who predict that because the Swiss are left at home, if victory stands against the Turk, then they will rise against us, especially the multitude that went to the French. But if fortune also favors the imperialists against the French, the soldiers, whose service would not be needed, will, they say, similarly set out against the Swiss through the Alps, perhaps. In Lower Germany, too, all remain as reserves for the Upper ones. And there can be no doubt that those who predict this are not entirely vain. I know friends among foreigners who are wonderfully grieved that such a response was given to the imperialists at Baden, as they fear that this matter may bring us some misfortune. Unless the Lord protects us for the sake of the word, we will not be far from misfortune. Let us therefore do our duty and exhort the people to repentance and not desist until something is done. Who knows if the Lord will have mercy on us?</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen Johannes Hospinian, whom you and Gaspar recommended. However, I understood that he is here and dealing with a bride, but quite tepidly. The maid has a guardian who, having learned of the matter, arranged for him to be heard, and when asked about his goods and relatives, they say he replied that he has neither goods nor relatives. Then nevertheless the day of the betrothal was set; in the meantime, he could return to his people and bring with him, if he is serious, those he wants, so that the action is legitimate. They say Johannes left like this. Whether he will return or when, I am completely ignorant; for what I write, I do not know by what means I received it. I am also glad that you are all restored to health. I grieve with you about Leo; may the Lord be with him, so that through patience he may possess his soul!</p>
      <p>The authors of the tumult (so as not to omit this) are said by noble men to be undoubtedly the Pope, the French, and the Turk (I speak of the Venetian tumult); for it is certain that those three are in complete agreement, and while the Venetians are thought to be in the same number from the six-year alliance (so to speak), they understood some defection, and hence the tumult arose. I beg you by the Lord, to write nothing but the truth.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with all yours. I wish Theodore, Pellicanus, Gaspar, all to be safe.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 13, 1542.</p>
      <p>Os. Myco. yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant president of Zurich, his venerable brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
