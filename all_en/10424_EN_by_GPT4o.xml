    <p xml:id="regest1">If the people of Zurich did not intend to leave Karlstadt to the people of Basel, why then did Bullinger recommend him? Undoubtedly, it is solely his intervention that is to blame for the fact that the council of Zurich does not want to let him go. Now the people of Basel must send a special envoy to Zurich on this matter. Bullinger could only reconcile the people of Basel, who are seriously angry with him, by now using his influence to secure Karlstadt's release from Zurich and achieving that. Bullinger should respond to the letter given to the relative Leo Jud's Hans Heinrich Winkeli?</p>

      <p>Greetings. Since it was not your intention to release Karlstadt, why did you so strongly recommend the man? Why did you add at the end of your last letter: "What about Karlstadt," as if we had forgotten about him? There is no doubt that you alone are the reason why the council does not want to release him, due to the recommendation, which I dreamt you both initiated and completed in person. It would have been better if, after presenting our reasons for accepting him, you had advised them to comply with our wishes in this matter, as it could be done without any loss to them. Now, behold, you compel us to send a delegation to your people for this reason, to plead that what has been decided with us, they should consider valid, if they wish to consult the interests of letters and our church in some way. Therefore, what was previously a mistake, now make sure it is corrected by whatever means, unless you prefer the brothers and the church of Basel to be more hostile towards you. You are mistaken if you think I am joking. For there is no one who does not attribute the renunciation to Bullinger, especially myself. Therefore, dearest of friends, make sure you reconcile with us here. This will happen if you ensure that Karlstadt is released. You do not need to retract anything, but simply say that you were moved by our pleas and by the love of letters, which you wish to see more promoted with us, particularly in the area where Karlstadt can promote them above all. We are not lacking in learned men, nor in the method of teaching, but here, as each is compelled to look to his own duty, it happens that we lie somewhat at a disadvantage. Therefore, if you do this, there will be nothing that can be reproached henceforth.</p>
      <p>It remains for you to respond to the letters I sent through Leo Jud's relative, Hans Heinrich Winkeli.</p>
      <p>Farewell and interpret our anger fairly.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 5, 1534.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, always yours, even while indignant.</p>
      <p>To Master Bullinger, the most learned and pious Antistes of Zurich, a friend and brother to be esteemed above all.</p>
