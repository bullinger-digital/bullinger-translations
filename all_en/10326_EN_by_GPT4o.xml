    <p xml:id="regest1">Encourages the people of Zurich and thanks them for Bullinger's letter No. 293?. However, the people of Zurich acted wrongly when they directed a certain "advice against their neighbors" without informing their friends in Basel. News about the Pope's return from Marseille to Italy and increased cooperation between Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Francis I of France. Greetings. Oswald is passing through Myconius on his way to Strasbourg. A Basel delegation is to be sent to Bern.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Counsel can never be lacking for pious hearts. Therefore, be strong in these great disturbances, which are only for the sake of God's justice. For God cannot abandon His own. Moreover, you have done us a great favor with your recent letters. They are indeed such that useful advice can be drawn from them. Regarding the advice of your people against the neighbors - you know whom I mean - it is very displeasing, not for any other reason than that it was not done in common with faithful friends. Unless I know the reason, it will remain displeasing as it has been. I will mention one reason: The spirit of those advising is so arrogant and more self-confident than it should be, that an outcome not differing from such a spirit cannot but follow. Consider what I say. I do not doubt that you understand me. Indeed, I wish that this had at least been communicated to our people.</p>
      <p>We also hear through rumors that the Pope has returned to Italy, taking with him the king's son to claim the five cities he promised him, and then the next journey is towards Milan, and that Hesse has sent all the leaders he has supported so far to the king. I know that a nobleman has been called from here by Hesse to take up a duchy, but I do not know for what service. The messenger urges me, so I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell always with your people and all the brothers, especially Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, in the year 33.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>That Oswald is with me, soon to depart for Strasbourg. I cannot extract from him what the condition is. Otherwise, he seems good and learned in Hebrew.</p>
      <p>This morning, delegates are being chosen to go to Bern for common affairs. Let me know if someone from your side is also being sent.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his dear lord.</p>
