      <p>Highly and well-learned, especially gracious, dear lords and brothers, my willing service and all good things are always ready for you from me. I have read and understood the contents of your earnest writing and request, and I would be very willing to advise and help in this and similar matters, indeed if it were possible for me. You insist so much and want someone to be sent to you who is so learned, earnest, long-experienced, and proven, that I truly do not know how or where one could find such a person.</p>
      <p>I have now served the church of Christ for more than 35 years; however, I do not claim to be such a person, but I can recognize well what the blessed apostle demands of the servants in 1 Timothy 3, and that we are all human and fallible. I also hold it to your credit that you are so careful for the pious church and honorable people in Davos, whom you would like to see well and properly provided for; but I think you should also allow yourselves a reasonable and appropriate satisfaction, considering that one must do what one can at the time, and God always grants grace to His servants, so that sometimes those who are less regarded accomplish more for the churches than those who are considered highly learned and wise. I can report this to you, dear brothers, in truth, as you, dear godfather, well know, that although we have a good school here, we must also be content with people as God and time give us.</p>
      <p>Since last autumn, we have provided for 16 positions here and only recently sent preachers to Altstätten in the Rhine Valley, to Zurzach, and to other places, so that we do not have many people at this time. You speak highly and urgently, advising how you should be provided with people, indeed where they might be found, or if my lords did not themselves need so many for their large territory, where they raise people with considerable costs and yet can hardly have as many as would be necessary.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you must also maintain modesty and not expect too much from us; you should understand this from me in all good. Mr. Rudolf Hüßli is in charge of Zollikon, has many children; Mr. Josue Finßler is in charge of Ottelfingen and in the county of Baden Würenlos; Mr. Glast has come to the large community of Sulgen in Thurgau, etc.</p>
      <p>But so that you may see that I would gladly serve the honorable people in Davos and also you, my esteemed, dear brothers, I have arranged for my dear godfather Mr. Samuel Kolmar, who is here as a stipend holder of my lords, examined and in the preaching office, to travel up to you, to see the church in Davos and to let himself be seen and heard there. He is a pious, honest, faithful man, who preached years ago in Toggenburg, where the mass priest was set against him and drove him away. You may know how and what my lords have dealt with in this matter, though they could achieve little. He offers himself, if he might please you and the good people, to live honorably, do his best, study diligently, and conduct himself faithfully. If it should happen to him that it is too difficult, or the good people do not take a liking to him, he may return home to his position. However, I kindly ask you to ensure that the honorable people provide him with a reasonable compensation for his effort, work, costs, or sustenance, since he has undertaken and made this journey in their service. With this, understand my writing in the best way; for I am always yours and love you in the Lord, always ready to serve you. Always be faithful; for our cause is upright before God and desires that we act uprightly. Always praying to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>I would have liked to write more, but I have not been able to due to business. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, July 8, 1558.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your brother.</p>
