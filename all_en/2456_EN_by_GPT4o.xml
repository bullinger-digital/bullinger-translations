      <p>Greetings in the Lord. On the third of this month, dearest godfather in the Lord, I received your letter, from which I understand that my Commentaries on Genesis have been returned to you, as I had arranged with my son Abraham when I was in Basel. There is no need for you to thank me so much for them; I know I owe you much greater things. I am very pleased that you are going to explain Genesis to your church on Sundays; I hope that in the process, those things which either escaped me or troubled me will be addressed and explained by you. I ask you to write to me on occasion about these, especially if you discover anything that you think needs correction; it is inevitable that in such lengthy works, no matter how diligently one is attentive, some drowsiness and errors creep in, even if the mind is sound and averse to all kinds of errors. No one observes their own thoughts and words vigilantly enough; in the matters of others, we almost all have more than enough sharpness. And this book is otherwise so composed that it offers ample material for displaying one's intellect, in which I know I do not at all satisfy those people who, with a delicate palate, superficially taste the writings of others. I do not fear the judgments of good men, which are not only harmless to those who err but also very beneficial.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I beseech you, do not find it troublesome to send the enclosed letters to St. Gallen at the first convenient opportunity, so that from there, with the help of some minister, they may be carried to Augsburg by merchants. I live quite comfortably with my family, thanks be to the Lord, who sends heartfelt greetings to you and your entire household. May you live most happily in the Lord and greet in my name Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gwalther, Phrysius, and the others. Bern, 11th of November, 1554.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, godfather in the Lord. To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest godfather in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
