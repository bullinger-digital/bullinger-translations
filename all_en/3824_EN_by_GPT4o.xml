      <p>Greetings. I received your letters written on the 20th and 25th of December.</p>
      <p>I am informing the guest of the Stork about my intentions, and you should not doubt that I will do what is within my power; but we must wait for the opportunity to do so with the king's good grace. Yesterday, I received letters from the constable, who has returned from captivity.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of this month, deputies are supposed to meet in Cambrai to complete the initiated peace talks, and there is great hope for peace. The Turk is making great preparations against Hungary; it is to be feared that this matter may hinder the imperial diets.</p>
      <p>I am also writing to the postmaster to bring gifts to the most honorable lady, who is the host of my son and is like a mother to him. You will greet Mr. Martyr and Mr. Walter.</p>
      <p>I wish you and them and your families a happy year.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 2nd of January.</p>
      <p>Yours.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich. In Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
