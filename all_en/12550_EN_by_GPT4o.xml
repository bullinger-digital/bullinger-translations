    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer received Bullinger's letter from July 12 [No. 2496] through a messenger [...] from St. Gallen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Hans Rych], to whom Bullinger had entrusted a letter for Blarer [No. 2493], has not appeared. Who knows what might have happened to him. Bullinger should inquire about him, while Blarer will make inquiries about him in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Since Blarer only wrote [with No. 2500 on July 15], there is nothing new to report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Blarer is willing to write as often as he can. Nevertheless, it is not possible for him to entrust his letters to the city clerk [Jörg Vögeli the Elder] for transmission without further ado. He must always justify his letters addressed to Bullinger with good excuses, as [Vögeli] believes that the preachers should not concern themselves with [political] matters. Therefore, Blarer has so far rarely sent letters via the city messengers. And when he had to report something to the Konstanz council that he had learned from a letter from Bullinger, he concealed his source from [Vögeli].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Like Bullinger, the [people of Konstanz] would also like it if the [Swiss mercenaries] all remained together in their own division under one of the captains [of the Schmalkaldic League], and if a good [moral] order were maintained among both the [Swiss and German] mercenaries. However, the people of Konstanz will hardly be able to achieve anything in this regard. Moreover, the [military] people will not want to submit to such discipline.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [Konrad Zwick] sends his regards and does not doubt that Bullinger will come up with something to repay [the joke played on him]. Zwick will then come up with something new! But seriously: May the Lord bring the difficult situation to a good end!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Blarer encloses a [secret] alphabet that he once used with the late Johannes Zwick for confidential communications. Now it is again necessary to be cautious so that no one comes to harm. Blarer would therefore like [to use this alphabet in correspondence with Bullinger].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Bullinger will probably learn current news from the enclosed letter from the Konstanz council to the Zurich council. The situation [of the Schmalkaldic League] is developing better than they deserve. Thanks be to the Lord!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- From Baden, Blarer has heard that the preachers from Zurich are accused of inciting the population to war. This cannot be true, of course. The preachers probably urged their authorities to act responsibly, which was interpreted by malicious people as if the preachers had called for recruitment. But now that [no more mercenaries are needed], it is no longer necessary for the pastors to admonish their authorities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The [Konstanz council] prefers that men from Thurgau, Toggenburg, Appenzell, and elsewhere rather than from Zurich [have gone to Germany for mercenary service], for this way the Zurichers are still available to them in case of emergency. The Thurgauers have no colonel. Therefore, they are not as efficient. The Zurich mercenaries, however, would always be flanked by a Zurich colonel, whom they would have to obey.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Should unrest arise among the Confederates (in Baden, they allegedly do not get along well), it would be bad for the Zurichers if their brave soldiers were abroad. If they wanted to recall their mercenaries, it could cause great disadvantage to the [Schmalkaldic League], and it might not even be possible for the Zurichers to withdraw their men [from Germany].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Since [the Schmalkaldic League] has rather too many than too few troops, the Zurichers should keep their people at home until they are needed. For given the strength of the Emperor [Charles V] and the wealth of the clergy, this war will probably drag on longer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Greetings to the family and friends. [Thomas] Blarer and Konrad Zwick send their regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- This time, Blarer asked the city clerk [Vögeli] to allow the present letter to be entrusted to the Konstanz messenger service.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Blarer has been bedridden for three weeks with a hernia that occurred a year ago. Bullinger should pray for him so that he does not have to undergo surgery.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother. Your long letter, dated July 12 at 9 o'clock in the morning, was delivered to me by someone from St. Gallen on July 15 after three o'clock in the evening. I respond to it briefly in great haste.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>First of all, know that this young man you write about has not been with me, nor has any letter of the content you mention been delivered to me by anyone. Therefore, you should inquire where the messenger and letter have gone. There is much deceit and treachery in the world, and it truly requires vigilance, for everything is full of betrayal. Perhaps something else has happened to the fellow. I will also inquire in Augsburg to see if I can find out what kind of person he is.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Otherwise, there is no need to write at this time. I have just written to you, and you now know how all matters have progressed up to this point. May God grant luck and grace, that a good beginning may have a better continuation and the best possible outcome, and that everything may be handled with God's fear and zeal.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I will gladly write to you as often as I can; however, with our city clerk, I cannot arrange anything directly here. I must rarely come and bring the matter in a roundabout way, so that I can have it delivered through him and write to you by the same. For he is truly a very pious, honest man. But in some things, he has his own views, from which he does not allow himself to be swayed; among which is also this one, that he cannot approve when he suspects that the preachers are also taking up such matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Therefore, I have so far rarely written to you through the messengers that the city clerk dispatches on behalf of my lords. Also, when you write to me about such matters that concern my lords, I prevent the city clerk from thinking that such things come from you, for otherwise, he would be very opposed to it. He otherwise loves the preachers very much, but he does not like them to take up such matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>That you would like to see all your people in a separate group under one of our captains and that good order (discipline) is maintained on both sides, we would also like to see. We would like to help and advise where something is up to us. But we think that everything will be brought about in a reasonable and tolerable way. These people do not want to be properly served or mastered, as you know. People want to sleep with discipline in those places, as it is initiated.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>My dear cousin sends you many good wishes and greetings. He ensures that there will be no lack in the payment to you. He wants to expect and strive that he owes you nothing in return. Well then! Extra joke, let us pray, plead, and cry out from the heart that the Lord God may lead and carry out this matter to His eternal praise!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I hereby send you a writing, of which our pious doctor Hans Zwick, blessed, and I had a fragment, which I have written confidentially when I was not here. It would be good to be cautious in these matters, as letters have been betrayed, so that it would be without disadvantage to everyone. I have encountered so much with letters that I should rightly be cautious and handle them carefully, as I could also in many ways, for the sake of writing, if it should be necessary.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>What the news is now and how everything is developing and happening, my lords are writing very diligently to your secret councilors. You should inquire about these things from them, as I am undoubtedly sure they will not withhold anything from you, as it is good for you to know. Everything is still going well and better than we are worth. Praise and glory be to the Lord forever. Let us call upon Him with all seriousness, that He may be the best for us, not count any old harm against us, but deal with us according to His fatherly goodness and faithfulness for the sanctification of His great name.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>From the day in Baden, I hear well that you preachers in Zurich are being accused of inciting the servants to run and preach insistently, they should now run and are obliged to do so, etc. But I consider it a calumny. I know you are much better disposed than to incite the common servants in such a way. But remember, you make a faithful report of what is due to an authority in this matter, as I have learned from one of your writings, that you are serious about the matter and preach, etc. Such things are then interpreted by the malicious as if you yourselves are moving and inciting the servants to run. I have not wanted to refrain from pointing this out to you, so that you may better know how to handle the matters, especially since it is not necessary at this time that your superiors are also pointed in that direction.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>For I have been informed in confidence that my lords have so far preferred to see that the Thurgauers, Toggenburgers, Appenzellers, and others have run, rather than the Zurichers, for the reason that they prefer the Zurichers to keep their people, so that if unrest arises among us, we might either need people for a garrison, or we might perhaps want to make an incursion against the enemy, that we might then have you, whom we would then prefer to have than others for not insignificant reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>For the Thurgauers, etc., are a people without a single head, and therefore it is difficult to achieve anything with them for many, many reasons, etc. Otherwise, your people would always have a captain and superior from you alongside ours, whom they must fear, etc. You yourself can well see other reasons. I cannot write it down.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Should unrest then arise among the Confederates themselves (as it is heard that they do not get along well in Baden) and you then have many servants and perhaps the best outside (as we hear that many of your brave people and a core of yours are eager and very active), it would not be good. For then they should return home in such a case and be steadfast with you, as is proper, which might then be a great disadvantage to ours. Should they then want to stay with ours or perhaps the matters on our side are arranged in such a way that they cannot withdraw, then that would be a great disadvantage to you, if you should lack them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>In summary: since ours are this time sufficiently provided with people on all sides according to all necessity and the servants are rather too many than too few, it is best that you advise and help in every way with special persons of yours and otherwise in general, that they remain at home. But if over time the aforementioned cases occur, as it is likely that one will happen, then be diligent and apply all possible effort, as we then completely rely on you, so that we may have help and support from yours at that time. For this matter looks as if it will become very extensive, given the emperor's great power and the clergy's heavy purse. They will try all their salvation and well know that it is a matter of winning or completely perishing, and, as they say, becoming a bishop or a barber. Therefore, it is likely that this brew will not be cooked in one pot. But we are comforted in the Lord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Greet your household along with all good lords and friends. We desire their and the entire church's faithful intercession with you. My dear brother and cousin Konrad Zwick send you all love and good. I have dared this time, since I have learned that my lords want to write to your secret councilors, to ask our city clerk to also deliver this my letter to you.</p>
      <p>Dated July 16, 1546. I have been lying for three weeks now with a hernia that occurred to me a year ago. It is hoped that I can be helped so that I do not have to undergo surgery. And the matter is going well! Praying to God that it may go well.</p>
