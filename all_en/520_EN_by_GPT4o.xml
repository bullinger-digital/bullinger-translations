      <p>Greetings. To your most honorable wife, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, my wife wrote these days. I suspect she may have included some complaint about the incivility of those who serve the church here; for she frequently complains about it in my presence.</p>
      <p>Each nation has its own customs, which I endure quite easily. She constantly longs for the courtesy and humanity of Augsburg and cannot bring herself to consider different temperaments favorably and to bear the present situation, as it is dispensed to us by the Lord, with equanimity. I write this to you so that you know, if anything of this kind has been written by my wife, it was written against my own opinion. I therefore ask you to write a letter to your wife, which responds to mine, and to advise her to bear any fortune patiently in the Lord, which I hope will not be unfruitful; for she loves her very much and will eagerly embrace any letter she receives from her.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding the chief scribe of Lindau, who has so far remained in St. Gallen, it has been reported to me these days that he has returned to Lindau with his entire household. If you have any information on this matter, I ask you to write. Three days ago, Erbius, the pastor of the church in Richterswil, came here, accompanied by two fellow ministers, and indicated that in that region, the Metaxian superstition and plague have been introduced by Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, and the ministers themselves have been given the condition to either subscribe to it or leave their positions. The unfortunate duke thinks that by this means he can appease the emperor and retain his principality against the insistence of King Ferdinand, which will turn out for him just as it did for the people of Constance with a similar plan.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, most esteemed man. Greetings to your entire household, to all my lords and brothers there, and to Lord Johann Butler, my dearest friend.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 13, 1549.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian M. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the church in Zürich, my dearest lord and brother.</p>
