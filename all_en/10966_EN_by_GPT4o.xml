    <p xml:id="regest1">The introduction of the letter to Luther contains - perhaps due to the fault of the scribes - no clear approval of the [Wittenberg] Articles, which is why the city clerk [Heinrich Ryhiner] has improved the text; [the Basel council] requests Bullinger's confirmation that this revision corresponds to the original, and wishes to avoid time-consuming consultations. The desire of Bern not to address the letter directly to Luther is incomprehensible; Basel will hardly be dissuaded from this intention.</p>

      <p>Greetings. We are sending the preface to you, regarding the matters we agreed upon, to be sent for the purpose of establishing concord to Doctor Martin Luther. This is because it was found to be so incomplete and obscure that we ourselves do not know what it contains. But Luther has received no response here to his articles, so that one might criticize the entire writing as futile. At the same time, we all agreed that the articles would please us if the intention were as the declaration of the people of Strasbourg would explain. We found almost nothing of the sort in our copy, which we believe is due to the fault of the scribes who misunderstood your dictation. Therefore, the chief scribe of our city has corrected it, giving it the form you see. So if it is similar to your draft, all is well. If not, we wish to be informed. Although in the meantime, we have no doubt that what we are sending cannot be displeasing, since it expresses the opinion we all once approved. We wanted to write this to you, not to the council, so as not to trouble them, and because we judged that a complete copy could be found with you. If a more extensive consultation seems necessary, we leave it to your prudence, provided everything is done in time, as your skill knows how to arrange.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the people of Bern have responded so ineptly about not sending the writing to Luther that no one is not amazed. And what have we done so far if we do not care for concord with Luther, but with the people of Strasbourg? Perhaps they think the matter is like the treaties of this world. I wish they could be persuaded to change their opinion! But if that cannot be done, I understand that our people will proceed in such a holy matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 3, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a very venerable brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
