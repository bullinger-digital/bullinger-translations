      <p>Dear brother-in-law, since it is currently not about appointing a pastor or preacher, but rather about an expectator (as you will see in the letters), who will take care of Mr. Isaak for a few weeks, I do not think it necessary to trouble my lords of the council and citizens.</p>
      <p>If you do not think otherwise, I would like to call upon the pastors and preachers alone tomorrow to deliberate on how we might assist the pious, faithful Mr. Isaak. We otherwise have available Johann Jakob Baan, Jonas Duckbücher, Johann Huser from Aesch, Johann Jakob Fry, Johann Jakob Löffelsperg, etc. God be with you. Once you have read the letters, please send them back to me with this messenger along with your opinion on what you think is good, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
