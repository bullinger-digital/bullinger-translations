      <p>Greetings. How great your care and concern for us is becoming more and more apparent; therefore, we cannot express enough thanks to you, especially because you preferred to send this personal messenger rather than let us remain ignorant any longer about the matters you write concerning both the Rhaetian affairs and others. All of our people praise and admire this diligence in you and are ready to return thanks to you. They, along with the consuls, quaestors, and the entire senate, who heard these things read today, send their greetings in return. I am indeed sending everything back at once through this messenger, whom I have kept longer so that the lords could inspect those things and then they could be safely and surely returned to you.</p>
      <p>I also thank you for the English matters. As for my booklet, it is entirely in your power; I never intended to publish it, and since it is approved by you, let it be done as you please, to whose judgment I commit and submit myself and all my things. I thank you for the changed title; I recognize how it would have been if it had been published as I had set it.</p>
      <p>In other matters, I also grant you to change, do, arrange whatever you wish and as it seems best to you, especially in the dedicatory letter, which I send to you here. Either correct it as it seems best to you, or omit it entirely if you wish, or add another in its place under your name. I acknowledge that I am not sufficiently prudent and circumspect in such matters; however, I wanted to send a draft to at least give you a taste of my thoughts. Forgive me, however, for causing you so much trouble in this, who have more serious matters to attend to; but since I know I can easily obtain everything from you, I therefore dare to ask you for anything.</p>
      <p>As for the new matters, we have absolutely nothing from France, Geneva, or elsewhere. In Geneva, the plague is raging again; it has also taken away Mr. Crispin the printer, as I believe you have heard, along with some of his children. They suspect that these things arise from certain witches and pestilential powder scattered around; therefore, they are again investigating them. In Lausanne, the beginnings of this evil are also showing themselves again. May the Lord be gracious to us! I hear that the case of Gagneus in Geneva has been brought to an end; however, I do not yet know how it turned out. Some would like to bring him to Lausanne willingly; but I fear that this may serve to further dissociate these churches. Otherwise, I hear he is being called by the Queen of Navarre.</p>
      <p>They say the marriage of the King of Navarre with the sister of the king is proceeding and it has already been granted by the king that the solemn blessing of this marriage will be performed not by a papist priest, but by an evangelical minister. I have nothing else now.</p>
      <p>I pray the Lord to keep you safe and sound with us for as long as possible. All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 6, 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours in all things, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>[S]amuel Telamon sends you special thanks, and since he is too busy to write now, he sends you many greetings through me.</p>
      <p>He shared his things with me, and I with him, and I add these particularly in his name.</p>
      <p>I thought I would send everything back; however, the lords wish to retain those Rhaetian matters and ensure they are copied; therefore, I am not sending them back now, but I will send them through someone else soon.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
