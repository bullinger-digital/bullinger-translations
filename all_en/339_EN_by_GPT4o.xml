      <p>Greetings through Christ from God.</p>
      <p>Our brother Jacob brought us your pleasant and welcome letters, most learned and beloved in Christ Bullinger, in which we perceive your charity and tireless concern for us and the church entrusted to our dispensation. For when we acted with your sharp judgment and sound advice, we found you diligent and ready at all times, and we are thus convinced that in any honest and prior business, you will always be our advisor, and we give you the greatest thanks we can, for you have held our church, entrusted to our faith, in your most prudent and circumspect counsel, commended to you from the bottom of your heart.</p>
      <p>Now, it pleased our brothers to communicate to you what was proposed to the ministers of the word in the city by our senate a few days ago.</p>
      <p>These are the things that were read to us word for word by the secretary in the sitting senate on October 29th.</p>
      <p>My gracious lords, the mayor, and the small and great council have recognized, upon the presentation of our loyal dear confederates from the 7 places, that the preachers should be sent before the small council, and it should be said to them that henceforth they should preach the divine word of the New and Old Testaments, considering themselves and the common state, insulting and slandering no one, and naming no one, so that no worse may arise from it, which my lords expect to happen to them.</p>
      <p>Regarding what should be responded to these matters, it was consulted by the brothers at the last synod; if the brevity of time had not taken me away, I would have written it here. But anyone can easily deduce what should be answered to such perplexing and, although many, words containing much in themselves.</p>
      <p>But, Bullinger, most beloved of all, we eagerly desire your opinion on these matters proposed to us, in as few words as you can.</p>
      <p>No mention was made before the ministers about the future council. We urgently request you to communicate your consent to the council and the opinion of all of you, which you will report to the deputies, to our faith. May the Lord keep you all, ministers of the word of His church, perpetually unharmed, whom we all greet in our name.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Hastily, in Schaffhausen, November 7, 1548. Heinrich Linggi, your most devoted. Simpert, Sebastian, Jacob greet you most dutifully.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man of the evangelical doctrine, M. H. Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, to his hands.</p>
