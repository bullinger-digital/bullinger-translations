      <p>God and all good things for body and soul here and there with all my loyalty and love beforehand, my heart- and dearly beloved lord and brother. Our pious Buttlerus has well answered your letter to me, for which I cannot thank you enough. I am heartily glad that your mind remains steadfast in love towards me; for thus is my true intention as well; otherwise, you will not experience it eternally in God, so the love remains steadfast. The quarrel is truly not a quarrel at its core, as you will understand more clearly from my writing, which you will soon receive. The unforeseen tasks daily burden me beyond measure, especially since so much is written to me that I would need my own scribe; otherwise, I would have answered you sooner or now regarding the matter in your letter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the oath, I do not think that you must swear at your disputation held in Zurich. To bind oneself with the oath to a unanimous teaching according to the guidance of God's word would have a different appearance. Since one can always dismiss any restless or false teacher, it might all be better directed in another way. But there is no need to dispute much about it; everything has its way.</p>
      <p>I am completely satisfied with your judgment and indeed highly delighted; for it is entirely in accordance with my heart and conscience. I thank you a thousandfold for this; may the spirit of divine wisdom be your faithful advisor in all your concerns, so that you may always recognize and meet His will.</p>
      <p>You have learned the form of my letter to those of Bern from the approving copy, and if it is not displeasing to you, it is my earnest and diligent request to you to send the letter, which you also receive herewith, to Bern as soon as possible, since Hallerus is also urgently pressing for a timely answer. However, if you find any deficiency in it, let me know and keep the letter. If you think it necessary for me to send my own messenger there, as you mention in the small letter, that I should soon provide the answer and send it to Bern, then you could arrange for someone in Zurich at my expense; I will repay you with thanks; for I cannot have the people here. My dear sister has nothing but people whose work she needs daily and cannot do without disadvantage; you might have them there. They are so much burdened on my behalf, it seems necessary to you.</p>
      <p>Please send me back the copy of the form of my letter; for I truly have no other copy. I would gladly send it back to you; for I consider it good that you have a copy, so that you may perhaps use it to prevent suspicion of other causes; however, do not let it be copied, so that it does not fall into the hands of malicious people, for reasons.</p>
      <p>What you have requested, that I should not write to anyone else, even if I were written to, you can be completely assured and certain of all things. Many distinguished people write to me and advise me greatly; but I have not disclosed a word of these matters to anyone; for I have often enough experienced how nothing remains unsaid.</p>
      <p>Regarding Wolphius and the others you mention, there is nothing to it. I will always maintain discretion, so that no one shall have just cause to slander from my words or other actions.</p>
      <p>That the four cities could not agree on a single response is not good; for these divisions, however small they are, strengthen the enemy and cause greater issues. I would like to know if they were also divided in the substance of the matter, as people say. May the dear Father in heaven give His holy spirit of unity through the Prince of Peace, Christ, so that the division does not ruin us.</p>
      <p>Regarding my letter to Basel, I regret that you should be troubled with it. I also wrote to my cousin about it, whether he could offer it to Staseli. I had also instructed him several times to deliver the letters to Basel to you with a coin for the messenger's drink; I do not know how he understood it, that he said to you, I arranged it through another way, now I worry he lost it, I write to him about it now. I thank you greatly on behalf of Doctor Nichrus.</p>
      <p>I have no news, nor have I heard anything about what you write. The commander in the city is very fearful, always worried that the Swiss want to take the city, wanting to say something for the truth. He has often secretly inspected the walls outside the city towards this land, and recently he has been running up and down by the powder mill himself, as if he were mad, etc. The abbot of Kreuzlingen buys an excessive amount of wine in Frauenfeld and elsewhere; it is thought he buys it into the city, when now the foreign people come, of which it is said that one is well provided with wine. There are still no more than two canons in the city and otherwise few priests, also a Franciscan monk or two. Some craftsmen are moving to Constance; they want to use the priests and do not grant the citizens their money. It will become a strange marriage. God have mercy on the poor people! No decision is given to the expelled, nor to the citizens who would like to move elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Two foreign soldiers with guns wanted to shoot ducks or other birds in front of the gate at Constance. As one of them loaded and wanted to shoot, the gun failed him; afterwards, it is not known how he overlooked the matter, he left the gun and shot his companion, who soon died from it, and his companion fled. Upon this, my dear brother added an epigram.</p>
      <p>I kindly ask you to inform me whether I could make a hundred guilders in Zurich through an exchange, which someone in Basel would certainly receive; I think there should be merchants among yours who trade to Basel. It would be a great service to me; for I do not like to send the money from Basel for many reasons that might arise.</p>
      <p>Now I find this letter; I still cannot find the copy and the other two. Excuse me to Haller; I cannot!</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
