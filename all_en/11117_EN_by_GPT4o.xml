    <p xml:id="regest1">Thank you for your letter. The sick Bernese church needs not only comfort but also remedies, as the spread of the infection poses a deadly danger. Since the special synod [in September], the epidemic of Buceranism has increasingly spread. After Eberhard von Rümlang presented his copy of the catechism edited by Capito and Bucer to the Bucerian pastors [Meyer and Kunz], they apparently urged the council to print this version, while rejecting the supplement promised by Megander as insufficient; there are also efforts to publish Bucer's "Retractations" translated for [Lienhard] Tremp. Both would give the impression that Bern has joined Luther and Bucer. Therefore, the writers propose that Bullinger and Theodor [Bibliander] should ask the Bernese council to be allowed to justify themselves personally, just like Bucer; additionally, the Zurich council should remind Bern of the decision not to change anything without the prior knowledge of the other places. This will not cause unrest, as those council members who have not yet been seized by the Bucerian fever would be strengthened. The [Strasbourgers] who do not belong to the confederation spared no effort in their interference, but the Zurichers can make representations without great effort and as confederates. If Bullinger and Bibliander correct the statements made about them, this is not an attack on the synod's decisions; they have already been informed about these statements by Megander, but Heinrich [Möriker], who recorded the negotiations from memory, could report more precisely. It is not advisable to wait for Bucer's reply to Bullinger, as the busy man will take his time. The council would not respond to a letter addressed only to the pastors. They urgently ask again to counteract in time, otherwise not only the downfall of the Bernese church is threatened. They disapprove of the proposal by the Bucerian-minded Tremp to send Wilhelm Zwingli to Strasbourg; his mother [Anna Zwingli] should be advised to rather send him to the monastic school of Kappel to protect him from contact with Lutheran superstition and papist remnants. They urge once more for swift help. Rhellikan promises the return of writings to Bibliander.</p>

      <p>Peace and a spirit of leadership through Christ our Savior.</p>
      <p>We received and read your letters with great expectation, dearest and most esteemed men and brothers in the Lord. From them, we truly perceived your eagerness towards us and your tireless zeal for defending the truth in the matter of the sacrament. This indeed could not be more pleasing to all of us.</p>
      <p>However, just as it is not enough for a skilled and faithful doctor to visit and console a gravely feverish patient with friendly and sweet letters, without applying medicines that soothe the disease and eventually remove it entirely, so neither is it sufficient for us, or rather for the truth gravely suffering, to have friendly correspondence and whatever solace through letters, unless suitable remedies are applied to the disease, and that in time, and all the more so, as the disease of the mind surpasses the disease of the body. For when the body suffers from this pestilential fever, if the skilled hand of the doctor is absent, perhaps only the patient or a few others, whom it infects with its contagion, will die. But the one seized by the plague (unless healing is immediately present) spreads the virus he has absorbed to everyone nearby and spreads it as widely as possible, so that not only the minds but also the bodies once again united with them are consumed together in the fire of hell.</p>
      <p>The plague or as if from a machine itself, about which we speak, is Buceranism, which first became a four-day, then a three-day, and then a two-day fever, and unless God helps us and others who are zealous for the truth as if from a machine itself, it will soon become a daily one. For the poison initially spread by a few and among a few for some time (as you know) lay hidden in the innermost veins, until the disease, spreading more widely, erupted with great force and invaded and shook almost all the members of our church.</p>
      <p>After our special and last synod, the situation has deteriorated day by day.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while Megander and Rhellicanus were with you in the homeland, Eberhard von Rümlang copied Megander's catechism, contaminated by Capito and Bucer, which we wanted to say was corrected, and presented the copy to two of our Bucerian pastors. They (although they denied it diligently) nevertheless, as the outcome showed, worked to have the catechism both expanded and corrected and printed. For not long after, by decree of the lesser council, we were ordered to work on publishing the book. When it was agreed among us that the booklet with the appendix, which Megander had promised to the council and people of Bern, should be restored (so that the Pauline phrase in the supper would be added: "Is not the bread that we break" [1 Cor 10:16] etc.), those good men were not content with this, but indeed wanted the entire rhapsody of Bucer to be published. Nor do they cease to urge this against the council's decision with their tricks and machinations. Not to mention in the meantime that many are in this, who also think it worthwhile to publish Bucer's "Retractations" made in German for Tremp's favor. If either of these were done, what, we ask, would the foreign churches say about us, other than that we have recanted, subscribed to Luther and Bucer, his cardinal at his side?</p>
      <p>You have the force of the disease raging in our ecclesiastical body. It is now your task to apply the most immediate remedy you can, and that as soon as possible. But you will say: "In what way do you think such a plague can be repelled by you?" This would seem most convenient to us (unless you find a better one), that Mr. Bullinger and Theodor write to our council, having learned that not only they themselves but the sacramental truth taught by all of us so far has been gravely accused, and therefore they request that they be allowed to clear themselves in the same way before the church and the republic's leaders as was given to Bucer. Whose business cannot but be most suspect to all of you because he does many things besides, indeed against the decrees of the Basel convention. Furthermore, it would seem worthwhile to us that your council write to ours on the same matter, so that nothing is decided in the cause of the Eucharist without the consent of the other churches in Switzerland, as it is provided in the edict of the aforementioned convention and the instrument given in testimony of this matter.</p>
      <p>If the feverish church is helped in time with these or similar remedies, it will recover; if not, it will die while living. For it is very close to Buceran death. Nor is there any reason to object that this sending of letters and your coming would cause some new disturbance. For there are still quite a few good men both in the council and among the people who have not yet been seized by the Buceran fever and wish to see the truth defended. You would encourage their spirits either by your writings or your presence, so that they would be less infected by the contagious. Nor do we fear any disturbance arising from this at all. For what harm could arise from your just and fair report to the council? And even if the pestilents were to plot something pestilent, which we hope they will not, would you act more negligently and timidly in the matter of truth than those who have conducted a false matter with deceit and tricks? They left nothing untried from the penultimate synod (in which they departed disgracefully defeated) and moved every stone (as it is said) to restore their collapsed matter in some way. For they spared no expenses and labors in sending secret messengers and letters back and forth, indeed they did not even refuse to throw themselves into danger of life, while they committed themselves to a long journey and men alien to the Swiss confederation interfered in the affairs of this republic uninvited except by a few oligarchs. And would you be weary of expenses, labor, and vigils, by which letters are to be sent only ten miles or a journey to be undertaken, and when due to the connection of the confederation little, indeed no risk is to be undergone? Especially if the opportunity to come (which they will not dare to deny) is given.</p>
      <p>Nor is there any reason to fear that you would sin against the decrees of our synod if you mention to our council the mark placed on you by Bucer. For when he came here only to clear himself (as he wanted to appear) and the whole council and people of Bern sat, we do not think anyone is bound by any religious oath, even if some things tending to the ruin of the truth are eliminated. But what Bucer said about both of you, that is Bullinger and Theodor, has been partly written to you by Megander before, and partly Mr. Heinrich Möriker, who recorded the negotiations from memory with remarkable vivacity and singular diligence, can write more fully to those who wish to know.</p>
      <p>Nor is there any reason to think that nothing should be done here until Bucer replies to Bullinger. For he (as he is a notable busybody) is occupied with much more vain, we wanted to say saner, matters than to want or be able to reply to him in time.</p>
      <p>Finally, you would not heal the afflicted and feverish church with this plan of yours if you only wrote to us and we presented your letters to the council. For it is so occupied with matters pertaining specifically to itself that it would not even deign to read writings addressed to others. Not to mention in the meantime that the matter would not be free from suspicion among the Bucerians, as if we wanted to undo the laws fixed by the council.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dearest brothers through Christ, if the salvation of the Swiss churches and the truth in the sacramental matter is of concern to you and you wish to render a worthy account to the chief shepherd Christ Jesus for the flock not only diligently pastored but also guarded from the grave wolves attacking, we ask, pray, beseech, and implore you through the same and through Christian charity to follow our advice in alleviating the church's disease or apply another more suitable remedy found in time. For unless this is done, it will perish from the Lutheran and Buceran plague. With it lost, there is no hope that yours will remain safe and unharmed for long. Just as the plague and the cancerous disease spread more widely with their contagion and infect and destroy everything nearby unless resisted in time, so too does evil and perverse doctrine infect everyone nearby and repeatedly gain strength unless restrained. Therefore, resist the beginnings while you can and have allies; for medicine is prepared too late and too late when the disease has prevailed.</p>
      <p>Regarding sending Wilhelm Zwingli to Strasbourg, we do not agree with the Bucerian-minded Tremp to such an extent that if he himself (who indeed cherishes the flesh of Huldrych Zwingli of most holy memory, but extinguishes his spirit) wants him to be sent away, we certainly think it better for the boy of good hope (as we have learned from Rhellicanus and others) to be educated and instructed for a time in the monastic school of Kappel rather than sent to Strasbourg. The reason is that the boy would imbibe Luther's superstition and papist remnants from a young age at Capito's, which he could never unlearn as an adult. For as Flaccus says no less elegantly than truly, the vessel will long retain the scent with which it was once imbued. You should say this to his mother in our name, but cautiously.</p>
      <p>Farewell, best and most faithful brothers, and put on the winged sandals of Mercury and break all customs, do and accomplish by whatever means you can, to help the church laboring and gravely infected with Buceran poison. For haste and speed are needed, if ever, now most of all. Farewell again, and if you are well, help and heal the sick.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, November 28, 1537.</p>
      <p>Megander, Erasmus, Rhellicanus, and Jacob Maior, deacon, ministers and fellow workers of the Bernese church now gravely ill in the word of the Lord and in teaching good letters, most ready to serve you at your command.</p>
      <p>Mr. Theodor Rhellicanus will return the writings sent to him at the festival of Lutius through a certain man.</p>
      <p>To the ecclesiastics, professors, and deacons of the church of Zurich, our venerable lords and brothers beloved through Christ.</p>
