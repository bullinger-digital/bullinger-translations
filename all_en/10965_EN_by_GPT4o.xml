    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to a reproachful letter from Bullinger: The illegibility of his handwriting can no longer be corrected and is most detrimental to himself. The statements in his letter [No. 913] do not mean that he speculatively misunderstands the limitations of the human nature of Christ; Augustine rightly teaches that nothing is impossible for the Lord, even with regard to his body. Gryn채us only wanted to point out to Theodor [Bibliander] that Bucer teaches nothing different from Vadian, namely that Christ's presence fills the world like sunlight. Admits that he writes too rarely. Will hardly be able to comply with the requests concerning Melchior [Wirz], as [Sebastian] M체nster has already been promised.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Your letter has one tone from beginning to end; it does nothing but speak openly, accusing the writing, my writings, and finally me as the writer. This is not writing unsuccessfully, when writing a long letter to a friend and hoping you can hit every point, yet you cannot achieve even one with the whole letter? What do you want; that I promise you to be better, more correct, more successful in the future? I cannot. The rod of this poorly taught and poorly accustomed writing finger no longer cares. I often accuse those who deceive no one more often than myself, who present no one with more troublesome business than myself; but in vain. How can it be changed, what I have practiced more often for so many years than anything else, writing poorly? And indeed, this complaint of mine is not necessary or just, unless it restrains yours. As it does not often happen that you read my writings, so it is not necessary. You may discard them; it is a just excuse: it cannot be read. Unless I can turn to good what my fingers have constantly produced as bad, you see almost all the fruit of my thoughts and studies perishing. Therefore, if you wish to rightly perform your duty, you will pity what cannot be changed rather than accuse it. About the writing only.</p>
      <p>About the written content, I have nothing to say. I do not have a copy. I certainly do not remember what I wrote about the miraculous power of the body of Christ filled with God. However, your letter seems to fear for me, lest I too stray from the path and, as a man poorly guided in contemplating the infinite presence of God, lose the certain and finite nature of Christ. For why should not those who undertake this be called the worst idle and lazy men? But I will tell you briefly: There is nothing for you to be concerned about here. I will use my metaphysics for another purpose. I only observe this and see it accepted by the dearest authors: that we should not remove entirely from the body of Christ what is against or above the nature of the body. You know the place in Augustine's 24th chapter of "De agone christiano." I do not bring this up in defense of his cause, which I have always opposed with common forces with you, but so that we are not rashly frightened by their false supports or, out of zeal for the cause, despise the truth. Even Saint Augustine admits that the Lord could do anything with his body. You know the place, you recognize the author. What? Will we dare to deny this? I do not think so. What then; unless we meet this, unless we repel the enemy from this corner of our walls, will he break in directly? Not at all. We conceded long ago under the first encounters that the Lord can do all things. But the contention is in what he wills and what the scripture teaches he wills. Therefore, however true this may be said, it is said with no support for their cause or detriment to ours.</p>
      <p>I wanted, therefore, that you show Theodor that last place from Vadian's booklet, introducing the body of Christ emitting rays of divinity into the whole world like the sun. If he cannot bear anything in Bucer, let him bear it more easily in a fellow citizen. For both say the same: that Christ, indeed the body of Christ full of the light of divinity, spreads its power like the sun. I would give no other explanation than that from a finite body on both sides, from here indeed a finite, from there an infinite power goes forth, this one powerfully and infinitely filling all these things, that one not all, but the whole sensible world. About my writing and indeed to your letter thus far.</p>
      <p>Should I say anything about the writer, in whom you desire duty? For I alone do not write, having dared to encourage others to write. And indeed, let it be, it has its reasons. For I offer myself entirely to you, my certain friend and most upright man, to be reproved, corrected, to do everything. Do, dearest brother, so that Satan does not divide us. You will therefore strive before the Lord, that in the true simplicity of our hearts we may always grow together more and more before the Lord.</p>
      <p>About Melchior, I fear that I may not be able to respond to your requests. A condition has long been promised to our M체nster with a very modest stipend for serving with us. But I will see.</p>
      <p>Farewell now in the Lord. Greet all the brothers diligently, especially our Theodor.</p>
      <p>Gryn채us.</p>
