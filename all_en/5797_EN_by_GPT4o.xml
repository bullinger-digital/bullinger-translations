      <p>Greetings. I received your letter written on June 12th, most illustrious man, on the 23rd, to which I would like to respond more fully, but I am unable due to the sudden departure of the messenger.</p>
      <p>For at this very hour, Mr. Calvin, out of his singular kindness and great goodwill towards me, indicates that if I wish to write anything to you, someone will leave in two hours to deliver my letters: and because he is distracted by other matters, he will write to you shortly and call me to take notes.</p>
      <p>While I wait for him to summon me, these few words to you briefly: I write nothing about his health, as I have no doubt that he will inform you in his usual manner.</p>
      <p>I had learned from Mr. Calvin, to whom you had written, that Trecius had left on May 6th, but I received no letters from him at all: which is not as bothersome to me as the fear that he may have received the packet of letters I sent him before the beginning of May.</p>
      <p>I had addressed it to you, because at that time Mr. Calvin was also writing and sending to you a copy of the exposition he had added to his Admonition to the Poles.</p>
      <p>I was also sending to Trecius 15 or more copies to give to Mr. Gwalther, Wolf, Lavater, and other friends. But I never received any response, so now I believe that packet was intercepted [...] I confess that this is very serious and bothersome to me not only because of the copies I mentioned, and which I had arranged to be printed, lest that explanation be lost: but because letters from Mr. Calvin to Sarnicius and Jacob were attached.</p>
      <p>Sylvius, the Polish pastors, to whom he was responding.</p>
      <p>If you have not yet seen that exposition, I am sending one copy, so that I may understand from you whether you received the packet, in which it was included along with Mr. Calvin's letters to you: I am returning the copy of the letters to Trecius, which I immediately returned to Mr. Calvin as you wished. Hastily in Geneva, July 2, 1563.</p>
      <p>Charles de Jonvilliers, your most observant.</p>
