    <p xml:id="regest1">Would gladly consider the printer [Thomas] Platter recommended by Myconius, but is too overwhelmed with other business. He dislikes the ambiguous expressions of Erasmus; however, action against the printing of the ["Ecclesiastes"] should only be taken if this work contains further objectionable passages.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Everything would be reported by me, venerable Myconius, who is commended to me by your letters, if only there were something to report that would bring joy. But the business by which I am almost constantly occupied does not allow me to serve Platter or any other good man. I present to Froschauer papers more smeared than written in my spare hours, even compelled by the relentless prayers of the brothers and driven into this mill. However, I will remember your request, if any opportunity arises to serve this man. For he seems to be a truly good man and worthy of receiving a benefit.</p>
      <p>I embrace and venerate Erasmus for his venerable old age and the many benefits he has bestowed upon literature and the learned, yet I abhor the man's detestable slipperiness. This man knows how to sit on two stools and carry on both shoulders. The words you ascribe are almost from Chrysostom's work "On the Priesthood," and I do not doubt that he understands his own words through hyperbole and amplification. But what does this matter to the common people, whose nature is rarely to be wise, and into whose impure hands these things come? I would bear this and ignore it if this were the only stumbling block in the whole work. But if he has also placed scandals in the rest, I would by no means ignore it. The world is to be explained, not entangled with our writings. We must speak clearly, purely, and simply. What Oporinus or Blatter or Bebelius has seen or heard, they will report. I could not do more at present.</p>
      <p>I wish you to remain safe for us and the church for a long time, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>On the feast of Peter and Paul, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the holy church of Basel, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
