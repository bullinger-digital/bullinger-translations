    <p xml:id="regest1">Cannot write in detail about the sad state of the [Geneva] church, but the letter carriers have at least received an impression of it and can report on it; he would prefer to discuss it with him in person. Without the restoration of the apostolic order, the church will not endure, but neither the church ban nor the division of the city into parishes could be enforced so far, and the people see the pastors more as preachers than as shepherds; if there were unity among the churches, a synod could seek common solutions. Pellikan and Grynaeus have mentioned that a response from Luther has arrived, but [the Bernese] have not disclosed anything about it; therefore, he asks for further clarification. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>Most upright and learned brother. If I were to pursue a just narration of our most miserable condition with you, I would have to weave a long story. I refer to our condition which has troubled the church, which the Lord has willed us to lead, for some time now and still oppresses it in large part. But because there is not enough leisure at present to explain each detail, and these good men can recount some things on their own, I will not trouble you with a longer letter. For although they may not have noticed the very source of the evil, nor to what end the efforts of the wicked were tending, they have nevertheless clearly perceived the state of affairs as it was. Would that a single day might be given to us for free discussion. For then, as I hope, we would not part without great benefit.</p>
      <p>I certainly have matters which I see cannot now be safely included in letters, nor can they be dealt with by us unless they are maturely weighed and discussed back and forth. I will, however, indicate in passing that it seems to me that we will not have a lasting church unless that ancient, that is, apostolic discipline, which is lacking in many parts among us, is restored in full. We have not yet been able to extort that the pure and holy observance of excommunication be restored. That the city, which is populous in proportion to its size, be divided into parishes. For as this confused administration bears, the common people recognize us more as preachers than as shepherds. There are very many other things which, although we greatly desire them to be corrected, we can devise no plan unless it is pursued with common faith, zeal, and industry. Oh, if only pure and sincere concord could finally be established among us.</p>
      <p>For what would then prevent a public synod from being convened, where each could propose what would be most beneficial for their churches, the method of achieving it could be considered by common deliberation, and, if necessary, cities and princes could also assist each other with mutual exhortation and confirm it with authority? But in such perplexity, the Lord must be asked to clear the way. Pellikan has informed us that a very kind and friendly response from Luther has reached you: Grynaeus testifies that he has much hope of obtaining peace on the other side. But we have not yet been able to ascertain what it is like. The church, which could most conveniently communicate everything with us due to its proximity, has never deemed us worthy of even a small note. If any opportunity presents itself, you will not hesitate to at least explain the main points to us. Farellus greets you. You will greet in my name the brothers to be honored in the Lord, your colleagues, Pellikan, Leo, Bibliander, and also Phrysius. May the Lord keep you all safe in the propagation of His kingdom.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 21 February 1538.</p>
      <p>Calvin, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To H. Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, brother and fellow minister to be respected by me. In Zurich.</p>
