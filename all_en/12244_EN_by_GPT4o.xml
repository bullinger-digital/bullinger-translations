    <p xml:id="regest1">What the intercession of the Helvetic cities [Basel, Bern, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, and Zurich] on behalf of the Waldensians with the cruel king [Francis I] [written on May 30, 1545] has achieved, Vadian can learn from his response [dated June 27]. [Francis I] did not tolerate the intercession, even though it was modestly formulated and the writer [Werner Beyel] put a lot of effort into its composition. This is evidenced by the enclosed copy. However, the powerful remain untouchable. [Beyel] reproaches himself, but there is no reason for it. [God], whom this corpse [Francis I] persecutes, lives in heaven! - How fortunate the Helvetians should consider themselves in light of their freedom! If only they could learn from this event to come closer together and beware of the princes! - Vadian should pray for those afflicted. - There is nothing new from Worms. The threatening [Charles V] rises against the Lord and his anointed. - Greetings from the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab] and the city clerk [Beyel].</p>

      <p>Greetings. You will understand what the pious intercession of the Helvetic cities has achieved with the most cruel King of France from his letters to the Christian cities. He is indignant about the letter, although nothing could be more modest. Our scribe used the best skill and fidelity, which you will attest to when you read the copy. However, when the mountains are touched, they smoke. The intemperance of the king's scribe pains the good man. He fears that he may have neglected something; but he is rightly at peace, having acted here diligently, prudently, and faithfully. The king's spirit is otherwise truculent and knows not how to be appeased. But He lives in the heavens, whom that rotten and cadaverous king persecutes. O happy Switzerland, if only it valued its happiness and freedom as much as it is worth! This single example of the king should teach us to bind ourselves more closely to God and to beware of the princes as if from a public plague. Nevertheless, I commend the cause of the afflicted to your prayers and those of your people. May the Lord Jesus comfort them and preserve them in His eternal kingdom. We have nothing memorable from Worms. The Emperor breathes threats and slaughter against God and His Christ. Farewell in Christ and write back. Both consuls and the city scribe also greet you. Zurich, July 15, 1545. - Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Joachim Vadian, most worthy consul of St. Gallen, always to be honored by his lord.</p>
