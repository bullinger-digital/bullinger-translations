      <p>Greetings. I received, most honorable godfather, your letter along with three books that are extremely useful and necessary, of which I have kept one for myself and faithfully distributed the other two as you instructed. We all express our greatest thanks to you and pray to God that He may always be present with you through His spirit, so that you may accomplish even more works that contribute to the benefit of His most holy church. I recently wrote something about the turmoil of the Rhaetians, but I do not know whether that letter reached your hands. It is a miserable and lamentable situation everywhere among the nations.</p>
      <p>May God finally arrange everything for the glory of His most holy name.</p>
      <p>All good people send their greetings to you, especially Jacob Franck and Johannes Jacob RÃ¼ger, as well as my wife and the entire household.</p>
      <p>In haste, from Glarus, March 12, 1573.</p>
      <p>Johannes Hug, your godfather, from Glarus. To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich, my honorable and exceptionally dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
