      <p>S. D. Christ, the only savior, may this year be the happiest for you and yours. I thank you for your writings; I am returning the sheet as you ordered.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Legate and wish him a very happy year.</p>
      <p>I heard a while ago that there were serious disputes between the cardinals of Mantua and Tournon. So I hear well: the third man with the bag has come in between and is taking the bride home. The devil tore the bag and the chair; that is my wish.</p>
      <p>His deceased brother, the Margrave of Meissen, left him a large sum of money, through which he was now able to buy the seat of pestilence.</p>
      <p>But since many envy him, he will soon be taken by poison. But in the name of all devils: they are not worth anything better. - The controversy of Chur is still stuck like this: the legates of the 5 Cantons responded that they had received no instructions, but they want to report what they have proposed to their home and ensure, if possible, that a response will be given at the next assembly to be held in Baden on February 4th. The remaining Cantons have seriously ordered that nothing be attempted in the meantime by force or armed hand.</p>
      <p>So it is still in art: The Lord must be prayed to diligently, that he may break the bloody and impious plans of the wicked. The Venetians may perhaps seek an alliance; for I hear that they fear Philip and the Savoyard. Regarding your letters, so that they may never bring you danger, I order you to be secure; if you ever want any to be destroyed, sign at the end: "Crema." Whoever reads it will think the letter was written from Cremona, etc. But as I just said, I do not want you to be worried.</p>
      <p>The good, pious bailiff Weiss has also died among us these days.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>I hurried.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 5, 1560.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you and yours and wish you a good year.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church of Chur, his dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
