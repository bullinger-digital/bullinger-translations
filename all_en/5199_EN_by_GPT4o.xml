      <p>Greetings. Briefly receive the state of our churches.</p>
      <p>After various disturbances, an edict was finally written, granting us the power to preach the word and administer the sacraments in the suburbs. The edict was written in rather harsh terms, and some conditions were added that were not very fair. Thus, the adversaries hoped that we would never acquiesce and would provide a just occasion for civil war. However, we were content with the present and hoped for the rest from the Lord, so we acquiesced.</p>
      <p>From here, they began to rage openly and to delay all matters so that the edict would not be published.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it was obtained in all parliaments except for two, namely the Dijon and Paris parliaments. Thus, there is no kind of injury that this church has not experienced in one month, although by God's grace the enemies have been so repressed at times that their evil plans have fallen back on their own heads. Another colloquium was also instituted, in which about thirteen Sorbonne members debated with three ministers, namely Marlorat, Perucellius, and Beza, in the presence of the entire royal council. The first contest was about images for six whole days.</p>
      <p>You would not believe how inept they showed themselves. Five from the other side, namely Bishop Valentin, Spensa, Botellerius, Salignacus, Pecherellus, all excellently learned, strongly and freely opposed all worship of images with us. However, they persisted and decided that everything should be referred to the council.</p>
      <p>The debate on the rite of baptism was to follow, as the order of the established conference required, but everything was soon dissolved by the intercession and prayers of the cardinals. Meanwhile, the Paris Senate rages, and all the orders of the city openly conspire against us, although we count not a few from every class of citizens in the church, openly and frankly professing Christ. Finally, the enemies are trying everything to prevent the publication of the edict, which paves the way for us to full freedom. It would take a long volume if I wanted to recount each plan and the infinite examples of divine providence. In short, after Admiral (Amiraldus), yielding to some fury, left the court, the matter was brought to such a point that we were in great danger. But such was the virtue of Condé and some others that within two days we obtained the promulgation of the edict, which we hope will happen tomorrow, despite the greater part of the parliament resisting in vain. Three hundred foot soldiers and forty armored horsemen were added to the garrison, with Mommorant as the prefect of this city, with the most ample power over the seditious.</p>
      <p>But the Guises are expected at court, from which I infer that the tragedy is not yet finished. Whatever the case, we hope in God, and if the rage of the enemies should force us to come to serious blows, I think we will not be much inferior in strength. But may the Lord avert this, who has wonderfully kept the minds of our people in duty until now. I, who, if I could, would wish for nothing more than to be far away from these disturbances, am still here, conquered by the prayers of the brothers, and I try everything to compose our people to patience, not without the greatest dangers meanwhile. To these inconveniences is added poor health, with constant cares and labors so twisting me that I am now entirely growing gray and withering more and more. Therefore, I ask you to remember me in your prayers, if ever before.</p>
      <p>You have a brief summary of the greatest matters.</p>
      <p>For you will be able to learn many particulars from the one who delivers this letter to you, a man both pious and industrious. Now I come to those things which you signified to me through our Calvin, from whom I also received your letters three days ago. Believe me, my father, nothing could be more pleasing, nothing more timely announced to us. Therefore, make sure that our man, who is going there for this one reason, understands all the plans of the illustrious man Dr. Hartmann in this matter, so that something certain can be brought from there as quickly as possible, which can somehow support our wavering leader (autokrator) and, against the constant threats of some treacherous people, prepare a certain victory for us against the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>They will therefore take care of what concerns the Germans. But you, please see again and again that not only your own people but also your neighbors are urged to the same plans, which you understand well enough will be most useful to us and not inconvenient to you either (since the common cause is being discussed). However, what course of action our faithful leaders judge to be most expedient and opportune, and all things pertaining to this business, our man will abundantly explain to you so that it is not at all necessary for me to write these things at length, which you will learn much more fully from him in person. Farewell, my father, may the Lord Jesus keep you safe and confirm you more and more in His work by His Holy Spirit. I ask you to greet Father Martyr, whom I greatly respect, and the other most honorable brothers in my name, and when you have explained the present state of France to them, commend our churches, barely emerging through infinite storms, to the Lord in constant prayers. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Paris, the sixth day before the Nones of March.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>When asked what kind of council the evangelicals (in France) are seeking, they responded: 1. We do not wish to convene anywhere by the pope's summons, but by the command of our prince. 2. We require a place free from all temporal power of the pope and, as far as possible, convenient. 3. We ask for a council to be initiated, not for the continuation of the Tridentine assembly. 4. We demand that all controversies be decided from the word of God. 5. We do not admit the papists as judges, but as opponents, and therefore we ask for a certain number of interlocutors to be appointed on both sides, who, in the presence of the princes' legates, may discuss and, if possible, decide on each controversy. 6. We ask for a suitable safe conduct, in which the constitution on faith not being granted to heretics, as they call it, is expressly annulled, etc. (These were copied from a document attached to Beza's letters).</p>
      <p>Cardinal of Ferrara, the pope's legate in France, requests in the name of the kingdom of France that 12 French bishops be sent to the Council of Trent, who will submit themselves to the Tridentine council. These were inscribed on a document attached to Beza's letters.</p>
