      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. From Konrad Lycosthenes, I received everything you sent back, safe and intact, on September 10th through Westhemer, whom I recently inaugurated as the bishop of Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>The prince is remarkably affected by new rumors; if only he would become better from it and learn repentance from the disaster of those who perished, and shear those subject to him in such great scarcity of all things, not flay them, etc. He demands 3000 florins from this small republic, etc. Changing the kindness he previously showed towards me, he reveals himself alienated with a furrowed brow. He is led, not to say misled, by those who think neither of Christ nor the public good. You, my brother, pray to the Son of God, that His glory may not perish through the greed of the avaricious and that I may be freed at a good hour. It is enough for me. If I am forced to leave, there might be a corner into which I can retreat or, what I most desire, heaven, where there are many mansions. Again, pray for me, that I may not see the evils that seem to be impending upon us. Hastily. Riquewihr, September 19, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and brother in Christ, to be revered.</p>
