      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. You would hardly believe with what joy I received your letters, most distinguished and always to be honored friend and brother, delivered by my venerable and illustrious lady. At the beginning of your letter, you rightly guessed that I had accompanied my lady as far as Speyer. However, due to some unforeseen business that arose, I was compelled to return directly from there. If I had known this beforehand, I would have been a bit more reluctant in accompanying her; for I had hoped to escort her as far as Engen in Hegau, from where it was then planned to visit you, my old and most sincere friend. And because the autumn fair in Frankfurt was approaching, as it is now, I intended to go to Frankfurt with your booksellers and then return to Cologne. For having recommended me so highly to the same lady, though I am undeserving, I owe you eternal thanks; for she provided the letters sent to her to be read and thus communicated how letters can be safely transferred to you from here. I therefore ask that you fulfill your promise by writing to me more frequently; I, in turn, will diligently try to do the same. Also, so that I may have something of your work to delight in (since your presence is denied), for who will forbid having it secretly? For I still have some of your little works that were once sent to me as a gift, and I will venerate them as long as I live. Among them, what you wrote on the Acts of the Apostles, after they were beautifully bound, were stolen, which still pains me today. Believe me, dearest brother, your name is not entirely unknown among our people; for some of the students and more learned individuals are wonderfully delighted with your works, even though some theologasters (petty theologians) anxiously resist, whom you have as enemies here no less than among your own people, the Anabaptists. I, too, a man of little esteem, have long ago thrown myself into considerable danger during the time of the recently deceased most reverend Archbishop of Cologne, because I acted here as a public notary for the Protestants against the chapter and clergy of Cologne, fearlessly executing the publication of mandates, appeals, etc., obtained at the instance of the Protestants against the chapter members, and openly posting them on doors, thus incurring the indignation of many. But with God's protection, I have so far escaped unharmed from the malevolent, although they threaten many evils and harms, because even in my absence, my illustrious lady and in the meantime they have tried in vain to disturb. What they have plotted against the lady herself, I do not doubt that it is clear to you.</p>
      <p>That you have so highly praised my lord or uncle Lysius to the illustrious lady, it is amazing how much you have pleased him; for my lady related this to him in the presence of many during a meal. He is still alive and well. If you have the time, I would like you to greet him familiarly in your writings, even lightly, etc. For without a doubt, he will boastfully show to many that, not unmindful of the benevolence once shown to you, you have visited him from so far away with your writings. For in my judgment, he is a man worthy of all veneration, even if he is not my blood relative, although he is given to some abuses, yet not as much as before. I was previously disliked by him for two reasons, both because of the wife I took and because I could not agree with his views everywhere.</p>
      <p>As for new matters, there is almost nothing here with us, except that Cologne has some distinguished citizens who wish that studies be cultivated with piety and due honors, who for this reason have voluntarily surrendered themselves to prisons, although otherwise, by the right of our citizens, they could have safely left the city; I have attached the work of one of them, which stirred up this trouble for him, to these writings. If you wish to be further informed briefly about my affairs, I have not yet shaken off that old yoke of mine at the Ursuline school, living content with my lot as it is given, until the best of all blesses me with eternal rest. Seven years ago, at the urging of my lady, I took a second wife, who, with the Lord's blessing, has given me three sons and two daughters; the daughters are still alive with one of the sons now in his fifth year. Lysius lifted him from the sacred font, and his name is Theoderich. From my first marriage, I still have one daughter, with four sons having died in the Lord in their tender age. The same daughter married a very wealthy man against the wishes of her friends and to her own detriment; for he is not only a fornicator and gambler but also an exceptional glutton and squanderer of his goods. In a few years, he has uselessly consumed more than a thousand ducats; we pray to the Lord for a sounder mind for him. My illustrious lady, whom I always embrace and honor for the benefits bestowed upon me, ordered me to wish you peace and all good in her name, marvelously praising your humanity and benevolence shown to her. If your brother, Mr. Johannes, is still alive, you should wish him well on my behalf; likewise, Rodolphus Gwalther, who greeted me through you; who he is here, I have forgotten, unless he is the one whom you once entrusted to be imbued with the rudiments of grammar when departing. With these few words, you will fare well in Christ. Written in Cologne on the last day of August in the year of our salvation 1555.</p>
      <p>Your supporter, Theodorich Bitter von Wipperford, head of the Ursuline school.</p>
      <p>To the best and most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful ecclesiastic among the Zurichers and my most integral friend.</p>
