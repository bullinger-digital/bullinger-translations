      <p>S. D. I thought I would keep this book, as I mentioned in my last letter to you, most esteemed sir, until your arrival. But behold, your cousin of the same name as you, and therefore also dearer to me, came to us, bringing with him Hector, your brother, along with letters from your venerable old father, requesting that I take Hector back into my discipline and care, etc. I have accepted him; for I could not refuse anything to the excellent old man; and I also believed that I would be doing you a favor, who from the beginning thrust this upon me even if unwillingly.</p>
      <p>Yet I have gladly accepted him, because I wish to serve esteemed friends. Meanwhile, while yours were absent, boys were offered, and I could have accepted the only son of the illustrious man, Mr. Matthaeus Coignetius, without any inconvenience to myself.</p>
      <p>For he brought him to Zürich itself and placed him with a certain noble relative of mine; but I reserved the place for yours, although in the meantime, if I had known that yours would never come, I could have easily accepted others or would still accept them, especially for those reasons which I once explained in person.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have imposed that duty of mine on your cousin to deliver to you, and he gladly accepted this burden upon himself, so that he might at least gratify you in this way. Therefore, receive from me what I offer with a kind and most favorable and loving heart towards you.</p>
      <p>At the end, you will find two sermons on magistracy and oath-taking, which do not seem useless to you. May the Lord keep you safe for a long time.</p>
      <p>May our Johannes Traversus von Salis be safe; may your wife be safe; may your whole household be safe.</p>
      <p>I hope you have received those letters of mine, which I mentioned at the beginning of this letter; I sent them to Chur 4 days ago to Mr. Johannes Fabritius.</p>
      <p>Farewell and write back sometime, whether mine have been faithfully delivered to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zürich, November 15, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, designated praetor of the county of Valtellina, residing in Samaden, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Samaden.</p>
      <p>I have made some notes about Mr. Traversus and your books.</p>
      <p>From this, you will understand what work is being printed here by Mr. Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>It is a work of over 230 pages on the cause of the Eucharist against the Bishop of Winchester, a learned man who wrote against us in favor of transubstantiation. This will be a proper work, which will deal with and publish everything from Scripture and the Fathers on this cause. Farewell again.</p>
