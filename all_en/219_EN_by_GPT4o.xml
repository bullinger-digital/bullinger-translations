      <p>My friendly greetings along with all that I can offer in honor, love, and goodness, first of all. Venerable, highly learned, especially honorable, gracious, dear sir, I have received your letter, thank you most sincerely for your effort and work and am very satisfied to send my nephew to Mr. Walther. However, since I intend to ride home, I will inform my brother-in-law of this and consult with him when we want to send him to Zurich. With this, I commend myself to you, faithfully praying to Almighty God that He may keep you in His divine protection.</p>
      <p>Dated at Baden, August 7, 1548. Your willing servant Hans Wunderlich.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the holy word in Zurich, my especially honorable, dear sir.</p>
