    <p xml:id="regest1">Shares news sent by Grynaeus: An English delegation has visited Emperor [Charles V.]; he is persecuting the Lutherans in the Netherlands; the peace agreement between Venice and [Sultan Suleiman I.] aligns with the latter's wishes; in [Calenberg-Göttingen], the evangelical preaching is permitted; the Protestants will hold a meeting due to the support of Goslar. From a letter to the mayor: Captured arsonists accuse Duke Henry of Brunswick; it is said that the Emperor wants to relinquish Milan to more easily wage war against the Protestants; the opponents are unsettled because Grynaeus [in Worms] appears together with the Lutherans. In the new heretic mandate, the Emperor rages against the Protestants, even though he has scheduled a Reichstag; Vadian is listed among the heretics because of his "Epitome." Myconius barely comes to writing and asks for leniency regarding the handwriting of Christoph [Rotacher]; knows nothing of Konrad [...]; now is the opportunity to close the women's house. Greetings. Rumors from Tübingen about a coup in England, a Polish campaign to support [John Sigismund Zápolya], and a postponement of the Reichstag.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Grynaeus has added this news: The King of England has a delegation with the Emperor; it is believed that they are about to form an alliance. The Emperor condemns the Lutheran heresy in Lower Germany as he does in Spain. To overlook the image and not expose the head of the heresy is a capital offense. The clothes of those he burned are hung in the temples as a warning. The peace agreement of the Venetians with the Turk is as the Turk initially demanded. The guardians of the children of Duke Erich, who died in Hagenau, allow the gospel to be preached in their duchy, although Heinrich, Duke of Brunswick, has ordered against it; for he is also one of the guardians (of which there are four). The Protestants have a day set because of Goslar, which is excommunicated by the Emperor.</p>
      <p>Somewhat later in the consul's letters: 14 arsonists detained in Magdeburg confessed under torture that Heinrich of Brunswick was the instigator of the fires and had given them money. The same was confessed by the one who set fire to Embeck, who also perished. There is a rumor that the Emperor will give Milan to the French to wage war against us more easily. It is unbelievable that the adversaries of the Swiss cantons would agree with the Lutherans; therefore, they are surprised that Grynaeus is joined with them. The first attempt of the adversaries is to sow discord among us.</p>
      <p>A few days ago: The Emperor's mandate was sent by some good people to our leaders. Here he reveals himself. In short: No Herod, no Pilate ever raged against Christ as he does. The titles against us are sectarians, fanatics, heretics. It is strange why he defines it this way while convening a Reichstag. Vadian is a heretic because of the "Epitome topographic[al]" etc.</p>
      <p>There was hardly any time to write this. Consider Christoph's handwriting favorably. We know nothing about Konrad. You now have the opportunity to abolish the brothel; do what is fitting for you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours, Theodor, Pellican happily. Basel, December 20, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>From Tübingen: They say the Englishman has been captured and his infant son made king. Also, the Pole is setting out with 50,000 to Hungary for the sake of the infant nephew, etc. The Reichstag has been postponed for 3 weeks because of the Worms assembly.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
