      <p>Greetings. If there is anything in the letters, which we recently received in Strasbourg and are sending to you, most holy Bullinger, from which I might understand what is happening in England and what hope there is for the future of the kingdom, I ask you to inform me of it. For I have received nothing from my son, except that he writes he has sent a letter from England to me, which has not yet been delivered. If it is possible for you to write back to me at your leisure, you can arrange for it to be delivered to the hands of Hieronymus Hurus or Peter Kunz, my relatives, in Constance through others or through our Mangold.</p>
      <p>Do not disdain to inform the magnificent Peter Martyr that I am more prepared to demonstrate my desire for the peace of the churches through his letters, and that he may regard me as one of the lovers of the Christian name. Farewell in Christ, and continue to love me in the same, as you do.</p>
      <p>My relative Peter Scherer and my cousin Jacob Zwick greet you. In Stein am Rhein, January 20, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Thomas Blarer.</p>
