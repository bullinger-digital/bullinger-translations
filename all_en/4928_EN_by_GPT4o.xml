      <p>Greetings. The evangelist from Lugano came to us, who saw the legates of the pope, who are on their way. Inform our consul of this, so that he may hurry home.</p>
      <p>Read the letters from Hercules von Salis and send them back. Pagici tries everything. What prevents us from being equally strong in the cause of Christ, even if we seem to have crossed the bounds of modesty? But come, discuss with Mr. Consul Tscharner whether it is useful and advisable to write to your people.</p>
      <p>This is very sudden; the evangelist did not want to wait. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Cur.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>Also inform Mr. Coignet of the arrival of the legates. Return the letters of Mr. Hercules.</p>
      <p>Truly to the great man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord.</p>
