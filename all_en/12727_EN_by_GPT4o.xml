    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Kröttlin recently prepared a letter of recommendation [No. 2628] for the two individuals from Ravensburg [Johannes Willing and Sebastian Nabholz], who had been in the Waldsee Monastery, at their request, addressed to Bullinger. He is thankful to God that his request was heard by Bullinger and is willing to reciprocate the kindness shown.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The bearer of the present letter is also a native of Ravensburg and wasted his youth in the local [Carmelite] monastery. Recently, he became involved in a physical altercation (Kröttlin does not know the details because he was not at home at the time). The city council expelled him from the monastery, advising him to seek his livelihood elsewhere for a while. As he now wishes to study and preach the Gospel, he also asked Kröttlin for a letter of recommendation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger is kindly requested to consider this request and to assess whether it serves the interest of proclaiming the Word of God and the Church of Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] God will reward Bullinger for this, and Kröttlin, who commends himself to Bullinger's prayers, also wishes to express his gratitude to him.</p>

      <p>Worthy, highly learned, your reverence, my obedient and willing service in Christ Jesus, our only salvation and comfort. Amen. Reverend lord and brother in Christ Jesus, recently I wrote to your reverence on behalf of two individuals from Ravensburg, who were born here and have been in the monastery at Waldsee for some time, at their request, and I find that my recommendation has brought and yielded not a little fruit with your reverence (to the gracious God be great glory, praise, honor, and thanks!). For this, I am most grateful to your reverence, offering myself willingly, should I be able to repay this to God the Lord and your reverence in due time.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, dear lord, the bearer of this letter is also a native of Ravensburg. He has spent some time in a monastery here, wasted his youth there, and recently committed an excess and transgression, the details of which I do not know (as I was not at home at the time). Therefore, he was expelled from the monastery by my lords, a council, and was told to sustain himself elsewhere for a while. He has likewise appealed to me for a recommendation to your reverence, as he indicates his intention is solely to study the word of God and subsequently to dispense it to the church. Therefore, I could not refuse him this recommendation to your reverence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Thus, my entire humble request to your reverence is to consider and examine this person and action, and whatever may be recognized herein to promote the word of God and the welfare of the Church of Christ, that alone should be furthered for the glory of Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The almighty, gracious God will reward your reverence highly and richly for this, and I have willingly offered myself to your reverence as a fellow brother in Christ, commending myself to your reverence's Christian prayers to the gracious God in Christian duty. Dated the 16th of November in the year 1546. Your reverence's brother in Christ and willing servant, Gabriel Kröttlin, city scribe of Ravensburg.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, highly learned lord, Mr. Huldrych Bullinger, ecclesiastic of the city of Zurich, my gracious, dear lord and brother in Christ.</p>
