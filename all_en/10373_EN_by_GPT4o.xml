    <p xml:id="regest1">No new news; soon he can report reliably about King Francis I of France. Sundgauers and Breisachers against Duke Ulrich of Württemberg. Myconius is well aware of the godlessness of King Francis I, namely that he hardly cares about the shedding of human blood as long as he can satisfy his desires. It is necessary to work towards the restoration of the Secret Council in Zurich, although the prospects for success are currently low. The resolutions of the last Diet were sent to the people of Basel, who did not participate in it; among the fine words, there are mixed in some foolish and arrogant ones, according to which the Five Places wanted to maintain the peace of the land, but also the new alliance with Solothurn, which is a contradiction. Myconius thanks for Bullinger's gift: Commentary on the Epistles of Peter. Indeed, Bullinger's treatment of the question of whether Peter was ever in Rome was criticized by a Basel deacon, and rather the book of Ulricus Velenus, who denies Peter's presence in Rome, was praised. Thanks for Heinrich Utinger's letter.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have no new news, but soon I will have some. Then you will learn something more certain about the king. The people of Sundgau and Breisach have held military drafts these days because of the Duke of Württemberg, not to lead an army against him, but to defend themselves if anyone wanted to trouble them with war. They fear the duke's brother, for he is nearby, and thus they responded to Ferdinand, who was seeking assistance against the duke, should he attempt anything.</p>
      <p>I have long known of the godlessness of the king, not just now, but since I realized how little he cares for human bloodshed, as long as his own desires are satisfied. What is it, then, that he distributes so much money to worthless men, if not ambition stemming from impiety? Let us leave this for now.</p>
      <p>We must work towards the restoration of the Secret Council, unless your people have fallen into such misery here that all hope of restoration is cut off. I have spoken with some of our people. They responded that, with encouragement, it might eventually be achieved, which you cannot hope for now. You know better what Chiburgensis, whom you know, could do here. The peasants will not come of their own accord, but if persuaded. You know what they would do, especially after they learn how this matter is contrary to the impious and to Molossus, as our Utinger calls him. See to it with good men that nothing is omitted here and that everything is done in time, as you see necessary.</p>
      <p>Besides this, the resolutions of the recent Diet were sent to our people. For they were not present. They are being courted with flattery, asked to come to the next one for certain reasons. Meanwhile, such foolish and reckless things are mixed in, if not rather arrogant, that I cannot sufficiently marvel, namely that the Five Places want to maintain the treaties, the peace recently made, and the new law agreed with the people of Solothurn. If they intend to keep this last one, how will they maintain peace, since this very agreement is against our faith? How will they maintain peace, since this prohibits new treaties, new, so to speak, cities? If it is foolishness or recklessness, it is beyond measure; if it is arrogance, I do not doubt that God will someday use His hand mightily against such great arrogance. They write this after they have placed the cause of the people of Solothurn among the articles. In short: I see that unless this way, by which they bind us more and more every day, is broken, it will soon be over with safety.</p>
      <p>I thank you furthermore for your gift as much as I can. If only it were granted that I might someday repay what you have so generously bestowed so far! I will add one thing: One of my deacons was offended that you trust writers more than the most certain arguments, which were once produced from the Pauline letters by someone unknown about Peter's conversation, in which it is denied that he was in Rome. Indeed, I have not yet seen it, nor is the argument such that it seems much effort should be placed there. But he who was offended knows the author of the book, a man certainly, as he himself says, great, and therefore does not want anything to be produced in opposition. For without the offense of many, he does not think that this has come out. This in passing.</p>
      <p>May you always fare well for the benefit of the Christian republic. I thank Utinger for the letter to me. I will reply when I have found the time.</p>
      <p>Basel, the day after Judica Sunday, in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most sincere friend and brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
