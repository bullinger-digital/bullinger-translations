    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the news [No. 1497?] about the opening of the Imperial Diet and the articles presented by the Emperor; expects something from Strasbourg today and encloses what he recently received from [Jakob] Bedrot. Regrets that [Hans] Vogler the Younger must be dismissed under such unpleasant circumstances. Greetings. The person recommended by Bullinger impressed him; Zurich is blessed with outstanding patricians. Sends the letter back and expects to learn the response [of the Protestants] soon.</p>

      <p>Your news is the latest; for we had not yet heard that the Imperial Diet had begun and that these articles had been proposed by the Emperor. Therefore, this matter is very welcome. I expect something from Strasbourg today; if there is anything, you will know. I am sending here what Bedrot recently [sent]. But I believe you already know everything.</p>
      <p>We will send Vogler's son. It greatly pains me that it happened in such a way that he could not be dismissed with better grace; for I wish, if it is possible, to have deserved well of you.</p>
      <p>I am glad you are well. Greet all friends. Farewell. April 23.</p>
      <p>Your S. Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>The honesty of the person you recommended to me pleased me greatly. The Lord loves you; may He preserve this order and the excellence of the most noble people for a long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>I am sending your letters back to you here; we will know the response shortly, I hope.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend.</p>
