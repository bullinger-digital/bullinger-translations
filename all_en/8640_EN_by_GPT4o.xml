      <p>If my health were intact, I would gladly write much to you, most illustrious man, but I hardly dare to greet you through letters, which I would not dare to do unless your kindness had been known to me for many years. For I have not ceased to remember the benevolence with which you received me when I was sent to the Swiss by the Archbishop of Cologne (in whose faith I then was) to learn the doctrine and practice of true religion. Afterwards, we also visited each other several times through mutual letters; but God has now so afflicted me that I can do nothing at all, and it was therefore pleasing to me that the bearer of this letter, Friedrich Konrad, informed me of his journey to you, eager otherwise to greet you before I depart from here. For from him, you will be able to learn exactly what the state of my health is, certainly such that I expect nothing but the grave. Therefore, it must be said with him: I learn and compose what I can soon express. What is also the state, what are the calamities and miseries of this region; you will hear from him, and indeed what this languid and barely half-alive body does not allow me to write. Meanwhile, I give thanks to my God that I will leave you and other good men behind me, who will assist the declining church. I am now retired and dare not hope that I will render any useful service to the church hereafter; but let the will of the Lord be done, into whose will I have wholly resigned myself. Pray to the Lord for me, a wretched sinner, and fare well in God.</p>
      <p>From Emden, August 15, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Albert Hardenberg from the bottom of my heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich in Switzerland, his father and friend, to be especially honored, to his own hands.</p>
      <p>"The letters of D. Albert Hardenberg from Friesland."</p>
