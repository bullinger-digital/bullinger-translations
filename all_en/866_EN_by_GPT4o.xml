      <p>Greetings. I have received both your letters, most esteemed brother and co-father, and the third Decade of your sermons, a welcome and appreciated gift, for which I give you my greatest thanks. This work of yours can be very useful to pious people, provided there are those who use it rightly and consider the matters you write about with a pious and religious heart, as undoubtedly some will do, if not in Germany, where the word of God is met with disdain, then certainly in France, Italy, and England.</p>
      <p>The affairs of our co-father, Mr. Haller, have been settled in such a way that he has nothing to complain about. He does not need my encouragement to endure his labors; for he is already inclined enough to not neglect his duty. I hear nothing about my own affairs, that any attempt has been made. There is utmost silence here; but perhaps there will be a time when my situation will also be considered, which I entrust to the providence of God.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I thank you for having my affairs at heart. I am very surprised about Gervasius, what it is that he is not provided for. Mr. Haller will come to you; I beseech you to act with him. It seems advisable that he comes up to us, as if for the sake of a walk, in case through such an occasion his affairs might be attended to here with us.</p>
      <p>I have read what Mr. Vadianus wrote to you. The times are very dangerous, and the men who ought to be vigilant are exceedingly dull and secure; happy is he who is made cautious by the dangers of others. But it may well be so when God wishes to punish the wickedness of the world. It is our duty to admonish, urge, and pray to the Lord and in the meantime prepare our minds, so that we may act like Daniel in captivity, until liberation comes from the Lord. At my home, everything is quite peaceful by the grace of the Lord, except that my Salome and Sara began to fall ill two days ago; I hope, however, that they will recover soon. Farewell very well, dearest co-father in the Lord.</p>
      <p>My wife and children send their greetings to you and all yours. Greetings to the lords and brothers Mr. Pellican, the excellent old man, Mr. Bibliander, Gwalther, and the others. Bern, 20th of March, 1550.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musc[ulus], your co-father in the Lord. To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, lord and dearest co-father in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
