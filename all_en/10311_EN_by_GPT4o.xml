      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>This slipped my mind in the previous letters: Otto, whom you recommended to us, is a pious and exceedingly diligent young man, so much so that while he thinks he must first acquire some proficiency in the Latin language, he reluctantly listens to sacred teachings, fearing that he might not be using his time optimally. Therefore, you, who share our concern that so few with even tolerable talents dedicate themselves to sacred matters and know how important it is to be a citizen there, I beg you to diligently encourage this young man, but in such a way that he understands you are doing this on your own counsel, to seriously study theology. He listens to sacred lectures prompted by Bedrotus, but in such a way as one who fears he is not making much of a worthwhile effort.</p>
      <p>Satan strives for nothing else as before, than to diminish the esteem of the word of God. He will have achieved this excellently if we dissolve the magistrates from religion. Christ is certainly everything to his own, so that whoever does not promote his kingdom to the best of their ability is indeed released from his religion. He should neither fear nor hope for anything from him. "There is one mediator between God and men" [1 Tim 2, 5]. Therefore, it is necessary for him to live and do everything among those who do well. Only sins are not the works of Christ. The Anabaptists therefore have a more correct view of these matters. For while they want the magistrate to be alien to the care of religion, they make his function entirely impious. For they understood that no office can be held by a Christian that does not primarily serve religion.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with you. Urge this young man, as much as you can, to once decide to become a theologian.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 30th October 1533.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bucer.</p>
      <p>What I, and Bedrotus requests.</p>
      <p>Commend me to all our fellow ministers there by name and especially to the excellent father Pellican, whose holy and truly very useful labors may the Lord grant to be completed as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and pious ecclesiast of Zurich, my esteemed brother.</p>
