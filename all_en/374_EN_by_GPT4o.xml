      <p>Greetings. Your people left in such a way that I was unaware. Shortly after, I learned that Lord Habäum, the consul, was still here and bedridden due to gout; then, feeling more at ease, I visited the sick man and found things that grieve me greatly; for I discovered not only gout but also cheiragra, and one knee was also being tortured. What if it has affected other limbs as well? Indeed, I greatly detest this disease; for it renders people, who could be of great use, almost useless. They are sometimes valuable for their advice; but what is that, unless you can also use your hand? May the Lord restore Habäum so that he can continue to lead and benefit this republic for a long time.</p>
      <p>You know better how the matter, which the cities proposed to discuss, turned out; for what I know, I learned from a scribe who had no more time to narrate than it took to sing one psalm before the sermon. He said they parted in such a way that the greatest friendship existed among them. And so that the Pagans could not accuse them of any dissension, the most suitable reason was found for why each would give separate responses. Here I had to leave, that is, ascend the pulpit. Indeed, I commend the whole matter to the Lord, as well as other things that happen today; for I see that no one can hinder the course of present affairs except God alone.</p>
      <p>We Swiss are divided, which is the first step towards desolation. The Emperor seems to increase the dissension as much as he can, and at least retain it in such a way that he may eventually achieve his desire, which is to tear apart this alliance, famous for so long, and subjugate our land. For what other reason would he gather such a great sum of money in the Netherlands? Our people, of course, assist him excellently; for they favor the most terrible enemy, even if they receive no reward from him, and they favor him mainly out of hatred for Christ.</p>
      <p>For there is no deep reason that they truly pretend. May the Lord open their eyes, if He wills, so that they may see someday; for they are truly blind, as I observe more and more every day. May the Lord Jesus help His own.</p>
      <p>News. A good and trustworthy man reported that in Antwerp, three young men, none of whom exceeded the age of 22, were burned for confessing Christ, and this happened within a month. He confirmed that he heard this from an eyewitness; I could not sufficiently praise their constancy. When two monks were joined to be corrected with them, they were repulsed as if they were Satan; but the holy martyrs entered the pyre with psalms, and when they were already being tied to the stakes, the executioner placed ropes around their necks and tightened the arteries so that they could no longer confess the name of Christ. Once they were dead, the herald began to publicly announce the reason for the punishment, shouting that they were Anabaptists, with this pretext wanting to satisfy the people. In summary: they fear the crowds, which the voice of the herald excellently testifies about their consciences.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the people of Strasbourg must finally respond, urged by the bishop and metropolitan Charles. However, they must first of all clearly state that they wish to accept, approve, and uphold what has been ordained. Then, the moderators say, if anything is more difficult to execute and perform in reality, they wish to apply moderation as much as they can, that is: after they have been suspended, then they want to render whatever they subsequently request more lenient. Thus, the Lord allows the lame to be treated by fools. Farewell in Christ with Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, Otto, and everyone. December 20, 1548.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most excellent and learned minister of Christ, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
