      <p>I can well imagine that Stoffel's (deceased) goods are nothing other than the horses, armor, or weapons and wagons; because his last letter, dated August 31, as you know, states that he has 6 horses, a wagon, and 2 wagon horses that are his, etc. Now I cannot know whether he has a community member like in the previous campaign. If he had one, as one would then do with the abandoned equipment, it would be dangerous. Should one then bring carts and horses here, what great costs would that be? Moreover, the horses, ridden out, starved and not properly cared for, are not worth anything and eat more than they are worth, etc. Yet I think those who receive his abandoned goods will manage everything. It would be the same for me if I had no debts that plagued me, although I am not willing to pay 1 heller more for them; because I feel that everything has been played with him deceitfully, et nulla fides in hominibus (and no trust in men). Must therefore be plagued and tormented until God is satisfied; I am well content with God. When you come, ride to brother-in-law in Embrach, he is also sick. Greet him sincerely for me and come as soon as you can, on Sunday after the sermon.</p>
