    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Yesterday, Blarer received Bullinger's letter [not preserved], which was written before Bullinger received the letter from Blarer handed over to Johannes of Ulm [No. 2644]. [Thomas] Blarer was also very pleased with the meeting with Bullinger [in Zurich] and regretted that he could not stay longer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer is grateful that Bullinger was able to resolve the messenger issue. The one-eyed Zurich messenger [Felix Schubinger] confessed to the Konstanz messenger [...] that he was reprimanded by the Zurich mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab] in the presence of [Thomas] Blarer, asked for forgiveness, and promised improvement.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The fate of the [Schmalkaldic] War must be endured, as it cannot be changed. The prayers [of the Protestants] will probably not be in vain, even though Blarer hardly expects a brilliant victory [of the Schmalkaldic League], because they doubt their own strength too little and are not sufficiently aware of their sins to rely entirely on God. There is also a lack of true zeal in praying and acting, as the Holy Scripture demands. Nevertheless, Blarer hopes that the Lord will not deny [the Protestants] his kingdom, but will strengthen in them the longing for it and the trust in Christ's redemption.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer is horrified by the new cruelties of the kings of France [Francis I] and England [Henry VIII]! Certainly, [Francis I] seeks the favor of the Pope [Paul III] to better alienate him from the Emperor [Charles V]. Meanwhile, he also ingratiates himself with [the Schmalkaldic League] and bribes them with money, as it is in his interest that the Emperor does not become even more powerful. However, this will not bring him luck, especially since he is shedding the blood of Christians. For God catches the cunning in their craftiness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It is written that the Emperor is preparing his retreat over the Danube, but nothing certain is known about it. He is cunning and wriggles like a slippery snake to escape danger. However, his days are also numbered, and his plans against the Lord will remain unsuccessful.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings.</p>

      <p>May the grace of Christ be with you. Yesterday I received your letter, my venerable Bullinger, and at the same time, I have not yet received the one I wrote to you through the young Johannes of Ulm. My brother, in turn, affirms that he saw and heard Bullinger in person with great pleasure. Meanwhile, he was very sorry that he could not enjoy it longer.</p>

      <p>I congratulate you on the successful resolution of the messenger issue and I am very grateful to you for this. Your one-eyed messenger confessed to our messenger that he was sharply reprimanded by your mayors in the presence of my brother and asked for forgiveness, promising improvement.</p>

      <p>We must endure the fate of our war, since we cannot change it. However, we will hope that the pious and fervent prayers of so many children of God will not be in vain, although I hardly dare to promise a splendid victory over this enemy for our side, especially since I do not yet see a true distrust of our own strength nor a worthy consternation for our sins, without which full trust in the Lord can never be placed. Indeed, we do not observe in our people a public and just zeal for praying or acting, as the present danger to the fatherland and religion requires according to the examples of the scriptures, not to mention other things that terrify me no less. Nevertheless, I trust that the Lord will not entirely take away his kingdom from us, but will kindle in us a greater desire for it, since Christ our King and Savior, who came into this world to seek and save what was lost, is not yet so publicly sought and desired above all. May he soon turn us to himself with true repentance and may we be saved!</p>

      <p>I am utterly horrified by the more than tyrannical cruelty of the new monarchs of France and England. What the French king does, I do not doubt, he does for the favor of the Pope, to retain him as an ally and to more easily alienate him from the Emperor, which some already think he is attempting. Meanwhile, he also insinuates himself into our affairs with not insignificant reasons and binds them to himself with a great amount of gold, believing it to be in his interest if the Emperor does not grow further. But this cannot be fortunate for him, as he tries to achieve it with such a great loss of Christian blood. The Lord is the one who catches the wise in their own craftiness; whom we implore fervently for his afflicted church.</p>

      <p>It is written that the Emperor is preparing his retreat over the Danube, but nothing certain can be known. He so marvelously simulates and dissimulates everything and twists himself in many ways like a slippery snake, that he trusts he can escape without great danger to his own. But his day is also set, and no plan will prevail against the Lord. We will entrust all to Him, recognizing Him as our strongest avenger. Under His wings, we will be secure and safest.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell well and perpetually in Him, my dearest and best brother! Greet all the brothers and friends with your household. Ours diligently greet you. Again and again, farewell! Konstanz, October 27, 1546. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable brother. Zurich.</p>
