      <p>Greetings through Jesus the Lord.</p>
      <p>I wrote not long ago to all of you about what some of our countrymen, who are carnivorous, seemed to be plotting for a long time, and for that reason, I earnestly asked you to ensure that they would not be able to accomplish what would eventually bring great harm to the Church of Christ. Therefore, I felt that my letters were not entirely in vain, since our Bernese senate has now taken action against some of the proponents of this wicked and perverse doctrine, and this, as I am convinced, was done more wisely and eagerly because of your advice. However, since this hydra has not been struck at the head, you will do a great service if you once again admonish, with your letters, those whom you know to be held by pious and learned zeal, indeed with serious letters worthy of such a matter, to investigate the source and origin of this evil among us. Let them go to Lausanne and there inquire more diligently about those who first brought that pestilential doctrine, who later fostered it and tried to spread it among the people, all under the guise of great sanctity and in wondrous ways. For since they are so disposed to simulate and dissimulate everything rather than yield their place, hoping that as long as they are tolerated in our republic, they can always make a more abundant sowing of their impure doctrine and contaminate the Lord's mass with that leaven, great caution must be taken that such people are not tolerated in the future. However, as far as I understand, most of them will have no scruples about abjuring, so that by obtaining the freedom to preach, they may secretly disseminate among the people what they neither dare to profess openly nor is it safe for them to do so. Therefore, I implore and beseech you, most learned Bullinger, by the account you will render to the Lord, to devote all your effort and diligence to this matter, and to frequently and diligently admonish those among our senators whom you know to uphold the pure doctrine, not to allow this pestilence to spread any longer among their people. As soon as you accomplish this, consider that you have rendered a great service to God and His Church, one that you will never regret.</p>
      <p>Farewell always, blessed, with the most holy company of your brothers. Baden, Switzerland, 14th day before the Kalends of June, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your brother, Béat Comte of Donzère. These my letters, nor the previous ones which I wrote to you, are not to be shared with some of our people.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and learned pastor of the Church of Zürich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord.</p>
