      <p>S. D. I received the miserable news last week from Geneva.</p>
      <p>I had hoped to receive your letters today along with those I had sent back; but I have seen nothing yet. Now, I pass on what I received this week from some people from Cremona coming from Geneva and heading to Italy. There is nothing to share with you from Mr. Calvin; I assume the same has been explained to you by him. From Heidelberg, it is written: Elector August of Saxony has summoned his leading theologians to a synod in Dresden; they have drafted a new confession; August and the more sincere theologians do not dare to openly profess what they understand to be true; for they see that some are solely aiming to persuade the Saxons that the Elector and the Wittenbergers have defected from Luther; for they hope to transfer the electorate to the most steadfast disciples of Luther through the people's fury. Until now, many thought the dispute was about adiaphora; but the issue is not about the choir robe, but about the electoral robe, and since Jeroboam fears the tribes will defect again to the house of David, he builds high places and defends those built. The Elector Palatine did not want to subscribe to that confession; when asked to admit some explanation in the preface to the Augsburg Confession, he replied that he is not one to forge and publish new things daily; he agreed at Naumburg, and he will remain in that agreement and profess no other faith than what he declared there.</p>
      <p>In short: that most religious and steadfast prince, from whom much is expected. Chancellor Minquitius or rather Nequitius recently returned to his Saxony, leaving the Palatinate, and some other thick-headed brothers have left the Palatinate; there is hope that everything will be better organized. May the Lord add His grace!</p>
      <p>The day in Basel has ended, and since either side wants to retreat, measures have been put in place that the Duke should be followed again with the three bailiwicks of Eschenz, Schaffhausen, and Isenfluh; however, what was assigned from that bailiwick to Geneva should remain with Geneva, and the entire Vaud should remain with the Bernese. Some things are being brought back; on Bartholomew's Day, they will meet again in Basel. All the envoys are very friendly and united, and the Savoyards have also shown themselves to be very friendly, etc.</p>
      <p>If you have any news from the Duchy of WÃ¼rttemberg and Swabia, let me know. Farewell together with our Matthias, whom you will greet from me, as well as the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 6, 1561. Our people greet you. Greet Gervicus, your son, for me.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Winterthur.</p>
