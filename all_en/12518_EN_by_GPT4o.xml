    <p xml:id="regest1">The day before, Blarer received Bullinger's letter to Vadian [not received] and showed it to some [council]men. Bullinger's advice pleased them so much that they immediately implemented it, which the people of Zurich will have already learned from the envoy from Konstanz [Ludwig Kürnstaller].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Duke Ulrich of Württemberg has pledged his unconditional support in a letter to Ulm. Allegedly, the people of Ulm confiscated several wagons with spears that were intended for Emperor [Charles V.], but paid the drivers for the goods.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- If the [Inner Cities] are not willing to assist [the Schmalkaldic League], the people of Zurich, at the request of the council of Konstanz, should persuade these cities to at least allow the [Protestant cities to offer their help to the League]. This way, the [Inner Cities] would satisfy the Emperor, and the support provided by the [Confederates] would be all the more efficient.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The envoy from Konstanz [...] at the [City Day] in Ulm wrote that the Emperor asked Duke [Wilhelm] of Bavaria to use his resources for the preservation of religion and in favor of the challenged reputation of the Emperor. The Duke is said to have replied that he would not wage war on anyone for the sake of religion, but would behave appropriately towards the Emperor. After that, the Emperor is said to have negotiated nothing confidential with him. Many do not trust the Duke's unclear response.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The Rhenish nobility has refused to support the Emperor, even though he made great efforts and several nobles were willing to do so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Blarer has not yet summoned [Barbara Winzürn] to him, but has no doubt about her reliability if she has delivered the [scholarship] intended for [Konrad] Hofherr.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Everything is settled regarding Bishop [Johann von Weeze].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- For certain reasons, the messenger [Ludwig Kürnstaller] does not know that the letter entrusted to him by Blarer was also written by Blarer. Bullinger should not tell him either. However, he may give him a letter for Blarer. Hopefully, the messenger is friendly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Blarer will continue to provide Bullinger with news. [Thomas Blarer] and K[onrad] Zwick send their regards. Some people from Augsburg are fleeing to Konstanz, and the wealthiest are bringing their wives and children to safety.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother. Your letter to Vadian reached me yesterday. I immediately showed it to some of my councilmen. The advice was very well received, and it was noted that matters are already being handled in this way, as you may have already been informed by our envoy who was with you, because I hear that everything is being arranged accordingly. May God grant it a good end!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>So you know, Duke Ulrich of Württemberg has written very confidently to the people of Ulm, stating that he will, without any hesitation (these are his words), commit his body, life, goods, and blood with all his might to this cause. Now there is news that the people of Ulm have confiscated several wagons with spears intended for the Emperor, but they paid the drivers for the spears. This is being reported credibly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Some of my councilmen consider it good that if the common Confederates were asked for help, they should arrange matters in such a way that the other Confederates, if they do not want to help, would nevertheless allow those who are committed to the Gospel to offer help. This would be best, as they would keep the Emperor at peace and the help from the other evangelical Confederates would be all the more fortunate for us. You know well what to do in this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Our envoy from Ulm writes that the Emperor has now asked Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria to use his resources for the preservation of religion and also for the preservation of the imperial majesty's reputation, which has been severely diminished by some disobedient estates with defamatory booklets, writings, and paintings, etc. To this, he replied that he would not wage war on anyone for the sake of religion, but as far as the Emperor's reputation is concerned, he will behave appropriately; after which the Emperor did not want to negotiate anything more confidentially with the Duke. However, some think this response may well be a trap and ambiguous.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Rhenish nobility, after thorough deliberation, has refused the Emperor's requested help, even though he gave them good words and some among them would have gladly supported him, and if it had been approved, it would have been little liked. Praise be to God!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have not yet summoned that little woman, although I dare not doubt her fidelity, if the money intended for Curio has been delivered, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Everything is settled regarding the bishop.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I am writing in great haste and the messenger does not know that the letter comes from me, for reasons. However, it does not matter if you give me one back. Therefore, do not tell him that I wrote this. I hope he will be gracious and willing. It is or will be forbidden to him and others by my councilmen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Given at three o'clock in the afternoon, June 25, 1546. Pray to God faithfully for us and do everything for the best. Whatever I learn at any time, I will let you know. My dear brother and C. Zwick send you all good wishes. Some people from Augsburg are fleeing to us, and the wealthiest are sending their wives and children away.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my good friend.</p>
