      <p>We have once again received your letter, faithful warning, and concern that you bear for our corrupted fatherland, with great gratitude. Dear sir and brother, although the governor of Milan has responded to the League's letter with good words: the unrest on Lake Como has occurred without his knowledge; he will not leave the perpetrators unpunished and desires to be a good neighbor with us, etc., while he continues to arm himself and reject peace, we suspect he will be a good neighbor until spring, as we have assumed, and then unexpectedly invade our land through the M端sser, as he has done before, etc.</p>
      <p>This enclosed letter from Dr. Ascanio Marsi I have received from Lucerne, with wonder about what he intends to negotiate in Lucerne and Z端rich. However, it is my request, wishing to direct you to him, and do not think that you will regret it; for he has good acquaintance with the pious and learned of the world.</p>
      <p>Thus he will also understand that I have written to Z端rich according to his desire, etc. And with this, we commend you to God the Lord.</p>
      <p>In Chur in haste, on the 15th of October, in the year 1549. Johannes Blasius in the name of the consul, Commander Tscharner, and all other pious ones, who greet you most warmly.</p>
      <p>To the most prudent, distinguished in learning and piety, Mr. Bullinger, bishop of the Church of Z端rich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
