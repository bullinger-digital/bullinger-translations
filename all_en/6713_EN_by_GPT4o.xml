      <p>Greetings. Nothing occurs to me to write except that I am waiting for a response to my last letters, that we are in good health, and that the matter of religion is making great progress every day, even against the will of all the wicked. And since now Mr. Bellieure is performing the duty of an ambassador, it will be safe and sound to enjoy our friendship with more frequent letters. My wife sends you many greetings. You will greet the most honorable council and all friends. Farewell. Paris, hastily, March 6, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignetius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church. Zurich.</p>
