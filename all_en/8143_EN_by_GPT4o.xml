      <p> Greetings. I received your letter, beloved son, and I greatly approve of your diligence. It is neither importunity nor impudence if the younger write to the older, especially when acknowledging and celebrating received benefits. This is rightly given praise; but it also provides an opportunity to confer greater benefits or at least to persevere in stable beneficence and benevolence. And I want you to know and be convinced that I have always loved you and still love you now, and I am most ready to serve you and your interests, as far as my abilities allow. Continue in your good studies, fear God, and diligently pray to Him, so that your studies may someday benefit His church. There are many things that urge you on, especially the examples from your own family. </p>
      <p> Your paternal grandfather was a man very well known to me, a man of utmost integrity and very knowledgeable in true religion, a most renowned teacher of the church, who also shed his blood for the testament of God. Your maternal grandfather was also known to me and was very dear, a great lover of true religion. The virtue of your father, uncle, and cousin of the Hallers is also celebrated. Therefore, you have uncommon examples to imitate. Pray to God to grant you grace so that you can. The Apostle also proposed to Timothy in the second letter to Timothy the examples of grandmother Lois and mother Eunice. Why then should I not also remind you of your most pious grandfathers and your excellent and pious mother, of sincere religion? Continue, continue my son, on the path of virtues. May the Lord have mercy on you and keep you. </p>
      <p> As for Thersites and that Stentor who accuse us, as you write, they will have God as their judge. I think such quarrelers and loud actors should be passed over rather than rebuked; they will destroy themselves eventually. May the Lord have mercy on them; for they persecute us without our fault and slander us. I wish you would tell Jakob Hirssgarter that I am very surprised, since I wrote to him through Lucius Nier, and he disdains to respond to my request. </p>
      <p> Greet him and the rest of our Zurich students. Farewell forever. </p>
      <p> Zurich, January 20, 1570. </p>
      <p> Heinrich Bullinger the Elder. </p>
      <p> To the young man of great promise, Johann Jakob Haller of Zurich, engaged in good studies in Basel, most beloved son. </p>
      <p> Basel. </p>
      <p> January 20, 1570. </p>
