      <p>Greetings. Since your and our Froschauer, most illustrious man and in the Lord most esteemed by me, has decided to return to you, I did not want to let him go without my letters, by which you may know that I am well and have not forgotten you. I came to London many days ago, because the assemblies, which are commonly called parliament, are now being held: for the royal majesty has decreed that since the gospel is accepted in his kingdom and the Roman bishop is excluded, the Anglican church should no longer be governed by papal decrees, decretals, the Sext, the Clementines, and other such papal laws; for in the ecclesiastical court, with the name of the pope tacitly omitted, the use of these laws has prevailed for the most part until now, since no other laws had been issued by which the external polity of the church could be governed. Therefore, lest this great kingdom be deprived of such necessary convenience, the king has appointed thirty-two men to establish ecclesiastical laws for this kingdom, namely 8 bishops, 8 theologians, 8 experts in canon law, and finally 8 consultants of the law of this kingdom, the majority of whom are distinguished by outstanding learning and singular piety, and among these we too have been called, Hooper, a Lasco, and I. May God grant that here such decrees are sanctioned, which with piety and holy justice will abrogate the Tridentine canons among the faithful churches of Christ.</p>
      <p>But because I understand that for such a great work we need your prayers and those of your colleagues, therefore, with all the faith and fervor I can muster, I implore them; for it is not only necessary to pray to God that the laws be written piously and holy, but also that they be approved by the votes of the assemblies. Otherwise, they would have neither force nor strength.</p>
      <p>As for other matters, we are now conducting ourselves quite peacefully. It is true that some disturbances were stirred up in the republic a few months ago; but now they seem to be settled. May God grant tranquility to both the kingdom and the church, which, however, I see well must be expected elsewhere to be full and complete, for as long as we live here, we may wish for it rather than truly hope for it.</p>
      <p>I have finally seen my commentaries on the epistle to the Corinthians; for some volumes arrived here around January 15, but so few that none are now left for sale.</p>
      <p>I do not know by what fate it happened that Byrgmann's books have not yet been able to be brought to us; he certainly owed me some copies, of which I have not had even one. However, I cannot but praise the diligence of the printer, which I attribute not only to him but also to your authority and the zeal of our Gwalther; I therefore thank you all and regret not a little that I cannot repay you. As for the other commentaries on Genesis and Exodus, I promise you that, when I have time to review them, I will send them to you for printing; but now I am so pressed by so many occupations that I am almost overwhelmed. I also desire to complete the commentaries on the epistle to the Romans, so that they may be printed by you. To this Froschauer, to whom I have entrusted these letters to be delivered to you, I can only give a good testimony. He conducted himself well among us in Oxford and lived without any complaint. John and your young men also live modestly and study diligently.</p>
      <p>I wish you well in the Lord and desire that all your colleagues be greeted in my name. March 8, 1552. From the house of the Lord of Canterbury.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the word of God.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
