      <p> Greetings. I pray to God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ that the upcoming new year may be as happy as possible for you and yours, dearest lord and brother in Christ. At the same time, I send you 8 gold coins as a customary gift, which I ask you to accept kindly. I thank you for sharing with me many writings about the state of France; I now return the same to you. I could not return them sooner or more conveniently. I was particularly pleased with the response of the people of La Rochelle. Regarding the state of our affairs, since you can learn everything in person from Müller, who brings this to you, except for what you see written on the attached page, I did not think it necessary to write more to you. I have found in Müller what you praise in him. I thank you for taking care of me even in this matter. I have entrusted him to my son. Now I send him to Basel, as you will be able to learn from Müller himself about this and other matters. </p>
      <p> The papists among us rejoice everywhere no less than among you; however, I hope the well-known proverb will apply to them, "He sells the skin before he has caught the bear." </p>
      <p> We are waiting to see what all these various assemblies will produce: the Swiss in Baden, the electors in Cologne, the princes in Neuburg, the Bavarians in Landshut, Ferdinand, Charles, the Emperor in their respective territories, then the recently concluded assembly of the Bavarians, Salzburgers, Charles and Ferdinand, the Poles, and the comings and goings of all nations everywhere. </p>
      <p> Farewell. </p>
      <p> Given at Bocksberg, December 23, 1572. </p>
      <p> I am saddened by the calamities of Mr. François Hotman; I send you, in addition to the previous 8 gold coins, which I ask you to send to him as a gift in my name when you have a suitable messenger. </p>
      <p> Your most respectful Georg von Stetten. To the venerable, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend. </p>
      <p> In Zurich. </p>
