      <p>To the most pious and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, father, minister of the church in Zürich, Matthieu Coignet sends greetings.</p>
      <p>For a long time now, I have been wondering, most esteemed father, what I should write to you in these times. Two things have occurred to me, which provide me with ample and copious material for writing. The first and foremost is to excuse myself for not having sent you letters for a long time. The second is to send you some certain information about my entire situation, for I do not doubt that you are very eager to know about my studies and health. I hope you do not think that the reason you have not learned about these things through letters is due to forgetfulness of your great merits towards me and your great kindness and love for me. Rather, it is because for the past two or three months, I have been distracted and agitated in various directions, since during that time, I received a letter from my father instructing me to move from here at the first opportunity. As I was eager to diligently carry out this command, I did not allow myself any part of day or night for rest in searching and investigating, so much so that when I was laboring to send you a letter, it even diverted me from my purpose. Not because I could not steal a small amount of time from my affairs, which, if not great, were at least not insignificant, but because I desired that nothing be unknown to you. For I have been affected by such great benefits and gifts from you, always received with such kindness, and have sometimes conversed with you in such sweet and familiar conversation, that I thought it demanded of me that I should not conceal from you anything that pertains to the state of my body or mind. Therefore, since the opportunity to write now presents itself, and I have often recalled your virtue and love towards me, I have tried to make up for the long period during which we lacked the exchange of my letters, which always recalled your grace and goodwill to my memory, by some act of duty. However, I am truly ignorant of what kind of duty I should perform to accomplish this; my abilities are so weak and abject that if I think of showing my duty to you through work or labor, a burden heavier than Mount Etna already weighs upon me. If I try to do it through some letter, I see such weakness in my intellect that I can hardly bring myself to believe that you could derive any pleasure from my rough and unpolished letters. Thus, wherever I turn, whichever path I take, I find nothing that could be worthy of you and your virtues, nothing that could respond to even the smallest of your benefits towards me. However, when I remember your kindness, which is accustomed to interpreting everything in a better rather than worse light, I see myself armed with the shield of Ajax, so that I fear no torments, no blows of cannons and spears, but dare to approach you fearlessly, do not hesitate to offer you my letters, and believe that, having read them, you will excuse me and accept the account of my studies with a fair and benevolent mind. Since this is the case, I will come to my studies, so that having explained them to you, I can more easily descend to other matters. They have been engaged in Cicero's speech for Murena, the fourth book of Georgics, and Aeschines' speech against Ctesiphon, with great labor and diligence on my part, as I wished to show obedience to my father and also to gratify you. For I know that you are accustomed to accept it as a benefit from me if I rush headlong into the study of studies and disciplines; for from this virtue is born, which we read and draw from the deeds of others and strive to imitate. The monuments of famous men, which we have vividly expressed in books everywhere, urge us, no less than the image of Alexander the Great urged Caesar to undertake many noble things, who, when he noticed such great virtue residing in such a small and young body, finally thought of monarchy and attempted to bring the entire world under his power, so that he later became the greatest commander, to which undertaking he was also aided by studies and disciplines, which he was accustomed to value highly. My dearest father, having neglected all expenses, thought it would be well advised for my studies if I were to go from Heidelberg, an academy if not obscure, at least not very famous, to Wittenberg, to devote myself to letters there for some time and then to Italy, to taste the principles of law. Whether he wants this to happen this winter, I do not quite know; I only know that I will go to Wittenberg, unless either peace is made in France or something else impedes that journey, and if I stay there for the winter, I hope to enjoy your letters, which are nothing more pleasant or sweeter, for some time; if not, nevertheless, I will always remember your kindness, which, whenever I recall it, will restrain me from many desires to which youth is accustomed to be subject. For I know and am aware of the great weakness of human flesh, which, as Ovid says, sees the better and approves it, but follows the worse. Moreover, the virtue of my parents reminds me, from whom it would be shameful and disgraceful to degenerate. The insignia of virtue urge me, of which, as Cicero says, nothing is more beautiful, nothing more splendid, nothing more lovable, for indeed honor is placed in virtue. I will not discuss this more copiously, lest I perhaps distract you, occupied with more serious matters. If you wish to know anything about my health, know that I am safe and sound. My father is also well and sends you many greetings. As for the news of this place, know first of all that peace has been made, as you can see from the conditions, and that the papal legate, who is in Speyer, has been caught for the crime of sodomy, one of his servants having fled, which indeed is a sad and horrendous spectacle, and should be severely punished. However, since he is a minister of the pope, if he were punished, it could never truly be expiated. These, most esteemed father, are the things I wished to inform you of, and since there is nothing more left for me to write to you, I will end my letter and pray to the best and greatest God to keep you safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on the 5th day before the Ides of September.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and most venerable man, lord Heinrich Bullinger, father, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
