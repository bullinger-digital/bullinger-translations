      <p> Greetings. It is part of the same friendship, dearest compater in the Lord, Bullinger, to sympathize with the afflicted and to rejoice with those who rejoice, and for this reason, true friends have been accustomed to eagerly share not only what is joyful but also what is sorrowful. Moved by this affection of friendship, I cannot restrain the sorrow of my heart without expressing it to your kindness. Although there are many things in this miserable and calamitous time that continually disturb my mind, a considerable sorrow has been added to their heap from the accident of my son Abraham, conceived in recent days, which I cannot yet, as I wish, shake off. On the eighteenth of this month, around noon, as he was leaving his study and the steps to the wine cellar at the entrance of the house, a very dangerous and inconvenient place, were open with the door ajar, he fell down them from the elevated floor through imprudence and lack of caution, so that he broke his right leg above the knee in an unfortunate manner. I have found a surgeon who, as I fear, is not yet sufficiently practiced in this art; for he is younger in age than to have been able to acquire any singular expertise in these matters; he promises, however, as they usually do, that he will take care to remove this ailment as conveniently and correctly as possible. Nevertheless, I am tormented on one side by the sorrow from my son's calamity, and on the other by fear from the surgeon's inexperience. But thanks be to the Lord: now the fourth day has passed, and the ailment seems to be treated in such a way that nothing inconvenient will result from it. You have heard about the sorrows that press upon me; now receive the more joyful news: today at the eighth hour before noon, my wife gave birth, initially with great difficulty, but finally successfully; she bore a son, whom tomorrow, with the Lord willing, we will give to be associated and consecrated to the church of the faithful and elect through holy baptism; his name will be Johannes Heinrich, taken from the compater, whom we have chosen, as you wished, you and D. Haller, for this sacred duty. I pray to the Lord that this child, in due time, through His grace, may follow, if not entirely express, at least imitate the piety and learning of both. May the Lord preserve you and all yours, along with the other lords and brothers, safe and sound. My wife and children greet you all and often wish that it may be possible to renew the comforts of former companionship in person. Farewell excellently, dearest compater in the Lord. </p>
      <p> Bern, 21st of September, 1549. </p>
      <p> Wolfgang Musculus, your most loving compater. </p>
      <p> To the outstanding theologian M. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zürich, his dearest compater in Christ, in Zürich. </p>
