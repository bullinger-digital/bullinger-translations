    <p xml:id="regest1">This time, together with Leo [Jud], [agrees to the amendment of the letter to Luther proposed by Basel], but demands that the Bern Council also be consulted. In Constance, where Thomas Blarer was elected mayor, there is resistance against the pressure from Strasbourg to sign [the Wittenberg Concord]. The threat from Basel to proceed alone if necessary is met with incomprehension in Zurich; the opponents are just waiting for such a split. Requests forwarding of a question to Grynaeus, sends greetings, and encloses a letter to Bucer.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You have obtained what you asked for, because these things you have now returned are much more circumspect (so that it was not burdensome for Leo [Jud] and me to agree to them and accept them) than the previous ones were. When you deal with me freely and advise, there is no need for you to continue with a preface or as if to apologize for a fault. I gladly accept the free admonitions of brothers. It will be your responsibility to ensure that nothing is done without the knowledge of the Bernese. I am not now speaking of brothers, that is, ministers of the word, but of senators. They do not want to be overlooked. May the Lord grant that the hardened mind of Luther and his followers bear with us, not to mention accept our views.</p>
      <p>The brothers in Strasbourg are dealing quite harshly with those in Constance. There, Thomas Blarer has now been designated as mayor. They do not want to be compelled to subscribe in this way; they wish to use the same freedom they see the Swiss churches have used.</p>
      <p>However, I would not want anyone among us to know how readily you threaten to separate from us over such a trivial matter. I will speak freely, as I feel. I could not help but be moved, and I am still moved. Nor do I know what the senate would have done if Leo and I had not pursued the matter with the greatest efforts. If they had perceived even a little of this, I do not know what would have been done. You know our dispositions. I beseech you, have the same spirit towards us as you see we have towards you. No death will divide us. And yet I know that some in Basel boast of being in full agreement, while others do not. You will find those who say: "If only Luther does not receive that response! For before the people of Basel offend him, they will accept the articles and thus subscribe. In this way, we will split those whom we have hitherto seen as most united." These things I confide to you. You know me. You know what spirit I am endowed with towards you.</p>
      <p>Now farewell and give this note to Grynaeus, so that he may respond to me about what kind of leaves the anabuli are. Give him my greetings and to the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Ensure that this is delivered to Bucer.</p>
      <p>16th of December, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant Antistes of the people of Basel, his brother in the Lord.</p>
