    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Bullinger's last letter [No. 2487], approximately 2000 men, including many honorable, wealthy, and even elderly people, from the city and region of Zürich wanted to march to Konstanz [to aid the Schmalkaldic League], so that Zürich might lack [defense forces]. Therefore, yesterday evening, the Zürich authorities closed the city gates and also instructed the communities around [Lake Zürich] to remain still.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Today, a letter from Baden was received at the [Zürich] council and citizens' assembly, from which it was learned that the Nine Cantons intended to write to [Germany] and demand the return of the [mercenaries] who had already set out. The cantons also wrote to the Zürich council regarding this. However, at the assembly, it was decided not to recall anyone and not to punish the mercenaries. Furthermore, the envoys [Itelhans Thumysen and Johannes Haab] present at the [Baden Diet] should strive to dissuade the Nine Cantons from their demand. The people of Zürich do not want to abandon the [Protestant] imperial cities under any circumstances. However, since they believe that the [Schmalkaldic League] now has enough soldiers, tomorrow in all the churches of the city and region, the population will be called to remain still and to commit to a possible defense of the country. The people of Zürich have never been as well-disposed towards the [Schmalkaldic League] as they are now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The people of Basel wrote that over 800 Italians, who had been in the service of King [Henry VIII] of England, want to travel home through the Confederation. The people of Zürich replied that they should not be allowed to pass through.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Zürich envoys [in Baden] report that the messengers [of the Schmalkaldic League] from Württemberg, Strasbourg, and Konstanz arrived yesterday and are being heard today. Envoys from Emperor [Charles V] and Pope [Paul III] are also present and are engaging in bribery.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Hans Rych], the bearer of this letter, was detained by Bullinger for half a day to be able to inform Blarer of everything in detail. Blarer should write more often than before. What news is there from Saxony, Hesse, Denmark, and Cologne?</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother. Since I concluded the last letter, so much news has come that we have learned precisely that around 2000 men from my lords' land wanted to set out and were in armor, intending to march to Konstanz, as everyone is willing. Therefore, yesterday evening, my lords of the city have closed and guarded the gates, and have sent an open letter to the communities around the lake to remain still. For if this is not done, we would be exposed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>And many very honorable, wealthy, brave, elderly, and gray-haired people are among those who set out.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Today, the council and citizens have gathered to discuss the matter. There also comes a letter from Baden, stating that the Nine Cantons, as you know, intend to recall those who have run to you, and they have also written to my lords. In response, the council and citizens have unanimously decided not to recall anyone, but to let those who have joined the empire remain and not to close their houses, as the statute allows, and to write to the envoys that they should strive to dissuade the Nine Cantons from their demand, etc., for Zürich will not abandon the imperial cities in any way. It has also been decided, since it is believed that you now have enough soldiers, that tomorrow in all the churches of the city and land, all the people will be called by honor and oath to remain in the land and not to run further, but to wait for my lords to defend the land, and if my lords need anything, that everyone should be armed, etc. And I tell you in truth, I have never seen such unity and goodwill towards you in Zürich. There is now no discord. Truly, it signifies good things. You should certainly expect all good things from us. After all, Basel has written that 800 Italian soldiers, who had been with the king of England, are marching through the Confederation to seek a lord in Italy, etc., and my lords have written that they should not be allowed to pass through, but should be sent back, etc. Furthermore, our envoys report that yesterday the messengers of the empire from Württemberg, Strasbourg, and Konstanz arrived. Today they are being heard. The emperor and pope are very powerful there. They are giving generously, etc. May God turn it to good.</p>

      <p>I have detained this messenger for half a day so that I could write to you the true reason, and all this is certainly so. Dear, write more, as you do. I am concerned. What news do you have from the north, from Saxony, Hesse, Denmark, etc., Cologne?</p>

      <p>God be with you. 11 a.m., 10th of July, 1546. In great haste. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his dear lord and brother, Master Ambrosius Blarer, preacher in Konstanz.</p>
