    <p xml:id="regest1">Received letter and money and paid [for the books acquired for Bullinger]. His commentaries [on two speeches of Cicero], which he will send to him at the next opportunity, are published under the pseudonym "Eubulus Dynaterus"; he is still undecided whether he should also undertake the commentary on the fifth speech against Verres. Otto [Werdmüller] agrees with Bullinger's proposal, but will hardly receive a position at the university; it would be nothing without [Hieronymus] Gemusäus and is further damaged as Grynäus is under pressure due to the lack of a title. Gwalther has sadly witnessed how [Wilhelm] Zwingli was taken by Sebastian Meyer to Strasbourg, where he is exposed to questionable influences as a housemate of Capito and Luther's son [Johannes]. Recommends bringing Werdmüller to Zurich in the interest of the school. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received the letters with the money from Quirinus, dearest father. Everything is in order; I have settled all matters in your name.</p>
      <p>I am pleased with the advice you gave regarding the publication of my commentaries, although I had never intended to put my name on them before. I will send what has been printed once Quirinus returns from Strasbourg. All my works are now completed, and Oporinus has changed my name to Eubulus Dynaterus.</p>
      <p>He did not specify the homeland. He was very pleased with them. He still lacks the commentary on the fifth Verrine; he asked me for it, but I am uncertain about what I will do; I would certainly like to undertake something that would both increase the fruit of my studies and contribute something to the expenses of living.</p>
      <p>I reported to Otto what you wrote. He is pleased, but he still has no position, nor, I think, will he find one in Basel in such a troubled academy. For if you take away Doctor Gemusäus from this school, it will be entirely crippled, indeed nonexistent. For Grynaeus, a learned and pious man who is wholly devoted to benefiting young students, is also miserably harassed by those most vain and ambitious titles, so that he cannot now carry out what he began. But God will someday put an end to it, not without punishment for those who so miserably afflict both the church and the hope of the church, namely the school.</p>
      <p>Doctor Sebastian Meyer from Bern was here with Zwingli's son, whom he led to Strasbourg. This spectacle so moved my mind that I could hardly hold back tears. For a boy of the best character, born of a most holy father, is being led to those whom you know what they are like. He will live with Capito and with Luther's son, a boy (as I hear) of the worst character. Add to this the annoyance of this city, the intemperate climate, and the pestilential waters, among which he will not be able to live healthily. But thus it is now conducted. The people of Strasbourg dominate in some churches, but how successfully, let it be the judgment of others. Here, certainly, life is miserable.</p>
      <p>My hope is in you, that you will, as usual, ensure that our school is not dissolved, which now is heard of as excellent by everyone. However, I would especially wish that our Otto, a young man who easily holds the palm among all the students of the Zurich college, would be taken care of. He certainly does not yet long for his homeland; however, in my opinion, it does not seem unwise if he professes among you rather than abroad.</p>
      <p>He could achieve much in philosophy here, and he can also teach many other things not without profit. But let your advice be on these matters; I speak of these things as with a father, whom I have as my only one. Be assured that I am most strongly held by the zeal for the safety of the homeland.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife most kindly, to whom I heartily congratulate for having successfully overcome childbirth, and I am very glad that you have been blessed with a new son. May God grant that they may someday be able to benefit the Zurich republic.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, greet the whole family.</p>
      <p>From the house of Mr. Myconius in Basel, June 6, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father.</p>
