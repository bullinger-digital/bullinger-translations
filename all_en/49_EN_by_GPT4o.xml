    <p xml:id="regest1">For a long time, Schertlin has not received a letter from Bullinger and has also not sent one to him due to a severe illness. However, he is now feeling better.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">He would have liked to report good news to Bullinger, but there are none. As the powerful rulers [Emperor Charles V and King Ferdinand I] proceed against the exiled [formerly Schmalkaldic commanders] in such a manner, their situation is increasingly worsening. An end to this raging and bloodshed is not in sight.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">In Augsburg, a scaffold for humans was erected next to the slaughterhouse for cattle on Perlachplatz [Town Hall Square]! May God have mercy on the corpses [of the executed] and put an end to this state!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Schertlin perceives that all the imperial estates are so intimidated that they no longer resist [the claim to power of Charles V]. Their resistance against him is drowned in their own blood. They must agree to all the emperor's demands.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Almost all the spiritual and secular princes and electors are now gathered at the Augsburg [Diet]. According to credible reports, they are supposed to re-establish the Swabian League.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Furthermore, the arrival of Philip II, the son of Charles V, is expected every day. The estates are said to have already consented to his election as king or emperor!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">It is also said that Charles V has sent an embassy with such great authority to Pope Paul III that a reconciliation between the two is to be feared. If that really happens, may God stand by [the Protestants]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Paul III is said to have instructed the German [Catholic] clergy not to agree to the negotiation that the emperor has commissioned to clarify the religious question.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">While Charles V, through his actions, makes all foreign rulers and communities fear an attack, he pursues his own plans with Philip II, Paul III, and the entire empire [for monarchical imperial reform]. And no one opposes him! Should he succeed, his neighbors will undoubtedly realize his plan [too late]. In short: God must come to help!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">The people of Bremen, Magdeburg, and the other Hanseatic cities, just like Count Albrecht VII of Mansfeld, Count Christoph of Oldenburg, and other exiled nobles, continue to prove themselves brave [in resistance against the emperor]! They are gathering troops, but they will probably not withstand Charles V for long unless someone comes to their aid.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">The riders of King Ferdinand I capture the poor [fleeing] mercenaries on their daily raids around Basel, some of which lead into the city, and also seize innocents. The riders, together with the [Basel] priests [N.N.] and their followers, try to incite the common people loudly against Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard, Johann Freiherr von Heideck, Friedrich von Reifenberg, and Schertlin through slander.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">Schertlin has still not received permission from the Basel councilors to settle, but must, to his [financial] disadvantage, live with his wife [Barbara von Stende] and the entire household in a public inn. In confidence: He would pay a fortune if he had stayed with the Zurichers or in one of their territories back then! To seek advice on how he could manage his affairs, he has secretly sent his son [Hans Sebastian or Hans Philipp] with letters to Bullinger and Bernhard von Cham. [The rest] is communicated orally by Schertlin's son. Bullinger should trust the son as if it were Schertlin himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">When Johann Freiherr von Heideck stood before the Bernese council, he was promised support. Additionally, the people of Biel intend to grant him a [former] monastery [as a residence]. However, Schertlin does not believe that any of the [German] commanders intend to stay [permanently] in Basel. But that is in strict confidence!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">Constance is said to still receive no support [against the emperor] and is in a great predicament. Should the city, however, submit to the Austrians [the Habsburgs], it would receive money and its reconciliation [with the emperor].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">Württemberg has an uncertain position, as Ferdinand I is not interested in a penalty payment [from Duke Ulrich of Württemberg], but wants to take possession of the land and people! The emperor is to judge on this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">Bullinger should also share these confidential news with the Zurich mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab as well as Bernhard von Cham and recommend Schertlin to them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">According to the people of Augsburg and others, Schertlin can expect a contractual reconciliation [with the emperor]. However, influential people advised him not to hope for it. He is completely at a loss as to how to proceed.</p>

      <p>My willing service and all the good I can offer are always ready for you, gracious, dear, and trusted lord. I have not written to you for a long time and have not received any letters from you either. My reason is the severe illness with which I have been burdened for a long time. But, thank God, it has improved quite well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I would have liked to write you good news, but I can find none. Our situation worsens day by day. The powerful rulers have imposed such tyranny against us poor exiles that there seems to be no end to the raging, tumult, and bloodshed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In Augsburg, a scaffold for humans has been erected on the open square called Perlachplatz, next to the slaughterhouse. There is such flesh that God might have mercy. May He bring a merciful, mild end to it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I see that all the high and low estates in the Roman Empire are so intimidated that none dare raise their heads. They must be struck down in their own blood by a small retinue. To everything demanded of them, they must say amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In Augsburg, almost all the electors and princes, both spiritual and secular, are gathered together. They are, as I credibly hear, supposed to re-establish and incorporate the great Swabian League.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Every day, the arrival of the emperor's son is awaited. The estates are said to have already agreed to invest him as emperor or king!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It is also said that the emperor has once again sent a remarkable embassy with much and great authority to the pope, and with such, it is considered that the two are to be reconciled. If that happens, may God help us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The pope is said to have written to the German clergy in such a way that they should not agree to the proposed colloquium (in which it should be discussed how a council will be held in the German nation) at the emperor's request.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The emperor holds himself against all foreign potentates and communities, so that everyone fears he will attack them. But in the meantime, he carries out his plans with his son, the pope, and the entire German nation as he wishes. There is no one who acts against it in the least! But when he has brought this matter together, the neighboring communities and potentates will undoubtedly see his work. In summary: I see no human help in this matter. No one wants to do anything. God from heaven must come to our aid alone!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The people of Bremen, Magdeburg, along with other sea towns, the counts of Mansfeld and Altenburg, and many exiled nobles are still manly: They are certainly striving for many riders and servants. But I have great concern: If they find no other help, they will not be able to endure it for long.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The riders of the Roman king raid us every day up to and into the city of Basel, throw down and capture the poor servants (even the innocent ones!), shout and strut along with the priests and their followers over Count Georg, Lord of Heideck, Reifenberg, and me, and presume to make us entirely displeased with the common people here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I have not yet been able to reach any personal settlement with the leaders here and lie with my wife and all my household with damage in an open inn. I show this to you as my trusted one: I would pay 1000 crowns if I had remained with my dear lords in Zurich or in their territories. Therefore, I have secretly sent my son, along with the Lord of Keyburg, to you to advise me, to be helpful in how I can manage my affairs in a more stable condition (as my son will inform you). I ask you to believe him as if I were with you myself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The Lord of Heideck has been with those of Bern. They have promised him friendly comfort and intend to give him a beautiful monastery in Bueyl. I think none of us will be able to stay here. I ask you to keep this in confidence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>As I hear, the city of Constance is still without any human help, comforted by no one, and in great concern. However, if they want to become Austrian, they will not lack money and agreement.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Württemberg stands on a narrow footing. The Roman king wants no money at all, but rather the land and people entirely. However, the emperor is to make the decision.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>I have not withheld all this from you, my trusted lord, and also to share with both mayors and Mr. Bernhard von Cham, along with the offer of my willing services.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>I am still daily highly assured by those from Augsburg and others of the most gracious reconciliation and agreement, yet faithfully warned by high-ranking people not to trust in it. I am completely at a loss in all my matters. Dated Basel, February 22, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your willing S. Schertlin von Burtenbach, knight, subscribes.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, my highly trusted, gracious lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the city of Zurich, to his own hands.</p>
