      <p>Greetings, distinguished man, in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I am sorry and even ashamed, my most esteemed lord, that I have burdened you, a very busy man overwhelmed with many great matters, and additionally afflicted by the situation and turmoil of the churches in Germany, with the heap of so many letters that I have sent to you. Wanting to fulfill my promise to you, so that you might recognize Stancarus, which I promised to do while I was there, I did not think well nor did I judge rightly, that it would have been better to keep them with me than to send them to you. For this matter was not so important that I should occupy you and cause you annoyance.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, I pray, and pardon my ignorance. What you write about Upper Germany and Constance is from the Lord; for no human force (as I estimate), however powerful and strong, could have brought about such a great upheaval in such a short time. Those churches have failed, they have failed because of their sins. But for us, who are not better, but perhaps worse, what is to be expected, than what we see has happened to them, or even graver things? For what has our preaching been so far among ungrateful people (I except very few, who are pious and chosen by God) other than a pretext for greed and freedom of the flesh? I speak of ours; what yours are like, you know. What do we deserve, except that the kingdom of God be taken away from us and given to a nation producing its fruits? I see, unless I am mistaken, that the axe is laid to the root of the tree. Let us pray to the Lord, that He may deal with us not according to our sins, but according to His mercy; let us exhort the people to repentance, let us rebuke, beseech in the meantime, while it is allowed, with all patience and teaching; let us commend the rest to God. If tribulation comes, all things will turn to good for those who love God.</p>
      <p>As for you, my lord Bullinger, and the others, who have labored much and still labor in the church of Christ, the Lord will take care (do not fear) who knows how to deliver the godly from temptation. Let us be strong through the Lord and not faint, for He will make a way with the temptation, that we may be able to bear it. I know you do not need this exhortation of mine; but my love for you has led me to this.</p>
      <p>As for your advice, that as much as I can, I should avoid schism while keeping the doctrine safe and sound, I have done so continuously and still do. But those who have separated themselves from us, who are nevertheless few, have separated themselves for the sake of doctrine. For they do not want to return to us unless I keep silent about the truth, namely that the sacraments confirm the faithful with the promises of God; they want me to keep silent about this, which is proven by the word of the Lord and confirmed by the authority of illustrious churches, namely by you and by the lords of the church of Basel and finally by the church of Chur. Shall I keep silent about the truth, to please men who are not now weak, but obstinate, and indeed these few, to the detriment of the rest of the church and great scandal to others? They say they cannot partake of the Lord's Supper with us with a good conscience while that preaching stands; this is their response. They can make a schism with a good conscience and cannot, unless the truth is kept silent and denied, receive the sacraments with us.</p>
      <p>They can with a good conscience tear apart the unity of the church, for which Christ died, to gather it into one, and cannot participate in the symbols of peace and unity with the rest of the body of Christ. And so you may know: I never forced them to believe or hold it; I only advised them not to make a schism for that reason. They want to force me, a minister, to keep silent. Shall I value a bad and perverse peace so much that I prostitute the holy truth of God? Far be it from me to retain a cursed peace, which is not proposed to be retained unless the truth is abandoned. I have tried everything, I have exhorted, I have begged with tears, not to depart, indeed I have asked for forgiveness if I have offended them in any way. "If I keep silent," I said, "I will render my ministry suspect of falsehood; the church will think my doctrine has been in vain until now; you will force me to deny against my conscience what I have always taught from the day I was first with you." I have done everything in vain. Teach me, you who are wise, what I should do; I am without counsel.</p>
      <p>I have therefore decided to attend to the rest of the church. I will not reject them; if they want to leave, let them leave, whom I cannot retain. If they want to return, I will receive them most kindly and with joy and embrace them. Stancarus has left, and he is given no credence, except by Francesco Negro, as I wrote to you, a good man, but easy. He now stays in the Valtellina, where he teaches some Hebrew grammar. I have told our whole church, if they want me as a minister, to grant two things: first, that we all hold the unity of doctrine, which is confirmed by the churches from which the light of the gospel has arisen for us, second, that church discipline be received.</p>
      <p>I am compelled to do this because of the impious, by whom, unless excommunication prevails, we will be mocked; for I see the name of God blasphemed because of some. I must not and cannot bear this. If they do not want it, let them seek another, for I do not want to be a minister of sin. I think they will grant everything.</p>
      <p>At the end of the letter, you write that you need the articles of Camillus Renatus, because he writes to you that he wants to know from you why you think he holds heretical articles and what they are. I think he wrote this to you to be sure whether I, when I was there, told you anything about this matter, which you could not have known without me telling you, and then he might say: "Behold, Augustinus slanders me among the churches and most illustrious men," and have a pretext to complain about me. But I do not care; I will tell the truth. You are wise and skillful and know well enough how to answer him. If you remember, in our confession, of which you retained a copy, there are twenty chapters; the tenth contains twenty-two errors, all of which are Camillus's, except one, namely the second, which speaks of the sleep of souls. I have all the others partly written in his own hand or heard from others reporting (and these are only three, the 11th, 12th, and 17th) or read in the treatise he wrote against me on the sacraments, or heard with my own ears; all of which, so as not to weary you in seeking our confession's copy, I have written down on this sheet. I expressly judge four to be heretical, the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 8th; judge the rest yourself.</p>
      <p>He defends the first with as much ingenuity and strength as he can, and the sayings of Scripture, which speak of the immortality of souls, he explains, indeed tears apart and draws into a different sense, so that no pious patience can either bear or hear him. Nevertheless, when he sees that this doctrine offends everyone, he says: "I do not affirm that the soul of man is mortal; but I say it for the sake of argument;" and when pressed to confess what he believes, he says: "Camillus still does not know whether the soul is mortal or not;" and I have this written in his own hand. We want him to confess with full mouth that the soul is immortal, if he wants to be considered a Christian by us, nor should he excuse himself that he does not believe it, because he has already infected some with that doctrine, nor would he say he does not know whether it is so unless he believed the contrary. I have the third error written in his own hand, from which it seems to follow that he denies the resurrection of the dead. For if the same substance does not return, but another, it will not be a resurrection, but a new generation of another thing; for it is called a resurrection because that which fell, itself returns again and not another in its place. I heard the 6th and 8th from his own mouth, yet he no longer dares to affirm the eighth, because he sees it is odious. All those, however, who speak of the sacraments, are written in his treatise on the sacraments; I heard the 4th, 5th, 10th, and 13th from his own mouth. All these errors concerning the sacraments, namely the 7th, 9th, 14th, 15th, 16th up to the last 22nd, are written in his little book on the sacraments. I wrote this to you because you wanted it; otherwise, I would not have written anything about Camillus. Would that he had been far from us in peace!</p>
      <p>From Italy, it is reported that Philip, the king of Spain, the son of Charles the Emperor, has taken Genoa by deceit; for the Genoese (as they say), since they did not want to receive him into the city except with a few, were invited by him to a banquet outside the city in the house of Andrea Doria, where all of them, because they were the first and rulers of the city, were detained by him, and in this way Genoa, which was free, was made a slave. These (hc he?) are the arts of the world and of princes. They also say that the very famous city of Siena was also captured by the Spaniards through deceit.</p>
      <p>What I have informed you about Camillus and our church, I ask you, inform few or even none, lest we be an offense to the churches. Greet, if you please, in my name, when you meet them, Lord Bibliander and Lord Rudolf, and if you wish me to do anything for you or your friends, command me confidently as your servant; for you can do nothing more pleasing to me. Farewell well in the Lord Jesus, our Savior. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be in your heart always, and pray to God for us.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, December 10, 1548.</p>
      <p>Postscript. Another messenger has come, who says that Philip indeed attempted it; but it did not succeed.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, lord and father, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the church of Zürich and most illustrious doctor. In Zürich.</p>
