    <p xml:id="regest1">Emphasizes the importance of unity in Christ. Melchior [Wirz] did not receive the professorship for mathematics, as the highly talented Veit [Ardüser] has taken precedence; whether he [as the successor of Johannes Fries] can become the head [of the Pedagogium] seems questionable. Fears that the call to Zurich will put the continuation of Fries' studies into question. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is well, my dearest Bullinger, and it is necessary that in the Lord Christ with all our hearts we truly love each other and with one voice, one heart, we unite in the preaching and sanctification of the name of Christ with all our hearts.</p>
      <p>Regarding Melchior, the situation is as follows: The position in mathematics had become available; I had already obtained it, I had already committed to it with the consent and authority of the entire school, if not for a certain Veit who arrived almost on the same day, a man thoroughly learned in these matters. Since he is a pious and reliable man and will be accepted by the testimony of all, I thought there was no longer any need to deliberate about this position. However, I do not say this to make it seem that a benefit, which we did not give, was given, because I was in favor of it being given, but so that you understand that I was in favor of what you wanted. But Melchior himself will write to you about this matter. The boys I am nurturing are mostly quite grown, as you will easily understand from Fries himself; I fear he may not be able to be in charge. If he cannot, you will not blame me, as the situation denies it to both of us.</p>
      <p>Regarding Fries, I wish that you would look out for the man. For there would soon be a not-to-be-despised position here, and there is some greater opportunity for learning in the school. His studies will be over if he is drawn to the position there; a wife will be given, and he will be entirely consumed by this indeed very laborious position. But you will see to these matters according to your discretion.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Christ keep you. Amen. Greet Theodor for me diligently in the Lord, and let us diligently conspire in the Lord against Satan, against every diabolical art. Farewell to all.</p>
      <p>Your Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother.</p>
