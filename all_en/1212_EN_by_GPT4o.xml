      <p>Most illustrious man, may you be well. I am compelled to postpone my visit to you until after Easter. There are indeed many and serious reasons that keep me entangled; but I can resolve them within these three weeks.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gwalter will share my other letters with you, and you will understand what has reached my ears regarding the affairs of England; you have begun this and can complete it. I urge you again and again to do this diligently; for it concerns the cause of Christ, which is so dear to your heart.</p>
      <p>I currently do not have a reliable messenger to deliver money to my nephew, whom I know is in need in the meantime. Therefore, I would like to earnestly ask you to either send someone to him or write to a friend in Basel to give him ten florins, which I will promptly repay to you. Trust a Christian man and test his faith. Farewell in the Lord; pray for us with the whole church.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, March 12, 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
