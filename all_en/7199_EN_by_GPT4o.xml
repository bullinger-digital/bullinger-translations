      <p>To Simon Zacius, minister of the Kraków assembly, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>We have gladly seen and heard our dearest brother Christoph Tretius, whose arrival was, as always, most welcome to us. It was especially pleasing that he brought your letter, written in the name of the elders of the Kraków church, elegantly composed and full of sincere love and humanity towards us.</p>
      <p>Indeed, we have always loved the Kraków church with sincere affection; but now, with your most loving writings, you bind us more closely and intensely to it. If ever, as you proclaim, we have served and benefited you with our advice and writings, we give thanks to God, the author of all good, for this and congratulate ourselves that in this part our work has been used for the benefit of the church and the glory of His name. Whatever small service it may be, we have most willingly provided it to you, and now and in the future, if we can gratify or serve you in any way, we present ourselves as most ready to do so. You rightly reject and abhor the Traditions and Ammonites of our times, who, with inept interpretation of the scriptures, bring themselves to such a state that they do not know what they believe or assert. However, I know that those who depart from the rule of faith are tossed and turned in this miserable manner.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the rule of faith simply teaches that there is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, not confused indeed, but distinct in their properties. For the Father was not incarnate or crucified for us, but the Son was sent into the world, yet in such a way that He never departed from the Father in divinity, nor was He made lesser in eternity or power. For one God is rightly believed and proclaimed. However, I do not intend to dispute this matter here, which I do not doubt you understand and proclaim most correctly; I am only led to this by the occasion of your letter. I urge you to remain in the simplicity and purity of faith, which Tretius vigorously proclaims you do. He will report more about our affairs; he will indeed be a living letter among you. We commend him to you as a man of sincere faith.</p>
