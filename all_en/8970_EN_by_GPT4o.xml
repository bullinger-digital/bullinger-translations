      <p>Greetings. I have received your letters, dearest brother, and I have nothing at present to respond to them or to add from my own. This one thing I ask of you as much as I can, that you send these enclosed letters, written to my nephew from my brother, who is taking the waters with his ailing wife at the Pf√§fers baths, without delay and as soon as you conveniently can.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever with all our brothers and friends. If you have any news of Italian affairs, the Venetian and Turkish war, the Roman pontiff, the Milanese, and other similar matters, I ask you to share them. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>July 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Tobias Egli, minister of the Chur church, an honorable lord and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
