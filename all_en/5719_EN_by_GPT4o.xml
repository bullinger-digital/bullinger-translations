      <p>To the most illustrious prince and lord, the despot of both Moldavia and Wallachia, etc., the great palatine, my most gracious lord.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords, bless you, most illustrious prince and most gracious lord.</p>
      <p>First of all, I wish to obtain from your piety, most gracious prince, that your excellency does not take offense at me, for although I am unknown to your excellency, I have dared to write to you.</p>
      <p>The zeal for the house of the Lord and the salvation of the people of God compels me. For just as in the time of the living apostles of Christ, there arose turbulent men who corrupted the doctrine of faith with their depraved opinions and delivered it to the churches, claiming that they had received it from the holy apostles of Christ, so today there are not a few who dare to boast that they are purging and restoring to the churches the simple and apostolic faith and doctrine corrupted by papal sophistry.</p>
      <p>They primarily accuse this corruption of the faith and doctrine concerning the unity and trinity of God, and finally concerning the Son of God, co-eternal and co-equal with God the Father, as if the primitive church and the most ancient bishops or doctors of the true church of God were sophists or papists and had imbued the church of God with sophistry from the times of the apostles.</p>
      <p>But it is well known that the doctors of the ancient church, before anyone had heard anything about the corruption of the Roman pontiff, taught in this way and the true church of God believed in this way, just as it is now taught and believed in the churches entrusted to our faith by God.</p>
      <p>Indeed, they do not want to appear to teach anything new, or that which was not used in the ancient church; for they understand that innovation is always odious to the prudent.</p>
      <p>However, while they abominate as sophistic our ancient doctrine, which we retain in our churches as delivered through the symbols from the word of God, they abundantly declare what kind of people they are and what good everyone thinks of them, for they evidently seek to revive the perverse dogmas of the old sectarians, like Arius and others, rather than to illustrate the simplicity and sincerity of the apostolic faith.</p>
      <p>And indeed we hear that a certain Genesius holds the most absurd doctrines of Servetus, which he also strives to spread to others.</p>
      <p>We hear that through certain Italians, the churches in Poland have been miserably disturbed by those skilled in concealing the poison of depraved doctrine, so that it is to be feared that this poison may spread more widely and infect neighboring regions, including yours, which God forbid.</p>
      <p>Therefore, your prudence, most gracious prince, understands that if such contentious and marvelous artificers of errors, concealers, and corrupters of the purity of faith come to those parts which the goodness of God has subjected to your excellency, all means must be taken to guard against such people, and indeed from the very beginning.</p>
      <p>Your remarkable piety undoubtedly remembers that admirable divine providence by which God has preserved you for many years not only from multiple plots and most severe persecutions but has also placed you over a vast kingdom by His divine grace and power alone and will undoubtedly retain you in this if you sincerely cultivate the Christian faith.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will continue to be grateful to God and truly a religious prince, which you will demonstrate by being entirely alien to those doctors and their doctrines, which were also rejected by the most sacred princes, as can be seen not only in ancient ecclesiastical history but also in that famous Justinian Code.</p>
      <p>Your region has the distinguished man, Johann Lusinius, who, while he was here with us, professed the orthodox doctrine, which we hope he still teaches and defends.</p>
      <p>Your notable piety will love, support, and listen to him and similar learned and pious men persevering in the orthodox catholic doctrine founded on the holy scriptures, not opening any lodging or place to others, lest they stir up dissensions and imbue the unwary with blasphemous opinions, and finally bring the curse of the Lord upon the whole kingdom.</p>
      <p>I also commend to your excellency the most distinguished man, Christoph Tretius, a Pole, a pious and learned man, who has long been engaged in our churches and is well instructed in the sincere truth, of whom all good men have conceived the best hope.</p>
      <p>If we can serve your excellent piety in any way, we who preach the word of Christ here in the church of Z端rich, we offer ourselves in all things to your excellency's service, and what I write here, I write with the consent and agreement of the other colleagues and dearest brothers, the ministers of the church of Z端rich.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, our Tretius will present some booklets and writings briefly noted for this reason, which we ask you to receive with a kind heart and to hold us commended to your excellency.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ, the only savior of the whole world, protect and preserve you, most illustrious prince, and your kingdom against all your enemies and bless you forever.</p>
      <p>Given in Z端rich, Switzerland, on the 3rd day of May in the year of Christ 1563. Your excellency's most devoted Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Z端rich.</p>
