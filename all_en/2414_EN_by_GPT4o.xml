      <p>It happened inconveniently, most holy man, that through those by whom I thought I could write abundantly to each of you there, I can now scarcely write three words, with my strength still worn out from a severe illness, so that neither my eyes nor my hands can perform their duties. I suffered from colic, a condition never before known to me; while I applied warm compresses to it, I stirred up bile around the liver, causing it to regurgitate into the stomach. Hence, jaundice followed, spreading throughout the whole body with a very intense fever, which has indeed left me now, but with my strength so depleted that I am amazed at myself. Therefore, my most beloved father Pellicanus and your other colleagues will forgive me if I do not write to them now; indeed, you too, most upright man, will pardon me for being compelled to be brief. I had begun to prepare some things against Westphalus; but meanwhile, a certain domestic storm here caught me beyond all my expectation, about which I cannot now say much. However, I have published a brief confession of my doctrine, which was attacked by slanders, a copy of which I send to you. This was again begun to be attacked by some in the public assembly of the ministers of this country, where I defended it. I have collected everything that was done; but they do not seem worthy of public light.</p>
      <p>They have nevertheless delayed me so much that I could do nothing against Westphalus. Thus we are still exercised, most holy man, thanks be to the Lord, yet not without fruit both for me and for many; for by this skirmish, our doctrine is now much more confirmed here than ever before, and those who tried to oppose it have been put to shame. Now under the press is the method of governing our church in England with its rites and ceremonies.</p>
      <p>Our Danish journey is presented in the German language by our Micronius. I can say no more now. Therefore, farewell and diligently commend me to the prayers of all your people, and bid them all greetings in my words, I wish. Hastily, in Emden, October 5, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, as much as I am, Johannes a Lasco.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I received one letter from you, and two from Pellicanus.</p>
      <p>To the most holy man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
