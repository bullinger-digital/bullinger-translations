      <p>Greetings, most illustrious and esteemed lord. As the old saying goes, it is convenient to build a house with neighbors, so our neighbors in Duelberg, relying on this convenience, wish for the long-interrupted preaching of the divine word to be restored by us. From the time when our beloved brother, Mr. Johannes Wederlin, was removed from Ramsen, the word of God has not been preached in the aforementioned Duelberg, nor has the Lord's Supper been conducted. Therefore, on the Wednesday just past, the new captain from the aforementioned Duelberg came to me with the town official and asked me to allow my assistant to ascend once a week and preach the word of God to them and, in due time, to conduct the Lord's Supper. With this request, they offered me the ecclesiastical ordinance of the Württemberg jurisdiction, sealed, according to which the prince wishes to direct the external worship in Duelberg, and for this reason, they presented it to us for inspection, so that we might deliberate upon it. I opened it, read it, and handed it to the deacon to read. We saw that it was not of our kind and that we could not, in good conscience, accept it. But because I suspect it was imposed upon the simple folk by certain courtiers—this suspicion arises because previously in Duelberg they were always free, and neither Wolfgang Mosel nor the soldiers were forced to dissent from our confession; Mr. Johannes Weckerli can testify to this, and furthermore, all who come to us from Duelberg visit our sermons, listen diligently to the word, and have agreed with us in all things thus far. Therefore, we are uncertain about what we should do; we implore your assistance and ask that your kindness confer on this matter with our dean, whether it should be proposed to the synod, or otherwise, what should be done, to inform us more certainly. Certainly, we are compelled against our will to be a burden to your dignity; but because it is the work of the Lord, which tends to the salvation of our neighbor, we have proposed the matter with greater confidence. At the same time, we give thanks to your kindness for all your benefits and pray to the Lord to keep you safe for a long time for His church and for us. Amen. From Stein am Rhein, daughter of Zürich, October 28, in the year of salvation 1554.</p>
      <p>Georg Wimpfer, your client.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and most sincere theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
