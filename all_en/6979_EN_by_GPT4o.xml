      <p>Today, what was reported several days ago, then almost disappeared, is confirmed again that the Alban has departed. The Venetians are often said to order their Jews to leave their territory; this severity lasts only until they have redeemed themselves with a monetary fine. They now also think this will happen; for the Venetians have now ordered them to leave within 15 months, as I wrote in my letters. The vice of Sodom has invaded Germany, indeed our neighborhood, and men of too much renown; the matter is quite evident to many; perhaps clearer reports will reach you from others than I am now allowed to write. The matter is lamentable in many ways, yet it does not lack a more hopeful expectation, as the Lord is shown to hasten to the end, because he hands over the impious to their desires, so that they may quickly fill their measure. Our Emperor has requested a loan from some less known cities, similar to Kempten; what he has obtained, I do not know; those who possess little cannot give much. They say he is still very ill; the papists insist on pushing him into their alliance and to attempt something against the heretics, which I would not doubt will happen if strength matches will.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich, my dear lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
