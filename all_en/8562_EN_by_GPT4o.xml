      <p>Greetings. You overwhelm me with such a multitude of benefits, most esteemed lord and godfather, that I can never have or express, let alone repay, sufficient thanks. For besides the other things you continually provide for me, you now also deign to honor me with such a distinguished and magnificent gift, namely the coin bearing the image of our Savior, for which I give as many thanks as I possibly can, and I pray to Him, whose image this represents, that He may embrace you with His favor forever and abundantly repay all things. At the same time, I also give thanks for all those letters and writings which you have shared with me. I return all of them to you through my brother and would have sent them back sooner if I had not been without a messenger. As for me, I am torn in my whole body from these waters, so much so that my hands and feet especially refuse to perform their duty for me. Therefore, if I am briefer in writing, you may attribute it partly to this cause, partly to my brother, as he will explain all our matters to you better in person. Perhaps, when this bathing is finished, if we are given enough time, I will see you and discuss all our matters with you in person. Although I do not have many things to do there, this one thing is enough for me, to see you and enjoy your presence. May the Lord grant us this more often! I commend you to Him.</p>
      <p>My wife and Herr Brunner, along with all our fellowship, greet you.</p>
      <p>From our baths in Baden, May 20, 1571. Yours in all things, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
