    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger soon doesn't know where his head is at because of the miserable war. He is increasingly entangled in political affairs and meanwhile suffers from persistent headaches. But the worst is yet to come!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He received four letters from Myconius [No. 2683, No. 2691, No. 2692, No. 2702], including the last one from December 4th. Thank you for the demonstrated diligence! Bullinger gave John Burcher a letter for Francisco [de Enzinas] yesterday. Burcher has business to attend to [at the Diet] in Baden. How long, is unclear. There is only the following to respond to Myconius' letters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Regarding the question about the field preachers: By name, Bullinger only knows [Theobald Thamer], the preacher of [Landgrave Philip] of Hesse. Enclosed is the letter addressed to Bullinger from this preacher [No. 2647] under the condition of the quickest possible return! Bullinger has responded to it in detail [No. 2675].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The reports about the Bohemians and Duke Maurice [of Saxony] are correct. On November 1st, the [Ernestine] Saxons had to suffer a defeat: 1200 men fell, and 500 were captured. This was reported by the Bernese according to a letter from Duke Christoph of Württemberg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] This afternoon, the people of Constance reported that a number of imperial cavalry will set up their winter quarters in the Hegau and on Lake Constance. If that's true, there will be more to come!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Enclosed is a letter from the people of Constance, which arrived yesterday, with the request for return with this [...] or the next messenger. Everything is in utmost danger! One must pray to God for protection!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Mayor [Johannes Haab] reports [with No. 2711 from the Diet] in Baden that [Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle, has induced the French King [Francis I] to withhold the money granted to the Protestants and to go to Paris for consultation, by informing the King that [Emperor] Charles V is seeking the hand of his daughter [Margaret of France]. The King's advisors will surely only intend the eradication of Christianity in Germany. Isn't this Emperor devilish? But the victor [Christ] lives, while the princes cannot be trusted!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The report about the 2000 killed imperial soldiers is just a false rumor. Also, [the Ernestine] Saxony could never have raised 6000 cavalry and 24000 infantry; therefore, the Bohemians would not have killed so many!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Jodocus [Kilchmeyer] has not attempted anything terrible in Bern. He is only advocating for the preservation of the doctrine established during the Bern Disputation [of 1528]. Perhaps the rumor is due to the dismissal of [Thomas] Grynaeus and his student [Peter Zeller]. However, these expulsions are not surprising in view of the song enclosed here, composed by the dismissed student (which Myconius should return with the current messenger)!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Today, the [Great] Council is meeting in Zurich. Bern and Basel want to have the protection of their faith assured by the Nine Places. However, the people of Zurich reject the request so that they do not have to defend the papal and idolatrous faith of the Nine Places in return. Strange that the people of Basel and Bern bring up this question!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Greetings, also to Enzinas and [Johannes] Gast. Bullinger cannot write more.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am so troubled by the turmoil and misery of the present war, my venerable Myconius, that I often do not know whether my head is still on my shoulders or being snatched away and whirled through the air! Affairs are succeeded by more affairs and increasingly entangle me. Meanwhile, I suffer from almost constant headaches. But it is all still nothing compared to what is yet to come and will come.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I received four letters from you. The last one you sent was on December 4th. You write diligently and most faithfully. I thank you for your diligence and faithfulness. The day before yesterday, I sent letters to Mr. Francisco through Mr. John Burcher, the Englishman. I do not know how long he will stay in Baden. He has business there. I know of nothing in your letters that requires a response except for these few things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You ask who the preachers in the camp are. I do not know. I know no one except Hessi by name. He sent me letters, which you see here, but on the condition that no one but you reads them and that you return them immediately. I replied to him with a rather long letter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The reports about the Bohemians and Duke Maurice are true. Additionally, the Saxons suffered a significant defeat. 1200 fell, and 500 were captured on the first of November. This is what the Bernese write here from Duke Christoph of Württemberg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Today at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the people of Constance write that several of the emperor's cavalry will have their winter quarters in Hegau and at Lake Constance. If this is true, you will see what will happen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>What they sent here the day before yesterday, you see here, but on the condition that you return it through this or the next messenger. You see everything is in the utmost danger. Let us pray to the Lord, doubting nothing about His protection.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Additionally, there is something else that our consul from Baden writes to me at this hour. There is a rumor that Granvelle has persuaded the French King to request the king's daughter in marriage for Charles (see if he is not the devil in the flesh!), so that he has ordered the money prepared for the Protestants to be stopped and kept for the present, indeed he is going to Paris to consult on what to do. His advisors will be all hands and feet in this, so that Christianity may be extinguished in Germany. But He lives, who has conquered! This will teach us to trust in princes and lords.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The reports about the 2000 imperial cavalry being killed are false: buy more lies! Saxony could never have gathered 6000 cavalry, 24000 infantry, so far from it, that so many could have been killed by the Bohemians.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Jodocus in Bern does not attempt anything terrible, but that the kind of doctrine asserted in the disputation is preserved pure and whole. I hear Grynaeus was dismissed along with a certain student. No wonder, for here you have a poem that this student wrote against us! You will return the poem with this. Because the young man was dismissed, perhaps he is said to be attempting terrible things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Now there is a council. Bern and Basel want to know from the Nine Places whether they want to protect them in their faith. Our people do not want the question. Reason: So that they do not have to tell them that they want to protect them in the pope's faith and idolatry. I do not know what will happen. However, I am surprised that your people and the Bernese propose this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Farewell. I cannot write more. A thousand times greetings to Dryander, Gastius, etc. December 8th, 1546. Bullinger.</p>
