    <p xml:id="regest1">Laments the great number of heresies and wishes for a synod of the Evangelicals, where their doctrine is laid out for future generations. Among them, many are uncertain in faith, become unruly, and deny - like the Sadducees once did - the resurrection after death; given the compliance of the youth, it is to be feared that they will soon be regarded as pagans. Bullinger or [Theodor] Bibliander should ensure that [the Panarion of] Epiphanius is translated into Latin, in order to counteract the toleration of superstitious church practices - now after the end of the sacrament dispute; his colleague Dionysius Melander will report further. Many are expecting Bullinger's gospel commentaries and the second part of Bibliander's Hebrew grammar; if he would continue with the interpretation of the prophets, this would be particularly fruitful for the church. Requests to receive the letter in good spirit.</p>

      <p>Grace from God through Christ in the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>I experience daily, my most learned Bullinger, just as in a large body there is always something that offers complaint and requires the hand of a healer, so it is also in the church, the great house and kingdom of Christ. Before Christ was born, according to Augustine, there were twenty-eight heresies. The age of Augustine had many more. Certainly, if anyone were to count the errors of our fermented age, concerning faith, the Trinity, baptism, penance, Christ as man, Christ as God, the sacraments, etc., they would never find fewer. This makes me, in my weakness, always have on my lips that saying of Polycarp: "God, into what times have you placed us!" Once, those whom the fear of God did not restrain were restrained by synods. For many years, the church has had no salutary synod, and yet the diseases of this time truly demand a remedy, when there is so much complaint and evil. And even if this were not the case, it would still be fitting for all of us who have embraced the renewed doctrine of the gospel to sometimes meet, so that we might hand down to posterity a certain and clear type of doctrine and a certain form of the church.</p>
      <p>Satan, as he is cunning, stirs up many here among us, under the pretext of our paroxysms, so that, while they believe now this, now that, with utmost inconsistency, they may eventually believe nothing at all and become a people of debauchery. It is dreadful that once among the people of God there were those who, under the title of Sadducees, were most unjust, denying another life after this one; but it is much more dreadful that in such great light of the gospel many are found similar to the Sadducees, indulging in luxury, making nothing of the resurrection after this life, indeed mocking it. To these evils is added the fact that the youth, inclined to follow anything, is miserably neglected and entirely perishes, so that unless the most merciful God kindly looks upon our most wretched affairs and has mercy on us, we must fear that we will soon have paganism instead of Christianity, so that the song once used among the ancients, when the praise of former times was overthrown along with the republic and the liberty of the Roman people, can most aptly be sung about us, namely, the age of our parents, worse than our grandfathers, has produced us, more wicked, soon to give birth to a generation more corrupt.</p>
      <p>Now, since you, most learned Bullinger, have always been regarded by me in our age as the one through whom the Lord, as a chosen instrument of His church, has provided much, and is undoubtedly going to use you for greater things, but perhaps after that sacramental paroxysm is over, Satan may try to stir up another, far more harmful to the church of Christ, namely ceremonial among us, as the greatest hindrance to things being established for the better, I would ask you, by Him who is to judge the living and the dead, to perform here the work of the most faithful evangelist and render your ministry fully approved. You will do this if you ensure, through yourself or Bibliander, that Epiphanius, the diligent and faithful writer of the histories of the primitive church, is not only sincerely translated from Greek into Latin, but also illustrated with notes, so that at least those admirers of ceremonies, who contend that nothing should be denied to the weak at the beginning, but also to the wicked perpetually, for the sake of peace and some unknown hope, may be shamed, not understanding that the wicked, if anything is given to them, will immediately abuse our kindness to the subversion of the truth, thinking only of how they can again establish their superstition. Dionysius Melander, our colleague, will write to you about the same matter, with whom I now preach the same Christ among the people of Kassel. For the fact that he has not written to you so far, do not blame him; for he has not attended the fairs of Frankfurt for several years, nor has he been able to be at home due to the frequent assemblies, which he must always attend with our most illustrious prince.</p>
      <p>Your commentaries on the four gospels are eagerly awaited by all. There are also many among us who urgently demand the second book of Bibliander's Hebrew grammar with commentaries on the holy language, desperately wishing that it may at last come to light. And indeed, as far as my judgment goes, it will contribute no small fruit to the church of Christ if he continues in these and does not cease in explaining the prophets.</p>
      <p>Now farewell in the Lord Jesus, most learned Bullinger, and kindly consider my audacity, with which I have not hesitated to trouble your most learned ears with my unlettered letters, relying on your humanity.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Kassel, on the sixth day of September in the year 1538. Your most devoted Johannes Pistorius, Niddanus, preacher of Kassel.</p>
      <p>To the best and most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my superior and most dear and esteemed, in Zurich, etc.</p>
