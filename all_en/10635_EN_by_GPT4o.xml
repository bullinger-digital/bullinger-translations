      <p>Faithful, dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>In good faith, I want to let you know that last Sunday, the son of the old Rubli from Dachsen came to me and requested that I baptize a child for him. When he provided me with the names of the child's godfather and godmother, he had chosen as a godmother Junker Hans Wilhelm's daughter, who is a nun in Diessenhofen and is currently staying with her father in Laufen for six weeks. I then asked him, since he had chosen her, to go to her immediately and tell her to choose another in her place, as it is not appropriate for her to raise children from the baptismal font. This has now happened, and her sister has been chosen in her place. Because of this, dear lord and brother, Junker Hans Wilhelm has become upset and has taken it badly, accusing me before God and the world as if I had acted improperly. I attribute this to his ignorance, and just as he previously stirred up trouble against the mayor and the church community, so it is again now. However, I believe I have not acted improperly, other than fulfilling my duty and not showing favoritism, and that all those who despise our Christian religion (as the nun does) should have no fellowship with us in hearing God's word, attending church, or receiving the holy sacraments. We should also have no fellowship with them in matters concerning religion. This was also decided once in synod, and Augustine is of the same opinion, as cited in "De consecratione distinctio 4: 'Vos ante omnia' etc." Therefore, my dear and faithful brother, God sends me a new conflict every day. I am troubled by people's ignorance, especially since I have preached here for 11 years and there is no higher understanding than to act so disorderly and to be so hostile to the servants of God's word.</p>
      <p>Let me and my office always be entrusted to you in faith, as I now and always will place my highest trust in you. May the gracious God come to our aid and comfort. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Laufen on the 23rd day of June, 1535.</p>
      <p>Peter Schnyder, your willing brother.</p>
      <p>To my trusted, dear lord and brother Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
