      <p>Greetings. Most illustrious Bullinger, I earnestly ask you, to have the second letter addressed to Capito delivered to Basel by some trustworthy messenger, so that it may promptly reach Strasbourg from there. He asked me in Basel to also send him a copy of my letter to Luther. For I do not know what they suspect, as if I had not given enough credence to their first report, about which I never doubted that it was both true and sincere. Therefore, I am taking care to remove the worst plague of suspicions among friends and at the same time redeem my own trustworthiness. Thus, we must resist the efforts of Satan.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my honor, and do me this favor.</p>
      <p>Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, again.</p>
