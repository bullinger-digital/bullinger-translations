      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote briefly, reverend father in Christ, what I wanted you to know; the summary of those letters was this: The acts of the Davos assemblies have been confirmed anew in full. The opposing party spared neither expenses nor efforts; but in vain.</p>
      <p>For they were answered that the acts of the assemblies must be firm and valid, especially since nothing is done in them except by the decision and consent of all the communities in the Three Leagues. Thus, the adversaries departed with the matter unresolved.</p>
      <p>Captain Hercules von Salis conducted himself excellently and very vigorously, although he defended the opposing cause of Dietegen von Salis, the Roman governor in the courts. Our consul Tscharner also conducted himself excellently and very well.</p>
      <p>The brothers in Valtellina are vigilant and indeed rightly so; for they see with whom they have to deal. Our people are well informed about that school; I hope that the efforts of a few can be countered in due time. The imperial envoys at the next assemblies among our people did not gain much favor; their demands were sharply answered by our people, as I hear from others.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that once all matters are settled by agreement between the two kings, the pope will urge Philip to reclaim Valtellina; certainly, many seem to foresee or at least fear this. Ferdinand and the princes do not yet agree well regarding religion; it has been written to the royal envoy from Augsburg that Ferdinand took it very badly that the German princes refused to be part of the Corpus Christi procession, considering it to be an antichristian parade. It is reported from Constantinople that the health of the Turkish emperor is very afflicted and that he was recently forced to show himself to his people; otherwise, there was a danger that Constantinople would be plundered by soldiers who were already convinced that the emperor was dead. These are the things I have now, which, although they are of very little importance, I thought should not be omitted, since I had something to give (for my wife came to visit you for the sake of seeing her parent). Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all yours, as happily as possible.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 5, 1559.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>All of ours send you greetings, especially our consul Tscharner; the other is absent in Valtellina.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
