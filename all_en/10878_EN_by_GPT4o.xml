    <p xml:id="regest1">Your assurance that the agreement [of the Zurich theologians] to the Confessio Tetrapolitana does not detract from the [First Helvetic] Confession has relieved him, yet his concern remains that new, unclear formulations might be interpreted by the Lutherans as concessions and used as a pretext for further demands, as also feared by the opinions presented by [Ulrich] Chelius and criticized by Bullinger of the Wittenberg and Strasbourg [theologians]. Greetings. [Simon] Sulzer and [Peter] Kunz have traveled [to a synod] in Yverdon. Further details can be reported by Erasmus [Ritter].</p>

      <p>Health and a tranquil conscience through Christ Jesus, our Savior.</p>
      <p>I have read both of your apologies, dearest friends and brothers in Christ, which have somewhat cheered my spirit, affected by sorrow. For previously, I thought you had fully adhered to the confession of the four cities; but now I understand from you that it has been accepted only insofar as it does not detract from the Basel confession. Nor are we so alienated from all civility, not to mention Christian concord (which Christ so often commends to his followers), that we cannot tolerate the four cities confessing thus about the Lord's Supper, especially since in the matter itself both parties agree. But in the meantime, I consider it very important, both before and now, to weigh whether it is safe for us and our descendants to confess in this manner, as those cities have confessed. For even if they have added an apology, in which those things that are more obscurely stated are clarified, it would seem more beneficial for us and our descendants if our confession were made with such significant, open, simple, and clear words that it would need no exposition, and, to speak more plainly, if we confessed in the same way as we have previously taught and written on this matter. For, as it is commonly said: "He who confesses rightly is given a right penance." Unless this is done, the same danger awaits us that the four cities fear, namely, that someone might arise who would suspect their previous confession if they were to confess in our manner; thus, we must also ensure that if we subscribe to their confession, which does not correspond to ours (as far as the form of speaking is concerned), we do not give our adversaries an opportunity to slander us, nor let a greater discord arise from a poorly patched concord, which is very likely. For we still remember well enough what kind of rumor was spread everywhere by the Saxons after the Marburg meeting about a Lutheran victory. Furthermore, we must also consider whether we are beginning to grant small things to the Lutherans in such a way that eventually, when it comes to a general council, they will demand greater things from us, which my mind clearly predicts will happen, given that the Wittenbergers and Strasbourgers allow more to the papists - if indeed their writings, which Chelius presented here under their title, are theirs - than can be proven by solid scriptures. Of this matter, I call you both as witnesses, but especially you, my Bullinger, who at that time, in a writing sent to the late Berthold, testified that you did not approve of their plan with a most Christian confession. These and other things concerning that concord I consider should be considered according to my slowness, not doubting in the meantime, given your sagacity, that you consider far more. Nor are these things written by me because I doubt anything about your faith and constancy, but to add a spur to horses running of their own accord. Therefore, beloved brothers in Christ, I ask you to bear with me speaking as foolishly as I may and to think that sometimes even a gardener has spoken appropriately. As far as that Christian concord is concerned, we are prepared to do everything that can generate solid and constant peace, and we will pray to God together with you that, with all dissensions and hostilities removed from his people, he may make us all unanimous and concordant in unfeigned love. Amen. Amen.</p>
      <p>Megander, together with his fellow ministers, greets you and yours. Sulzer, my colleague, would have greeted you too, had he not traveled abroad with Kunz to Yverdon to instruct ministers on how the word of the Lord should be sown in new churches. In turn, greet on my behalf your entire assembly of Christian muses. Farewell happily in the Lord.</p>
      <p>8th day of June, in the year 1536, in Bern.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Rhellicanus.</p>
      <p>You can inquire about the state of new matters from Erasmus (who delivered this to you).</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious lords Heinrich Bullinger and Leo Jud, beloved friends and brothers in Christ. Zurich.</p>
