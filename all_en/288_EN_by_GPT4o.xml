      <p>Special gracious, dear sir. The time is too short for me to write to you about the situation in Konstanz, but I have instructed Clausen von Walesselen, the letter carrier, to inform you of everything that has happened to us and what we are aware of. May the Lord grant grace and provide better means, and soon; for it is nearing the end, as you will hear. With this, yours, Marcel Dietrich, etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. [Fall of Konstanz 1548.]</p>
