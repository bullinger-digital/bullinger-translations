    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices that Blarer also appreciated Albert Hardenberg. Has read Gwalther's [planned] introduction to Zwingli's works; it does not need to be changed. Bullinger will follow Blarer's advice to be cautious when drafting Zwingli's biography. Bullinger will keep secret that [Georg Frölich] is the author of the "Speculum" directed [against Andreas Osiander]; in Wittenberg - according to [Wolfgang] Musculus - Osiander's "Coniecturae" was laughed at. Subsequently, he transcribes Philipp [Melanchthon's] letter [No. 1966]. May God protect him. Luther is truly a quarrelsome person; he is possessed by Saul's spirit and has banished or persecuted many followers [of Christ]; the edification of the church is not his concern; if Blarer receives Luther's [“Kurtz bekentnis”] directed against the [Zürichers], Bullinger would be grateful for its transmission; Bullinger already possesses the book by Justus Menius against the Anabaptists, which is provided with a preface by Luther. Blarer [probably] knows that Cochläus answered Bullinger's "[Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum...] Responsio" in an unlearned and impudent manner with a "Replica [brevis]"; Bullinger will briefly respond to it on occasion; Cochläus has also written a ["Sacerdotii ac sacrificii... defensio adversus... Musculi arrosiones"] against Musculus, in which he attacks him for a letter written in [1536] in Frankfurt by the [Augsburg] delegation (if only Bucer had remained silent!); Cochläus also attacks Musculus' commentary on Matthew, which prompted Bullinger to consult this writing; however, he had to find that Musculus is completely "bucerized", rejecting the orthodox interpretation of "Hoc est corpus meum" as "This means my body" that has been guaranteed since ancient times, and like Bucer distinguishes between offering and presenting signs; yet Luther's interpretation, "With the bread, Christ's body is truly and essentially offered to you," is not attested in the Early Church; Bullinger will write to Musculus, whom he likes very much, regarding this. He further wishes that [Melanchthon] escapes his enemies, finds a refuge, and flees from corruption like Lot; whether Heidelberg would be suitable for him remains open; Bullinger fears Melanchthon's timidity. May Blarer continue to take care of Bullinger's still so young and instructive-needing nephew [Josua]. Bullinger loves the learned, pious, and modest [Matthias] Schenk from the heart. "Amsladorf" [Nikolaus von Amsdorf] behaves like a bishop and is accordingly possessed by devils. [Francis I] has informed the Lucerners about the peace concluded with [Charles V.]; he is to return the territories to Duke [Charles III.] of Savoy and, as long as [Charles V.] lives, renounce Milan; the prisoners are to be exchanged mutually and the exiled allowed to return; [Charles V.] is to give Duke [Charles II.] of Orléans his daughter [Maria of Spain] along with the Netherlands; if [the marriage takes place], Milan and Burgundy will belong to them after the emperor's death; [Francis I.] is now moving against [Henry VIII.] of England towards Boulogne. Bullinger sends back the [borrowed letter] part. [Written on] the eve of the thirteenth anniversary of the [Kappel] defeat.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I rejoice greatly, most beloved brother and esteemed lord in Christ, that the talent of Mr. Albert could be so well appreciated by you, for he truly loves and seeks Christ from the heart; may He preserve him to the end for the glory of the divine name and the safety of the churches!</p>
      <p>I have reread Mr. Gwalther's preface to Zwingli's works after he had left, and I truly see that Gwalther has not handled this matter immodestly, and therefore nothing at all should be said about this matter if it is necessary to expunge or change it; thus, nothing seems to need changing.</p>
      <p>In describing Zwingli's life, I will apply the utmost diligence with God's invoked help, so that I say nothing in praise or hatred of anyone from any private affection, but that I may say all things truly and prudently, moderately and rightly for the edification of the good. Pray to the Lord that He may be with us and guide both our intellect and pen. I thank your charity for the brotherly admonition.</p>
      <p>Regarding the author of that most unfortunate "Speculum," believe that the secret entrusted to me will remain buried with me. Mr. Musculus writes that his "Conjectures" were laughed at in Wittenberg.</p>
      <p>There is no need for you to pray that I conceal from you what Philip has given us; for nothing is so secret to me that I would not reveal it to you, my dearest and most intimate brother.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I transcribe the letter, but with the condition that you keep it to yourself and your trusted ones: [......] You have Philip's letter, from which it is easy to gather what Philip's disposition is; may the Lord preserve him!</p>
      <p>Luther, however, seeks not peace but perpetual war, fighting for his own glory, not Christ's. He is possessed by Saul's spirit and exiles and persecutes many good men who follow the blessed son of David, but in the end, that proud spirit will fall by its own sword (alas!).</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on him! This man has nothing moderate; he does not care for the weak, nor for the edification of the churches, he is entirely driven by fury. You will do a favor if you send me what you have received from him, namely what he has written against us; for we have only the book by Justus Menius with Luther's preface, written against us under the pretext of the Anabaptist name. You know that Cochläus has opposed my "Response" with a "Replica" (as he calls it), which is not only unlearned but also exceedingly impudent. I will respond briefly when I have the leisure. Everywhere and on all sides are wars and battles; but we are cheerful and of a tranquil mind in Christ Jesus, our Lord, to whom be praise and glory forever. The same adversary of mine has written a book against Musculus, our friend. In it, he attacks the arts and some secret plans and acts written by the delegates sent to Luther in Frankfurt. I am truly sorry if they have fraudulently conducted the matter of concord, truly most unfortunate.</p>
      <p>If only Bucer had remained silent! Cochläus accuses Musculus of what he wrote about the Eucharist in Matthew, and it moved me to read it myself. But, oh God, how I wish he had written more purely and cautiously! He is entirely "bucerized" and brings forth things that he will never teach with any scriptures. How coldly he refutes the orthodox and simplest and safest interpretation of the Lord's words, preserved from the times of the apostles until now: "This is my body," that is: it is a sign of my body, a memory of the body, it signifies the body. From where does he bring forth that some signs are offering and others are presenting? Which of the ancients ever mentioned offering signs?</p>
      <p>This is a modern invention of Bucer. Luther's interpretation is not of the ancient church: "With the bread, the true and essential body of Christ is given to you." But that good man has all these things in his commentaries, which that malicious and malevolent old man greatly exaggerates. I will write some things about these to Musculus, whom I love more tenderly, and therefore I am more grieved that he has handled that simple matter so obscurely and with some ambiguous reasoning, following Luther in some things, Bucer in others.</p>
      <p>As for Philip, I wish he could be freed from those most ferocious hyenas and beasts and cling to a safer place. May the Lord deliver him! Let us pray for him faithfully, I beseech you. Lot will be brought out sometime, so that the pride and arrogance of some may be punished. I do not know whether Heidelberg is advisable for the best man; but the Lord will not forsake His own; I only fear for his timidity.</p>
      <p>Take care of my nephew from my brother, I beseech you; he is a young man who needs admonitions and rebukes unless he changes his mind. I bind myself to you and yours in return for equal services.</p>
      <p>Your Schenkius is a learned, pious, and modest man, whom I love from the heart. Greet him and have him commended.</p>
      <p>Amsladorff has been made a bishop, therefore he exercises episcopal duties. All bishops must be possessed by devils; therefore, he is too. He is the author of many evils in the church; may God repay him!</p>
      <p>For the sake of peace, the king has sent his envoys with credentials to the people of Lucerne, as the commanders who left the servants, and has announced that a good peace has been made. The king is to return the land to the Duke of Savoy, withdraw from Milan during the emperor's lifetime, be a friend and companion of the emperor, release all prisoners, and allow his exiles (banned ones) to return; the emperor is to do the same, be a friend of the king, release the prisoners, allow the exiles to return, and give his daughter to the Duke of Orléans along with the Netherlands up to the Rhine. When they have the princes together, Milan and the County of Burgundy shall be theirs after the emperor's death, etc. But since the Englishman does not want peace, the king moves down with all his forces to Boulogne, to drive him away by force or however he can; there it will still be a matter of snorting. What if? You understand the rest.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet Welser, whose fragment I send herewith; I give thanks. October 10th, the day before the 13th anniversary of the Tigurini being slaughtered by the Five Cantons, 1544.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his incomparable brother.</p>
