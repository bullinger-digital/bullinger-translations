    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter and praises his kindness, which stands out from the arrogance on the Lutheran side. Has thoroughly studied Bullinger's interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11 as well as Oecolampadius's "Dialogus"; since he shares their doctrine of the Lord's Supper, his brother-in-law [Bleikard Sindringer] does not help him out of his current position. Due to his poverty, he cannot afford [Pellican's Bible commentaries], but he is sufficiently instructed in their doctrine from the works of Bullinger, Zwingli, and Oecolampadius. Complains about the attitude of a majority of the preachers.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>It cannot be expressed how much your letter has delighted me, most learned Bullinger. For I have recognized in it the ease and humanity, which you preach everywhere in your writings, and also teach through deeds and life, something we see in few today. For I have experienced that Lutheran arrogance in the persecution of Karlstadt, which still endures today. These men seem to think they alone are wise, and I wish they would be wise for the glory of God and the salvation of their neighbor! I truly thank you as much as I can, for not disdaining to address me, a man of the lowest condition, with your letters. I will pray to the Lord that He may increase rather than diminish that mind in you, as we almost observe happening through our own fault, so that those great ones (as they promise themselves, as far as it appears), who consider you almost as heretics, may be defeated and ashamed in their conscience, return to themselves, and act and write more thoughtfully. For truly, as you write, pride rules among most, not humility. Also, among us, because of them, the word of the Lord is poorly heard by adversaries, although they too admit they are worthy of severe criticism. And I fear too much - may the Lord avert the ominous fate - that a severe plague from God may avenge this immense ingratitude of ours. But among you, as I hear, that ancient sincerity and humanity is cultivated, which I greatly rejoice, that there is a place where truth is loved.</p>
      <p>I have read the eleventh chapter to the Corinthians in your work two or three times and also the "Dialogus" of blessed memory Oecolampadius, which still stands firm and will remain among men of more sincere judgment. Let Philippus scorn as much as he wants; he alone, as it seems to me, opposes. Perhaps they see that they cannot reject so many illustrious places of the ancient authors and for that reason refrain from writing, except as much as they secretly bite in books published under another title. May God give them a healthier mind and you perseverance in good! This opinion of mine about the supper is the only cause, which my brother-in-law does not rescue me from this mill. Nor do I desire a splendid condition, but I wish to live in seclusion and with letters, wherever the Lord may offer. Meanwhile, I will live content with this labor, until the Lord places another province on my shoulders, and I will delight myself with reading the Bibles I have and your little works, whenever leisure is provided. The lack of resources prevents me from buying those greater works of Pellican, too adverse a goddess. And I have been sufficiently instructed in that doctrine by the grace of God from your writings, Zwingli's and Oecolampadius's, whom I pray, that He may strengthen you and all those among you and everywhere on earth, who seek the glory of the Father and Christ with a sincere heart, so that they may teach and live constantly without any fear. For there are already many, to whom James rightly says: "You have faith, and I have works" [James 2:18], whom the Lord may enlighten.</p>
      <p>I have written these things to you with a candid mind, as if lamenting our unfortunate times. For you know how most of the preachers who profess the gospel conduct themselves and what they seek. I ask you to consider these my writings kindly, for relying on your goodness, I have written more extensively.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, 4th day before the calends of April.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted</p>
      <p>Heinrich Sellarius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished herald of piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent pastor of Zurich, his most esteemed lord, greetings.</p>
