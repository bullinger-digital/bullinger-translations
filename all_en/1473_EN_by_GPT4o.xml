      <p>Most illustrious man, the brothers from Italy inform me that a rumor has spread there that the Bishop of Chur is going to the council. This matter would cause great inconvenience. I have urged my people, among whom I live, to recognize this; therefore, they have given orders to their messengers who are about to set out for the small assembly, that they should by no means allow the bishop to go there. I wanted to inform you about this matter, so that you might also press the people of Chur from your side, even with public authority (if it seems appropriate), to prevent this evil from happening, a truly great evil; for the Lords of the Grisons would be forced to submit to the yoke of the decrees of Trent, if they sent the bishop there, who would agree and subscribe. Shortly, I will have other news from Trent, which I will send. Farewell and greetings to you with your whole family, school, and church. Pray to God for me.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, on the Ides of November.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
