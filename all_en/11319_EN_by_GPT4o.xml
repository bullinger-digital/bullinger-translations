      <p>Greetings and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>Everything is still quiet, and it is not known what the Emperor will decide. Some seem to hope that the Nuremberg Diet can be seized with good prospects by some through this conference. We also wish for this to happen, yet we believe it less likely; for we deny that those scandal-filled agreements are evangelical, especially when it is not a matter of giving an account of faith, but of discussing by what means you might make friendship with thieves and robbers. Meanwhile, we are scarcely as concerned about ourselves as we are about you and your churches; for we fear that some of yours might be dragged or enticed into this business as well.</p>
      <p>If this were to happen with common consent, there would be less danger; but if it happens with a new division, it is to be feared that many evils may arise from one, which may the Lord avert. I might add other things with the next messenger; for everything is still uncertain.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell, most beloved in the Lord, and always love us. Brother Konrad and all the fellow ministers greet you most earnestly. I bid your wife, mother, and daughters, and all that is yours to be safe.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, May 24, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>I commend to you Jakob, who was unjustly expelled from Thurgau and is now with you; for he is truly good and has suffered great injustice.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the notably pious bishop of ZÃ¼rich, my dearest brother.</p>
