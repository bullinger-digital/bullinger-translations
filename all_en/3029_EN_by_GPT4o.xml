      <p>Greetings. I received your letter through a young man, who appears to be of great promise, and through whom I also return the readings. I am not greatly surprised by Satan's craftiness in Poland, as it is a very common trick of the deceiver; what concerns me more is the king's either pretense or open treachery against Christ, although even so, the rising kingdom of Christ will not be destroyed or oppressed, for it is founded on the rock and will stand even against the gates of hell. Indeed, I do not doubt that these efforts of the impious will contribute to the illustrious advancement of sincere faith and piety. Nevertheless, it is our duty to support our brothers, who are placed in trials and struggles, with serious and fervent prayers. The Roman Antichrist pleases me in that he is openly bloodthirsty and wicked without hypocrisy, yet I fear that he may either corrupt the confederates with money, or that among us there may be those who are slaves to glory and gold, who will serve his favors to the horrible scandal of the Church of Christ, and that the magistrate may become more lukewarm in punishing such things. Indeed, some seem to be paving the way for this plan not in a common manner among us, while they make citizens too familiar with them through banquets and other interactions and services. We seriously declaim against them and urge the magistrate to oppose these beginnings, lest we all become involved in the nefarious crime of hypocrisy and impiety, if from our own body, while we do not watch seriously enough, they are joined in alliance with him, whom we have for so many years truly declared to be the open enemy of Christ and the saints, Satan the angel, etc. The people of Ensisheim are murmuring against the margrave, and as much as they can, they are hindering the instituted reformation; but I hope in vain, unless they wish to stir up an open, dangerous, and very bloody war. I receive nothing from the Netherlands nor about the progress of the Diet of Regensburg, nor about the dealings between the people of Geneva and Bern and what outcome it recently had at Payerne. I am greatly distressed about the people of Glarus. In Sion, a sufficiently large door is open for the profession of the gospel, as it is increasingly allowed to speak and read freely each day what is fitting for piety, but there are also many and very hostile adversaries who turn in all directions to exclude Christ from the country. However, He is more powerful and is not broken by human forces and schemes.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all your people. Basel, October 5, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
