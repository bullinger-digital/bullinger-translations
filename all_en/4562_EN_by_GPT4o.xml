      <p>S. I am greatly thankful to you for the news you shared, which, although they are all signs of much greater evils soon to follow, it will not be unfruitful for the faithful of Christ to know them, so that they may more and more arm themselves against the final efforts of the prince of this world and his accomplice, and timely assume the whole armor of God, and with the shield of faith cautiously receive and extinguish all the poisonous and fiery darts of that evil one.</p>
      <p>Indeed, great and greater struggles than most think await us, in which, however, with unbroken spirits, we will easily be victorious, having already obtained victory through Him who said: "In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer. I have overcome the world."</p>
      <p>As soon as I hear something further from Württemberg, it shall not remain hidden from you as before. The bishop of Laibach has departed from Constance the next day; it is believed he has accomplished his mission for which he was there, and the hail has been cooked. They have serious mandates for the bishop of Constance, that he should think and move to Constance into the city and reside there; otherwise, another will be placed in the city. This is all nothing but a made-up scarecrow; for he was not at all happy before, except that he might come back into the city with authority; otherwise, he had spoken so highly against it that it would have been ridiculous for him to stand by it, which he can now do with honor, because in every oath the authority of the superior is excepted; what good he will accomplish in the city will soon be known. He now begins to write to the abbots and provosts in the name of the pope, each one, what contribution he should make to cover the costs of the council; I have from one who was sitting at the table with the abbot of Rheinau when the mandate came to him that he should pay 400 florins.</p>
      <p>And yet there is a lot of another scarecrow behind it, as it is generally believed, namely that they are gathering a strong, powerful sinew of war under this pretext, so that they can conduct the war persistently; otherwise, it is not necessary to impose a tax because of the council; everyone must otherwise bear his own costs; but they can deceive all their matters with speed and false appearance in the hope that it will not be immediately noticed. In summary: the devil sits on basilisk eggs; if he hatches them, we will see strange birds; utinam subventanea pariant! The matter of Ötingen and Schertlis' span is supposed to be tolerated in all things.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hoser writes to me from Augsburg now twice in succession, rejoicing greatly that he has come into acquaintance with you, reports nothing new, except that it is completely quiet with them; they have the most unrest with the risen merchants, whose downfall many other poor, pious people, from whom they have taken money, must pay dearly. There is much and great lamentation and complaint, etc.</p>
      <p>From Antwerp, someone came up these days, reporting to me that the persecution has neither goal nor measure; but they no longer burn the Christians with slow torture; it has caused many waves of unrest. However, they make a trap for them, that is, when they catch one, they quietly seize him, put him in a prison, thrust him into a barrel, seal it, and then pour water into the barrel, so that he must drown; afterwards, before daybreak, the executioner takes the barrel out, opens it, cuts off the drowned man's head, and sticks it high on a pole; this is now quite common, and many lose a neighbor whom they think is in the field; so he is executed. Ah, Lord God, vindicate the blood of your saints and soon put an end to the lamentation. Meanwhile, turn us to you, and we will be turned with all our heart, so that, having broken through all these almost insurmountable difficulties and temptations and having become superior to all human affairs, we may happily strive directly to you in that heavenly truly safe and tranquil security. Farewell, my soul, with all yours, and commend us constantly and earnestly to the ruler and savior of the whole world. Our people, whom you know, greet you.</p>
      <p>Winterthur, December 1, 1560.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius Blarer, truly yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and most dear brother.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
