      <p>Greetings. You will certainly inform the most distinguished gentlemen, the consuls and wise senators, that the only thing being pursued is the establishment of a Jesuit college in Rhaetia. The Jesuits, an ill-omened kind of monks, who barely tolerate being called monks to avoid envy, surpass all monks in hypocrisy, wickedness, audacity, and malice. They are entirely focused on oppressing the gospel and gradually restoring the fallen papacy, leading people into Antichristian captivity. Therefore, they do not wear the prodigious habit of monks.</p>
      <p>They claim to be named after Jesus, the only savior, so that they are not impiously named by men; thus, they proclaim Jesus with their lips but hate him in their hearts. They teach for free and wonderfully insinuate themselves into the minds of people. Many of them are learned, sharp, and eloquent.</p>
      <p>I am sending here some information about their beginnings; but see to it that you return it safely and securely after eight days. King Ferdinand the Emperor favors them above others. They have already begun to nest in Vienna and Ingolstadt, and I do not doubt that they communicate many plans with the Pagans and the Abbot of St. Gallen, and I hear that many things are being secretly attempted among them regarding the establishment of a school. This is certain: if you once receive those frogs, Rhaetia will never have solid peace. Therefore, be vigilant and seriously do what befits men of God.</p>
      <p>I beg you to send this very letter to Friedrich von Salis; I could not write to him.</p>
      <p>My son wrote from Tarvisio via Augsburg that he sent letters to Friedrich, in which he included all his affairs.</p>
      <p>I would like to ask him to ensure they are carefully delivered to me; for I understand that they deal with financial matters. I am returning the most carnal cardinal articles; we have seen other articles written in Italian, which Laelius interpreted for me. They are great scoundrels.</p>
      <p>Our assembly is being convened in Baden to begin on December 10th. It will deal with the people of Basel regarding the grain, which they partly allow to be transported to us, etc. I could barely write this.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 24, 1559. Greet the friends.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur among the Rhaetians, his compatriot and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
