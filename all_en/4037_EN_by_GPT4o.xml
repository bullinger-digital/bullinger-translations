      <p>Greetings, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>Since I have no one who is coming directly to Zürich, behold, I write through Basel, at least so you may see that I am mindful of Bullinger, with whom I now desire to confer more than ever before, especially with everyone praising what was established or declared at the Frankfurt assembly regarding the supper. You would be amazed if you knew how many and who agree and affirm that now only the form of words is being disputed. Who knows if before winter, which I think I will spend elsewhere, I might visit you? Perhaps it will happen. The end of the assembly is approaching.</p>
      <p>The churches are to have peace according to the Passau assembly; the rest is not worth writing. No mortal is more hostile to the Emperor than he who speaks with you, especially after I approached his son, and the Cardinal of Augsburg, who is now closest to the Emperor, rages against me, especially after the publication of a booklet, which I will include with the letters. But I despise both through the grace of God, as well as the Pope.</p>
      <p>I have written against the new catalog published in Latin and Italian, and I have published my four dialogues against Hosius; I would send them to you if I had a messenger. I do not cease from my labors, whatever they may be.</p>
      <p>If only your people would cease to think so poorly of me, etc.; for I do not wish to enter that sea, I will only say that I hope they have believed lightly; I am certainly sustained by a clear conscience. I indeed have more to write, but not in such letters that come by a long circuit. If only we all thought about concord.</p>
      <p>Greet for me the family, the school, and the church; help me with your prayers. Tübingen, August 3, 1559.</p>
      <p>Brother Vergerius.</p>
