      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, honorable, wise, gracious, dear sir, I have received your letter concerning Master Rudolf Weber and am of good, willing disposition to help him to the best of my ability in view of his skill, piety, and your request. However, it has not been possible so far due to the many affairs with which my lords have been and still are burdened. But as soon as it is possible, I will ensure that work is done in this matter so that he may know what he should rely on. Please understand this as my good intention.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Greet Master Werner Steiner and other good gentlemen and companions for me.</p>
      <p>In Bern on the 11th day of July 1534.</p>
      <p>Your well-wishing H. Jakob von Wattenwyl.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, my gracious, dear sir.</p>
