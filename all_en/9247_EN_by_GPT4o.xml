      <p>God with us. Beloved son, I thank you and Susanna for the good carp, which is very rare for me, but pleasant; for there is no fish here, etc. Also for the little goat, which I sent to the childbearing Heinrich's wife; we ate the fish together. Everything is reasonably well with us; may God confirm and improve it.</p>
      <p>The people of Prättigau are up with their enemies and are calling others to join them, having solicited wine and bread from Chur (the people are so prudent that they go out and have nothing to eat for three days; such imprudent, unfortunate people, if God does not protect them, they will cause enough misfortune, bringing themselves and others into suffering and ruin). The people of Chur did not want to give them anything, and also told them that they would not let them into their city. What will come of it is not yet known. They have moved to Maienfeld; may God grant us peace. A lot of news has come to my lords of Bern and Basel; it is not possible for me to write. Moreover, I must return the letters of the lords, which were shared with me by the city clerk and council clerk and by the mayor, soon. So now is the last week, and I have other things to do. Recently, the preceptor of the two young lords, the sons of the admiral, has arrived, with whom I was at the town hall today; he has much news from La Rochelle, etc., and will ride to Schaffhausen tomorrow. I give him a commendation to Master Hans Conrad, to whom he will share the news. From Marseille on March 3rd, it is written that those in Languedoc are causing great damage to the king; those in Nîmes have sallied out and forcibly taken a castle from the king; when the king wanted to retake it, he lost about 500 men, including many of the nobility and counts, etc. There is so much of this matter, it is impossible for me to write, and more comes daily.</p>
      <p>God with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Monday after Palm Sunday, March 16, 1573.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
