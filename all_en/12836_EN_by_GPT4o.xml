    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger thanks for Blarer's letter [No. 2790] and for the letter from Ulm, delivered by Konrad Zwick, [addressed to him]. Before dinner, he read the letters to the mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater?], after which the mayor became upset [in view of the Swiss envoy mentioned in the Ulm letter]. During dinner, [Lavater?] sent for Bullinger and had him read the letter to the second mayor [Johannes Haab?] and the chief masters [Georg Müller, Itelhans Thumysen, and Hans Wegmann].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] They thank Blarer and Zwick sincerely for the friendship service rendered to them and would like to know as much as possible from which places these envoys [in Ulm] come and what their mission is, especially since the people of Zurich knew nothing about such an embassy. Any costs will be covered by the people of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Haab thinks that the envoy might be Jost von Meggen from Lucerne. During his last mission in Rome, he is said to have brought the cardinal's hat to the Bishop of Lund [and Constance, Johann von Weeze]. Weeze will probably earn this red hat by shedding Christian blood! The people of Zurich therefore ask for prompt information about this embassy [in Ulm], [so that they can send a message?] to Inner Switzerland [if necessary?]..... Emperor Charles V......, which is to be read to the council, as well as the peace terms of the people of Ulm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger writes the present letter at 10 o'clock at night, in order to be able to dispatch the messenger [...] early in the morning. He gave him 12 Constance batzen and also covered his lodging costs.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] When the council of Constance sent their [previous] messenger [...], he reported that several riders were sighted near Güttingen. Subsequently, some councilors came to Bullinger and asked him to write to trusted people in Constance, advising them not to hurry to pay homage to the emperor, as in eight to fourteen days a different wind might blow. Bullinger still hopes that pious Swiss confederates would assist the people of Constance in their time of need.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Blarer himself sees how things are going for the poor people of Ulm. The same or worse awaits the people of Constance if they let in the emperor's devilish people. Then the priests supported by the emperor would also dance on their heads, as surely as the stars stand in the sky, and the emperor would not keep his promises. Better to die honestly than to live "Ulmish"! Only now do the poor [people of Ulm] realize what they have gotten themselves into. This should be a lesson to all!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] After the riding messenger delivered the letter from the council of Constance [from February 1] to the people of Zurich, [the Zurich council immediately sent it?] to the [three Protestant] places..... [Bullinger has his?] letter to Hans Wunderlich..... sent to his father-in-law Ve[nner Niklaus Wytten]bach. The messengers [Andreas Müller and Melchior Schlosser] sent to the Three Places have not yet returned.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The emperor will have enough wars to fight with Francis I, Suleiman, and the princes Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Philip of Hesse, so that he will soon forget Constance. But if the people of Constance are deceived and outwitted by him, they will be spiritually and physically enslaved by him forever. May God grant insight and grace!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Bernardino Ochino rode through Zurich on his way to Basel today and was accompanied by [Heinrich Gugolz] on the council's orders. At the same time, Calvin arrived from Geneva for a meeting. He reported on the great armament of Francis I, the imminent departure of the military campaign, and a French embassy to Constantinople.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] There is a rumor that Sebastian Schertlin arrived in Constance with 30 companions on January 31 [correct: February 2]. It is indeed a wonderful reinforcement that God is granting the people of Constance with such people! An opportunity that should be well utilized.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Where are Georg Frölich and Johannes Haller? May the Lord protect the people of Constance! Blarer should report whether.....</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Blarer's letter [will Bullinger] send to Kaspar Seidensticker.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] May God be with Blarer, [his brother Thomas] and with Zwick.</p>

      <p>Dear sir and brother, I have received your letter once again and read it diligently. Thank you and your dear cousin sincerely. When I presented it to my lord mayor, he was greatly moved, and as it happened just before dinner, he sent for me again during dinner. I had to read the letter from Ulm to both mayors and the chief masters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>They then informed me and requested that I thank you very kindly, as they consider this a great act of friendship. They also ask that you, along with your cousin, remain in such good will and, as much as possible, find out from which places the envoys are or what their mission is, and if any costs arise, they would cover them. It would also be of great service to them, as they cannot know or imagine which place should have such envoys.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>My lord thought it might be Jost von Meggen from Lucerne. He is said to have brought a red cardinal's hat to the Bishop of Lund while he was in Rome. He will earn it by shedding Christian blood! But whatever the case, let us know as soon as you can thoroughly find out who or what this embassy is, and the sooner, the better, as one will also... in the lands. Emperor Charles V... to be read to a convened council along with how the people of Ulm will be kept in peace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I am writing this letter now at 10 o'clock at night so that I can dispatch the messenger in the morning on time. I have also given him 12 Constance batzen and paid for his lodging.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>When your lords sent their own messenger, some riders were seen near Güttingen. Some of the councilors came to me (they are very honorable people) and asked me to write to trusted people in Constance, advising them not to hurry to pay homage to the emperor. They trust that in 8 to 14 days, a different wind will blow. I still trust that pious people in the Swiss Confederation will not leave you comfortless if further distress befalls you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>But you see for yourselves what is being done to the poor people of Ulm. The same or worse awaits you if you let the devil's people in. You will have the priests sitting on your heads as surely as the stars stand in the sky. The priests can do everything with the emperor. Afterwards, he will not keep what he promises. It is better to die honorably than to live "Ulmish"! Now the poor people realize what they have done. Honor God and take their example! Be brave!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>My lords have sent the letter brought by your riding messenger quickly to the places and also... to Hans Wunderlich... sent to his father-in-law Ve[nner Niklaus Wytten]bach. The messengers have not yet returned.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Remember: The emperor will have enough wars with the French, Turks, and the princes to forget Constance. But if you let yourselves be deceived and pushed into the sack, you will never again be free, spiritually and physically! Let us pray to God for understanding and grace, steadfastness and strength, for without Him, all our efforts are in vain.</p>

      <p>Bernardino Ochino rode through here today on his way to Basel. My lords accompanied him. At the same time, Calvin arrived from Geneva to discuss with us. He spoke of the remarkable armament of the king and that the campaign will soon begin. He also mentioned a certain embassy sent by the king to Constantinople, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The rumor here is that Captain Schertlin arrived with you on Monday with 30 of his companions. If so, I consider it a wonder and a reinforcement that God sends you such honorable people. Use it rightly!</p>
