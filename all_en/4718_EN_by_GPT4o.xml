      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>What I once wrote about the generosity of the late King of Denmark, to be presented to your kindness through his treasurer in Strasbourg (indeed, it was greatly boasted about me at that time), I believe has been thwarted by the ill will of those whom the writings of the exiled English church have sufficiently and rightly exposed, and whose notable ambition and greed have also betrayed them among their own people, showing what kind of people they were. However, the Lord, who has fed you from your youth and given you a truly heroic spirit that despises these courtly morsels, will not allow your seed to beg.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I have suffered many losses and most atrocious injuries from Westphal, a most morose and unrestrained monster rather than a man. However, having been conveniently pruned by Beza and made somewhat more tame, he now seems, according to some who write to me from Hamburg, not so much to be at rest as to be giving birth to some new monstrosity with his patron Illyricus. I am sending you their new articles of faith, which the apostolic fishermen and the entire ancient church of Christ were unaware of. I ask, however, that you, with the most learned and pious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, your most friendly and the ornament of our age, ensure that through some diligent person, he arranges for tables to be compiled on his Christian Institution, just as Johannes Nisaeno of Augsburg did on the common theological places of the blessed memory of Mr. Philipp Melanchthon, and that they be printed in such a paper format that they can be bound together with the aforementioned Institution in one volume, perhaps even more saleable then. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Erfurt, and commend me to the prayers of your church (which may the Lord keep you safe for a long time) and greet your most learned and equally pious colleagues in my name as courteously as possible. Again, farewell in the Lord. March 18, in the year etc. 61.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your reverend kindness, Baptist Johannes Wisamerus signed.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Father in Christ and Lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy, learned, and pious superintendent of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, as to his dearest parent in the Lord.</p>
