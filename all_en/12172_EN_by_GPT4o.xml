    <p xml:id="regest1">Pistorius thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received], which [Christoph] Froschauer delivered to him. He can assure Bullinger that even in [Hesse] many pious and learned people disapprove of Luther's [„Short Confession“]. In these dangerous times, efforts are being made there for unity. - As soon as he is back home [in Nidda], Pistorius will read the [„Orthodox Confession of the Ministers of the Church of Zurich“] and report any ambiguities. Bullinger may also know that Pistorius and many others defend the people of Zurich against their attackers, and that [Philip of Hesse] is not hostile towards the people of Zurich. In Hesse, they are content with the assertion that the true body and true blood of Christ are offered in the bread and wine, without any explanation, as efforts are being made to settle the dispute over the Lord's Supper. If this does not succeed, the Lord will probably want to make people understand that despite all their talents, they remain human. - Pistorius has bought [Theodor Bibliander's „Faithful Account“] on the Apocalypse; it could have been more detailed. - It is clear to everyone that the [believers] have no choice but to entrust themselves to the Lord and await the [persecution], for [Charles V] will probably not be content to exercise his tyranny only in the Netherlands; he will also threaten [Germany]. However, the [German] princes are prepared, trust in God, and are making preparations. The [people of Zurich] should pray for the [Germans]. - Greetings also from Dionysius [Melander]. - [P.S.:] Pistorius thanks for Bullinger's gift.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I received your letter delivered by our Froschauer with the greatest gratitude, and I want you, Bullinger, revered for many reasons, to know that many men renowned for their learning and piety among us are also lamenting, as you and your people have seen with great sorrow, the publication of Luther's work in these most turbulent times. We see more than enough dangers threatening the Church of Christ, even if we all joined heart and hand, and if anything seemed to be said less wisely or conveniently to another, we would amicably admonish each other and converse, even through letters. But such are our times, which Christ and the apostles rightly called most perilous.</p>
      <p>But I will read your writings as soon as I return home, and what seems - in my judgment, at least - not sufficiently clear, I will later, God willing, advise you for the sake of learning. And there is no doubt that I and many other good men will diligently defend your churches against people not entirely of sound mind, and in this, we have a leader not entirely ill-disposed. For we simply confess that in the supper, Christ our Lord offers to his faithful the true body and blood with the bread and wine. We consider it a great crime to investigate the manner, and we would prefer the tragedies stirred up by this matter to be quelled rather than the fire once extinguished to be rekindled. But perhaps it seemed otherwise to the Lord, who truly orders all things for the good of his own, and if nothing else, he declares that we, though adorned with excellent gifts, are still human.</p>
      <p>Would that we truly knew this!</p>
      <p>I have purchased the summary on the Apocalypse. However, if it were possible, I would prefer a more detailed example explained by Mr. Bibliander.</p>
      <p>Although it is entirely ours to commend ourselves to the Lord and to bravely await the cross that our enemies threaten. For it is not enough for Caesar to persecute the gospel with unheard-of tyranny in all ages in Lower Germany, unless he also threatens us with the utmost. The princes and all our people, by the grace of God, are of cheerful spirit, placing all hope in one God, yet not neglecting the means which they can use with a good conscience. But we expect the outcome and happy success from God. Therefore, I pray that you and your church pray for us, that he may either deliver us from the tyrant or give us the courage to endure what must be endured for the glory of his name.</p>
      <p>Our Mr. Dionysius sends his greetings to you and all the fellow believers with me. Hastily, from Frankfurt, March 30, in the year of our Lord 1545.</p>
      <p>Johannes Pistorius Niddanus, entirely yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>I received your little gift with a grateful heart and, since I cannot repay it, I give and hold thanks that will not perish.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, distinguished in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, theologian of Zurich, his lord in Christ, etc.</p>
