      <p>To the most reverend father, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most esteemed president of the church in Zürich among the Swiss, a preface from John Banks, an Englishman.</p>
      <p>Your eminence (most excellent father) may perhaps wonder why I am writing to you in these turbulent times, something I have never done before; especially since I have no prior acquaintance with you, and now I must speak of matters that would create great danger for me if the letters were intercepted before the bearer left England.</p>
      <p>I did not think these matters were of such a nature that they should delay what I intended, since it is both a pious act and truly worthy to be recognized by all, especially by your eminence, for the love and benevolence you have shown to the noble Gray family among us; which you have not hesitated to illustrate with your own writings. Although this family is now overthrown and almost extinct, for the sake of the saving name of our Savior and the cause of the gospel, those who are pious and truly Christian should not grieve over the ruin of such an illustrious family as much as they should rejoice that the final act of their life was concluded in the testimony of the name of Jesus: all the more so because those who rest with Christ the Lord in the kingdom of the Father will not witness with their own eyes the miserable and sorrowful destruction of our nation. We, we are the wretched ones, who daily hear the name of the Savior being insulted and witness the most terrible slaughter of those who strove to propagate His glory and expand His kingdom.</p>
      <p>But to the Grays, about whom I intended to speak with you in this discourse, both because of your singular interest in them, which is clearly declared in your divine writings, and because of my own affection for the deceased, to whom I diligently tried to prove my respect in life.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Jane, the duke's daughter, truly a gem, not so much for her incredible knowledge of letters, in which she excelled all other women at the age of 17; but for the singular fortitude with which she surpassed men in the army of Christ, as you will understand from a certain conversation of hers, which I send to your eminence, that she could not be conquered by any machines the papists devised, nor could she be deceived by their traps.</p>
      <p>This conversation was held by them with an excellent and cunning papist on certain controversial points of our religion, on which she explained her opinion learnedly and ingeniously. It can be sufficiently understood from what she said shortly before she was executed that she persisted in this confession of faith to the end; which I thought should be added to others, as they seemed to me worthy of being known by all. Furthermore, it will be evident from two letters how truly golden her heart was, illuminated by the light of God's word; one of which she wrote to the most noble virgin, Lady Catherine, her sister, to inflame her to the study of sacred letters, and the other to a certain apostate, to recall him to Christ the Lord. I took care to translate all these from our vernacular into Latin, so that your eminence would not consider the effort you made to illustrate that family and incite to piety to be in vain. For I can testify, if not as the most reliable, at least as an eyewitness, to the incredible benefit that all the Grays, and especially Jane, derived from your writings; she had not only diligently observed almost all the points of your fifth decade but had also committed them to memory.</p>
      <p>The duke himself, as much time as he could steal from the affairs of the kingdom, in which he was involved, he spent in sacred books, especially in reading yours, whose milk-white eloquence he used to say he was wonderfully delighted by. From this reading, he derived the greatest benefit when, in prison, certain monstrous beasts attacked him to divert him from the faith and confession of the true Christ. But they could not move him in any way: for he confessed Christ the Lord to his last breath; and when he was taken to execution, although the papists had appointed a counselor from the herd of swine to shout about the Catholic Church, the mass, the fathers, and the long-established custom, he would acknowledge no other expiation than that which was perfected by the death of Christ, he sustained himself with this faith, and in this faith, he finally ended his life.</p>
      <p>I would speak about the entire overthrow of religion in England and the antichristian rage, if those who come daily from England to Zürich, the richest emporium of all good lands, did not make you more certain of it. Therefore, what remains, I earnestly and repeatedly ask from your piety, is that you consider this my duty favorably, count me among your own, and pray to the Lord that our England may finally be liberated from the tyranny of the papists, by which it is now oppressed. Farewell, most excellent Bullinger, and continue to illuminate the kingdom of Christ with your writings perpetually. London, March 15, in the year of our Lord 1554.</p>
