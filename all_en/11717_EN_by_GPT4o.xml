    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for his long silence, which was solely due to the absence of a messenger and his many other commitments. Can never adequately reciprocate Bullinger's generosity and goodwill; thanks for the [Matthew] commentary and Bullinger's other writings; he particularly likes the 17th chapter [of the Matthew commentary]; may God preserve his creative power for a long time! Has sent a letter to Gervasius [Schuler] and [Balthasar] Funk through the messenger, and also returns the explanation of the Bernese [regarding the Eucharistic dispute between Peter Kunz and Erasmus Ritter]. Greetings from his brother [Thomas Blarer] and Konrad Zwick, whose brother [Johannes] is staying in Bischofszell and repeatedly sends greetings to Bullinger. In [Bischofszell], the plague is raging so severely that in some weeks no fewer than 26 or 27 people die from it, relative to the size of the town more than in Konstanz. He is concerned about [Johannes] Zwick, who is sacrificing himself for the sick there after the death of the pastor [Andreas Kölli]; Bullinger should also ask [Konrad] Pellikan, who is friendly with Zwick, to pray for his health; Zwick's death would be an unspeakable loss for the church. Arrival of the messenger; greetings. - [Enclosure:] It was reported from Vienna on September 17 that Buda is being besieged by the [imperial] troops, while the Turks are said to have moved from Pest to there; the [German] troops are supported by the Hungarians, who are advancing from Transylvania and other places, so that they are ready for conquest; rumors of the outbreak of dysentery and angina in the camp. From Pavia, the arrival of a huge swarm of locusts was reported for September 5, moving towards Piedmont, but locusts were also seen in Venetia. It is reported from Augsburg that [King Francis I] has moved his troops from the Netherlands to Spain; after the destruction of Luxembourg, he is now besieging Perpignan. In five weeks, a Reichstag will take place in Nuremberg, before which a city day is scheduled in Ulm. Duke [Heinrich] of Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel] has been expelled from his land and the castle at Wolfenbüttel was taken on August 12; at the subsequent church consecration, Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] had the flag of the [Schmalkaldic] League hoisted and his preacher preach; in the castle, they found Heinrich's youngest [Julius] and eldest son [Karl Viktor] - a bloodthirsty man - as well as his daughters; the sons are to receive an annual maintenance of 6000 guilders, and the daughters are to receive a dowry; Heinrich is staying with the middle son [Philipp Magnus] partly in Munich, partly in Landshut in Bavaria; in the castle, a large supply of provisions, weapons, ammunition, and other things was also found, and in the intact chancellery, they came across several correspondences of Heinrich with the [Catholics], some of which they intend to print. Detailed enumeration of the finds in Wolfenbüttel Castle, including clothes of Heinrich and his deceased wife [Marie of Württemberg], the sister of Duke Ulrich of Württemberg. In Schöningen Castle, the body of [Konrad] Dellinghausen was found, who participated as an envoy of the city of Goslar at the Reichstag in Augsburg [1530] due to the negotiation of the dispute between the city and Heinrich and was detained by Heinrich on the way back despite imperial escort; he had denied any involvement, but now documents and also witnesses have been found reporting that the bailiff of Schöningen stabbed Dellinghausen and buried him in the ground of the castle tower, where his body was indeed found. It has now finally been proven that Heinrich had the death and burial of his lover [Eva von Trott] faked. The cities of Metz, Schweinfurt, Wimpfen, and Hildesheim have accepted the Gospel, as has the Bishop of Münster [Franz von Waldeck], who has reconciled with the city of Minden. The Emperor [Charles V] lying at "Maser" [or "Masin": Monzón?] is pressing [Francis I] so much that he has ordered mercenaries from the Netherlands and other places to Narbonne; apparently, he is in a dire situation, as his embassy in Solothurn [Louis Daugerant, Seigneur de Boisrigaut] has also suddenly departed; asks for any news Bullinger might have on this matter.</p>

      <p>Greetings in our solid salvation in Christ.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would be lost, Bullinger, venerable in the Lord and dearest brother by far, if there was any reason for my silence other than the fact that since the last letters I sent to you, I have not encountered any messenger traveling there. The countless affairs and these turbulent and truly uncertain times have prevented me from seeking more diligently, although during this whole time there has not been much of those things which you delight in knowing, that I could certainly write to you amidst such a license of falsehoods. Therefore, forgive me, my soul, if you think I have erred here; I will diligently make amends if the occasion helps, as it is my intention to gratify you as much as to live rightly, since I could not live well if I showed myself ungrateful to a friend and such a great one, even by the slightest suspicion.</p>
      <p>I am very ashamed of myself that I cannot adequately respond to your remarkable generosity towards me. For what are these perpetual prayers, that the heavenly and most generous Father in heaven may fulfill my part here and repay you a hundredfold or a thousandfold for all things according to His kindness, what, I say, are these or to what purpose do they serve? It would be easy for anyone to pray in such a manner with a full mouth, although I do so with all my heart. But ah, how I wish I could testify to my utmost gratitude towards you in reality, so that you would understand that I am in this, to beautifully surpass you in service and benefits! But this my misfortune must be borne by me, indeed by you too, for a while, until some chance brings it about that I may accomplish what I earnestly desire with happy success. Now I give thanks in words for your most learned commentaries and other booklets, a gift indeed for many reasons, especially because it is your work, which reflects your mind and talent to me, most gratefully. I am very pleased with what you wrote in the 17th chapter; you know the reasons. May the Lord preserve you as a fruitful olive tree in His house for a long time! I have written through this messenger to our Gervasius and to Consul Funck. I am returning that other writing, namely the Bernese opinion. Your brother with Konrad Zwick, whose brother is staying in Bischofszell and who has already once and again requested in his letters that I commend him to your sacred prayers before the Lord, send their greetings and wish to be most accurately commended to you. For the plague is raging there so cruelly that no fewer than 26 or 27 are taken each week, a number that almost surpasses those dying here, while our city is four times larger than that little town. The excellent Zwick is risking his life at every moment for Christ, for whose glory he is most thirsty, nor could he deny his duty to those so afflicted and so desperately demanding, to whom even the Lord's hand had taken away their most holy pastor, so that they are now like wandering sheep. You will inform this especially to our Pellican, who loves him more earnestly because of their old friendship, so that he may pray more fervently to the author of life for his health; for it cannot be said how great a loss our church would suffer here if this heart burning with zeal for God were taken from us.</p>
      <p>The messenger arrives unexpectedly. Farewell then, my heart. Commend me to all the brothers and friends. Especially greet Gwalther, the best friend, more than most with my words. I cannot add anything more.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>
