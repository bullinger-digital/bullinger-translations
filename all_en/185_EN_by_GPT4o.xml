      <p>Greetings. As I was just beginning to write to you, dearest lord and godfather, behold, the Zurich courier arrived bringing your letters to me and Musculus, along with the vocabulary and that "Destruction" (as you rightly call it) of Germany. I am entirely moved, so that I do not know what to write first, whether to explain our affairs or (which I cannot omit) to lament that common calamity of the church, although even amidst lamenting, I do not know what hope always shines upon me, which both lifts and gladdens my spirit, when I see the Lord doing these things not for destruction, but rather for the testing of His elect and for the declaration of the treacherous hypocrites, whom the title of the gospel has covered and concealed for too long until now.</p>
      <p>I hope the Lord, who is true in His promises, will grant His faithful ones an outcome with the temptation, so that they may endure.</p>
      <p>I rejoice as much that my dearest brother Musculus has finally escaped as if I had escaped myself. You advise well about him; I love him as a strong athlete for the glory of God, and therefore I will labor for him as much as I can. You should encourage him not to attach himself to the people of Basel.</p>
      <p>Since we have also established public lectures here, we will make an effort to call him to the theological profession; for at this time we can scarcely have a better one than him, until he is gradually also drawn into the ministry. I indeed solemnly promise that I will gladly yield my place and perform the office of deacon, provided we do not neglect such a man whom God offers us. I am especially glad about your testimony, which you write, that he spoke with you about the sacrament in a way that was very pleasing; for I congratulate both him, who thinks well, and myself, who have thus far preached such things about him. I write a few things to him, which I send to you, in case he is still with you.</p>
      <p>If he has gone to Basel, I beg you to send it there. These are about Musculus, about whom more shortly; for today, since I received your letters, I have not yet been able to do anything in his matter. As soon as I received yours along with that schedule containing what each state of the empire responds and decides regarding the proposed, indeed imposed, Interim, I immediately approached the senate then assembled and informed them of these things. Then I went to the remaining brothers. Having returned long ago, I write these things. I will therefore write about all these things in the following days. Master Jodocus and I wish that you would write either to the consul Negelin about Musculus or to us in German, but in such a way that you instruct us to offer your advice to the consul and senate; for we know that your authority can do much here.</p>
      <p>I will also write about the Vocabulary soon; in the meantime, after I have read it with some friends, I will return it. Everyone thanks you for your diligence and singular zeal towards us.</p>
      <p>I am also very concerned about Master Laetus, my most esteemed godfather; I am surprised that you have written nothing about him. I also do not doubt about Lepusculus, who is to return to Basel.</p>
      <p>I ask that if you have any certain information about these matters, you inform me as soon as possible. In your letters, you ask how the Lausanne tragedy is composed. Concerning this matter, take this: They are still anxiously waiting to be called, and they remain in doubt, not knowing and fearing that they may be removed from the ministry. In the meantime, while they fear this, they beautifully recall and explain very clearly, sincerely, and familiarly what they had previously taught and disputed, in case by thus explaining their opinions, they might be able to remain in their churches and offices. A man of good faith reported this to me, and I do not think it happens without a singular cause that their matter is thus suspended; for they act much more clearly now, while they fear, than if they were already certain about their conditions. However, it is certain that they will be called at some point; there are certainly some on our side who are too agitated and exacerbated by that long-standing contention, who would like all to be indiscriminately removed. I, as much as I can, mitigate them, so that they may rather gather those returning to us than reject them, correct them before condemning them. Master Viretus was here with me these days; he also brought me letters from Calvin. They wish to have peace with us; Viretus especially dealt with me very familiarly. He had a few things that seemed to be moderated rather than reprehended in his exposition. He appears to be a pious man and not to think badly, provided he feels in his heart what he expresses with his lips. He complains of being too much oppressed by unjust suspicions. I promised them all my efforts, if they wish to be sincere; but if I perceive that they intend to impose on us or not to act in good faith and openly, I will be more opposed to them than others. And thus their matter still hangs. Viretus was present for some other reason, so that no mention was made of this, except that he was severely rebuked by the consul Negelin, where he nevertheless excused himself modestly and left not without his favor.</p>
      <p>You wrote recently about Benedict. I explained these things to the consul; he replied that he does not envy the man's condition; however, it is dangerous to provide for him now, since others are still here removed because of that faction, who would then also be confirmed by his example in the hope that they would soon be received back into favor, and thus perhaps the latter things would be worse than the former. Moreover, he greatly detested the man's inconstancy. I persisted in asking, also bringing forth your intercession. But he continued: to warn us not to throw the church again into those dangers by promoting such men, from which it has scarcely escaped. Therefore, I could obtain nothing; we all advised Benedict to wait and defer until the matter of Conrad the deacon, who was removed with Sultzer, is settled. For if he is received again, there is no doubt that he can also be admitted; if he is not received, then there is no one else whose example could hinder him; for within a few days Conrad will either be received into some place or sent away.</p>
      <p>Waeberus has been assigned to us. They have elected Theobald as deacon in Sur. Another deaconate is still vacant.</p>
      <p>The school matter is as follows: For two whole days, we held an examination of each lecture and class. Present were the treasurer Haller, the standard-bearer from Grafenriedt, and Claudius Amadiis. After the examination, the evaluation of each professor, schoolmaster, lecturer, and supervisor, and then also of each stipend holder, in the same form as is held in Zurich. After the evaluation, some stipends were increased, and the senate decreed that those evaluations should be made at each angaria. Before the examination, we conferred among ourselves what we would propose to the school overseers in the matter of schools and studies, whether to be changed or renewed.</p>
      <p>We drafted some more general articles that seemed most necessary. After the evaluation, we presented them; we asked that they also deign to deal with these matters with the senate. They approved our zeal and diligence and encouraged us to deliver to them in writing everything we wanted to be established in a certain order; they themselves would present it to the senate and act for the confirmation of those things that seemed beneficial. We did this and now await when they will present it to the senate; we do not doubt that they will confirm everything. If we receive it, I will inform you of the articles we have obtained and proposed.</p>
      <p>I hope the Lord will not fail this pious church. Concord is now beautifully growing with all of us agreeing.</p>
      <p>However, I am surprised that you write nothing about what is publicly sung here not without great sorrow and admiration of all the pious, that the Zurich senate has consented to that papistic and execrable form of oath, that is, that among the papists they themselves want to bind them to swear not only by the name of God alone but also by the names of the saints.</p>
      <p>For who will make this distinction between a given and accepted and offered faith under the patronage and protection of creatures? Oh, what madness is this, what impiety to fall into such weakness after so much knowledge of the truth, that we want to swear by creatures! Our covenants would indeed be firmer never sworn than impiously sworn. I see (if this is true) what threatens us. Write, I beg you, how this matter stands. We are very concerned here; we wonder who will be so shameless, not to say impious, who will utter these profane words if a delegate is chosen to bind others with this form of religion. Prevent it, I beg you, even now, if you can in any way; we will also do here indeed what befits good men. We faithfully warn to beware of the alliance with the French, which many seem to desire too much; may the Lord give us all such a spirit that we may learn to trust no princes, but to seek help from Him alone, who alone is almighty. Amen.</p>
      <p>My whole family greets you and yours. We are well, thanks be to the most good God. I ask again that you forgive me if I write more negligently; for I write more freely and hastily. May the Lord Jesus keep you forever.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 9, 1548.</p>
      <p>I wish all the brothers well, Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther. Ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most esteemed godfather. In Zurich.</p>
      <p>Rare humility. Haller, the antistes, wishes to perform the office of deacon so that a foreigner may be received, but a man suitable for promoting the glory of God.</p>
      <p>The Zurich senate is poorly spoken of. What holy Bullinger has done in this place, learn from elsewhere.</p>
