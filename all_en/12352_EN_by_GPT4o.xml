    <p xml:id="regest1">Hindermann dares to write to Bullinger, even though he knows he is not worthy of it. He tries to fend off opposing attacks against the [Zürichers], but in the matter that prompted this letter, he cannot avoid informing Bullinger about it. - The Strasbourg theologian Theobald Thamer, who is active in [Marburg], expressed himself very disparagingly about all previous interpretations of John 4, [23], and especially about Bullinger's [John] commentary, where the "Disticha Catonis" is quoted. In doing so, he slandered Bullinger. Hindermann, who attended this lecture, had to listen to this with embarrassment. Thamer is one of those unlearned people of whom Terence says that only what they themselves have accomplished seems good to them. Hindermann shares this with Bullinger so that he can better defend himself knowing the accusations of the opponents. - Karl Viktor, the son of [Duke] Heinrich of Brunswick, was brought as a prisoner from Kassel to the castle of Marburg on November 21, where he spends his time playing ball games. - Greetings to [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and the entire household as well as to his relative Theodor Bibliander. - [Appendix:] [Karl Viktor] is imprisoned in Marburg in a heated room [of the castle] and the adjoining bedroom. He has only two or three companions, possesses not a penny, and looks very gloomy. - [Heinrich] was initially allowed to walk in the fortress of Ziegenhain, but he seemed to want to abuse this privilege. Thus, he was granted only two rooms and a heated room. He has about eight guards. When he came to Ziegenhain, he had only one thaler, with which he plays and wins some hellers and pfennigs. He complains that [King] Ferdinand I and Emperor [Charles V] owe him 17 tons of gold. At set times, he listens to the sermon by the local pastor [Albanus Enkel]. When he noticed that iron bars had recently been installed on the windows [of the chapel], he became so angry that same night that he smashed the glass of a window. The pastor himself confirmed this. It is still unknown what will become of [Heinrich's] noble companions and war leaders, who are held in Kassel at their own expense and hope for the grace of the prince [Philipp of Hesse].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Grace and peace from God, the best and greatest, etc.</p>
      <p>Even though I know I am most unworthy to write to you, and that I might disturb you (like a jackdaw among the Muses) with my letters, which are completely devoid of the flowers and ornaments of rhetoric, and that I can bring nothing perfect in talent or polished by industry, I am nevertheless emboldened by your memorable humanity, which shines above all other virtues, to come into your presence with my letters, most distinguished man. I am also compelled by the fact that I cannot and should not bear anything that detracts from your honor, glory, and authority. For I am so affected towards you and all of yours that, whenever I see the weapons of adversaries directed at you, I try to avert them, if I can in any way. But since the present time and age do not allow it (for this day demands different manners), nor is it my duty, and I am least able, I wanted to leave this to you, who excel in wisdom and doctrine in infinite ways. But you may ask, from whom should I defend myself? I will recount the whole matter in order, as it stands.</p>
      <p>You know (I suppose) Theobald Thamer of Strasbourg, a theologian residing with us. When he came across that passage in John 4: "The true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth," etc., refuting all opinions and interpretations concerning this passage, he finally (and especially) attacked yours, inveighing against it most severely with many words, publicly mentioning your name as if it were odious, in this manner: "I must say it straight, it is Bullinger," etc., because you cited those distichs of Cato in your commentaries on this passage: "If God is spirit," etc., also saying among many other things: "I pity them; they ruin many good people with their sacrilegious and profane trifles," etc.; which he then refuted with many words in this manner: "As heaven and earth, so purity or spirit (which John speaks of here) differs from the spirit or purity of Cato or the old man," etc., and many other things, which I, being present at his lecture, received with a flushed face. But he does not only do this to you, but also to the most holy fathers and others, so that almost that saying of Terence can be most rightly applied to him: Nothing is more unjust than an unlearned man; who, unless he himself has done it, thinks nothing is right, etc. I write what I have heard and witnessed; therefore, I beg you not to take it in a worse part, that I have dared to write such things to you. For you can, by your wisdom and doctrine, better defend yourself from the insults of adversaries, knowing what they impute to you, etc. But if I seem not to be free from blame for having informed you of such things, I beg to obtain pardon for my error.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, nothing new is happening with us, except that Karl Viktor, the son of Heinrich of Brunswick, was brought as a prisoner from Kassel to Marburg on November 21, where he still resides, occasionally engaging in ball games, etc.</p>
      <p>These are the things I wanted to write to you, most distinguished man, which you will consider kindly from me according to your humanity. I pray that this year may happily favor you and your family. Greet your wife and entire household, Theodor Bibliander, my always most respected relative, and other lords in my words.</p>
      <p>Farewell. From the house of Wigand Happel in Marburg. Your most obedient Heinrich Opisander.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>I will write briefly about the state of mind of Heinrich and his son. The latter is confined with us in Marburg in a heated room and the adjoining bedroom.</p>
      <p>He has only two or three companions with whom he can pass the time by talking or playing, and he does not even have a single penny to buy nuts to use in playing. He has a gloomy, horrible, and deformed face and appearance.</p>
      <p>However, Heinrich is said to be somewhat more humane. At first, he was allowed to walk and roam around the Ziegenhain fortress and inspect everything. But later, when he seemed to want to abuse this privilege by demanding things more imperiously from the prefects, he was assigned only two rooms and a single heated room, from which he is no longer allowed to leave. He has about eight attendants who observe and serve him, play with him, and talk to him. He had only one thaler when he came to Ziegenhain. He enjoys playing and experiences great luck in playing; but there are only a few hellers or pfennigs. He complains bitterly about the treachery of Ferdinand and the emperor, whom he miserably boasts owe him about 17 tons of gold. He listens to sermons at set times from a certain local pastor. What he gains from it, no one can guess. It happened recently that after hearing a sermon, he was supposed to pray and kneel with the pastor, and as if about to do so, he approached the window, and when he unexpectedly saw that iron bars had been newly fixed to the windows, he became so angry that night that he smashed the glass of a window with one blow of his hand and fell completely silent. The pastor himself, who was present with him, told me this and confirmed that everything was true.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write about him. His remaining companions, nobles and war leaders, are in Kassel at their own great expense and disgrace, and they await the prince's clemency and grace. What will become of them is not yet known.</p>
