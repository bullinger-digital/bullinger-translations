    <p xml:id="regest1">Clarifies that he is only upset because Bullinger no longer asks him for news and does not believe what Myconius shares on his own, but this trifle is no reason for conflict; thanks for the news from Italy. Offers to convey Bullinger's [planned] response to Martin Hentius through Kronstadt [students] in Wittenberg. The Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied], about whom Bullinger always likes to hear something, had the entire citizenry of Cologne armed and brought before him to vote: Those who were for him should stand on one side, those against him on the other, whereupon everyone stood on his side; only the canons questioned later wanted to remain with the old religion. Bullinger probably already knows the final decision on the Peace of Religion, which the Brunswick [Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel] is trying to oppose; one can see that the peace tries to please each party, even if one can guess which party it favors. Myconius has other news, but lacks the time to write. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan; hopes - as does the widow of Johannes [Lüthard] - for a response from [Pellikan]; best wishes for Theodor [Bibliander] and his family.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I spoke of the loss, not because you require new things from others, but because you do not ask me and do not believe what I signify myself. However, this matter is not something to be troubled about. I thank you for sending what was written from Italy; not long after your letters, I learned the same from others.</p>
      <p>Hentzius Transylvanus indicated a way of sending, which I would like to use; if you also wish to use it, you can entrust all your matters to me, and I will take care of it. Through Wittenberg, whatever we wish will certainly be delivered; for there are still some from Kronstadt there, who have also written to me and promised their help in delivering my things.</p>
      <p>Regarding the one from Cologne, because you like to hear about it, I cannot refrain from sharing what I have heard for certain. Moved by great reasons, he came to Cologne with some horses; he called the senate and asked if they recognize him as their lord. They acknowledged him with the keys offered and other signs, as is their custom. Then, having made this recognition, he asked that the entire city stand before him in arms. And he obtained this as well. Therefore, with the citizens gathered and collected in a circle, he entered the middle and gave a speech from his horse, in which he gave an account of the changed religion with this appendix: If anyone wishes to stand by him and indeed by the Lord God and to endure whatever the Lord may send because of it, let him turn to this side; whoever does not wish this, let him turn to the other side without any loss. Having heard this, all stood by him to a man. The man rejoiced, and the whole city. Shortly after, he also sent to the canons, asking what they intended. They responded that they would remain in their old religion for the time being. What decision he will make about this response is still unknown.</p>
      <p>I have the final opinion on the Peace of Religion, against which the Brunswick [Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel] is trying to act; if I knew you had not seen it or desired it, I would gladly send it. It is as it usually is, where a judge tries to satisfy the most diverse parties, neglecting justice, so that you can see, however, to which side he leans more.</p>
      <p>I have many certain and uncertain things; however, I lack the leisure to write them. Farewell with yours in the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 22, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Greet Master Pellican in my name. I wish, indeed the wife of the late brother Johannes wishes, that he would deign to respond to my last letters. Also, may Theodor be well with his family.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy Antistes of the Zurichers, his most esteemed brother, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
