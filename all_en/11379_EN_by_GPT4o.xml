    <p xml:id="regest1">Received the letter from November 2nd only on December 10th, but is writing now due to a lack of messengers. His studies are going satisfactorily; he is glad that Bullinger advocated for him with the [Zurich] school officials. A German merchant invites him to Geneva because he wants to be taught in mathematics; Gwalther asks Bullinger to advise him - also with regard to a change of study location in the spring - and to be concerned about his scholarship. Emperor [Charles V] is supposed to come to Paris and allegedly meet Pope [Paul III] there, and King [Henry VIII] of England is said to have given Duke [William] of Cleves his daughter [Mary] in marriage; Gwalther has not received any news from England from the [Frankfurt] fair and wants to know if Nicholas [Partridge] has written. Andreas Zebedäus has translated a German poem about Reuchlin, Oekolampadius, Erasmus, Luther, and Zwingli into Latin verses; Gwalther sends them along with some distichs about Zwingli and conveys the poet's greetings. He adds two self-composed epitaphs about Zwingli and one about Clement VII and promises further poems. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letter, most esteemed father, written on the second of November, was brought to me by the prefect of Lausanne from Bern on the tenth of December. I am surprised at such a delay and do not doubt that you are greatly amazed at my silence, since you have previously so much demanded the duty of writing, which has been so long interrupted by me, and which was not only troublesome to you but also to me. For there is nothing I delight in as much as reading your letters and sending mine to you. The reason I have not written for some time was the infrequency of messengers, as all my letters had to be sent to Basel (for in Bern I knew no one to whom I could send them). Now, however, since you have opened this opportunity and occasion for me to write to you, I will certainly ensure that you cannot accuse me of silence in the future.</p>
      <p>The condition of my affairs remains always the same, and as far as I can judge, my studies are proceeding not unsuccessfully; for Conrad and I share them mutually. I will never be able to give thanks enough for defending my cause with such a faithful spirit before the college presidents; however, I will take care that nothing similar is committed. I was indeed very much afraid of this; yet, trusting in your patronage, I also decided to dare something in this matter with Otto's advice.</p>
      <p>There is a certain German merchant in Geneva, moderately learned, who has often tried to entice me to Geneva with his letters; being a student of mathematics, he seeks to use my services. The preacher of Morges and the deacon have introduced me to the man. He offers me either his own house or that of a Genevan printer. He promises to compensate my labors with a just reward. I am uncertain what to do. I await your advice on what I should do. Therefore, I ask you to write to me about this matter as soon as possible. You will also indicate what you think should be arranged for me at the beginning of spring. I would indeed wish that I could spend that time of my travels visiting famous cities and flourishing studies of letters. But in this matter, let your advice be everything, to which I will never object. I also entrust the entire matter of the stipend to you; for I do not think you will ever forget me.</p>
      <p>There is a constant rumor among us that the Emperor is coming to Paris, where some also promise the Pope will be present. What they are planning, there is no one who cannot judge. Many affirm that the King of England has given his daughter to the Duke of Cleves in marriage. We have received no news from England at this fair; I ask you to write whether you have received letters from our Nicholas and whether he is well.</p>
      <p>There is a learned man among us, a native of Gelderland, named Andreas Zebedäus, who now acts as a minister of the word, who, having recently come across some German poems in which the praises of Reuchlin, Oekolampadius, Erasmus, Luther, and Zwingli were contained, expressed the same in these Latin verses; which, since I saw them to be wonderfully elegant, I thought should be sent to you, even without his reluctance. The poet himself greets you most dutifully, and I think he will write to you shortly, perhaps even visit you next summer; for he is very fond of the Zurich church. These are the poems themselves:</p>
      <p>When Naso the poet sang, he did not lack a nose: "Names often suit their things." Thus nature draws us, thus it devolves us into those things, Which our names mark with certain signs. Many examples of this go through all the ages, which it is long to recount here. If, however, anyone still wickedly calls this into doubt, He has before his eyes the course of this time. Thus Capnio spread smoke into the Swabian regions, And not badly laid the path from smoke to flame, While he brings forth all kinds of tongues from the sacred summit And draws pure water from the very fountains. No other age has seen an equal, through whom The way of Scripture began to be clearer. Then Oekolampadius happily kindles the fire And shines like a new flame in the house of the Lord. By whose rays, poured out through the dark paths, Many things are well revealed, which were previously badly covered. Thirdly, Erasmus of Rotterdam comes, Softening amiably what was previously too harsh. Meanwhile, the cause becomes more celebrated throughout the whole world And the plain way to great glory is now open. And powerful Luther comes forth into the arena and thunders with a loud voice, By which both poles of the world stand. At this thunder, the highest, middle, and even the lowest, and those things placed on the right and left, roar. Then the private way of truth, previously private, is made public, By which anyone can go to the great supper. To which no one can come so late, even at this time, That he cannot have some place. Therefore, nothing of loss is felt by such a guest, And the table can hold its number, All kinds of people are summoned here from everywhere, there is no Respecter of persons, who prepares such great goods. All are invited, man, woman, healthy and sick, Every age here has a place to rest. Hard men, a wild race, an impious crowd persist And spurn the ample riches of this guest. They must be compelled to come and words must be added to the blows, Lest the wretched miserably allow such great things to perish. For this work, Zwingli alone, a man of the highest price, Is certainly sent with the mouth of God. Who, showing nothing in his mind, undertakes all things with a ready spirit, Which befit the servants of Christ and pious hearts. He presses on with the arms of the word and the holy voice of the senate, He puts on bronze arms against fierce wolves, Prepared to attempt anything for the cause of Christ And ready to suffer all things in the name of Christ. While he performs his duty with the highest piety and faith, Here he dies, or rather departs from here, and holds better things. About Zwingli by Zebedäus: It is wrong to hope for a greater, perhaps to ask for one, That our age may give even one equal. A learned mouth, a sincere heart, a keen spirit Have devoted themselves to the praises of one God.</p>
      <p>Acclamation: O most valiant defender of the evangelical word, O for Christ, O for the fatherland bravely dared to die!</p>
      <p>I too have recently played, while in my spare hours I devote myself to poetry, with some epitaphs, which I write here, not that they are worthy to hold any place among those learned ones, but because I am not ashamed to send even my most trifling things, which at least have a taste of letters, to you, who have always been both a father and a teacher to me.</p>
      <p>Zwingli the pious rests in that tomb. Do you want it shorter? Piety occupies this tomb.</p>
      <p>Another of the same: Zwingli lies here, the glory of the Zurich people, Who was always an excellent servant of God. This is (if you do not know), by whose holy strength The glory of the proud pontiff is laid low. For he was the first to remove the seeds of the Roman pestilence And the high walls of the fierce pope. He always burned with holy love for the Lord, While the high glory of the holy God is sought. While he strove to preserve the safety of his fatherland, For his dear fatherland, Zwingli bravely dies. Ah, it is shameful to describe the deeds of the ungrateful fatherland. He, who was always a father, was miserably taken away, alas. It is not enough to cut the holy body with iron, But impious crime heaps bitter crime upon crime. Four parts are cut from the slain body, And the dead limbs of the man are given to the flame. The flame consumed the body with its fierce strength, But it could not prevail against the brave hearts. Therefore, the holy hearts are buried in hard marble, For the devouring flame took the bodies from us. When you see the signs of the stone, traveler, Let the holy teachings of the holy man come to your aid.</p>
      <p>Epitaph of Clement of pious memory: Here lies Clement, the disgrace of the Roman city. Do you want it shorter? This stone covers all crime.</p>
      <p>Now, most dear father, I beg you to consider these things with fairness and goodness. The haste of the messenger did not allow me to write more, nor did anything occur to me that seemed worthwhile to disturb your studies. Perhaps we will soon give more, if we find that these have not been unpleasant to you.</p>
      <p>Conrad and his wife send you and your entire family many greetings. You will also greet your wife and mother in my name, along with all your children and the rest of the family.</p>
      <p>In Lausanne, December 12, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the truly learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Zurich church, his most esteemed father.</p>
