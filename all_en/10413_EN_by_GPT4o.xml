For the cleaning of the library against vermin, he will follow Bullinger's advice. Claude d'Aliod should be expelled. He is pleased with the news from Württemberg, but also that Bullinger has written that all this should be accepted with fear of God and one should guard against arrogance.</p>

      <p>Greetings. In order to establish a friendly and familiar relationship with you, who preside over the sacred matters in Zurich, dearest Heinrich, our brother Simprecht Vogt from Schaffhausen, the minister of the church in Biel, a man both learned and sincere, is visiting you. Therefore, so that he may conveniently achieve his desire, while he was staying with us in Bern these days, I did him the great favor of recommending him to you through my letters. I did this more willingly, relying on your kindness towards all, especially those who come to you in my name, so that he may also be a witness to our mutual friendship, since everyone proclaims that Haller is so devoted to Bullinger that he depends entirely on him, as far as this is permissible without compromising faith and sound doctrine.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we have acquired an antidote for our library; therefore, I will follow your advice as much as possible whenever leisure permits. Claude d'Aliod, who is also well known to Simprecht, will be expelled; in the meantime, it is necessary that we are prepared to give an account of the hope that is in us in all things. The news from Württemberg is pleasing, and so is what you added, that we should accept everything in the fear of the Lord, lest "the end of our joy be overtaken by grief" [Proverbs 14:13]. There is nothing here that seems worthy of note. Otherwise, we are all well.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, and love me as you always do.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 21, 1534.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
