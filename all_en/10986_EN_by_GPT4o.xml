    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not know who gave Bucer the reason for his annoyed letter [No. 939], but has already previously pointed out in conversation that his "Retractations" strengthened the opponents in their error if they compared them with the Bern Disputation, but also with Luther's recent statements in the "Letter to the People of Frankfurt a. M."; Bucer's way of appeasing Luther has offended many. Bullinger has already explained his opinion on Bucer's ["Report from the Holy Scripture"] several times; he fundamentally approves of everything that agrees with the [First Helvetic] Confession and the letter [of the reformed cities of the Confederation] to Luther, but considers Bucer's recent statements about the Lord's Supper to be less clear than earlier ones. However, he unjustly complains about hostilities. Another meeting with him is not necessary. The questions pending at the Bundestag in Schmalkalden regarding the council [No. 934] have been summarized by Johannes Zwick in three points [No. 940], to which Bullinger responds as follows: [1.:] A council convened by the Pope is to be rejected, as he has firstly already condemned the opponents as heretics in advance, secondly is superior in means of power in Mantua, and thirdly unjustly claims dominion over the churches, as he has long been exposed as a tyrant and Antichrist; these reasons for rejection should be publicly stated. The Emperor is indeed entitled to convene a meeting, but it should take place in peaceful times and be well-prepared in Germany, recognizing only the Holy Scripture as authority; otherwise, he is to be obeyed as little as the Pope. If the Curia was ready to send indulgence sellers to Germany, why not also scholars to refute the heretics, which would even benefit the indulgence trade! [2.:] That besides theologians, the authorities are also entitled to have a say in religious matters must be maintained with reference to the pious kings in the Bible and in the Codex Justinianus. [3.:] If necessary, violent resistance may be offered to the Pope, as Joshua, Judas Maccabeus, and Paul did not forgo the protection of arms. Instead of engaging in a conversation with the enemies of the truth at all, it would be wiser to reject their efforts from the outset under the reservation of better instruction from the Scripture. Requests to show the letter to Grynaeus and would like to see the position of the Baselers in return. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I see Bucer is upset, dearest brother; however, I do not see who has upset him. I hear the reason; but among us, there is no one, as far as I know, who has called him a "traitor to the truth of Christ and a deserter of the churches." Regarding the Retractions I had, I explained them to Bucer in person. You also heard him responding to me and our Leo. Indeed, what I testified then, I still regret now, that those Retractions have come to light. Although they find many fair and kind interpreters, many more are offended by them. Certainly, among us, we experience more and more every day how the adversaries of the truth rejoice because of them, and how the pious are saddened. There are those who, for public sermons, console the followers of the papal religion with this very argument, that there is no consistency among us, as we handle and retract everything at our discretion. We are forced to swallow these and other more bitter things unwillingly, and in the meantime, we have nothing safe to oppose. The Bern Disputation is in everyone's hands. Bucer's Retraction is also read, which seems to me not to fully agree with what Bucer disputed there about the articles of our faith "ascended to heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father," etc. This seems to particularly pertain to the fact that what was excellently said in previous expositions, especially in John 16, has now been erased in the recent Retractions. However, if Luther no longer holds the opinion that Bucer attacked there, is there no one who defends it? Therefore, when they see these things removed, it is no wonder if they, secure in victory, are confirmed in error. Furthermore, if the latest writings of Dr. Luther [---], it will be plainly doubtful what he supports. For in the letter to the people of Frankfurt, which he wrote in 1534, he seems to have written quite crudely and little mystically about the Eucharist. His words, if you do not know, are these: "This writing will be a testimony for me before God and the world, if (when) some among you stand on the dwelling, as if your preachers were of one mind with us and taught in the same way about the holy sacrament, that they know from this that we are not at all of one mind. And no one should rely on hearing our teaching from them, which they also mock in many points. [...] Many indeed now teach like us, but some others, now that they see the cart has been driven too far and deep into the mud, and no longer want to sound their previous cry with idle bread and wine in the sacrament, wash their mouths and turn their words differently, but still keep the previous opinion in mind and practice, saying with their mouths that it is truly the body and blood of Christ present in the sacrament. When such a simple man hears this, he thinks they teach just like us, and then goes to the sacrament and receives only idle bread and wine. For their teachers give no more and mean no more. But the secret gloss and understanding is that the true body and blood of Christ is indeed present in the sacrament, but only spiritually and not bodily. It is also received only in the heart with faith and not bodily with the mouth, which receives only idle bread and wine, as before. See, is this not a devilish juggling with the words of Christ, and are the simple hearts not shamefully deceived and robbed of their sacrament?" etc. Our adversaries are not ignorant of these words of Luther, so it is no wonder if even the mere name of retraction, then seeing most things erased that were written in previous expositions against bodily eating for spiritual, they boast of having won. For these and many other reasons, I told Bucer in person that I regret the publication of the Retractions. I regret it more every day, the more I see where these things are being dragged. If it offended Dr. Luther, he could have placated him in another way, which Luther would have accepted, unless he wanted to be less Christian. Now, in my opinion, he has embarked on a path where he perhaps placated one, but offended many. Would that, my brother, all were as concerned with illustrating the truth and presenting it to the church as openly and simply as possible, as we are both anxious in winning over and elevating the ministers of the church!</p>
      <p>Regarding Dr. Bucer's book to the people of MÃ¼nster, there is no need to repeat the same tune so many times. In person, I explained what I aimed at in that letter of mine, then what I approve in that book; I have done this not once in written letters; I have prayed that my letter not be abused. What I approved then, I also approve now, namely, to say everything in a few words, what we expressed in our confession and response to Luther. However, I do not acknowledge those things that are contrary to these or do not fully agree with them. But I also freely admit that what Bucer wrote last about the Eucharist is more intricate and obscure than what he previously published on this very matter. Nor are there lacking good and learned men who solemnly assert that they do not yet understand what he thinks about the matter of the Eucharist in the Retractions, but in the meantime, they neither condemn nor reject him. They wish for a clearer mind. For they entirely believe that this matter can be presented more clearly.</p>
      <p>There is a question about the disparagements that he has endured from us for several years now. I respond that he wrongs us unless he names those disparagers. I am certainly very conscious of this matter, but when asked about other brothers, I can only respond that they strongly hate disparagements. Therefore, he should see to whom he lends his ears to whispers and disparagers. Whenever the brothers from Strasbourg came to us, I think we received them amicably, and we sent them off amicably. If we had anything against them, we admonished them freely. Therefore, we do not know what disparagements or whose he understands.</p>
      <p>As for his request that we set a day for him and judge the hearing, I certainly leave the judgment to posterity and all the saints, and therefore I neither set a day for him nor think any should be set. I think we have agreed enough, and that is why we have written a unanimous confession of faith, so we are not compelled to meet so often. In this, I will remain henceforth. The doctrine of piety is certain. Churches are established among us. We must take care to adorn these and promote them to greater fruitfulness. This is what I had to say in response to your last letter about Bucer's writing, whose services and benefits bestowed upon us we intend to repay not with insults, disparagements, or hatred, but with love, candor, and mutual services.</p>
      <p>Now to those endless questions that I hear are being discussed at the Schmalkalden assembly. However, I seem to have briefly answered all of them if I answer a few. For Dr. Johannes Zwick has reduced all your questions to these three: The first, whether the Mantuan council should be sought at the Pope's convocation or the Emperor's call should be awaited. Here I think the council should not be sought at the Pope's convocation. The reasons are:</p>
      <p>1. The Pope has prejudged that he is trying to eradicate our religion. For the words of the bull are: "We have desired nothing more from the heart and have continually prayed to Almighty God than that the church entrusted to us, long since overgrown with the thorns of so many heresies and errors, may be purged by the working grace of the Holy Spirit and our diligence, and its morals reformed for the better to its due splendor," etc. But what can you do with him who, before the council, has condemned our doctrine unheard as heresy? For what doctrine did he understand if he did not understand ours? "Long since" has emphasis. It also has weight that he calls our religion "thorns of errors." For if this single saying of Paul "avoid a heretical man" was enough to remove Saint Huss from the living at the Council of Constance, certainly that evangelical saying against us will be more evident: "If anyone does not abide in me" (meaning in the holy Roman church, in which the Pope, the vicar of Christ, presides), "he is cast out, withers, and is thrown into the fire," and that of the apostle: "The land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and close to being cursed, whose end is to be burned." Therefore, with Virgil, I exclaim: "Mantua, alas, too close to wretched Cremona!" For it is most wretched, destined for the slaughter of the saints. Why did he not choose Cremona, the most holy? For this would fit more (if one considers the etymology) his purpose. For he compels the council to burn us. But forgive the joke.</p>
      <p>2. The Pope has chosen a place where, if the matter requires, he is also superior in arms and power. Now it is likely that he will want the council to be held in the old manner and will not allow himself to be put in order; indeed, this can be gathered from the context of his bull. But this could not be done without the oppression of the truth. We must, however, beware of those things that hinder the truth, lest it be endangered by our folly. Therefore, who does not understand that the council must also be avoided?</p>
      <p>3. It is not for the Pope to convene a council; partly because we have long since proven that the Pope is not the general bishop nor are all the churches of the Christian world subject to his care. Therefore, when he usurps a right against the truth and the freedom of the churches and assumes dictatorship in the church, he is convicted of being a tyrant. But who, being free and sane, would obey the counsels of a tyrant, whose whole aim is to confirm his tyranny? - partly because the whole scripture, all the saints, and the times themselves proclaim that this is the Antichrist. And indeed, this is the wolf and robber who is accused by the whole world. And the accused sets himself as judge and president of the judgment. That impious sacrilegious and enemy of Christ, who governs the reins of affairs against the word of Christ, presumes to judge the church of Christ. Oh shame, oh crime! We will be insane, mad, indeed most inconstant rascals if we have even allowed this crime to enter our minds. Therefore, I would advise that this Antichrist be utterly despised, so that through our contempt he may feel what we think of the rascal. However, it would be useful if all the reasons were publicly set forth in writing to the world, why the church of Christ despises the Pope's call and council, lest anyone believe that anything is done by us arrogantly. Certainly, no one will call it affection, which the word of Christ commanded.</p>
      <p>Then, as for the Emperor's call, I indeed acknowledge that it is the duty of the Emperor and the princes or magistrates to convene assemblies, but in a legitimate time, place, and manner, and especially with a candid mind and not at all imbued with the spirit of the Antichrist. But if the Emperor or princes were to do what they do by the Pope's counsel, it would make no difference whether we obeyed the edicts of one or the other, nor would we obey the Caesar any less than the Pope when we obey the laws of the Antichrist. However, that is a legitimate time which is not turbulent with warlike tumults, which also grants space for thinking and consulting to those whose interest it is to dispute about religion. To this also seems to pertain that those heads of matters should be proposed in good time, which will be discussed and consulted about. A legitimate place is one that is safe and easily accessible and where error seems to dominate, where heresy has occupied the minds of many. It must be publicly refuted there, so that the seduced may repent. You have some very elegant things about this in St. Ambrose's book of letters 5, chapter 32. What, I ask, do we have to do with Mantua? But if the adversaries say: "What do we have to do with Germany?" - "We teach in it, in it are the churches you accuse of heresy." "We," they say, "teach in Italy; therefore, we must be refuted in Italy." - "Not only in Italy, but in almost all of Europe. For you assume the censorship of all churches." A legitimate manner is one that prescribes that everything be transacted according to the canonical scriptures, that the canonical scripture be the judge, that no one be excluded. For in the Nicene council, the unlearned judged and disputed better than the most learned bishops, so that what pertains to the matter may be said, etc. I would think that the Emperor should be admonished about this if he were to call a council of the Pope. But if, admonishing him with holy things, he would not listen, but proceed to act against us with unjust laws and conditions, I would obey him no more than the pontiff.</p>
      <p>It could also be requested from the Christian princes that they arrange a delegation of the best, most eloquent, and learned men from the entire papal council to Germany, which, traveling through each province, would refute the preachers of the gospel of error. For if this is requested, nothing unjust or new will be requested, since 18 years ago the Roman Curia was so beneficial to Germany that it sent a delegation not only to the metropolises but to small towns, indeed to any villages, to sell the most generous indulgences. For it wanted to promote our salvation. Now, therefore, when the matter of salvation is again at stake, I think it will not be able to deny a delegation that will bring us back into the bosom of the holy mother church. For if the most holy father was so kind then, he will not deny us his service now. Nor will there be a lack of the most ample fruit. For once converted to the Roman church, it will again be possible to sell indulgences for that admitted heresy. Which indeed will be no small gain, provided the delegation can persuade the seduced to repentance with lively arguments. It will give a heap of money.</p>
      <p>The second question is how it can be ensured that the ministers of the word are not separated from the magistrates, but that both defend the truth with common defense. Here I answer that this matter can be easily provided for if the business of the first question succeeds well, in which I advised that no one at all should be excluded who can in any way rightly advise about true religion. It must be diligently demonstrated here that it is not only the ministers of the word, but also the magistrate's duty to defend religion not only with the sword but also with reason and arguments. But we can easily do this if we recall the old scriptural examples of Joshua, Samuel, David, and other faithful kings. In the Justinian Code, too, there are not a few examples of religious kings that are relevant here. What, that from Deuteronomy we most clearly gather that the kings of the people of God were as guardians of the laws? Therefore, I would first ask for this to be granted to me. But if they would not admit the magistrate as a defender of religion, I would have nothing to do with these men as those who set themselves alone as the masters of truth and religion against the word of God.</p>
      <p>The last question is: If the Pope does not accept any fair laws and the Emperor, along with other kings and princes, gives us nothing, but commands adherence to the Pope's decrees, and the Pope condemns the truth, confirms false religion, and persecutes those who protest with the sword of the princes, is it lawful to resist the Pope with war? Absolutely. For if Joshua, the most holy prince of God, thought it his duty to pursue with the sword the perfidy of the Reubenites and their allies, who were thought to have erected an altar against the law of God, how much more is it the duty of a holy magistrate to prevent anyone from erecting altars against the word of God and compelling to impious worship? For they compelled no one to kneel at their altar, etc. The story is known. And that which is reported about the most valiant leader of Judah, Maccabeus, is also well known. And the apostle Paul did not impiously use the arms of the Romans against those who, pretending judgment and disputation outside, conceived parricide inside. This is what I had to say about those questions of yours.</p>
      <p>But why do we dispute these things without fruit? For you will certainly find that these men are pursuing their own business, not the truth. Therefore, we would have acted imprudently if we had had even a little business with these old hands. We have once acknowledged the truth. We have learned that they are in perverse religion. We have once removed what the scripture commanded to remove. We know that we are in the truth. What business, then, do we have with the enemies of the truth? Why do we enter into their counsels? Or why do we receive them into ours? Would it not be better and more prudent to renounce them altogether and respond in these words: "We have God, we have Christ, faith, religion, and the worship of God, and all these things are established according to the scriptures, sought from them and confirmed. In that religion of ours, we will persevere to the end with the grace of Christ confirming us. But if you think we are planning anything against the law of piety and scripture, come, refute us, and better instructed, we will abjure all heresy. But unless this is done with clear and holy scriptures, there is nothing you can expect from us. We abhor your counsels. We do not want your religion. We detest your pride and luxury from the heart. But we desire that Christ and the spirit of Christ live in our hearts."</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Myconius, and do not despise my rusticity and, I think, Christian simplicity. Also, show these to Dr. Grynaeus, our very dear brother. I would also like to see your counsels.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 10, 1537.</p>
      <p>Greet Dr. Grynaeus, Marcus, Carolstadt, Wolfgang, Gastius, and the others.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
