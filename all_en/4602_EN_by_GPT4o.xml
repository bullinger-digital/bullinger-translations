      <p>Your reverence, revered father in Christ, has been faithfully delivered to me.</p>
      <p>In return, I have nothing at all to write, except that six delegates have been appointed to attend the assembly, namely those who were previously sent, with the same mandates. A few from the Upper League cannot do what they want, as they see their practices being understood; because some communities were not summoned to the meetings held in the Upper League, they are dissatisfied, and when the young lord governor from Davos brought up something similar at the last meeting, as if those from the Upper League had spoken in writing or orally with the five places at the assembly held in Baden, the district judge Cabalzar earnestly defended his league and presented many other reasons for their meetings, upon which much good was promised in the name of his league, and among other things, they said that if the matter were to fall, they would stand faithfully. This he, who is the worst in religious matters, which is a sign that he speaks such things even unwillingly, to remove any sinister suspicion from himself, etc. Regarding the death of the Duke of Florence, I have that he was in Rome and was appointed commander of the troops by the Pope, but on his return, he died on the way before reaching Florence. This death is also believed to have disturbed the Pope's plans.</p>
      <p>Regarding the omen, about which I wrote extensively to my father-in-law Collinus, I have this to add: An honorable man from Glarus informed me that people from Glarus ran to NÃ¤fels with fire extinguishers, thinking to extinguish the fire (for that is what they thought it was). Young lord Joachim Metteli (residing at Sulzberg near Rorschach) writes to the lord of Sax, as he claims, that the city of St. Gallen was on fire, but when he arrived in St. Gallen, he found nothing. This letter was sent by the lord of Sax to Captain Georgius, who gave it to me to read.</p>
      <p>Ramschwag, residing at Gutenberg, looked out of the window and said: "I believe Lake Constance is burning." I write this so specifically so that it is understood that all this was directed towards Lake Constance; it was not seen in the sky, but it appeared to rise from the earth; for as far as one could see, there was a fire. These things in passing, you will hear more from Collinus; however, we do not doubt that these things were seen there and by your people. I cannot write more now.</p>
      <p>I send the letters of Dr. Friedrich von Salis, I also send the Basel Confession, which is to be delivered to Dr. Simler, to whom I also give thanks, whom I wish well along with you and all yours. All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Tscharner has lost a most honorable matron, he himself, a sickly widower, is wasting away in grief. Farewell, revered father.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 31, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, renowned for his learning and piety, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his lord and patron.</p>
