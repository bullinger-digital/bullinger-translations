      <p>Honored brother, I wanted to meet you yesterday; but you were not at home.</p>
      <p>God has given me a travel companion, who now urges at the 14th hour; therefore, so that I am not forced to walk alone, I now endure this inconvenience.</p>
      <p>I have paid off in Basel whatever debt was accumulated. I gave Sebastian 20, and not a small amount to others; only Froschauer remains, to whom I have not paid. But you should assure both him and Michael (which I ask of you) that I will soon pay generously. Farewell and pray to God for me, who certainly exposes himself to not insignificant dangers for His glory.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
