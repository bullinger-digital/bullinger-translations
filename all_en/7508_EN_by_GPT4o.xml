      <p>Greetings. I am sending to you, most esteemed lord, a document from which you will learn about the events occurring here and those recently happening in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>I am also sending the letters of Mr. Haller, which Mr. Schenck requested to be included with mine. He also asked me to convey his many greetings to you on his behalf.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, June 21, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten. To the reverend, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the Zurich church, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
