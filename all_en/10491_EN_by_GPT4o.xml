    <p xml:id="regest1">Schuler received Bullinger's letter and his works, including "De testamento seu foedere Dei unico et aeterno" and the commentary on 1 Corinthians, through Gregor Mangolt and shared them with other fellow believers. He thanks him for this gift and praises the works of Bullinger and Konrad Pellikan. Bullinger should pray to God for the healing of the sick members of the Church. As a zealous fighter for Christ and a strong Achilles, he should continue to bravely fight against the enemies of God's word, but also lead the weak and the erring back to Christ. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>We received your letters through Gregor Mangolt along with the booklet "On the One and Eternal Covenant or Testament of God" and some other clearly divine works of yours, especially those that have come to light through your work and labor on the first epistle of Paul. We have shared them with the brothers. We recognize that our heavenly Father openly announces His word to us, albeit differently than before through His servant Moses to the people, and we do not doubt that you are a unique instrument and chosen vessel of God. Therefore, we give thanks to you, or rather to the immortal God through you, who in His goodness and immense mercy has redeemed us by the blood of His Son, regenerated us by the spirit of His mouth, and in these latter times, has abundantly nourished, fed, and cherished us with the sweetness of His truly fruitful and life-giving word, after we had been obscured by human traditions from our earliest days, as they say, and had become emaciated, almost broken and exhausted by the lack of the food of the Holy Spirit that truly refreshes the soul. And what was obscured in us, He has now fully illuminated in our latest times through you and your fellow brother Konrad Pellikan. Moreover, you, dearest brother in Christ, seek to initiate friendship with us. What, I ask, do you consider a stronger bond of true friendship or kinship than brothers born of one father alone, or perhaps members joined together in one body? Therefore, we hope to be joined and united to you and others, much more noble in both doctrine and grace by the grace of God, as both a brother and a member, albeit fragile and weak, of that body of which the apostle teaches Christ to be the head. Wherefore, through that same common head of ours, Christ Jesus, we pray that you may not be ashamed of our wounded member. But come, you - which is our common duty - be our true and specially called and chosen priest, faithful and constant patron, advocate, and intercessor before our most gracious Father. Intercede with your prayers as a most faithful supplicant, that He may mercifully deign to heal and restore by His grace what He recognizes as deficient and wounded in us due to our corrupted nature, "a bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not snuff out" [Isaiah 42:3], He whose nature is to have mercy and do good even to us, though undeserving, He who promises and provides Himself as a safe refuge and our only salvation. You, moreover, as a valiant soldier of Christ, an athlete, you strong Achilles, perform your duty and office bravely, fight fiercely with the sword of the Holy Spirit, overthrow all adversaries of the word with it, unflinchingly convict and suppress the enemies, but in the meantime, support the weak and the frail, console the anxious, and lead the wandering sheep back to the fold of Christ's flock. But why do I call Lydus to the plain? May the best and greatest God, who began through you, complete it in His mercy.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the one salvation of us all, Christ Jesus. Please convey our greetings to our fellow brother Konrad Pellikan and all who follow the doctrine of Christ Jesus in holiness and purity of life. In turn, the brothers with me who profess Christ send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Given in Ravensburg, on the fourth day before the Ides of October, in the year 34.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and faithful dispenser of the mysteries of God, Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his lord and brother in Christ, to be especially revered.</p>
