      <p>Greetings. The other day, Melchior Tilman from Lucerne came to me, perhaps better known to you than needing my introduction, bringing news of what recently happened to him for the sake of the Gospel. Among other things, he attempted to see if I could somehow assist him in obtaining another priesthood and to intercede on his behalf with you, who justly holds much influence. However, I now hear something different from another source, namely that the man has boasted among our people that he has been chosen and will soon be placed in Küsnacht. I cannot accept this without astonishment, especially since he did not even mention a word of this in my presence. Therefore, if this is the case, I easily accept it. If not, I implore that Lucerne be considered in such a way that the bearer of this letter feels he is not being neglected, as he seems to me to be preferred by many. However, let the judgment rest with you and the others who have the authority in these matters. I ask this one thing: Since I and many like me, who are not particularly distinguished in learning and power, are often chosen as ministers, that you receive and support him more, who has been known and approved by me for two years, and by the parishioners for a decade, considering both his poverty and the integrity of his life, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Küsnacht, June 3, 1533.</p>
      <p>Jodocus Kilchmeyer, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
