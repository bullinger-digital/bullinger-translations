      <p>The article, as I wrote to you, since all the cantons up to Basel did not want to burden themselves with the matter, advised the people of Glarus, and they accepted it with a cheerful protestation to remain with their religion; for they are very sincere there. The cantons have also sufficiently provided for themselves and have also opened up to the four places. Thus, the peace was accepted by Lucerne, Uri, Unterwalden, Zug, and Glarus. At the moment, they have been reinstated, and Aman Sch√ºler was the first to sit in the council. The envoy from Schwyz has left, and he is very dissatisfied; for his opinion is that Glarus should accept the council without any reservation. Glarus absolutely does not want that, etc. Zurich, Bern, Lucerne, and Zug have admonished the people of Schwyz to be calm and have allowed the governor Luchsinger to ride up. Whatever they do, they should write to Zurich, where further action will be taken. May God grant all good things. The people of Glarus were happy as they rode home through here, and it is no wonder; for they have been plagued long enough. May God grant that those from Schwyz also come to an end.</p>
      <p>- A friend writes from Geneva that it will soon be besieged; for they are warned that the Allobrogian prince has secretly hired settlers who, with an army recruited in Germany, will suddenly attack and undermine the fortifications within two or three days and capture the city. Therefore, they have hired 600 soldiers and are asking Bern for 300. The people of Bern have refused because these things are uncertain and they do not want to start a war. The same writes that in France, the impious are again full of hope and are plotting something unknown. But the Lord of hosts lives, whom we must pray to, that He may protect us. A treaty was sought by the French. No response, and then all negotiations were dismissed, etc. Farewell. I cannot say more. Greet the friends.</p>
      <p>How the lustful and filthy life of the ministers torments me. Oh, they let it become known, they set it aside from the services, July 7, 1564. Yours always.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother of mine. Chur.</p>
