      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Dear friend, speak with your people, that they earnestly and persistently ensure that we are not burdened again with the holy oath in the alliance. The Lord has inflicted upon us a deadly wound by taking from us Dr. Wolfgang, a most moderate, pious, prudent, and learned man, and my closest and dearest friend. Pray to the Lord that He may deign to heal this wound. May God in heaven have mercy, that I must outlive all my true and dear brothers: Leo, Pellican, Bibliander, Gesner, Martyr, Otto, Erasmus, Megander, and others most dear to me. Deliver me at last from these evils, O Lord God. Within two months, the fiftieth year of my ministry will be completed, yet there is no end. But may the Lord do what is good in His eyes. May He have mercy on me and preserve me. Pray diligently to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
