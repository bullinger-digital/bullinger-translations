      <p>From the letters of Mr. Wolfgang Waidner of Worms to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger written by his own hand... March in the year 1554.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding the obligations: First, my executors will have the mandate that, upon my death, they return those to you to be preserved by your most holy council. Indeed, what if this happens while I am still alive, with only a copy of them retained by me, and my wife and I depend entirely on the faith of your council and church for receiving the annual pension set for the days of our lives? Moreover, the death of both myself and my wife, if not otherwise, for example through the executors (for they are also mortal), but through your merchants going to and returning from Frankfurt twice a year, can be made known to you at any time, so that everything is safe for you even in this place, especially with the original document first transferred there. And so that you know how much I value the authority and faith of your council and the church of ZÃ¼rich, I have decided to deposit the obligations of the Basel people with you for perpetual memory, with this intention, that if ever (which God may graciously avert) it happens that the purer doctrine is corrupted there, with their churchmen either relapsing to papism or colluding (which is also abominable) with the Lutherans on the matter of the Lord's Supper, and the same happens in their schools, that your council may gently, amicably, and fraternally remind the Basel council of their obligations (for I would not want it more severely, lest I seem to be the author of discord among confederated brothers), so that they may henceforth annually turn that pension of three thousand either to marry off poor virgins or to other pious uses for the true poor of Christ according to the last article of the obligations. But if they have been so amicably and fraternally reminded once or twice and have neglected to listen, it shall be left to divine judgment thereafter. For in this case, my conscience is my witness, the obligations themselves are witnesses, and even Christ himself will be a witness in the universal judgment, with what intention I, with my wife deceased, donated the pension of those three thousand to the church, school, and poor of Basel.</p>
