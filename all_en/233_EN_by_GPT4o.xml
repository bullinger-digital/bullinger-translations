      <p>Greetings. At this hour I have received your letters, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, in which you inform me what you have done in my name before the renowned council of your city on the eighth of this month, and what you have obtained and how easily, namely, that which I requested when I was last with you, that I might be allowed to rest under the protection and shadow of your most honorable council. I wish your letters sent to Constance had found me. But thus it seemed to the Lord. I came here to St. Gallen, tossed unexpectedly and disastrously by the storm beyond my intention; for I had decided to stay with you, especially because of the company of learned men and the remarkable kindness, which not only I, but many others have experienced, although this place also has a man both most learned and most kind, the famous Vadianus.</p>
      <p>But he is so occupied with public affairs that it is not very possible to enjoy his company. Now I implore your advice, most excellent Bullinger. As I indicated in my recent letters, my small belongings have been brought here; for their transport from Constance, a journey of 4 miles or, as some count, three, I paid 24 florins. Such expenses, if they are to be repeated and borne several times, will be intolerable for me, unless I wish to neglect the necessity of sustenance, which I cannot. For I see that everything is very expensive everywhere, no less for exiles than for residents and citizens. Therefore, it seems that by necessity, it is advisable for my affairs to avoid such transports until it is possible to settle in a certain place.</p>
      <p>In this matter, I need your help and advice. I therefore beg you by Christ, to inform me of your decision. Three days ago, my wife began to fall seriously ill with a certain little daughter. I attribute the cause of the illness to the distress and anxiety caused by the siege of Constance. I commend both myself and her, along with all mine, to your prayers and faith, which I do not doubt you will steadfastly maintain towards me. I pray to the Lord to keep you constant and firm in His faith.</p>
      <p>Farewell most excellently, most learned Bullinger.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 18th August 1548.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all the brothers and friends, especially to your household and my Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful overseer of the church of ZÃ¼rich, dearest brother and friend in Christ.</p>
