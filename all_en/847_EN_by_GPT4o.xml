      <p>Greetings and Peace. You indeed act wisely, my Bullinger, and show yourself to be not at all arrogant, as you do not wish to prescribe what should be done to such great men; for it is your nature not to think highly of yourself, which you know is a dangerous disease in a theologian. Therefore, not only because of your exceptional learning but also because of your remarkable virtues, we rightly love you. I also give you eternal thanks for your kindness towards me, for allowing me to obtain from you what I wanted, and I promise you my loyalty, effort, care, and diligence in return, so that my goodwill will never be lacking to you. But, my Bullinger, I was so far from wanting to send back your letters to you that I immediately took care to have them sent to Bern along with our senate and college. England is pleasing, where one can easily reach with the help of merchants without danger, and not at great expense; but we will leave this to the discretion of our lords. It would not have been necessary to consult them if that discordant harmony had not brought many evils not only to the Swiss but to almost all of Germany. Our steward from Königsfeld told me that he learned from you that there are many, both bishops and abbots and others, who now accept the true doctrine of religion. Please inform our Platner of their names so that he may write them to me; for I have scarcely heard anything in a long time that has given me greater pleasure.</p>
      <p>Christ will reign, and then, as I sang somewhere, the foul beast will fall. Farewell. Hastily from Brugg, February 26, 1550. My family greets you and your entire household, which never speaks of you except with the highest honor.</p>
      <p>Those whom you greeted wish you well. Your Toxites.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and kind man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zürich, my esteemed lord.</p>
