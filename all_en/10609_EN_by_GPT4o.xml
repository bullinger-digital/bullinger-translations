      <p>Greetings. I thought it was trivial, but now I understand from your letters that it is serious - I am speaking of the tumult. They have your man in custody, and if they examine him properly, they will certainly hear something that will be useful to know. The name is known to me, as I have never heard anything good about him. I am surprised that the name belongs to another.</p>
      <p>You think very poorly of the Frenchman, and rightly so, and better of the Emperor, who if he remains as he has been until now, I would feel the same. But listen and judge: Both are indeed courting the Germans seriously. If the Frenchman wins them over into friendship, nothing else will happen, Germany will remain its own master. But if the Emperor wins over the Germans, he will attempt to establish a monarchy over the entire Christian world. While the nobility understands this, they are in doubt as to which side to lean towards, indeed they are grieved, fearing for German liberty. I did not gather this from myself, but from a certain noble and evangelical man three days ago, who is very concerned about German affairs. He spoke almost in these words: "If the Frenchman is defeated, it is certain that the Spaniard will attempt to take our liberty no differently than he began in Lower Germany. May it be far from the Germans to bear this burden, which he is preparing." This has thrown me into doubt, so that I almost do not know which of the two evils to choose. I write this to you so that you may see the dangers of these times.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you wrote at the end, I will respond another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 9, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your O. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
