      <p>Greetings and best wishes. When I consider your venerable age, the richness and abundance of your learning, and the flow and greatness of your intellect, and on the other hand, deeply reflect on my own youth, the barrenness of my knowledge, and the weak powers of my small intellect, most vigilant bishop, I cannot help but be deterred from the duty of writing. And although your excellency instructed me, upon my departure from Z端rich, to inform you of our affairs whenever the opportunity arose and to occasionally write about the state of our republic and church, to tell the truth, I have often hesitated until now, wondering whether I should write or remain silent forever. However, when I considered that you are endowed with every kind of humanity and such ease that anyone interested in good literature can write to you and approach you freely, I resolved to break my silence, especially since there was a certain and worthy reason to write. Indeed, when Salomon Rappensteiner was about to return to Z端rich, he earnestly requested me to commend him to your humanity.</p>
      <p>Since I have observed that he is endowed with honest morals and a good disposition, inclined to every form of virtue, I could not deny him his just request. Therefore, I earnestly wish to ask you, most illustrious man, to embrace, support, and assist this Salomon as if he were your son. Because I am entirely convinced and know that, due to your singular benevolence and humanity with which you pursue those interested in literature, you will by no means fail this young man, I do not wish to use many words in commending him, lest I be a nuisance to you, a very busy man.</p>
      <p>Before I close this letter, I must express my gratitude to your excellency for having embraced me so kindly and overwhelmed me with all sorts of benefits while I was still in Z端rich; but I cannot find the words to do so. Therefore, as an expression of thanks, I offer and dedicate myself and all that is mine to you.</p>
      <p>May your excellency fare well through Him who alone can grant salvation and immortality. Written hastily and spontaneously in Friedberg on the day before the calends of October in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>Perpetually obliged to your excellency, Heinrich Vietor of Friedberg. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Z端rich and most vigilant bishop, his uniquely esteemed lord.</p>
