      <p>Most excellent father. Although nothing new occurs to me at the moment that I might write to you, I would like you to know that we are all well in the Lord and wish that you too, along with your entire family and brothers, are in good health. The commendations you gave me to deliver here, I have delivered most faithfully, and I hope they will not be considered ordinary.</p>
      <p>Today we heard that a certain tumult arose in the camp besieging Magdeburg, and it was so great that they almost came to blows with each other. For this reason, Moritz left with the entire army, and Magdeburg was freed from the siege. If this is true, we must give thanks to God, who brings death and gives life. Please convey my greetings in my name to Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gwalter, and Mr. Johannes Frisius. Farewell and pray for us. Basel, June 4, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Hieronymus Massurius.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the word of God.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
