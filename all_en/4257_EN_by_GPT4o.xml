      <p>S. D. You wish for me to write extensively about French affairs.</p>
      <p>However, I have nothing to write except rumors, and now I receive letters from Bern testifying that rumors are coming from France that there are about 60,000 conspirators and their plans have been discovered, from which some of their leaders have been captured, and the truth of the matter is being extracted from them through torture. It is also said that Guise, equipped with soldiers, is wandering and disturbing and slaughtering scattered cohorts not yet united in strength. If this is so, it indeed happens as I thought it would, that a peasant war would arise in France just as it once did in Germany, in which countless people would be slaughtered and the gospel would be heard very poorly due to the crime of sedition. Let us pray to the Lord that the premature and immature plans of some do not harm the church.</p>
      <p>When a crown is given to your wife, nothing is given to you. However, I acknowledge that I owe you very much.</p>
      <p>It is merely a sign of recognition. Therefore, do not reject the humble gift.</p>
      <p>I demand nothing at all for the horse from Mr. Philipp, except this one thing and the price that is owed to the blacksmith.</p>
      <p>If you are satisfied, then I am too.</p>
      <p>The son is recovering with difficulty, referring to quinces during the treatment.</p>
      <p>See to it that you do not yield in expelling Beccaria, lest they badly finish the poorly begun business in other and more numerous matters. Handle it with justice, not with force; if he has done something dishonorable outside of religion, let him be convicted; otherwise, they will allow anyone to be expelled according to their whim. Thus you will be subjects of the Rhaetians, who will govern you with their mandates, etc. Farewell and greet Mr. Legate, Mr. Philipp, Mr. Pontasella, the consuls.</p>
      <p>Also, send your letters to us as soon as you can, from which we will understand what the legate has, what is happening with you and in Italy. Zurich, April 5, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, his most esteemed and dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
