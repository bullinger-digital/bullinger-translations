    <p xml:id="regest1">Belényesi is unknown to Bullinger, but in view of Bullinger's kindness and piety, he asks him to initiate prayers in Zurich for the beleaguered churches of Hungary. Two years ago, the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I] razed twelve cities and smaller towns [in Hungary] to the ground. Since the second half of March [1545], he is invading Hungary again, and the first part of his army has already reached Buda [Ofen]. - [P.S.:] Hungarian envoys, who rushed to the Diet of Worms to King Ferdinand [I] because of the [new] Turkish threat, have communicated this [prayer] request to him.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>My lord, I am unknown to you, nor has there ever been any acquaintance between us before. However, relying on your humanity and piety, I dare to request your service with great confidence for necessary matters. I will say in one word what I want you to do: Two years ago, that tyrant and enemy of the entire Christian religion, the Turk himself, completely destroyed twelve illustrious cities along with many villages and towns and with the destruction of the most wretched people. Now indeed, in the last part of March, he has come to Hungary with a huge multitude. The first part of his army has already reached Buda [Ofen], and like locusts, they have filled the entire plain of Hungary, and now there is no hope of our liberation placed in human strength, only in God alone. As always in Him, now especially we must deal with God concerning this imminent danger and affliction, under which that calamitous church, which is in Hungary, is placed. Therefore, my lord, I ask you for your charity and piety, with which you are bound towards the church of Christ, to pour out prayers with your holy church to the Lord, that the Lord may deign to mitigate that great punishment, with which the church of Christ, which is in the remnants of Hungary, has been afflicted for many years. This is what I wanted you to do in the name of the afflicted church. The brevity of time does not allow me to be more lengthy in writing.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and may the Lord preserve you for the benefit of His church. Frankfurt, on the first day of April in the year of our Lord 1545.</p>
      <p>Gregor Belényesi, a Hungarian by nation, now for the first time returns from France to his homeland.</p>
      <p>I heard this custom from the Hungarian envoys, who were directly heading to Worms to King Ferdinand because of the danger that threatens both Hungary and Germany.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished minister of Jesus Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the church of Zurich, his dearest lord, etc. In Zurich.</p>
