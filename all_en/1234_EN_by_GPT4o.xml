      <p>Greetings. I am exceedingly glad to have found our letters again, and I do not think they were unsealed for any other reason than that whoever happened upon them by chance hoped to find money hinted at within. I will ensure that everything is delivered and received with better faith in the future, although even the most diligent sometimes tend to make such errors.</p>
      <p>Regarding Michael, he is well, although I know that he spoke to his colleague as I wrote to you. I have always encouraged Funck to pursue peace and harmony, even though by nature he strongly abhors discord. May the Lord preserve both in His peace for the edification of His church through the unity of the spirit.</p>
      <p>I was completely unaware that your Consensus with Calvin on the sacraments had been published, as Christ is my witness, before I received your letter. Therefore, I wrote to our Mangold, asking him to send me a copy if it is available for sale there, which I will read diligently upon receipt, and I will inform you as soon as possible whether it pleases me.</p>
      <p>You did not sufficiently consider the state of the question I sent to you; for I was not asking whether such a scoundrel, as I described to you, should be appointed to the church; for no one who has read even a little would affirm that. But I was asking this, which you receive again here in the note, where I beseech you by the Lord to respond regarding the magistrate; I am not speaking of the magistrate who appoints such a person to his own, but who permits or overlooks if one of his citizens, running voluntarily from another church, is received into the ministry; for this is disputed among some, etc.</p>
