    <p xml:id="regest1">The two Zurichers [bearers of the present letter], Hans Hug and Meinrat Oggenfuß, came from Moravia to Haller. Due to their long journey, they had no money left. Haller wanted to help them, but he himself had nothing at the moment, especially since he had recently lent [Hans Wilpert] Zoller 30 florins. He had also had some bad experiences. Therefore, he lent each of them only [one] crown, with the explanation that the city clerk [Georg Frölich] had advanced them the amount and expected them to repay it to Bullinger within 14 days. For this, both Zurichers issued a written receipt to Haller. Bullinger should send the money to Haller immediately upon receipt, who will then destroy the receipt.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [P.S.:] The amount that Haller owes for the copies of the writing [“Hoffnung der Gläubigen”] he has already ordered should be deducted by Bullinger from the two crowns, and only the remainder should be sent back to Haller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The mayors [Hans Welser and Jakob Herbrot] set off yesterday with about 100 horsemen to receive the princes in Donauwörth. Ammann [Hans] Vogler [the Elder], who accompanied them, wanted to lend [Hug and Oggenfuß] the money, but to their great annoyance, he had already left earlier.</p>

      <p>Greetings. These two citizens of Zurich, Hans Hug and Meinrat Oggenfuß, came to me from Moravia, completely stripped of money due to their long journey, asking if I could lend them at least a few florins.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I myself am so devoid of money that I have nothing to spare (since a few days ago I lent 30 florins to Zoller), and I could not satisfy their request, yet I did not want to send my fellow countrymen away empty-handed (although both of them were unknown to me except by face). However, because one cannot trust just anyone (for I have been deceived so many times that I am cautious wherever I can be), I gave them [one] crown each, under the pretense that the city clerk had lent them these crowns, with the expectation that they would return them to you within 14 days. They left their written receipt with me for this transaction. Therefore, if they return the money to you, I beg you to send it back to me as faithfully as possible. They instructed me to tear up the receipt after the money is received.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Farewell. August 5th.</p>
      <p>Deduct the amount for the books I requested in other letters from these crowns; send the remainder. The mayors set off yesterday with about 100 horsemen to Donauwörth to receive the princes. Likewise, Ammann Vogler followed them. He had said he would lend them the money, but he left for Donauwörth, which greatly annoys them.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Haller.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, his esteemed father.</p>
