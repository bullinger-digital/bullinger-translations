    <p xml:id="regest1">Returns the writings borrowed from Bullinger with thanks. Bernese council elections: Wolfgang von Wingarten is back in the council, but treasurer Bernhard Tillmann is not; six new younger councilors; Georg Schöni became Venner; Sebastian von Diesbach moved to Freiburg, his brother Hans Rudolf, suspected as an enemy of the reformed faith, was also not elected. The synod was scheduled for April 22. In Geneva, Guillaume Farel and Pierre Viret are preaching. Freiburg therefore demands the dissolution of the alliance from Geneva, but Geneva refuses; an arbitration court is to decide on this in Lausanne. Haller suspects a plan by the Catholics: The Genevans should be attacked because of their faith, so that the five places and the Valaisans could more easily fall on the Bernese, who had to protect Geneva, from behind. The four reformed "bandits" from Solothurn, who are staying on Bernese territory, are being used by the Confederates as a pretext to start the war. Simon Sulzer praises the hospitality of the Zurichers. Haller asks for news. Megander wants to have his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians printed; the Zurichers should review it.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I return what you entrusted to me, dearest Heinrich, and you have answered my many and unusual questions so well that I can raise no further objections.</p>
      <p>Wingarten has returned to the council, but not the treasurer, because he has aroused the hatred of many for a long time. Six others have been added, men who, as far as words are concerned, are quite pious, but young and inexperienced, and unless the Lord directs their hearts and counsels, I fear they may someday prove to be like Rehoboam's advisors. Georg Schöni, a man of both studies and ministers, a patron, not unlearned either, was unexpectedly elected to the butchers' guild and succeeded Hagio. Thus, everything has turned out quite successfully. The mayor of Diesbach has given up his citizenship with us, resigned, and moved to Freiburg; as of today, no Diesbacher sits in the small council, which no Bernese can suspect, yet the mayor still has a brother with us, a very honorable and wise man; but since he is suspected of being an enemy of our religion, it has affected his election. Our brothers in the countryside have requested a synod; it will now be on April 22. Be aware, not much else will be dealt with there; however, whatever happens, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, Farel is preaching and now after him Viret, a very learned young man. The people of Freiburg have demanded the dissolution of the alliance from a large and small council, indeed also from the community; for they are compelled to do this, otherwise the Antronians will demand the treaties from them. The people of Geneva do not want to give up the alliance, but rather offer legal proceedings; the court date is now in Lausanne. And that is the plan: as soon as they give up the alliance, they will be attacked because of their faith, considering that Bern will be obliged to protect them and draw them in. As soon as that happens, the Valaisans will follow the Bernese on the pretext, while the Antronians will either besiege Argovia or another part of the territory.</p>
      <p>Four reformed "bandits" from Solothurn have moved behind us; they will urge all Confederates from our territory; if we already want to hold them to account, the war will have its beginning. That is the current situation with us. Otherwise, I have no news.</p>
      <p>Sulzer cannot praise enough your honors, kindness, and goodness, shown to him; he will soon write himself. Dear friend, let us know what news has come from Frankfurt. Leo has written to me. I know well, you are responsible for it. I will write again soon. That notary is the servant of our bookseller, to whom you can safely entrust anything confidential. Megander wants to have his commentary on the Ephesians printed. I have seen some things, but very few. Rellican's style is such that he has put everything in order with his work. You will indicate which are worthy of the press.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>April 18, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic of Zurich, his own brother and dearest of all.</p>
