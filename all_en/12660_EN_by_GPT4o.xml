    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Today, Frölich received Bullinger's letter from September 30 [not received]. Two other letters from Bullinger [not received] arrived earlier. He did not respond to these, but he conveyed news to Ambrosius Blarer with the request to forward them to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In view of his friendship with Bullinger and [Joachim] Vadian, he gladly advocated for Hieronymus Sailer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Hans Wilpert Zoller is doing well. Bullinger should inform his mother [Agnes Zoller, née Schmid] and siblings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The [Schmalkaldic League] is satisfied with the Swiss mercenaries. However, due to the sudden [outbreak of war, the Swiss captains] could not be selected very carefully. In the future, more caution must be exercised!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It is good that Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] wrote to Bullinger [HBBW XVII, No. 2581]! Frölich forwarded the situation communicated by Bullinger [regarding the Swiss] alliances and the defamation [of the Protestant Swiss by] Emperor [Charles V.]. However, he does not know what was decided on this and will inquire again with the Augsburg authorities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The matter with [Thomas] Naogeorg is very disturbing! Bullinger should remain silent about it until the end of the war. In the meantime, efforts are being made to find a position for Naogeorg. Frölich learned from him that he did not assert the [articles of faith] attributed to him in the form they were written down.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Between the [Schmalkaldic League] and the Imperial forces, faith and trust are destroyed, so no peace is to be expected. Moreover, Frölich has heard nothing about peace negotiations. Therefore, there is no reason for concern.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] The Imperial army has moved from Bavaria to the Nördlinger Ries, some distance from the Schmalkaldic League. The [Schmalkaldic League] immediately followed them. On October 4, both sides encountered each other and formed battle lines. But due to the advantageous position of the enemies, a trench in between, and the onset of night, they withdrew again. Nevertheless, skirmishes occurred. Over 30 Imperial soldiers fell. The [Schmalkaldic League] suffered only a few losses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The [Schmalkaldic League] is stationed near Nördlingen, the Emperor not far from there. A confrontation is likely to occur. The Emperor is setting the villages in the Nördlinger Ries on fire. He and his sodomites are worse than the Turks!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] It is just reported that the Imperial forces apparently want to move back to Augsburg. However, this seems unlikely, as the cold makes a prolonged field camp impossible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Frölich intends to meet the pastors sent from Zurich to Augsburg [Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder, Lorenz Meyer, and Thoman Ruman] in friendship. He heard that they are serious both in teaching and in their way of life. [Wolfgang] Musculus, however, fears Lorenz [Meyer] and would prefer if he were active in the countryside instead of in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Bullinger will now be aware of what the [German princes and] estates have written to Zurich, to Bern, and to the other [Protestant places]. May this contribute to a good relationship! The [Catholic] Five Places should be left in their hostile attitude for the time being until God remedies it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Bullinger should inform the Zurich mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater] of the letter's content. May the Lord be with Bullinger, his family, and all [Protestants]!</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with us, most beloved lord and brother. Today, I received your letter, dated the last day of September. Before that, I also received two letters from you, to which I did not respond in general, but I wrote to our dear lord and brother, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, about the situation as far as I am aware, with the attached request to forward this to you promptly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>What I did for Hieronymus Sailer was done willingly and fairly, for your name is great with me; likewise, Mr. Vadian's testimony holds much weight with me. No thanks are needed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Hans Wilpert Zoller's situation is well. You may inform his honorable mother and siblings of the same.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding the Swiss mercenaries, ours are well satisfied. The matter has always proceeded in such a way that the choice of people could not prosper. In the future, more care must be taken.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am very pleased to hear that the Landgrave wrote to you, for his matters are solid and well-founded. I timely informed the Landgrave about the situation with the alliances and the Emperor's defamation. I do not know if anything was written or otherwise acted upon. I will raise the matter again with my lords.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The case of Naogeorg, a very good man, greatly terrifies me, but it makes me more cautious not to trust the gospel of some. You will keep the matter secret until these disturbances have been settled. In the meantime, we will consider how to provide for the good man. He denies having asserted the articles in the manner they were presented.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I cannot foresee any peace between us and the enemies, as there is no middle ground, for trust and faith have already vanished. I have also heard of no negotiations. Therefore, be without worry on this account.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Emperor has withdrawn with all his people from Bavaria and, by a detour, moved somewhat further from us to the Ries, a mile away from Nördlingen - our troops hurriedly followed, so that on the 4th of this month they came close to each other, formed their battle lines on both sides, and stood against each other for over 6 hours. However, since the enemies had a great advantage and there was a trench between them, so that ours would have had to attack over the trench with concern and danger (likewise, the enemy did not want to leave their advantage), they withdrew; the night also prevented it. But great skirmishes occurred, and in one of them, over thirty of the enemies were laid low. And ours, praise God, have suffered very little damage so far.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Ours are stationed near Nördlingen, the Emperor not far from there. And since he is in retreat, it will not fail that they will clash at the waters or narrow paths that the area has, and hardly come apart without a fight. The Emperor is burning everything he can in the Ries. And there is more than Turkish tyranny with him and his sodomites.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Now news comes that the enemy seems to be preparing to move back to Augsburg, although I do not worry about it, as the cold will not allow them to stay in the field much longer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Your sent church servants shall be agreeable dear friends and brothers to me. I also hear that they are of all good in teaching and life. Our Musculus fears Master Lorenz and therefore would prefer him to be active in the countryside. What has been decided, time will tell. However, you will not doubt that everything will be well provided for each one.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>You now know what has been written to your lords, Bern, etc., by our estates and how they mean it. I hope it will bring good friendship. Therefore, let the Five Places remain ill-disposed until God grants further grace!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>May you show these things to your lords, the consuls, with the expression of my willing service. The grace of the Lord be with your house and us all. Amen. October 7, 1546. Georg Frölich, city clerk in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed (Antistes) in the word of God. Zurich, etc.</p>
