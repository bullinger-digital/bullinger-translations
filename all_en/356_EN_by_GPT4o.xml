      <p> Greetings. It has been almost half a year since I wrote to you from Augsburg about the state of my affairs; but just as nothing is stable in human affairs, so many things also change with me. I thought at that time that I would stay there longer and await the outcome of miraculous events; but the Lord saw it differently. You may have heard that the Emperor graciously forgave me and all the people of Augsburg and released me from a function that had long been very troublesome to me, which brought me much joy, and therefore I was in good hope that nothing more would stand in the way of my purpose. But behold, while I am thus secure, some of the malevolent nobles pretend a new indignation of the Emperor against me, without any reason being given, and they cause me to be treated by the magistrate in such a way that I must leave the city. When I realized that this could be done under tolerable conditions, I immediately agreed and yielded to malice. Moreover, even there, true joy is rare for the good. Therefore, on the 23rd of November, I moved with my wife and children to Kaufbeuren, where I hope to spend the winter among the rustic and impious people. You can now write to me more boldly, namely first to the people of St. Gallen, then to Lindau, Isny, and Kempten, where our Thomas Naogeorgus is now acting as a preacher of the word, hopefully for a long time; he will safely send letters to me; for only 4 miles separate me from him. </p>
      <p> The people of Nuremberg have accepted pure papacy, except only for the major canon in the mass, which will soon follow; since Osiander did not approve of this, he was dismissed, and when he thus became an ordinary citizen, he asked the council whether it would be safe for him to live as a private person under the protection of the magistrate. </p>
      <p> They replied that they could promise him nothing. Moved by this word, Osiander immediately left Nuremberg and went to Denmark, if I am not mistaken. The people of Augsburg are now imitating the people of Nuremberg; for this reason, they have instructed their preachers to baptize infants with chrism and oil and to buy or receive such remedies from the bishop. The external appearance of the churches is miserable, and it is no wonder if someone says that they see no church at all now. I willingly live in exile and suffer disgrace with loss; for I seem to myself to have moved every stone so that God's glory might shine through men; thanks be to God. </p>
      <p> I once wrote that the spectators of this tragedy would also become actors; if this happens soon, who will excuse themselves from ignorance of these matters? But I do not deny that divine long-suffering has always acted on earth in such a way that it has wanted to reveal its majesty to wretched mortals beyond and contrary to hope. You will give your souls to Christ and the rest to the prince, so that things may be done without bloodshed; the people of Fünfkirchen give you words, from which blows will be made. </p>
      <p> Please send the enclosed letters to Schertler and write to him that if he wants to reply, he should give it to you, which you can then send to me in Kaufbeuren. </p>
      <p> Do not be offended by these my words; I am entirely yours and will remain so. It may be that I will be with you soon. Farewell. Give my warmest greetings to all friends in the Lord from me. 29th of November 1548 from Kaufbeuren. </p>
      <p> Your Georg Frölich (Laetus) etc. </p>
      <p> To the Christian, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the well-deserved prelate of the church in Zurich, my especially dear lord and friend, to be delivered. Zurich. </p>
