    <p xml:id="regest1">Pergener and his fellow believers are grateful to Bullinger for the commentary on the Pauline Epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Epistles of Peter, and assure him of the favor of many [followers] in Zittau and in neighboring places, especially in Bohemia. Pergener possesses [apart from the commentary on the Epistles of John] all the commentaries by Bullinger on the Epistles of the New Testament and the Acts of the Apostles that have been published so far, as well as his works on the Covenant of God, on the Nature of Christ, and on the Office of the Prophet; since not all of his fellow ministers have access to these writings, they eagerly await the delivery at the Frankfurt Fair. Will Theodor [Bibliander] write more in German? Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace in Christ our Lord we wish to you perpetually, most learned man.</p>
      <p>We are rightly to be reproached for the fault of ingratitude, as we have not expressed any thanks to you for your various and excellent commentaries, through which you have illuminated for us the epistles of Saint Paul, especially the Acts of the Apostles, and also the writings of Saint Peter, so that aided by these, the pious brothers confidently apply themselves to the divine scriptures.</p>
      <p>But to dispel this fault, believe me, dear Bullinger, there are many not only here but also in other neighboring cities, especially in Bohemia, who wish you and your churches the very best and pray for nothing but utmost happiness; thus, in place of the benefit we owe you, there is a most willing spirit, as the saying goes. I do not wish to flatter; I know how piously they often speak and judge about you and your churches in my presence, eagerly inquiring whether anything new has been sent to us from Zürich or Basel.</p>
      <p>Your commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles, which you sent me a year and a half ago as a symbol of perpetual friendship, are now worn by my hands, followed by the commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans, both to the Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus, Philemon, both of Peter, to the Hebrews, also the golden booklet On the Covenant or the Sole and Eternal Testament of God, also On Both Natures in Christ and On the Office of the Prophet. But not all brothers have the opportunity to use these commentaries due to the scarcity of copies; for few are brought, the reason for which I do not know. In the previous year 1536, we see that you published nothing except the commentary on the Epistle to the Thessalonians with the others, which you issued in January. We hope the approaching Frankfurt Fair will bring us some of your writings. While I wanted to write these few things to you, dearest Bullinger, so that you can be certain that we remain steadfast in the word of God and hold your writings in unique esteem among us.</p>
      <p>I will write the rest to Theodor in the German language, which is more familiar to me than the others, and no wonder; for I am overwhelmed with many civil affairs.</p>
      <p>Other brothers outside Zittau greet you and your fellow ministers: Jacob Mraczek, scribe at Nymburk on the Elbe River, a Bohemian, Nicholas Bitensis, scribe at Turnov, also a Bohemian, Francis Boarius, senator at Lubań, Ludovicus Flosselius, a citizen of the same city, all of whom, along with other brothers, wish you the very best, and I wish you to fare very well in Christ. Pray to God for us.</p>
      <p>Given at Zittau, on the 15th day of the month of February in the year 1537 since the redemption of the world.</p>
      <p>Oswald Pergener, etc., from public letters.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and equally pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the word of God in the church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
