      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your letters with the booklet on April 17th from your courier; but at this time, with the legate absent and residing in Lyon, I cannot conveniently offer it to him except through a public messenger, whom we expect at any moment. Cast aside all worry; I will ensure that the booklets, properly secured, reach the hands of the legate, even though I have not yet decided what I wish to do with the booklet addressed to the king, since the king is expected and might lead the army through Alsace: I could more conveniently send it to Schertlin, but I will deliberate on what should be done.</p>
      <p>I deeply regret the English people's inconsistency and cruelty towards the best men: I would rather live among the Turks and perhaps be safer than among that people, who are constantly agitated by various seditions. Do you think the gospel will remain long among such people, who have not once instituted a reformation, which they soon abolished for trivial reasons?</p>
      <p>Here is some news: They say Gonzaga was hanged in the castle of Milan by the imperial forces; for they intend to hand over the castle to the French, and many others have been quartered. Furthermore, they say Granvelle's son was beheaded by the Emperor because he persuaded the Emperor to imprison the Germans and expel the preachers.</p>
      <p>Schertlin's courier was hanged by a nobleman from Granville. This nobleman will undoubtedly stir up trouble in Hungary; for some nobles are expected from Schertlin's side, whom they will not leave unpunished. The bishop and the other leaders have ordered that all our people in Alsace prepare food for some unknown persons. Every farmer is to have two sacks of flour in his house; if he cannot afford it, the wealthier farmer should provide for him; this was ordered around Palm Sunday. The peasants are in great fear. Strasbourg has three banners, which they ordered to move into the priests' houses. The King of France is in Nancy, a very fortified town. Metz has surrendered. Soon he will either cross the Rhine River or head for the Belgians. There is a large amount of money with us, which they will send to the king once he has crossed the Alps. Brentius and the ministers from Strasbourg have not yet been heard in Trent. The legate from Strasbourg, Sleidanus, has returned and says the preachers will soon return with nothing accomplished.</p>
      <p>Consider what those deceitful bishops are planning. Those returning from Trent say they have seen nothing of the Emperor's preparations; some say he has been dead for a long time, others say different things, as the common people usually do.</p>
      <p>Farewell. More when the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>I do not know which books you want; please specify. I could not find your letters. However, I am sending one or two, so the courier does not return home completely empty-handed. Basel, April 18, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>You know the state of Poland from Coelius and the beginnings of the war between the Muscovites and the Poles.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned gentleman, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my gracious lord, to his hands.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
