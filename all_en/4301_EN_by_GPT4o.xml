      <p>Most esteemed Lord Bullinger, I have nothing to write now except that it has been reported that King Philip's fleet was defeated by the Turks near Tripoli, and consequently, he lost about 60 galleys or merchant ships. Indeed, it is regrettable that the Christian king suffered such a loss from the greatest enemy of the Christian name. Otherwise, we are quite peaceful here, except that we are still troubled by a severe shortage; however, we hope it will be alleviated at some point, and may God make it so. - By God's grace, I and all my family are well; I earnestly wish to hear the same from you and yours, whom may the most gracious God continually keep safe. I think I will attend the upcoming Chur fair and then write to you more extensively from Chur, especially if any news arises. My son sends his regards to you and all your household and wishes you all well.</p>
      <p>Farewell greatly.</p>
      <p>Written in haste at Chiavenna, June 2, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted, Friedrich von Salis, Commissioner of Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord. ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.</p>
