      <p>Greetings. I have written to you, esteemed lords and dearest brothers, once and again this spring, and I hope my letters have been faithfully delivered to you. I attribute the fact that I have not yet received a response from you to your serious and various affairs. Indeed, I would not wish to hinder your holy pursuits through me; rather, I pray to the Lord to remove all obstacles from you, so that you may proceed swiftly on the Lord's path with much fruit, as we confess has been done so far by God's grace, and for this, we give thanks to our Lord God.</p>
      <p>Various rumors are spreading here about the inhabitants of the Val d'Aosta, who are miserably harassed by the Duke of Savoy, and also about the serious disturbances and upheavals in France. We would like to be informed by you about these matters, so that if they are fortunate, we may rejoice and exult with our brothers, but if they are unfortunate, we may not cease to pray to the Lord for those in danger. With us, all things are moderately well, except that the Unterwalden and Schwyz, the most bitter of all the Five Cantons, continually breathe heavy threats against the people of Glarus. However, we hope the Lord will restrain their ferocity.</p>
      <p>Although the people of Glarus are steadfast, it is still right that you also invoke the Lord for their safety. In the Grisons, the beginnings of dissensions are sprouting among the ministers.</p>
      <p>We hope, however, that those who seem too inclined towards new things will be promptly restrained. It seems to me that it is more timely and serious to assist the struggling matters, as some minds seem more inclined towards condemned doctrines, etc. The bearer of this letter to you is a good man, a Pole, Christophorus Trecius.</p>
      <p>He brought to me two noble boys with a tutor, etc. He brought an excellent testimony from the churches.</p>
      <p>He will devote himself to studies with you.</p>
      <p>He is sent by the churches; they wish him to be well instructed in true religion, so that he may someday serve them with fruit, open a school, and form ministers of the church; they love our churches and are pleased with our simple kind of doctrine. Therefore, I commend this Trecius to you and beg, through our friendship, that you love him and assist his studies, and finally be his fathers.</p>
      <p>I have praised to him your faith, diligence, and humanity; he loves you and desires you. Therefore, for your piety, ensure that, as much as is in you, he returns to his own with much fruit. But why do I call you to what I know you are already most ready to do? Love us in the Lord and farewell with all the fellow ministers and brothers; all of ours greet you. Zurich, May 17, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger. [...] To the most illustrious men, John Calvin and Theodore Beza, the most faithful ministers of the Church of Geneva, esteemed lords and dearest brothers of mine. Geneva.</p>
