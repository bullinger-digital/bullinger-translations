    <p xml:id="regest1">The Landgrave has received Bullinger's letter [No. 2569] well from the hands of Heinrich Thomann. The bearer was accommodated in the chancellery.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Enclosed, Bullinger receives records of the past combat actions with the enemy. Bullinger should know that he can count on the Landgrave.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [Enclosure 1:] On the night of August 28 to 29, about 1000 Spaniards attacked the camp of the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony], specifically the troop unit under [Johann von] Heideck. The attackers all wore a white cloak to recognize each other in the night. The [Schmalkaldic League] lost about 40 men, who were killed more by their own than by the enemies in this nightly confusion. However, they defended themselves bravely, repelled the Spaniards, killed several of them, and would have pursued them if Heideck had not prevented them for tangible reasons.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [P.S. to Enclosure 1:] On the afternoon of August 29, the enemies were scouted. This led to a skirmish in which about 80 opponents were killed or captured. Among the nobles, the [Schmalkaldic League] lost Melchior Rhau and Georg Bruch.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Enclosure 2:] On August 31, early in the morning, a hill was wrested from the enemy, forcing them into battle. On the hill, troop units and three cannons of the [Schmalkaldic League] were positioned. From another side, the Elector of Saxony was supposed to attack. But before that happened, they fired from the hill at the enemy, hitting them and initially stopping their advance before they fled between the entrenchments they had built and the city walls of Ingolstadt. They suffered great damage, but the [Schmalkaldic League] only minor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [N.B. to Enclosure 2:] The next day, it was learned from prisoners that the enemy, especially the Italians, suffered great losses and would have suffered even greater damage if the [Schmalkaldic League] had continued their attack, especially since the Spaniards and Italians were in flight. However, since the Emperor had particularly well-fortified himself at the city walls of Ingolstadt and the [Schmalkaldic League] did not trust the city's inhabitants, they halted their attack.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Overall, the [Schmalkaldic League] has had to accept only minor losses so far.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [Enclosure 3:] Since the enemy could not be forced into battle on September 1, a fortification was erected on September 2 near the enemy's camp to bring artillery there. In this way, one side of the camp could be shelled, destroying catapults. The shooters of the [Schmalkaldic League] even dared to advance to the enemy's fortification. The enemy suffered quite significant damage, while the [Schmalkaldic League] only had to accept the wounding of some soldiers and horses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- On September 3, there were some skirmishes, but nothing special was undertaken.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- On September 4, it was decided to withdraw from Ingolstadt, as the Emperor could not be provoked into a battle. During the orderly retreat, the enemy did not attack. They only sent a few horses after them, some of which were killed. A mile was covered that day.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- On September 5, when the camp near Neuburg [on the Danube] had already been set up, and only five companies were still on their way to the camp, they were attacked by about 2000 cavalry and two companies of shooters. The attacker was repelled, and when he saw that some squadrons were coming to the aid of the [Schmalkaldic League], he fled back to Ingolstadt.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- [Postscript:] It has since been learned that the enemy suffered great damage from the shelling on September 2, and that the [Schmalkaldic League] could have achieved even more against the enemy if they had advanced. However, this was not done because some feared significant damage for the [Schmalkaldic League] for valid reasons and predicted only minor damage for the Emperor, as he had entrenched himself in such an advantageous position at Ingolstadt.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- This was to be communicated to [Bullinger and the people of Zurich].</p>

      <p>Philipp, by the grace of God Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc. Our gracious greetings beforehand. Honorable and highly learned, dear, special one, we have received your letter, which you sent to us, from Heinrich Thomann and have graciously understood it. We have arranged that the same Heinrich Thomann shall have his stay at our chancellery.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As for the matters of war, we send you herewith a report of what has transpired between us and the enemies (what God may further grant and what will happen, time will reveal), which we did not want to withhold from you in our gracious opinion.</p>
      <p>For, where we can show you grace and goodness, we are inclined.</p>
      <p>Given in our field camp before Wechingen, on the 12th of September in the year, etc., 46.</p>

      <p>For the chancellor</p>

      <p>What happened on August 29, 1546: On the night of August 28 to 29, about a thousand Spaniards fell into the camp of the Elector's servants (under the command of the Lord of Heideck). They were dressed in white shirts so that one could recognize the other. On our side, about forty servants were harmed and partly shot. I believe that more of our own people, because it was dark, than by the enemies were harmed. However, our foot soldiers held themselves excellently, repelling the Spaniards.</p>
      <p>If they had followed them (if the Lord of Heideck had not, for tangible reasons, prevented it), they would have almost all been killed. However, it was not advisable to go too far from the camp at night. But without any doubt, the Spaniards did not escape from us so easily, but also suffered great damage, as some were found on the battlefield.</p>

      <p>Acted in the field camp before Bettenhoven, on August 29, 1546. Postscript: This afternoon we wanted to scout some things against the enemies. It happened that we came to skirmish with the enemies, and about eighty of them were shot, stabbed, and partly captured. On our side, however, no more than two nobles were shot, one Melchior Rhau and the other Georg Bruch, and otherwise some common companions. We hope it will not harm them, but they shall recover.</p>

      <p>What happened on August 31, 1546: On August 31, in the year, etc., 46, our plan and intention were to take a height before the enemy's camp and bring it so close to the enemy that he had to fight. Therefore, we arranged that our vanguard would come to the height in the morning with the day, driving away the imperial guard from there. As soon as our riders and servants followed the vanguard, one squadron and troop followed the other, brought our artillery to the height, and arranged one troop next to the other. At the same time, the Elector of Saxony came with his riders, servants, and artillery from the other side, arranging the artillery and troops against the enemies. But before and as soon as the Elector arrived, as soon as the enemies noticed ours, they drew out with very large troops and positioned themselves as if they wanted to fight. Then we let three cannons go into them and it was clearly seen that the third shot went into their ranks. As soon as they hesitated. As the artillery went into them more and more, they soon retreated back to Ingolstadt into an advantage, where they have the city and their raised entrenchments to their advantage, so that nothing could be taken from them there. Thus, the skirmish with the large field artillery lasted the whole day on both sides. We believe that our artillery did great damage to the enemies, but we, on our side, thanks to the Almighty, suffered little damage.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Note: On the first of September, we received information from the enemies who were captured that the artillery did them very great damage, especially among the Italian troops. We also received further information that if we had pressed forward yesterday, the enemies would have suffered great losses, as the Spaniards and Italians were in flight. However, the pursuit was abandoned because we did not dare to trust the city of Ingolstadt, as the Emperor was very hard on the city, which had entrenched itself behind and in front of itself to its advantage.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>And it is to be known that by the grace of God we have so far come away from all skirmishes with less and the enemies with greater damage. May God henceforth be gracious on our side.</p>
      <p>Given as in the letters.</p>

      <p>On the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th of September: And since we could not force the enemies into battle yesterday despite all efforts, we thought of other ways. And on the second of September, we erected a fortification about a thousand steps from the enemy's fortification and brought our artillery there, with the ultimate intention of forcing the enemy out of his advantage again, so that we might come to action with him. And we have therefore worked so hard with our artillery that we shot up a good part of the enemy's camp on one side, so that they had to retreat with the tents that stood there. In addition, we also shot away the enemy's erected catapults. And the enemy suffered great damage from the heavy shooting, but on our part, only a few were harmed. We also skirmished on both sides today; in which skirmish our people held themselves well, especially our arquebusiers who ran onto the enemy's fortification. And they also did considerable damage. However, some horses on our side were harmed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>On Friday, the 3rd of September, we remained still before the enemy. Our servants skirmished with each other the whole day, but without orders, and nothing special happened.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>As we now considered that the Emperor was in such a great advantage, and we could not break him there, it was decided in council to withdraw. Which then happened on Saturday, the 4th of September, with good order.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>They did not pursue us at all, except for a few light horses. Some of them were also shot and stabbed. We covered a mile that day and camped there.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the 5th of September, as we were still moving towards Neuburg and the camp was set up and we were almost in the camp and only five companies of riders were behind us, the enemies came up with about 2000 various horses and two companies of foot shooters. They had taken a height from us. Our people turned and drove them back. As a result, some of the enemies were shot and stabbed.</p>
      <p>And when they saw that we were pressing towards them with some squadrons of riders, they retreated back to Ingolstadt.</p>
      <p>What will happen next is in God's hands.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Also, dear special one, as we on the 2nd of September shelled the enemy so thoroughly, as you can see from our records sent to you herewith, we have since received certain information that on that day we achieved something remarkable against the enemy and caused them great damage; which, however, did not lack on our part, but happened for the reason that the Emperor was entrenched at the city of Ingolstadt, and some had the concern that not much damage could be done to him there, but our people could have suffered great damage from the artillery, although this concern did not come from ill-hearted people, but from those who undoubtedly also meant well and faithfully.</p>
      <p>We did not want to withhold this from you, so that you may also have knowledge of it in our gracious opinion.</p>
      <p>Given as above.</p>
