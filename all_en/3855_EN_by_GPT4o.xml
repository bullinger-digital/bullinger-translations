      <p>Greetings. I send to you what I think you have already understood from Germany.</p>
      <p>The constable and other deputies are now together to discuss the conditions of peace; this depends on the will of the Lord. I am expecting the money that was promised to the captains.</p>
      <p>I commend my son to you and to your friends, and myself to their prayers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, February 3rd.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
