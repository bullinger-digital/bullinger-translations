      <p>S. P. Venerable father in Christ, I do not know if you have received the letters I wrote to you three or four months ago. However, since Oporinus recently sent me the book of the most learned and pious man, Lord Bibliander, "On the Supreme Trinity," etc., I take the opportunity to write to you safely through him. I cease to ask you to intercede with the most illustrious Prince Georg about establishing a school here, where a new refuge for the church of God in France, suffering under the cross for more than thirty years, would be established here, as I hoped to establish a school and a printing press here, but I have ceased to hope. The hope of rescuing the family by the common counsel of the princes at the assemblies has also vanished, just as they vanished and will never happen while Pharaoh lives. I would have succeeded if I had stayed in Strasbourg, although I do not regret being in Tübingen because of the dispute in which the Lord made me superior, even if many complain that I left before the matter was concluded. Certainly, I did not fear for myself, but for the prince; for they said that the crowd would be dangerous to his state. I disregarded the rumors, but having heard the letters from the chancellery given against me, I requested a mission with a confession, having experienced how much it cost me not to follow your most prudent counsel, although I followed it from Neuchâtel. But after I traveled through Germany, received and enticed with great favor by the princes, although I entirely wanted to return to Strasbourg, I nevertheless ascended to Tübingen in the middle of winter, driven sideways by the hope of more quickly and effectively obtaining the family. I would have returned to Strasbourg again, if not for the aforementioned hopes, and to close the mouths of those who would have slandered me as expelled by the prince, to whom I offer to provide part of the stipend in Strasbourg, so that I may be allowed to join a printing press to my free voice there. I have now brought out of France Franciscus Balduinus, an ordinary jurist from Bourges, who was my principal scribe in Paris twelve years ago for four years, whom I gave as a professor to the people of Bourges, who requested a teacher from me, and whom I named to the prince to be substituted in my place in Tübingen.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I have also persuaded a distinguished printer, who, having left France, is about to come to me; but now I see it is necessary to ensure he is admitted with me in Strasbourg. By the favor of the princes, I have a most ample, pleasant, and healthy home, I enjoy the greatest and freest leisure; but I do not care for delights.</p>
      <p>I am always the same, except that as age flees, I hasten to grow gray more, and because I persist in those things which I wrote to you extensively about my intention, therefore I left Tübingen, where my course was being blocked. The printers I presented were not admitted, etc., and therefore I look to Strasbourg. Where (if I had foreseen the future) I would have remained with greater profit. Eight days ago, I gave written accounts to the prince and the agents in matters.</p>
      <p>I will write to you more extensively if I do not inconvenience you. Meanwhile, I wish the aforementioned Lord Bibliander, the venerable Lord Pellican, Zwingli, Lavater to be well in my name. May the Lord always be with you. Lord Calvin sent me his recent defense. Farewell happily.</p>
      <p>Montbéliard, the first of March, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Charles du Moulin.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, here I have made a book against the abuses in French and six times larger. But my wife complains bitterly about her dangers because of the speech in Tübingen reported in Paris. But I will not cease because of this and will show that I have not thrown away my shield by leaving Tübingen; where I first obtain a school with a printing press, there I will remain, urging what is most important.</p>
      <p>To the most pious doctor and ecclesiastic Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
