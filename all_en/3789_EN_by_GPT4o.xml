      <p>S. D. Our son Johannes Travers von Salis came to Zurich, but he did not come to me until the next day after he arrived here and delivered your letters. He also mentioned that he would leave for Basel the next day with his companions. When invited by me to dinner, he said he would come; however, in the evening, he announced that he could not come. Therefore, the next day he returned, gathered his things, received the money he had entrusted to me for safekeeping, and bid farewell. I gave him letters of recommendation to the most honorable man, Mr. Johannes Jung, pastor of St. Peter's; I asked him to either receive your son as if he were my own along with his companion or, if he could not, to entrust him to Mr. Johannes Hospinianus for care and education.</p>
      <p>I recommended him to those to whom I would have recommended my own sons if I had wanted to send them to Basel. You wrote that you wanted my consent for this journey as well.</p>
      <p>However, since I saw and experienced that your son was so committed to his companions that he wanted nothing but to go to Basel and did not seek my advice in words, I did what I could and recommended him to the best and most faithful men.</p>
      <p>What I have achieved or whether they presented the letters as necessary in this matter, I do not know; for those to whom I wrote did not respond, and Johannes did not write back. However, I hear from Mr. Johannes Fabricius that they are staying at the house of a certain citizen who was once a reputable host, to whom your son pays twenty-two crowns a year for board, from which I infer that they either did not seek lodging from those to whom I recommended them or, if they presented the letters and asked, they were not received.</p>
      <p>I wish that what they have undertaken may be successful and fortunate for them. I encouraged Johannes as he was leaving to write to me if he wanted anything or needed anything and to trust me as he would his father. I added that I would gladly take care of his letters addressed to you.</p>
      <p>I advised him to beware of those things which we have experienced here that have not benefited some students living in Basel, etc. Now I will present to you the account of receipts and expenditures in German, so that, if you wish, you can also show it to your father, a man I hold in reverence. The following account I have settled with Johannes Travers von Salis; he was also satisfied with it. Johannes von Salis came to me on February 8 and stayed with me until June 10; that is 18 weeks and 3 days. The agreement was for food, drink, lodging, washing, etc., 16 crowns and 6 good batzen or 26 florins, 15 Constance batzen per gulden. The 18 weeks make 9 gulden or 18 of our pounds, the pound calculated at 8 Constance batzen. I gave him on February 10, 2 pounds 2 hellers for a small catechism by Heinrich Spr√ºngli.</p>
      <p>On February 17, for a small notebook and ink, 6 hellers. On March 2, 6 hellers for string.</p>
      <p>When he went to Embrach, 1 pound. On March 28, 15 pounds for a testament in Latin and Greek.</p>
      <p>At the end of March, 6 hellers for thread and another 6 hellers. On April 1, 6 hellers for a writing pad. On April 3, 1 pound 3 hellers; he gave it to Elsy von Uster. On April 14, 2 pounds 8 hellers for paper from Balthasar. On April 25, 2 pounds 4 hellers for a lace and a writing knife.</p>
      <p>At the end of April, 6 hellers for a writing pad, 3 hellers for ink, 8 hellers for soap.</p>
      <p>To the shoemaker Walder according to his written account on May 3, 13 pounds. On May 6, for thread, 6 hellers.</p>
      <p>For Sallust to Balthasar, 17 pounds 6 hellers.</p>
      <p>For the school fast, 6 hellers. On June 6, 1 pound 3 hellers for strings for the lute.</p>
      <p>Another 6 hellers.</p>
      <p>When he went with Dosy and his companions to the milk, 1 pound.</p>
      <p>To the innkeeper at the Salmon, Heinrich Bercker, for playing the lute, 2 florins or 4 pounds.</p>
      <p>The total of all these expenses is 13 florins 2 pounds 1 heller. However, at the beginning, Friedrich, my dear young lord, gave me 10 florins.</p>
      <p>Then I lent my son Heinrich four Italian crowns, each worth 23 Constance batzen, and Stoffel, my son, a Rhine gulden, worth 18 Constance batzen. This brings a total of 7 gulden 13 pounds 4 hellers.</p>
      <p>All sums together make 17 florins 13 pounds and 4 hellers. But when the aforementioned debt, which is 13 florins 2 pounds 1 heller, is deducted, I remain indebted to young lord Friedrich for 5 florins 11 pounds 3 hellers. Hector von Salis stayed with me as long as Hans did.</p>
      <p>Therefore, he also owes me 8 florins.</p>
      <p>So I gave the innkeeper at the Salmon for playing the lute, just as I did for Hans, 2 florins. Furthermore, I gave him on February 10, 6 hellers for paper. On February 17, 6 hellers for a small notebook and ink; 6 hellers for a writing pad; 15 pounds for books from Balthasar, bound. On March 4, 6 hellers for wax; writing materials 5 pounds 4 hellers. On March 23. On April 1, 6 hellers for a writing pad. On April 3, 1 pound 3 hellers; he gave it to Elsy von Uster. On April 6, 1 pound for a writing pad; 3 hellers for ink.</p>
      <p>At the end of April, 6 hellers for a writing pad; another 8 hellers for a lute book.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Walder according to his account for shoes, 1 pound 2 pounds. For cloth for a dress, 2 pounds. On May 17, 1 pound 4 hellers for Cato.</p>
      <p>For the school fast, 6 hellers. On June 6, 1 pound 3 hellers for strings; 6 hellers for feathers.</p>
      <p>The cloth for cutting, bleaching, and preparing, 2 pounds. For buttons for trousers, 1 pound 8 hellers.</p>
      <p>For colloquia and arguments, 6 pounds.</p>
      <p>Again to Mr. Walder for his saddle, 2 pounds for repairs.</p>
      <p>The total of all these expenses is 13 florins 18 pounds 3 hellers. Of this, young lord Friedrich gave me 10 florins.</p>
      <p>When these are deducted, I am owed 3 gulden 18 pounds 3 hellers. Furthermore, I spent on behalf of Hans, Matthe Rollenbutzen for a pair and cloth according to his handwriting 1 pound 3 pounds 4 hellers. When this debt, which is due to me, is summed up, it brings 4 gulden 1 pound 7 hellers.</p>
      <p>These deducted from young lord Friedrich's debt, I still owe 11 good batzen and 4 hellers. I have calculated all this in haste; calculate it again.</p>
      <p>If it is not correct, it will be corrected.</p>
      <p>I will deduct the rest from Hector or send it to Hans in Basel, whichever you prefer. It is very troublesome for me to write such minutiae, and then also to calculate them.</p>
      <p>Therefore, check these; if there is any error, it will be corrected on both sides. Farewell and take this in good part.</p>
      <p>I could not write more due to pressing business; perhaps more another time. Zurich, December 9, 1558.</p>
      <p>May Mr. Travers the elder, Mr. Rudolf the parent, and the other good men, especially the ministers of Samaden, be well. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>We are informed by horses sent from England that on November 16, Mary, Queen of England, has died, and her sister Elizabeth, a virgin of great hope, learned, pious, and prudent, has been created queen. May the Lord preserve and help her, etc.</p>
      <p>In great haste.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, designated commissioner of Clavenna, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Samaden.</p>
