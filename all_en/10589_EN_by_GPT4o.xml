      <p>Grace and peace from God, the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, be granted to all people who desire it with truth. Dear lord and friend, I have received your letter addressed to me and have noted your good will, for which I thank you most highly, with the promise to reciprocate in the same manner, as much as God, my Lord, grants me grace, hereby asking you to faithfully pray to God for me, that He may increase the true faith in me and in all of us.</p>
      <p>And regarding the matter of Geneva, all pious minds and hearts must entrust it to God. He will guide the righteous on the great day of the Lord, etc. The devil will not allow it to be right, so it cannot be right.</p>
      <p>God, our Savior and only comfort, greets you and all who inquire about me in faithfulness.</p>
      <p>15th of March in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your servant Peter Im Haag.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and pious, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zurich, in his hand.</p>
