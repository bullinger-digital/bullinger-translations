      <p>Greetings. A few days ago, dearest Bullinger, I wrote to you through the ministers of the Ravensburg church who were traveling to you, and I informed you of my current situation and the reason for my coming here, as I had planned to come to you and was awaiting your letters indicating the will of your council on this matter. Meanwhile, I have received my belongings along with my books, so that I am now completely freed from the Augsburg Babylon, which has been imposed upon that church, notable for many reasons, by the satellites of the Antichrist, and I can henceforth serve some church in our Savior Christ according to His gospel. For I do not wish to incur the reproach of an idle life, like that wicked servant; therefore, while awaiting the Lord's calling, I remain here with the people of St. Gallen, unless you think it best for me to come to you, concerning which matter, I pray, let me know your advice.</p>
      <p>I hear many things about the people of Constance that make me greatly fear for that church as well as for the people of Lindau.</p>
      <p>They could be made stronger by the support and help of their neighbors, which would have remarkably broken the efforts of their adversaries; their downfall threatens to be the occasion of great evils. Perhaps you have heard about the departure of the Emperor; it is said he has gone to Ulm, undoubtedly contemplating the occupation of Strasbourg. Nothing is done by him casually or rashly; all his actions must be observed vigilantly. But God is in heaven, who providently cares for all things, and just as He is upright with the upright, so He is perverse with the perverse and abominates the man of blood and deceit.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently; greetings to your entire household, to all the brothers, and to my Haller in Bern.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 16th August 1548.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, my dearest lord and brother.</p>
