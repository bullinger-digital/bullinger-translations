    <p xml:id="regest1">Waiting for [William] Peterson, who announced his arrival at Pentecost in March, but might have been detained in France; Butler or other Englishmen will compensate for a possible loss of [Rudolf] Schinz. Peterson will report on the turmoil in England, where three prominent clergymen [Robert Barnes, Thomas Garrett, and William Jerome] have been placed in the Tower. Butler will travel to Frankfurt to comfort some English refugees. Greetings. Requests intercession.</p>

      <p>Peace and a tranquil conscience in Christ! I am daily expecting the arrival of Peterson (William Peterson): for he assured me, in a letter sent in March, that he would be here by the feast of Pentecost. If he does not come, it is certain that he has been intercepted while crossing France. I hope for better things, relying on God's mercy. Let it be so, we Englishmen (with God's guidance) will ensure that Schinz (Rudolf Schinz) does not suffer too great a loss; unless I myself suffer a shipwreck of my affairs, which I possess in England. Then my protection will be of little worth: yet it will be aided by others (I do not doubt) of good will. I write this because the state of England is now very turbulent. But I will write nothing more about this, because I am convinced that Peterson will soon report everything in person. Moreover, the shortness of time does not allow me to write more on this matter now. However, from your prudence, you can easily infer the rest of the evils from here, most esteemed Mr. Bullinger. For three of our best ministers are imprisoned in what is called the London Castle or, if you prefer, the Tower of London. Furthermore, I will go straight to Frankfurt to console some brothers who have fled from England. When I have arrived there, you will learn more, if the Lord wills. Farewell most happily in Christ together with your wife and entire family. Please greet all your colleagues in my words in the Lord. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, J. BUTLER</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord of our fate that He may deign to have mercy, I beseech you. To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
