      <p>Finally, I have decided to send a messenger, my most illustrious and dearest Bullinger, and I ask you not to be reluctant to do a few things for me there with my lord Josias. But first, I will discuss recent events; take from the enclosed sheet how the matter was conducted between Maurice and the margrave. The Duke gave this with his own hand and added that he had received other letters, by which he understands that the margrave himself has undoubtedly been captured. Well done; we hope for a more peaceful Germany and a less powerful Emperor. Now there will be a meeting of princes in Bohemia.</p>
      <p>The assembly has been postponed to the 15th of October in Augsburg. Hear the word, Heinrich Bullinger, but keep it to yourself; there is hope (it is not a dream of my mind; I know from where I have drawn it) that in these upcoming assemblies a national council will be celebrated. The Emperor loosens the reins, more than you could hardly believe. I do not cease to inflame the spirit of those you know, indeed I have already been invited to be present in Augsburg at that time, and I hope to be there.</p>
      <p>The bishops, with whom Albert was waging war, are negotiating with Maurice about introducing the gospel into their dominions, if he wishes to save them from the Emperors and the popes, in which matter we hope for some good.</p>
      <p>You know that the King of England has died, a great loss indeed; but it pleased the Lord so. The Emperor has set his mind and sent a delegation there, if he can persuade a certain great man (the name escapes me), who would marry Catherine, the daughter of Henry VIII (as many think), with the kingdom. Those new lands will be ravaged, as I fear, by boars and papists; I fear for Occhino, I fear for Martyr in this change of affairs. You, Lord God, protect them and those new lands together through Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>The main reason that has now driven me to send a messenger is this: I wish to know in what state things are there and in Rhaetia; for when I receive your response, I will then deliberate whether I wish to go to Zurich first or directly from here to the Court of the Rhaetians. Therefore, write, I beg you, whether there is anyone there who expects me, whether you have heard anything about the plague in the Valais and other districts of Rhaetia, whether soldiers are being gathered in Rhaetia itself, whether there is anything else new from there; collect everything and write to me.</p>
      <p>Then also look everywhere with Ziegler, with the host of the Stork, with everyone, whether there are any letters addressed to me, and send them to me. For when I have read yours and others, I will then decide whether I wish to come to you first. I also wish to know whether that margrave, who was with you two months ago, has returned to Geneva and whether you have seen another brother going there from Italy or returning from there to Italy. Also write what has been done in the Baden assembly regarding the Duke of Florence, whether it was granted to him to send his envoys to Switzerland. In the meantime, I will affirm that I will certainly come to you in the month of September (so that I may go to Augsburg afterwards), if I now think it right to go directly to Rhaetia.</p>
      <p>The Duke is present. Yesterday I spoke much with him and I think I have done a great favor to our Frecht, which I gladly did, also because I know he is loved by you. My booklets will be completed next week, as I hope. 'Good God, what labors I have endured; I have become from a bishop and legate a corrector of a poor workshop, glory to God. I think it is not necessary to send my Josias to Venice. What if those lords wanted to give him a gift, would it be permissible to accept it, because he is from Zurich? But you see more; write what you think. I am beginning to think differently; for I would have thought before to send him. I write to Ziegler to store everything I left with him, namely to extract from the packages and place in his chests. Also write if you have heard anything else about Laelius and whether his father has ordered anything about his books.</p>
      <p>In summary: I now depend entirely on your letters; I will come there if things remain in one state, I will not come if in another. I also write to my lord Josias. I commend these letters, which you will find enclosed; take care, I ask, that they are sent as soon as possible, but see to whom you give them. Farewell and be well. Pray for me with the whole church.</p>
      <p>Volmar greets you. TÃ¼bingen, July 20, 1553. Vergerius.</p>
      <p>When I had written thus far, the Duke invited me to dinner with him; and Lord Charles, the Margrave of Baden, was present. What do you ask?</p>
      <p>He affirmed to me that Maurice has met his end; so it is. The competitors for the electorate will be Augustus, Maurice's brother, and John Frederick. May God turn it well. Behold, how I have overwhelmed you with these letters with new and recent matters. Farewell again, be well again.</p>
      <p>Your same brother.</p>
      <p>Duke Otto Henry of the Palatinate (future elector) today requested through his letters from the Duke that he grant him Brentius, who would go to him to reform those churches.</p>
      <p>I hardly dare to write another message, it is so enormous. Today one came from Prussia; he reports that the mother gave poison to the King of Poland, her son, and he is gravely ill; indeed, she was incensed with anger because she saw him wanting to marry her sister, whom he had already taken as a wife, namely Ferdinand's daughter. I affirm nothing, except what the man coming from Prussia affirms. Wonders.</p>
