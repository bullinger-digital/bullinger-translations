      <p>Greetings. To prevent any contention from arising between us, venerable and dearest brother, I will not touch upon the subject which I see is so odious to you. However, let the agreement on the essence of doctrine remain intact and whole between us.</p>
      <p>Let each of us allow the other freedom of judgment in other matters. I have attempted to persuade you of what I deemed right and useful.</p>
      <p>Since offense has arisen from this, it is better to cease. I want to remind you of only one thing: I have long despaired of Luther's imitators, and there is not much hope in Jakob Andreae and the like.</p>
      <p>But it pains me greatly that our brothers, joined to us, are oppressed by barbaric tyranny and are not relieved by any aid. For how many do you think there are who silently wish for a helping hand to be extended to them, and lament that they are abandoned by us? But I move on to other matters. You did not hesitate to dispel the blame of the French tumults from us, and you could do so safely.</p>
      <p>When these plans began to be agitated eight months ago, I interposed my authority to prevent them from attempting to proceed further. I did this secretly and quietly, because I feared that if the matter became known to the enemies, it would lead all the pious to the gallows. However, I thought that my efforts had restrained and even calmed the impulses, until someone of no value to me came from France, boasting that he had been appointed leader. I immediately curbed his boasting and declared that I was far removed from this conspiracy.</p>
      <p>The next day, a famished man, who was seeking prey everywhere to ensnare a wealthy friend and, under the pretext of a meeting, to extract a good sum of money, shamelessly lied, saying that the conspiracy was not disapproved by me, but that I did not want it to be made public to avoid envy. Upon hearing this, I was suddenly moved and, with my colleagues present, I sharply refuted his vanity.</p>
      <p>Indeed, he testified that he had already learned for certain in Paris that I was far removed from that plan. However, although it was widely known that I was suspicious of it, because he lived in Lausanne, due to its proximity, and as he was charming and full of allurements, he had won the friendship of many among us. As a result, he infected this city with a strange contagion in three days. Many, both noble and common, and craftsmen, consulted secretly, yet the noise reached my ears. I showed without dissimulation how much this conspiracy displeased me, both publicly and privately. When I achieved nothing, I complained that we had so little authority that our counsel was scorned in a matter of utmost seriousness. I said a hundred times that it was a new kind of fascination.</p>
      <p>I predicted the sad outcome in such a way that many would regret their madness too late. Therefore, I ask you, for your humanity and our mutual friendship, to continue to excuse us confidently. You will seek the rest from Mr. Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>For a headache does not allow me to extend the conversation further.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will be compelled to ask our best brother, Mr. Wolfgang, for forgiveness for not responding to his letters.</p>
      <p>In my name, you will thank him for the effort undertaken for my sake, and you will diligently greet him and the other fellow ministers. Farewell, distinguished man and brother, most esteemed by me.</p>
      <p>May the Lord guide, protect, sustain, and bless you and your whole family. Amen.</p>
      <p>Geneva, May 11, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, brother and esteemed fellow minister.</p>
