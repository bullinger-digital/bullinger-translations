      <p>To the most reverend and illustrious men, Johannes Calvin, Wolfgang Musculus, Heinrich Bullinger, Peter Martyr, and the church of Lausanne, their dearest brothers and friends, greetings and best wishes. Since the revelation of the gospel, most learned men, in our Poland, our churches were initially reformed in the true doctrine and confession of Christ by the prayers of noble men, by Francesco Stancaro of Mantua, who is now under my jurisdiction. We celebrated God with one accord, remaining in Christian peace and charity, with great joy of spirit. There was then great rejoicing among all the pious and daily accession to pure religion, while on the contrary, great trepidation arose among the papists about their kingdom being about to fall.</p>
      <p>But behold, in the absence of Stancaro, some of our ministers first secretly and among a few, then openly and among all, attempted to disturb and corrupt the doctrine of the Trinity and of Christ the Lord as mediator, which indeed they accomplished. After Stancaro was called back to Poland and noticed the contaminated doctrine on these two articles and other evils, he endeavored to recall the churches to their former and catholic faith. However, those desirous of the glory of new things and of ruling rose up against Stancaro, shouting that it was unworthy for him to be in our sight. Hence, they expelled him from the churches and inhumanely proscribed him, as you will learn from Stancaro's writings, which we send to you through our messenger Christophorus P. of Lviv. Indeed, by this schism, the papists, rejoicing that their kingdom would be stable, gather strength and courage against us, and thus, while they see us consuming each other, they triumph with great joy, which makes the state of our churches miserable.</p>
      <p>With some pious and prudent men, I have often labored to apply a remedy to these great evils, namely, that peace and concord might be restored between them and Stancaro. And since your writings have obtained such authority among us that many think it a sin to dissent from them even slightly, I have tried, as much as I could, to show that not only the ancients but also you in your writings teach the same as Stancaro about the Trinity and the mediator. They, having brought forward certain letters printed under your name and a certain booklet of Philipp Melanchthon and the confession of Helti, boldly affirm that you think no differently about the Trinity and the mediator than what is written there, which we can by no means be persuaded of. For we see that both those letters and the other writings mentioned are plainly contrary to your writings. It seems incredible to us, I say, to believe that you have written anything that would contradict your doctrine, which you have handed down in your books about the Trinity and the mediator, not departing at all from the word of God and the orthodox church, and would accuse you of having defected from your former doctrine, although some of Stancaro's adversaries have spread these rumors: namely, that God, because of our sins, had hidden this mystery of the Trinity from our ancestors, but now for the first time through grace has revealed it to you and other saints of his, and therefore you have retracted the old doctrine of this article of the Trinity and also of the mediator. Although, as I said, we can by no means be led to believe this about you, indeed, even if the whole world were to be endangered, we are persuaded that we must stand firm in that faith of the mediator, which both Stancaro teaches and you profess in your books. Nevertheless, to satisfy some weak and simple ones who depend on the authority of your letters, which were mentioned above, we send this our messenger to you, that we may be made more certain by you about the whole matter. We, I say, most illustrious men, whose name is most celebrated among us, earnestly request that you write to us whether you have retracted the doctrine of the Trinity and the mediator, which is contained in your printed books, in those letters or not, that is, whether you still believe with the old church that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one God, one essence or substance of three persons, one will and one operation, and that Christ the Lord is the mediator according to humanity and not according to divinity, that is, that Christ prays, supplicates, intercedes, and does the like according to human nature and not divine, as is seen in your books, or not. For these lovers of new things condemn this old and true doctrine in your name and authority and vociferate that it is thrice accursed. You will understand their doctrine more clearly both from our messenger and from Stancaro's books, and you will also recognize their art in promoting it, if indeed at this time they do not contradict these articles as freely and clearly as they did at the beginning, nor are they consistent with themselves, so that it plainly appears that they are completely routed.</p>
      <p>For when Stancaro opposed them, they did not want to yield with a stubborn and obstinate mind, but now, restrained by the conscience and shame of a bad cause (as I suspect), they have begun to change their forms of speaking. For before, some of them were insinuating something about three gods, three wills, three operations into the ears of some, they rejected the Nicene Creed, and called the Athanasian Creed the Creed of Satan; but now they say they confess one God and accept these very creeds. Yet they teach something obscure about the persons and say that the Son of God is lesser than the Father even in divine nature, and in the same they make him praying, supplicating, and interceding for us with God the Father, as you will learn from their writings and Stancaro's, which our messenger will present to you. Therefore, most illustrious men, we again and again earnestly ask that you clearly and perspicuously write to us your opinion on all these matters, which we trust you will do for your humanity and singular zeal for the church of God. We, in turn, will strive to gratify you with all our duties and dignities.</p>
      <p>Dubiecko, December 10, 1560.</p>
      <p>Stanislaus M. Stadnicki of Zmigrod, heir in Dubiecko.</p>
