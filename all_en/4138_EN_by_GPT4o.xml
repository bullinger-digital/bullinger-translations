      <p>Greetings. Your letter, reverend father in Christ, was delivered to me around evening, so I have not yet been able to read the booklet on the institutions of the Jesuits; I will return it in a few days with good intentions. They are demolishing the very large and splendid buildings in Innsbruck to construct a monastery for the Jesuits there. If any of you were to write a warning to the faithful to beware of such hypocrites and issue a brief booklet in Latin and German, I do not know what could be more useful. This is written hastily, as the noble young man of very generous nature, the son of the elder Tscharner, is hastening his departure early in the morning.</p>
      <p>He also wishes to see you and did not want to come to you without my letters. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Our people wish you well.</p>
      <p>Chur, 28th of November, in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
