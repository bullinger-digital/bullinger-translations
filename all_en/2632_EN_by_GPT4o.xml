      <p>S. I have no news of recent events, neither from France nor elsewhere, except for a certain story about the Bishop of Valence, which my brother will recount to you. Mecardus writes from Augsburg about the horrendous insolence of the Lutherans. A certain Melhofer, taking advantage of the presence of Ferdinand, the bishops, princes, and especially the Saxon envoys, proclaims that those are heretics who do not believe that Jews and Turks, if they approach communion unknown, receive the true, natural, essential body of Christ as much as any most faithful person; also, that preachers are heretics who do not openly condemn the heresy of Zwingli and Oecolampadius; that the ministers of Augsburg do this, therefore, etc. He has not communicated with his fellow minister Leonardo for 6 months. Illyricus was secretly in Augsburg, but he could not settle the controversy that is among the ministers. The aim is to introduce the Nuremberg Reformation by ejecting the old ministers.</p>
      <p>That is all from there.</p>
      <p>However, the main reason I wanted to write to you is this: I hear from some friends that you wrote something to Blaurer, in which you criticized our people quite sharply both in the Locarno case and in the Thurgau case. He showed these letters to some people in Bern, some of whom do not wish you ill, but I hear they are gravely offended. I have not yet fully understood the matter itself; this much has been reported to me by trusted sources. Therefore, in good faith, I wanted to advise you to be careful to whom you write; I do not know how well Blaurer is disposed towards us; I hope for the best, but often even good people encounter such things through imprudence. You already know well enough how the minds of many are affected. I endure many and serious things, which increase day by day, and I do not know how long I can endure them; however, I will not complain unless extreme necessity demands it. Farewell and take these words of mine in good part. I wrote hastily while in the waters, where I have been bathing for several days. Bertinus is returning to satisfy his creditors there and will then return to us. I. Haller greets you; he left here the day before yesterday to entrust himself to a certain empirical doctor in a village. May the Lord grant that he returns to us safe and sound!</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your people, whom you will greet from me and all mine; Musculus greets you, who recently wrote to you through the bookseller from Aarau and sent you a copy of his Commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans. Bern, May 15, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his honorable lord and compatriot.</p>
