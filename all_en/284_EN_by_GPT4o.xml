      <p>Greetings. Zwingli, following the custom of students, delivered a declamation when his turn came.</p>
      <p>The declamation, although not at all tumultuous, stirred up some sort of tragedy between him and the Swabians, so much so that they wrote German-Latin poems, so to speak, not without insult to Zwingli and all of us, which I believe you have already seen. The matter came to the academic senate; it leans towards the Swabians. After the author of the poems could not be identified, he almost threatens the innocent and seems to demand thanks for not punishing; he forbids approaching the preachers to complain, nor to show the translated declamation to the tribune. In short: he should observe the magistrate to whom he is sworn, unless he wants to be removed from the register. Meanwhile, the Swabians secretly threaten revenge and speak ill of the Swiss in Switzerland itself. The academics defend them, perhaps so they are not forced to lack students.</p>
      <p>You will find the whole matter in detail with Gwalther, to whom, as I hear, Zwingli wrote everything. He seeks advice on what he should do. Indeed, I do not dare to advise, as they proclaim me an enemy of the academy; meanwhile, however, it pains me that the Swabians thus seem to dominate, while ours are despised and lie low. If the matter moves you, seek advice on whether to remain silent or to act, after they act with threats. However, be careful not to say anything about these letters to anyone, unless you want to expose me to not a small danger. Therefore, it would be safer to commit them to the fire after reading or to send them back to me, if perhaps they may provide some use once the matter is known.</p>
      <p>I would like to add this: if the senate knew what had been done, they would not bear it with an even mind. Hence, I think they have so anxiously prohibited him from saying anything to anyone. Thus, we play secure in this most unfortunate storm.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, strong and steadfast with yours, Gwalther, Otto, and all. If you have anything about the assemblies, share it.</p>
      <p>Basel, 27th of September, 1548. You will hear news from the merchants. Yours, Oswald Myconius</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of ZÃ¼rich, his venerable lord in Christ.</p>
