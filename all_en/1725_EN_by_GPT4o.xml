      <p>S. Upon returning here, I found my household in turmoil; for in my absence, Kaleb Bschörli, a stipendary and alumnus of your church, and my housemate, was struck by the plague and passed away to the Lord on September 18th. My absence increased the family's grief; but even if I had been present, I could not have averted what the Lord had ordained. He did not lack consolation, for Musculus diligently attended to him and beautifully testified to his faith and patience. Meanwhile, two ministers also passed away in the field, one from Zofingen, and Theobald in Herzogenbuchsee. The schoolmaster of Zofingen is still bedridden. The plague is not rampant here, indeed not at all; however, I suspect a great epidemic will follow. Yet, may the Lord's will be done.</p>
      <p>Truly blessed is he who the Lord transfers from this most troubled prison to the eternal joy of His kingdom.</p>
      <p>Here you have some excerpts from letters sent to us from Augsburg. A persistent rumor asserts that the Emperor is in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>If you have anything, share it with us in return. Musculus, with all his family, sends greetings to you and yours; the same does my wife and the whole household. Musculus himself writes.</p>
      <p>I recently recommended these students of ours to you in person, so there is no need for more now. I have good hopes for them, as they have conducted themselves here without inconvenience. I have strongly impressed upon them how they should conduct themselves there; I hope they will comply. If they or others commit any offense, I ask you to write to me privately before writing to the school authorities, and that for certain reasons; for I will ensure they are corrected or disciplined more suitably than those recent ones.</p>
      <p>Jodocus is still bedridden; what to hope for his health, I do not know. May the Lord grant him patience. Bern, September 25, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I found the bundle of your sermons at home and distributed them as they were addressed; everyone gives you great thanks.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
