      <p>Greetings through our Lord Jesus Christ. Reverend and especially gracious lord and good friend, my inclined, willing service is always at your disposal. I have received your letter through Mr. Tretius, as well as your faithful advice. I was also entirely inclined to absent myself for a while, but I have not been further troubled, although there is no lack of some evil, godless, and envious people. Thus, I must await the time with patience; only the raging and ranting of some of our preachers will not cease; they incite and provoke the authorities to such persecution. In particular, a Netherlander, yet a citizen here, recently went to the Lord's Supper in Amberg in the Palatinate and communicated there, for which the citizens there wrote to a council here and entered it in a very hostile manner, so that this person was examined by some of our preachers. However, since he stumbled somewhat in the dispute over the Lord's Supper, it was imposed on him that he should reconcile with the preachers within 3 months; it is to be expected that if this does not happen, it will not be to his advantage, so that we must expect no less persecution than under the papacy. May Almighty God have mercy on His poor Christians.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, things are truly bad with us, and whoever cannot preach against sacramentarians and enthusiasts is worth nothing with us. Herewith I send you a little treatise for you to see, along with an epitaph and portrait of a local preacher, to discern what spirit governs them. Furthermore, you will undoubtedly have heard that some of the council from Amberg traveled to the Elector in Heidelberg and petitioned that they be allowed their preachers. But since these are more inclined to rebellion than unity and have preached so, he wants to remove them, but with the condition that they may take other learned people from Wittenberg or other places, but he will not tolerate any clamorous and shouting ones. The word is that the entire citizenry wants to insist on their preachers once more; what answer they receive, time will tell, so that it appears more like a rebellion than obedience. And since we receive mail and letters from Antwerp every 8 days, they have not arrived this time. And as the word goes, the letters are said to have been intercepted by the Albanians, and as some think, things are said to be very bad in the Netherlands, and that great plots and conspiracies are at hand. May God disperse their plans. Some are of the opinion that things will also go badly in France. With friendly request, if you have any news, please share it with me. If you send the letters to Hans Lienhardt in St. Gallen, they will surely be answered to me. Otherwise, nothing more at this time, only asking that you would let me be commended to you and your prayers, and hereby I commend you to the protection and care of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Dated Nuremberg, October 10, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your willing G. S.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and highly learned Heinrich Bullinger, the elder, my gracious lord in Zurich.</p>
