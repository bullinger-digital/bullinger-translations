      <p>May the Lord Jesus strengthen you in all things, and support you now as you decline into old age, and may He never fail you, especially in your old age!</p>
      <p>I have refrained from writing to you for so long, most learned man, primarily because of my harsh and barbarous style in writing Latin, which is less appropriate, so that I am almost ashamed and reluctant to respond to your most welcome letter, written in Zürich on the 28th of August last. Along with that letter, I received the confession of the Swiss churches, compiled and written in the German language, from the most beloved brother, Lord Abel. You wish to renew our old friendship with your little book (as you also confess); and for that, I am very grateful. I previously had the Latin version in London through the same Lord Abel, and if I remember correctly, it was received from you at the last Frankfurt fair held during Lent. The book itself pleases me well, as it should; for everywhere in it, pious and sincere doctrine is taught. Lord Abel also told me that your three married daughters were taken by the plague. However, I do not doubt that they died in the Lord: they are blessed because now they not only rest from their labors but also undoubtedly enjoy eternal life with Christ our Savior, just as their mother, your pious wife, does. Since you are widowed by divine providence and not young, I do not doubt that you have followed the advice of the Apostle Paul, where he says, "I wish that all men were as I am. But each has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. To the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I do, etc." And again: "Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife."</p>
      <p>Praise be to God that you have completed 190 homilies on the prophet Isaiah. After they have been published, I will, if I live, obtain a volume of them, God willing. For I do not doubt that they will come to light with much fruit. I am sorry that you feel your strength gradually failing: yet I certainly hope that the most good and great God will not forsake you in your old age; and I will pray for you to Him, as you desire. May God grant that He hears, who said, "Whatever you ask the Father in my name, He will give you."</p>
      <p>I will bid my wife to greet you in your name. I know she will be very glad as soon as she hears of your good prayer: for she indeed loves you very much. It will also refresh her when she learns from me that you are still well, as you say, by the grace of God. My wife suffers severely from time to time from kidney stones, indeed almost to death sometimes. I pray that you would deign to pray to the Lord for her. I fear that this disease will eventually consume her. Lord Abel, after a large stone was extracted from his bladder, has not been so well. I fear, however, that he will not be with us for long. He is a pious man, faithful to his friends, and a true Israelite. He has a wife, as you have undoubtedly heard or know, who is pious and most honorable. She is well, but she always limps since she left Strasbourg, just as she did for two years before she left there. "Whom the Lord loves, He chastens, and He corrects every son whom He receives." And "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all."</p>
      <p>I wish to interpret some of the confession of the Swiss churches for my wife at some time. She also reads in it from time to time; for she understands your language somewhat, and sometimes meditates in it.</p>
      <p>I have at home your other letters, indeed two, my lord, which you sent me shortly after the death of our Queen Mary: but I have certainly forgotten on what day and year they were dated in Zürich. I am very grateful to you for them; for they are full of pious exhortation and excellent consolation. May our Lord Jesus Christ render to you in return abundant consolation on that day when your body will be dissolved from your soul, and also when it will be joined and restored again! Thus, for almost three whole years, my strength has been failing, and my spirit is so small that I sometimes wonder that I have survived for so many years. Yet may the Lord's will always be done. I desire to depart and be with Christ. For in the meantime, while I remain here, I am sometimes tormented by innumerable cares and vain anxieties (because of the calling of the mercantile condition), so that I would much prefer, if the Lord wills, to be free from such small pleasures and joys of this vain world, and so mixed, indeed rather too seasoned, with torments and disturbances of the mind, than to enjoy such things. But may the Lord's will be done!</p>
      <p>I have been here in Antwerp for almost three and a half whole months. In the meantime, I have sometimes informed our mutual friend, Lord Christoph Mont, by my letters about the state of affairs in Brabant, especially in Antwerp; as far as the change of religion and the toleration of evangelical preaching is concerned. Nor do I doubt that you have received enough news about these matters from the preachers of Strasbourg, or through the writings of other brothers. Therefore, I do not think it necessary for me to write again about the same things now.</p>
      <p>But now everywhere they say, those who frequently receive letters from Spain, Italy, France, and England, that King Philip will come here from Spain to Brabant and all Lower Germany next spring, either to hold a general assembly of the whole country (by whose prescription every religious controversy may be reformed or transformed) or to restore and establish papal superstition, idolatry, and cruelty. But may God, in whose hand are the hearts of all princes, take away from this king and the princes of this region their stony hearts, and give them hearts of flesh, so that truly converted to Christ from the heart, they may greatly grieve and repent of their past sins and enormities, so that they may obtain forgiveness and mercy from the Lord, and afterwards promote His glory with all their might!</p>
      <p>It is to be lamented that some Lutherans, as you write, although offering peace, do not cease to trouble you. Here, however, the Martinists (as they prefer to be called rather than Lutherans) openly do not cease to criticize and disapprove of the orthodox symmists (whom they also call Calvinists) in their public sermons, but they dare greatly. However, the Martinists have fewer churches than the orthodox; for they have only two (one of which they call in a large barn), while those whom they call Calvinists have three or four. Yet both parties (except for one who preaches in that barn) still preach in the open air, and not under roofs. But now, almost two months ago, they began to build temples, and they proceed to construct them with great haste. However, the walls (which are constructed of bricks and stones) only stand out so far, and the temples remain unroofed.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus, most esteemed lord, who always keeps you! Amen. Antwerp, December 20, 1566. Yours, Richard Hilles.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend. Zürich.</p>
