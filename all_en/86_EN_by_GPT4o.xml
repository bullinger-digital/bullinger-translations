    <p xml:id="regest1">Tirelessly, Bullinger shows his benevolence to everyone. This includes his book publications, which cannot be praised enough. He does not hide the talent bestowed upon him [cf. Mt 5, 15 par], but rather increases the glory of God with it. He proves himself to the Lord and to people as a good and faithful servant and will receive his reward one day [cf. Mt 25, 14-21]. May the Lord protect him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Bullinger's [foster] son Rudolf Gwalther diligently follows Bullinger's good example, which is particularly evident in his writing [«Οἰκέτης sive servus ecclesiasticus»]. Bullinger recently sent Myconius this synodal speech [correctly: Karlstag speech] as a gift. Hopefully, Bullinger and Gwalther will serve the church successfully for many more years!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">As for news, Myconius can only report that he is not doing very well... But this concerns him less at the moment than the impending persecution of the faithful and the eradication of the [evangelical] doctrine. The son of the Antichrist, Emperor Charles V, is indeed working to restore everything Antichristian. If Christ does not reveal his power, all is lost. No help is to be expected from people, as they already recoil at the mere mention of the Emperor! Certainly, some place their hope in the strength of the Swiss Confederates and pray for them. Nevertheless, the power of the Emperor remains terrifying: His son, Philip II of Spain, is said to be approaching with 80,000 Spanish [mercenaries] to destroy the Confederates and the Gospel! All of Germany is already subdued, as one hears, and will in any case have to comply with the imperial mandates (against whom or about what ever). In the face of such an enemy, the Confederates can only be defeated and the heavenly doctrine eradicated!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Since Myconius knows the nature of people, he (honestly) places his hope solely in God and will remain steadfast in this faith. If God allows the suppression of his Gospel, he may have already gathered his own and will lead their souls to heaven after the persecutions, but will surely consign the others to eternal fire. No pious person can doubt this! However, the saving doctrine will certainly not perish so soon. Rather, through the work of Christ, everyone will recognize that every worldly power is just dust in the wind compared to the divine [Hos 13, 3]. Surely, given the Emperor's misdeeds, it won't be long until then, even if Myconius does not notice it yet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">The Zurich council recently informed [the people of Basel] by letter that a delegation from Constance was summoned by the Emperor [to Augsburg] and must agree to some treaty. Myconius knows nothing more specific about it, but the people of Constance do not want to accept anything that is against their religion and their allies. Charles V will accept everything as long as they submit. But what then? Do these blind people not see that the Emperor [already] did not keep his promises to others?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">There is said to be a dispute in Strasbourg between the Ammeister [Jakob von Dunzenheim] and one of the [Stettmeister] due to an inappropriate negotiation with the Emperor. Since the citizens have no say, decent people fear that the better and more truthful one will be defeated. The population is very upset.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Myconius only added [the news from Strasbourg] to report [at least] something.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Greetings, also to Bullinger's family and to Gwalther.</p>

      <p>You strive to do good continually, not only to your own people but also to outsiders, and the same with your published books: I cannot commend this enough! Since you have received a talent from the Lord, you do not wish to hide it, but you work to gain more for the use, praise, and glory of the same Lord. From this, you also gain for yourself the name of a good and faithful servant before God and men, and you will surely receive the reward one day that the Lord promises to such a servant. May the same Lord preserve you in this endeavor for as long as possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You lead by example your son in the Lord, Rudolf Gwalther. He indeed strives for the same as you, and so far, he has not undertaken this study in vain. This is proven by many things, especially the synodal speech you recently sent as a gift. I wish for both of you an increase in divine grace and a longer life, so that you may benefit the churches of God for many more years as happily and effectively as possible!</p>

      <p>I have nothing new except for new illnesses in my body from time to time. Although they do not frighten me much, since I look at these present times, which threaten severe persecutions of the pious with the eradication of the Lord's doctrine. For they say that the Emperor is intent on restoring everything Antichristian. And unless Christ reveals his power against the son of the Antichrist, all is lost! For there is no help from men, so much are all struck down even at the mere mention of the Emperor's name. I know some who still place some hope in the strength of the Swiss and pray for them. Meanwhile, however, his power is quite terrifying. For behold, they say: the Emperor's son is coming with 80,000 Spaniards to crush us and eradicate the Gospel, and all of Germany is already occupied (therefore, whether they want to or not, they are forced to obey the command against anyone and anything). Therefore, it cannot be that we are not to be conquered and the heavenly doctrine abolished if such a great enemy invades.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Here, as far as I am concerned, I say freely: I neither conceive nor can conceive any hope from man. For I know what is in him. But I trust in the Lord, and if I remain thus, I shall not be moved forever. If the Lord permits his Gospel to be suppressed, perhaps he has already gathered his own through the word. Therefore, when he has handed them over to heaven according to their souls after persecutions, he will surely devote the rest to eternal fire. No pious person can doubt this. Although it does not seem that the saving doctrine will perish so soon, but rather that Christ will soon bring it about that everyone will see the power of this world as dust carried away by the wind compared to his power. Although I am not allowed to experience this here, I believe it is not far off, so nefarious are the things he attempts.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Besides this, I recently heard that your people wrote (I do not know what) about the people of Constance being recalled by the Emperor and some treaty being accepted. However, they themselves are to accept nothing against religion and against their neighbors. They submit, and the Emperor permits everything. What then? Do they not see what he promises to others and what he delivers? Oh, blind ones!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>If I understood correctly, there is a dispute between the plebeian consul and the consul of the city of Strasbourg due to an unworthy action with the Emperor. Good people fear that the better and more truthful one will succumb. The citizens are nothing. Thus, the common people are enraged.</p>

      <p>Farewell in Christ with your family and Gwalther. Basel, April 9, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your O. Myc.</p>
