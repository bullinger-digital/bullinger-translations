      <p>Greetings. While we are in doubt about the parish of Buchberg due to the intercession of men who hold almost the highest positions among you, and then because of the inconsiderate promise of the bishop, who did not exclude himself from admitting Cellarius, if the people of Schaffhausen approve it, since the benefice is only his, but the peasants of Schaffhausen, Conrad Klinger fears that something may perhaps be taken away from him by you, while in the meantime he presides over this church to gratify the widow and orphans. Therefore, he asked, while the matter is still under judgment, that I write something to your humanity for his sake.</p>
      <p>I have delayed this until now, as the matter is not yet settled. But because he asserts that this delay will be an obstacle for him, I did not want to deny what he asked. Thus, the school board had decided, which the senate also approved: Since Balthasar Mörikofer, a companion of Mr. Gwalther, was deprived of his stipend for a year due to a sin committed according to the laws of our church, and in the meantime, however, he neglected something as far as studies are concerned, so that he might winter with Mr. Gwalther and thus deal with him as indicated by the letter of the school board sent to Mr. Gwalther, in the meantime Conrad should preside over the church of Buchberg. For it seemed that this would be beneficial both for the widow left behind and the orphans, as well as for Conrad, who is now poor, on the condition that, while he tries to care for our church and the widow and orphans left behind, he is not deprived of 52 florins, which we do not doubt you can prevent with other symists.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, if it were in his interest to appoint him to some church among you, we do not prohibit it. This is our intention, while he is free as far as a certain condition is concerned, that he presides over this church (to his own advantage), from here another (whom I mentioned above) can return to us with greater benefit. But once this controversy is resolved, I will inform your humanity of more certain things, provided that in the meantime nothing is taken away from the unfortunate Klinger, whom we ask you to have commended to you and in the future will ask more vehemently on account of his services to our church and the widow. If we also had stipendiaries, he, not Cellarius, would rather prevail with us. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am troubling you too much, most humane man, with my unpolished writings; but indeed I do everything with good zeal, whence I ask that you judge the mind rather than the writings according to your wisdom and prudence. Schaffhausen, September 10, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient servant, Jakob Rüeger. To the most illustrious man, distinguished in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed brother in Christ, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich.</p>
