      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>My intention, honest man, is to act, but I will not do so without your advice. Indeed, in the matter of God, I have always sincerely taken care not to cause any offense to the weak, either through negligence or rashness. I will strive to continue doing the same to the best of my ability. But the situation is as follows: The church in the Linthal Valley, which is near me, has been without a priest for a year now; in the meantime, some have come to hear my sermons on Sundays. Moreover, I have faithfully and willingly served them in whatever they lacked in spiritual matters, especially in administering the sacrament of baptism. Except that they have never allowed me to preach the gospel in their church. This has been the case not only for that year but for six continuous years now, during which they had a priest for a short time but were mostly without one. Meanwhile, in the absence of a priest, the parishioners of this church have requested the ministry of baptism from me. In response to their actions, I have so far lived with the hope of better things and have gladly complied with their requests. Now, I truly feel that I have complied more than enough in this matter; therefore, with your advice, I will refuse them baptism in the future, especially for this reason: they seek and receive baptism from me, but by no means the word of God in the absence of a priest, especially since the majority have vowed not to admit an evangelical preacher to the church pulpit without the papal mass. Therefore, I report this matter to you, so that you may advise me in writing, through the messenger, the treasurer, on what should be done prudently and piously, so that no disturbance arises.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. November 20, 1538.</p>
      <p>We also desire your commentary on the book of the Apocalypse of John the Evangelist; oblige us so that we may enjoy it as soon as possible. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>F. Fonteius Glareanus.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned M. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of God's word at the Minster in Zurich, to his kind master, to be delivered.</p>
