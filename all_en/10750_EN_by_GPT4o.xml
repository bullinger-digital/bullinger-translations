      <p>My entirely friendly and good-willed service to you beforehand, well-learned, especially dear sir and friend.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter for which I was recently before the honorable council of the city of Zurich and with you, my gracious lords of Basel have already sent a diet schedule to an honorable council with you through the bearer of this letter, and they have requested that such a diet be communicated to those of Schaffhausen and St. Gallen, who should also be visited with their envoys, not to delay. I did not want to hide the reason from you, so that Doctor Joachim von Watt, as you well know how to do, would be appointed as an envoy from St. Gallen and would not be absent in these serious (weighty, important) matters.</p>
      <p>With that, whatever is dear and of service to you. May God grant you health and many good years.</p>
      <p>Dated Tuesday, the 4th of January, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Hans Rudolf Frey, of the council of the city of Basel.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the divine word in Zurich, my especially dear sir and friend.</p>
