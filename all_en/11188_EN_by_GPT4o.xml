    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for the delayed return of the [New] Testament [Zwingli's], which he wanted to keep until the completion of his own edition, and provides reasons why he could not send it with several messengers. He was held back, among other things, by his journey to the Valais, where the transition to the Reformation has not yet occurred only because they want to avoid unrest and because "Lutheranism" is discredited among the peasants; he received a favorable impression from the bishop [Adrian von Riedmatten] during a conversation. Leading circles secretly promote the evangelical doctrine, but out of consideration for the peasants, they adhere to mass and fasting; they are educated enough to be superior to the priests in a disputation, yet it is difficult to hold them accountable for their vices. The Valais would be more inclined towards Bern if it weren't for the local divorce practices causing offense, therefore Bullinger should publicly address this issue; Platter himself contributes to winning the country for Christ by admitting students. Asks Bullinger to forward a booklet from Wittenberg to Elgg and to be patient regarding the poetry [“Alexandreis” by Walter von Châtillon]; he is satisfied with the "Nizolius." Urges caution, as the mood in the Valais is on the brink; with skillful action, it might be possible to alienate the country from the Five Places. Apologizes for his lengthy writing. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt, esteemed Mr. Bullinger, that you are already so angry with me that you could not be more so, because I have not yet returned the testament until this day. Indeed, you probably believe that I have either lost it or damaged it so badly that I do not dare to return it, or that I do not want to return it at all. But none of these fears are true; I still have it in the same condition as I received it. The reasons for not returning it sooner are, and may I never be saved if they are not true, as follows. First, before I left for Frankfurt, I could not send it because I barely finished the testament before the fair. When I returned to Basel, I intended to give it to Froschauer, but he left before I knew it. Then I wanted to give it to Myconius, but I saw that he was already burdened with other matters. I did not dare to trust it to messengers, as I knew how often they are negligent, especially if, as they say, they have to serve the priests. So I kept it, expecting our Quirinus to return from the fair or his homeland. I have not seen him since the fair.</p>
      <p>Finally, it happened that I had to go to my homeland, where (to mention this in passing and give you, my dear Heinrich, something to rejoice in, for I know you and all pious people like to hear this) I found everything in such a state that there is a very certain hope, a very certain hope, I say, that they too will accept the truth. The only reason for the delay is that the good men there are waiting for an opportunity to do so without causing unrest. Even the bishop himself, with whom I had a long conversation and shared a meal, seems to be not a bad man. He sets his sails to the wind of the peasants. All the peasants unanimously cry out against the priests (for they live most disgracefully); however, they do not want Lutheranism because they think it is something abominable and utterly impious, as they have been misled and persuaded by the priests.</p>
      <p>The third group, those in power, that is, the highest after the bishop, all favor the gospel, and there is certainly a large number of them here and there, but they are not strong enough to be subdued by the peasants if they suspected them to be such. Therefore, they skillfully conceal this and meanwhile, here and there, first show the peasants and relatives what the true path to salvation is, at home and wherever the conversation turns to these matters. Therefore, they are suspected by everyone of being Lutherans; however, from their statements, they cannot be judged as Lutherans.</p>
      <p>For they admit that what they say is pious and not at all Lutheran, as long as they do not openly accuse the abuses. Meanwhile, the peasants themselves begin to criticize the abuses because of the priests' vices. And they carefully observe the suspects to see if they indicate anything that would accuse them of being Lutherans. But these good men avoid unrest and attend ceremonies with the others, always saying that the Lord's judgments must be awaited, and that He will find a way for things to proceed. And so you know, these are the kind of people who, if they had to confront the priests and debate, would easily be superior. For most of them are learned in Latin, not absolutely, but they understand somewhat what they read. Therefore, they are in the most obvious suspicion; but there is no one who dares to use force against them, as long as they attend masses with them, abstain from meat on prohibited days, as they say, etc. The peasants love them, as they elect them as magistrates. The priests do not dare to accuse them before the bishop, and if they secretly accuse them, he does not attempt to punish them openly, for the examples of others teach him how difficult it is to lay hands on the people of Valais.</p>
      <p>Thus, things are varied. They begin to hate the Five Places, their confederates, and transfer their love to the Bernese. The only thing that offends the pious about the Bernese is that they separate marriages. So they say.</p>
      <p>They admit that adulterers can indeed be separated; but that the one who sinned, or she, can associate with another, this greatly offends them. And today there is hardly anything that offends more, not only among them but everywhere, as good men fear that sin is committed here. And if only there were someone to address this issue! And I hardly know anyone who could do it better than you, if you set your mind to it. But it should not be written to my people, for then they would be suspected by the Five Places, and perhaps they would plot to destroy Christ in innocent children, as Herod attempted. But if I knew that you wanted to address this for Christ's sake or could do so because of your duties, I would tell you what torments them most here, etc. You will indicate, therefore, if anything, etc. I ask you for the sake of God's honor, if it is possible. If this nation could be brought to Christ, it would be almost over for the Five Places (so to speak). Things are going well if our offenses are absent. However, as I hope, things will proceed if good men assist. I have brought back ten boys with me and had five before; more will be sent, and there is no one who dares to speak against it anymore, no matter how sternly some have looked at me. The Lord must be prayed to show the way, and He will undoubtedly do so. I cannot write more, lest I cause you nausea by writing unpleasantly about pleasant things. I wanted to insert this in passing. I beg you for what I have prayed, that I may obtain it. But I return to the matter at hand.</p>
      <p>I returned to Basel on the day when our Otto returned to us from you. I began again to look for a messenger. Here Melchior Wirtius, along with two others, said he was going to the baths; I decided to give your testament to him. A certain woman known to me and born in Zurich intervened; she promised to take it and left without my knowledge. Thus, I was again deceived and very much grieved. Therefore, I wrote this letter so that, if no other messenger could be found, I would send my own. I also included another booklet from Wittenberg; if you can, send it to Elgg. I implore you, my Bullinger, not to be angry with me, for things are as I have written. I would have gladly sent another testament as well, so that you would have something not as a reward, but as a small gift for this service, but I feared it would not be welcome, as you already have one; but if you want anything else, let me know, and I will send it most willingly. As for the poem you sent, I ask you to delay a little; I am expecting an old copy from my homeland, with which I will compare it. Oporinus has a third one; I will speak to him about what he has decided regarding it. I am content with Nizolius. Everything is safe, and it is well if I have appeased you; but I hope you will forgive me when you hear what the cause was.</p>
      <p>What I wrote about the people of Valais, I would prefer to keep secret, lest any rumor reaches the enemies of the gospel and plots are made. They are already suspected, and the Valaisian peasants are still undecided; they could easily be swayed this way or that.</p>
      <p>Nothing would be better than if they could be separated from the Five Places, which will be difficult; but I hope it will happen, for the Valaisians are despised by them. In summary: What can I say, one must act wisely and have God before one's eyes and pray and not cease.</p>
      <p>Forgive me, I beg you by the love that should be mutual in Christ, for not having kept my word at first, which happened without my fault, and for burdening you with such tedious letters, even if they were written most elegantly, due to their length. I had decided to write very briefly, but once I started, it was so pleasant to converse with you that I did not know how to stop.</p>
      <p>Please greet on my behalf Mr. Collin and Amman, Theodor, etc. I would say more, but, as I said, this is already too much.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me commended to you in the Lord. Basel, July 12.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Platter.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the chief preacher of the word of God among the people of Zurich.</p>
