    <p xml:id="regest1">His relative Bartholomäus Bertlin and others have told him so many good things about Bullinger that he has long wanted to get in touch with him; at the request of citizens and the council, he has written a treatise on the plague, which he has extracted from Greek authors and adapted to the conditions in Germany, and he would like to have it printed in Zurich; he asks Bullinger to inquire with the printers whether this is possible at short notice.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>From the reports of many, when I returned home last year, and especially from Mr. Bartholomäus Bertlin, my blood relative and parish priest of the church in Augsburg, I received the most honorable mention of you, endowed with no less elegance of manners and humanity than your writings suggest, which, besides your erudition, with which you are endowed in every way, depict you as extremely moderate and possessing a wonderful sweetness of character. For this reason, I have greatly desired the opportunity to write to you more often, so that some familiarity might arise between us, since from a young age I have always considered those excelling in doctrine to be worthy of respect and embrace. But I do not know what has hindered me, so that I have not yet responded to my wishes, although I often promised your acquaintances that I would do so. And finally, I am glad that an opportunity has been offered to express my goodwill towards you, as I wish a certain treatise to come to light with your most acute judgment at this time. Although my mind is always reluctant in this most fortunate age, filled with the most illustrious men at my muses, who produce nothing but the most ingenious things drawn from the most ancient Hippocratic and Galenic art, yet the love of my fellow citizens and the constant urging of our council, to prescribe a true and certain method of protection and healing against this pestilential plague, have led me to think that it would be outside all bounds of piety and charity if I did not comply with them. Therefore, I have written a treatise on the plague according to the opinions of the most ancient Greeks, in which I have included the method of protection, how each person should guard themselves according to their temperament and what should be done daily to maintain a healthy bodily disposition, and of healing, how it should be driven away and overcome as quickly and conveniently as possible, with the most approved antidotes of the ancient Greeks, which I have especially adapted to our German region and our temperaments. I wish to have this published by your most diligent printers. And if yours could bring this to fruition shortly, it would be most gratifying to me and the council.</p>
      <p>These things, most learned Heinrich, I thought should be communicated to your humanity, so that I might make myself known to you, and then so that my work, which I have destined for the common use of the republic, might be more successfully published by your people. It remains only that you, for my sake, consult the printers, whether they can satisfy my endeavor shortly, which the necessity of this time greatly requires. Thereafter, do not disdain to inform me in turn of their opinion.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily, dearest man.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, the day before the Nones of October in the year 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Regel, physician of Memmingen.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man in every respect, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and patron. Doctor Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
