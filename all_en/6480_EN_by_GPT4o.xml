      <p>Greetings. I have eagerly read both Beza's booklet, which advocates your cause, or rather the cause of the church, and the proceedings of the Maulbronn colloquy. I am very pleased with both writings; however, as both Brentius and Jakob Andreae seem more eager and zealous for their own glory than for Christ's, I do not expect them to yield; for it would be shameful for such great men to appear to have been ignorant of something and to have learned it from the Zwinglians.</p>
      <p>But these matters are for another time.</p>
      <p>Now, at the request of a certain good man, I ask you to have someone from your circle (for I would not dare to impose this burden on you) inform me whether there are any houses in your republic and city where a certain amount of money is provided for the support of those who, due to old age or any other reasons, do not wish or are unable to manage their domestic affairs at home. I believe we would rightly call it a "Pflegeheim" (nursing home). Also, whether this house is open to everyone and how much money is needed for someone who wishes to be admitted (he and his wife are both fifty years old), what the treatment is like, and anything else of this kind. I have no one else to whom I can entrust this, and I hope someone from your circle will not begrudge taking on this task for my sake. Please convey my greetings to Mr. Gwalther in my words, to whom I should write more diligently than my current occupations allow; for he sent me his homilies on John as a gift. It seemed fitting to write these few things hastily, as letters from the lords of Stetten were to be sent to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most excellent and kind Mr. Bullinger, and continue to love me.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, May 26, 1565.</p>
      <p>Matthias Schenck, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned Heinrich Bullinger of Zurich, a lord and esteemed friend.</p>
