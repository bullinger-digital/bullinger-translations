    <p xml:id="regest1">The Neuenburg "Classe". The admonition and formal reprimand are handled as follows: The person to be admonished must withdraw; then the dean inquires with the neighbors and relatives whether they are aware of any transgression by this brother [pastor] against the church or the pastoral service by him or his family; then the others are asked what admonition they consider appropriate; thereafter, the brother [pastor] is called back and kindly admonished, based on the advice and judgment of all, to perform his service piously and contribute to the building of the church. The opponent [Jean Chaponneau] of the "Classe" claims: 1. Brotherly reprimand is an act of love and falls under the divine commandment, from which no one should be exempt. 2. Since the rule of brotherly reprimand is binding, it is not tied to a specific time [such as the meeting of the "Colloque" or the "Classe"]. 3. The formal reprimand, whose goal is the improvement of the sinful brother, should therefore not only be postponed but sometimes even abolished. 4. According to the command of Christ, "If your brother sins against you" etc. [Mt 18, 15], admonition in private must precede a public denunciation. 5. Whoever is attached to the brother and even to one whose sin is known to the public, in Christian love, acts wisely if he first admonishes him secretly, then, if he does not listen, repeats this in the presence of one or two witnesses, and only then reports the obstinate one to the congregation. 6. This person must not be reported to just any congregation, but only to the one of which he is a member. [In Farel's hand:] The brothers [pastors] say that the correction they exercise is pious and useful so that the church and the doctrine are not harmed but preserved more purely. The opponent [Chaponneau] claims that the exercised censorship contradicts the word of the Lord, whereas every pastor should first be admonished personally, then before the people he instructs, and never in the assembly of the teaching brothers [pastors]; one must wonder that what he observed does not lead to a change of mind in him, as there were two [pastors, Claude de Glant and Alexandre Le Bel] who behaved badly and did not want to obey the admonitions of the brothers [pastors] nor the command of the magistrate, because they relied on the people blinded by them, who now hate the disaster they previously wished for in ruinous love.</p>

      <p>To the most learned and equally distinguished in piety, Heinrich Bullinger, highly esteemed pastor of the Zurich church, in Zurich.</p>
      <p>The Neuenburg "Classe".</p>
      <p>The admonition and correction among the ministers of the word are handled in this manner. The one to be admonished is ordered to leave; once he has left, the dean asks the neighbors and relatives if they know of anything in that brother which openly offends the church, whereby its edification might be hindered and the pastor's ministry could be criticized, both because of him and his family. Then, individually, the others are asked what they consider entirely worthy of admonition. When each has given their opinion, the brother is called back and, based on the advice and judgment of all, is candidly and kindly admonished to perform his duty piously and to build up the church. The opponent of the "Classe".</p>
      <p>1. Brotherly correction is an act of charity falling under God's commandment, from which we believe no one should be exempt.</p>
      <p>2. The commandment of brotherly correction, since it is affirmative, does not bind for any specific time.</p>
      <p>3. Therefore, it is permissible to not only defer correction, whose end is the amendment of the erring brother, but sometimes to abstain from it altogether.</p>
      <p>4. According to Christ's command: If your brother sins against you, private admonition must precede public denunciation.</p>
      <p>5. Whoever is moved by Christian love towards a brother, or one laboring under a notorious sin, acts wisely if he first admonishes him secretly, then, if he does not listen, admonishes him again in the presence of one or two witnesses according to the order prescribed by Christ, and finally reports him to the church if he does not yield to repeated admonitions.</p>
      <p>6. It is not just any church to which the denunciation should be made, but the one of which the obstinate person is a member.</p>
      <p>The brothers say that the correction they maintain is holy and useful, so that the church is built up and the doctrine does not offend the church with morals, but both are preserved more purely. The opponent says that the censorship is entirely contrary to the word of the Lord, but that any pastor should first be admonished separately, then before the people he teaches, and never in the assembly of the teaching brothers. And it is surprising that what he has seen does not lead him to think otherwise: for there were two who entered badly and acted worse in the church, and neither heeding the exhortations of the brothers nor obeying the magistrate's command, relying on the people they had deluded, who now hate the plagues they previously desired with ruinous love.</p>
