    <p xml:id="regest1">Has learned from Capito that he will go to Zurich and Constance, after Luther approved Bucer's doctrine of the Lord's Supper in his writing "Ad Monasterienses" and only Schnepf and Brenz were still hesitating to agree. Urges caution and presses for joint steps. The action against the slanders spread by the Württemberg Lutherans was left to Zurich at the Diet in Baden. Has learned of the punishment of the pastor [Hans] Lux [Riem]; however, a councilor is said to have been treated more leniently after a similar offense.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I was expecting your apology, dearest Heinrich. Capito intervened, as I hear, intending to visit you and the people of Constance, bringing news that Luther has agreed to the concord, and that Bucer will not only approve but also defend to the death his confession on the Eucharist in the booklet "Ad Monasterienses." Only Schnepf and Brenz are still struggling with obstinacy. Capito briefly hinted at this in a short letter he sent me. Therefore, I beseech you, dearest brother, that we are not forced to swear to agreed words or subscribe to anyone who does not speak most openly about the matter, as I observed in your letter, of which you sent a copy. Advise us, communicate with us, recognize us as brothers of one faith, and act without neglecting us. Let there be one faith and the freedom to teach our faith. I would prefer concord, provided it does not bring about greater discord, provided the truth is not obscured by ambiguities, and that consideration is also given to our common people. The brothers in Strasbourg are working diligently, but we must be extremely cautious that neither they nor we are deceived. For it is a significant change in Luther if he allowed himself to be moved by the Augsburg envoy, whom neither the prince of the Hessians nor his own soul, namely Melanchthon, could move before. Therefore, my dear Heinrich, let us not be the last and perpetually ignorant of these matters both in learning and in place.</p>
      <p>Your envoy at the Diet in Baden was entrusted with the matter of the Württemberg Lutheran bishops. Therefore, inquire what your people will do; for the others have entrusted the matter to yours, so that either a diet is called on this matter or at the next Diet in Baden they confer their plans with other pious people.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>August 28, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>I hear that the minister of the word, Hans Lux Riem, has suffered deserved punishment, but a certain councilor, guilty of a similar crime years ago, was punished only as an adulterer.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his beloved lord and brother.</p>
