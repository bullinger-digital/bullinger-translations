      <p>Your letters, reverend father in Christ, were delivered to me today, but in the evening.</p>
      <p>I had nothing to reply; Mr. Hercules von Salis has entirely committed himself to writing to you; for he respects and loves you, but he said he was embarrassed because he would Italianize while writing and could not do so in Latin. His son, Rudolf, solemnly promised that he would soon enough inform us about Venetian affairs; for he is very well informed about them. Therefore, since he himself writes nothing, I do not think there is anything worth reporting to you.</p>
      <p>What I recently wrote about Vergerio, I wrote somewhat agitatedly, but I wrote the truth and could add much more, but I reserve it for now. I have not seen Brentius's book and I doubt if he wrote against you by name; for Vergerio denies that this was done. There is no need for me to send Vergerio's book; for our citizens and among them Mr. Balinggetus had reported it to me; in the meantime, I inspected it myself, it is Vergerio's retraction; for I gather that you have that book from the fact that Vergerio, among other things, when he complained about you, also added this: that when you inspected that book, you indignantly threw it from your hands because it did not satisfy you in the matter of the sacrament. I rejoice that Mr. Martyr has returned to us safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Our consul had promised to share the acts of the House of God; but he has not yet done so; I will send them when he does. I cannot say more now.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>I have compiled my sermons held in Ilanz into a small book.</p>
      <p>God is my witness that I do not seek any small glory, but I am entirely focused on strengthening our people; for without a doubt, the pope will also undertake other things.</p>
      <p>If my book satisfies the censors, I ask you, on some occasion, to be an advocate to Froschauer, that he may print it promptly; for it is a type of argument that, due to its novelty, is more pleasing. Farewell, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>Chur, 24th of November, in the year 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, the most vigilant doctor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
