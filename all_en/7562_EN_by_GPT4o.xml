      <p> The council has just adjourned. The prevailing opinion was: first, that the monks should be attacked and examined regarding their external goods, so that nothing is taken away from the Rhaetians; second, that the monastery should be destroyed; third, that a great assembly should be convened, in which the vote of each community is collected, so that everything can be discussed more extensively. If only the other jurisdictions would do the same! - As I was leaving the court, I met Mr. Christian Breding, who claims that his relative, Captain Remigius von Schauenstein, has written that 36 loads, that is, seum, gold, and money, on mules, have been captured by Albano von Uri, and among the 36 loads, there are supposed to be two barrels of pure gold. Behold the miraculous and magical collection! Also, the chief magistrate of Lyon has beheaded 3 captains who intended to harm the evangelicals, etc. </p>
      <p> Farewell. August 10, 1568. Chur. </p>
      <p> Most submissive to your lordship, Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Church of Zurich, his most gracious and ever-faithful lord. Zurich. </p>
