      <p>Honorable, highly learned, especially dear sir and friend, my always willing and friendly service to you first.</p>
      <p>Although your letter, sent by my servant and messenger Cristoffer Werndl, dated June 13, has reached me, and it would therefore be appropriate to write back to you and respond, it has not been possible due to the reason that I have not been at home for a while, but have had to travel to other places on the orders and service of my gracious prince and lord, Duke Albrecht of Bavaria, etc.</p>
      <p>As for the matter concerning my three sons, which I have entrusted to Mr. Doctor Gessner for Mr. Rudolf Funck, your honor has previously understood my compelling reasons, and I have had no other complaint regarding the dealings of the honorable and well-renowned man, Mr. Gessner, concerning my sons, except that he is so burdened with other highly important matters and studies that he has been able to pay less attention to my sons. I also do not wish to be less grateful and friendly to Mr. Gessner for his proven kindness, and it displeases me that he will not let his previously intended goodwill towards me and my children fail.</p>
      <p>I will, in turn, wherever I can, be friendly in my obligations, with a diligent request that your honor will inform him of this on my behalf.</p>
      <p>I have also written to Mr. Rudolf Funck and inquired about the well-being of my sons, with the utmost request that he be entrusted with their good spiritual and physical discipline and maintenance. Thus, I also very confidentially and friendly request your honor, especially if you notice or observe that Wilhelm is disobedient or unruly, not to allow him such behavior in any way, but to take such diligent and honorable ways and means to bring him to and maintain him in all disciplinary obedience. For I can testify before God, my Lord, that it would not be pleasing to me, but rather a significant concern, if he or his other brothers should not conduct themselves as they ought, or engage in discipline and learning, in which all I, as the father, should not be lacking.</p>
      <p>Continue to act further in this matter as my friendly trust in you stands. I am eager to earn your favor with body and goods for you and yours. In addition, I ask that you write back to me with the next dispatch, how my sons have improved in learning or how all matters concerning them have been managed, and let such a letter reach Mr. Doctor Gerion Seiller via Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Lastly, I thank your honor for the diligence and effort shown so far, which I have not only heard from my aforementioned servant but have found to be true, very friendly, and I am eager to earn such. May God, the heavenly Father, always share His divine grace with you and your household. With this, I faithfully commend you.</p>
      <p>Dated Munich, August 22, 1554. Pankraz von Freyberg, Bavarian Marshal, by my own hand.</p>
