      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, my Bullinger, dearest brother and the most radiant light in the church of God. I have with me three letters written last year; the first was dated January 6, 1568, the second March 20, 1568, and the third August 24, 1568; furthermore, your books "On the Origin of Error" are with me as a gift from you. As for why I have not yet responded to your most delightful and piety-breathing letters, I prefer to offer no reasons rather than those that are indeed trivial and empty. Therefore, omitting excuses, I give great thanks to my Heinrich, both for deigning to visit me so frequently with his letters and for continuing to bless me with such pious gifts. Indeed, I give the greatest thanks from my heart to God, the best and greatest, who has established you as the most solid pillar for the propagation of His truth. I pray that our Lord God may make you long-lived for His glory and the benefit of His church, which is now being pressed into a narrow place and is oppressed from all sides; about which even the adversaries are contemplating and eagerly expecting triumph. But "why do the nations rage, etc.?"</p>
      <p>We must confidently hope that God will not forsake His own in the end. May the Lord scatter the plans of those Swiss who have departed from you with such great spirits to the French! The Assyrians threatened the people of Jerusalem terribly, but to their great harm. If God is for us, who can be against us? Our affairs (thanks be to God!) are still quite peaceful, except that the Canaanites among us are incredibly numerous, waiting daily for the donkey to speak.</p>
      <p>Our Abel still lives, a most excellent man, but he is gravely afflicted by his gout. There is a great harvest of pious young men in our academies. We hope the Lord will increase the laborers who are sent into His harvest; this should be our unique comfort, as we shortly expect our release, so that souls may be returned to heaven and bodies entrusted to the earth.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, and let us help each other with mutual prayers to God. You will greet my Julius, a man not unknown to me.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely.</p>
      <p>To the dearest brother in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>"Letters of the Bishop of Ely 1568."</p>
