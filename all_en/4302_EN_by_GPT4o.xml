      <p> Greetings. Balthasar Funck, a consular man of the Memmingen republic and especially pious, as well as our mutual friend, returning to us from there yesterday, after conveying many greetings to me in your name, added that you had told him many new things about the affairs of Poland, which you wished to communicate to me as well in person. However, since he could not promise in good faith to do so due to his untrustworthy and fleeting memory, you, out of your perpetual benevolence towards me, voluntarily promised to have everything carefully transcribed and sent with the next messenger you have from me. </p>
      <p> Indeed, my venerable and dearest brother, since I have found no one going there and soon returning, despite diligent searching, I earnestly beseech you to entrust whatever it is that you wish to be safely conveyed to me, to our Mangold, who also manages our other affairs with the utmost care; for he will transmit everything as soon as any opportunity arises. First of all, you will indicate whether it is true, as my relative Albert von Breitenlandenberg wanted me to know immediately after Funck's departure, that the Bernese are in arms, adding nothing further; for I cannot be persuaded to believe it, since Funck did not mention anything of the sort to us here, when it cannot be that your people would be unaware of it if it were true. I began to write this the day after Funck had left, when someone offered to go there, but he was called away elsewhere and disappointed me. Therefore, I must await another opportunity to send this through someone going there, but returning to us, to receive in return what you have given. Now I receive letters from Calvin through French merchants, a part of which I will transcribe and give to you, in case you have not yet received these from him. My dearest niece Petronella, from my sister, is now here with her youngest brother to visit the excellent wife of Jacob RÃ¶sti, their cousin. Petronella, being keen on weaving tapestries and having heard that your daughters are very skilled in this art as well as in embroidery, earnestly wishes to have the opportunity to visit them and to observe their craftsmanship more closely, which, due to your usual benevolence and kindness towards our family, I know will be possible for both my niece and your daughters. Farewell, my soul, venerable and dearest brother in the Lord, with your entire household, whom you will greet honorably and most lovingly on my behalf, along with all the brothers and friends who love us in the Lord. I commend myself and mine to your sacred prayers and pious intercessions. </p>
      <p> Farewell again. June 4, 1560. </p>
      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer. </p>
