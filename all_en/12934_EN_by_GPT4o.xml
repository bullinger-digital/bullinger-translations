    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] It is going downhill! The deserved punishment of God for the transgressions and ingratitude [of the German Protestants] is expected at any time. The Papists even threaten with death! There is nothing left but to ask God to endure the chastisement with humility. The people of Memmingen have sent a delegation to Emperor Charles V in Eger in the Bohemian Forest. This delegation is to try to reduce the extremely high fine. If it fails, Memmingen would be doomed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] This "ever exalted" one is draining the imperial cities to the last! The Papists want to put an end to German freedom. The main thing is that they are doing well and can rejoice (not to say something obscene)!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In Ulm, the Antichrist raises his head. Many masses are being held there (in the temple of the "Dominicans," it is whispered). The noble citizens are throwing themselves into the arms of the devil! Everything is full of hypocrisy! The soldiers [of the imperial garrison] are amazed at the shameless fickleness of these noble people of Ulm and punish them with all severity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The pastors of Memmingen continue to proclaim the pure Gospel. The revival of the Carthusians in nearby [Buxheim] is an annoyance!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The outcome of the war between the Emperor and Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony is uncertain, even though so far fortune seems to favor the latter. The Emperor's attempts to recruit mercenaries in Memmingen and the surrounding area have been unsuccessful because the population did not want to participate. He is so bold that he even demands participation in the war from the Swabian nobility and from some even a considerable sum of money. Sultan Suleiman is said to be arming strongly against the Empire, while King Ferdinand persecutes the confessors of the truth to death.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Who will put an end to this tribulation, and when? It seems that the hour of the wrath of the righteous judge has struck. May the Lord end it soon and grant steadfastness!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Apart from that, Schuler and his people are doing well. Bullinger, pray for him and the Memmingen church! Greetings also to Anna [n√©e Adlischwyler] and the children. Schuler would write more if it were not dangerous.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen. Our affairs, venerable brother in the Lord, are in decline. We expect the heavy hand of the Lord any day now, and not without reason. For our sins, the contempt of the offered benefit, and immense ingratitude demand it. The Papists are plotting with their might, threatening us with extreme horrors. We have nothing left but to fervently pray to the Lord, so that we may bear His hand with great patience. The delegates of our city are with the Emperor in Eger, near the Bohemian Forest, pleading for the reduction of the extremely heavy fine imposed on us. May the Lord grant that they find favor with the Emperor; if not, Memmingen is surely doomed.</p>

      <p>Believe me, this "ever exalted" one is plucking the imperial cities bare, so that they can barely recover. I fear that German freedom is at an end, for the Papists desire nothing more than its destruction, as long as they themselves are well and can revel freely, not to say something more impudent.</p>

      <p>In Ulm, the Antichrist raises his crest: Masses are being held vigorously (it is whispered in the temple of the Dominicans). The greater part of the city's citizens, I say, follow Belial (the Devil)! Everything there is full of hypocrisy, so much so that the soldiers are amazed at the shamelessness and fickleness of the Ulm citizens and severely persecute them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We in Memmingen still purely preach Christ, with the Spirit of Christ strengthening us. The Carthusians near our city have revived, to our great offense.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>An uncertain war is being waged between the Emperor and the Elector of Saxony, although fortune has so far favored the latter. The Emperor recently tried to gather soldiers in our area and surrounding cities, but he could achieve nothing against the unwilling hearts of the people. He dared to call the entire nobility of Swabia to war, from whom he also demands a large sum of money. In short: there is no end to the furious exactions. They say that the Turk is preparing a great military force against us. Meanwhile, the King of the Romans thirsts for the blood of the confessors of the truth.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Good God, who and when will put an end to these tribulations? Everything breathes the burning wrath of the just judge upon us. May the Lord bring an end to this and grant us great steadfastness of spirit, so that we may persevere in holy fear!</p>

      <p>I and my people are otherwise doing well through the Lord. Pray for me, dear brother, and for the church entrusted to me. Greet your wife and children warmly from me. Farewell in the Lord, incomparable friend! Given in Memmingen, April 19, 1547. If it could be done without danger, I would write more. Yours sincerely, G. S.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, Lord, brother, and dearest old friend. Zurich.</p>
