      <p>In Augsburg, things are currently very quiet; they are brooding over an egg.</p>
      <p>In Venice, you may have heard about the terrible floods and the sea's outbursts, and the great damage it has caused, which people want to consider as a portent and a bad omen.</p>
      <p>Brother JÃ¶rg has killed 3000 Turks. The Pope is supposed to send 20,000 Italians against those from Magdeburg.</p>
      <p>A group of people has taken the bishopric from the Bishop of Bremen, and it is not yet known who the leader of the group is or who sent them; however, a captain from the same group writes to another captain about how well-organized they are and that they are still strengthening; they have 2000 well-equipped horses and 24 banners of good soldiers; he dares not write what their intentions are; but soon wonders will be heard. These things are written by a man of the most reliable faith; but what will come of it, God knows.</p>
      <p>Speaking humanly, the good people of Magdeburg will have to give in; they cannot hold out in the long run, as the Emperor has roused the entire empire against them, etc.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that we all must go into the sack. May God grant faithful patience, so that in it we may overcome the world and its princes! Yet nothing emerges from which one might hope for liberation; indeed, all assumptions indicate that the persecution against those who love God and His word will grow ever stronger and more intense. For upon the Emperor's death and during the interregnum or even the election of another emperor, one hoped for change and liberation. But now all that has been preempted, as they have already agreed on a new emperor and king, so that as soon as this one closes his eyes, the others immediately take over and continue what this one has started. In summary, the back must submit to the cross; we must prepare ourselves for that alone; otherwise, I see well, all is lost; I see then, that no one turns to God with seriousness and zeal with their people, so I would then believe very differently.</p>
