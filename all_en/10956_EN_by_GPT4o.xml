      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ. Oh, how I long to hear from you, most esteemed Bullinger, what was done and concluded in Basel! Would that everything had succeeded according to the word of the Lord! I hear that the brothers in Basel desired our presence, but were displeased by our absence. But what could have been done by us? Furthermore, I hear that Bucer was not entirely well; however, I hope he has recovered. In any case, out of your goodness and benevolence, indeed for the benefit of our church, you will inform us of all things worthy of knowing.</p>
      <p>We have read your response, and it was pleasing. But we wonder what was agreed upon among you, what was added, what was erased. I am sending it back to you with thanks.</p>
      <p>Brother Konrad and Thomas, and then the fellow brothers, wish you well.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your whole household.</p>
      <p>November 18, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>If you have anything that should not be entrusted to letters and that we should know here, I am ready to understand it from you in person.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, and do not cease to love our church. We are accused by some as if we are overly zealous. But the Lord knows our minds. The Lord will prove who is wiser. We will gladly offer sacrifices for our ignorance. But knowingly, we do not sin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church in Zurich, his most beloved and esteemed brother.</p>
