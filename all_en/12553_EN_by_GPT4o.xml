    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer will likely have received the letter [No. 2493], which was entrusted to Hans Rych from Rapperswil. After the arrival of Blarer's letter [No. 2503], Bullinger inquired about Rych and learned that he only departed [from Rapperswil] last Saturday.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Apart from what Blarer will gather from the letter of the Z端rich council, there is nothing special to report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Several war-experienced [Z端richers] do not find it advisable to capture many more towns and castles after the conquest of [Ehrenberg Pass], because then the [military] forces would have to be divided for the garrison. It would be much better to attack the [imperial] army at Salem. For if Emperor [Charles V were attacked by Landgrave Philip of Hesse], it would be advantageous not to have imperial troops at the back.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Enclosed is a copy regarding the arrangement of public prayers in the city and countryside [of Z端rich].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Blarer should diligently report on the situation.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I trust you have now received my letter through Hans Rych from Rapperswil, as I have diligently inquired about him after your last writing and learned that he only departed last Saturday.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Besides, there is nothing special, as you will gather from the letter of the Z端rich council.</p>

      <p>Many of our honorable, war-experienced people think that after obtaining and losing the pass, it is not good to capture many towns and castles, because the troops would have to be divided for the garrisons. It would be much better to attack the forces, especially those at Salem, so that if you must march down against the Emperor, you do not have to leave a force behind you. Moreover, it is known and public that whoever holds the main battles has the towns and castles opened (captured). Therefore, they think you should direct your efforts towards that. I show you this with good intention; for certainly, they mean very well with you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>As public prayers have been arranged in the countryside, so also in the city, of which you have a copy here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Write back to me diligently, for I am eager to know how things stand. Farewell, farewell. July 21, at noon 12, 1546.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
