      <p>To Christoph Stiltz.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Christ.</p>
      <p>Your letter has been so well received by us, dear Christoph, that we are sending back a booklet instead of a letter, so that you cannot accuse us of laziness and silence. But I know that for a long time you have been looking at us with a stern gaze, blaming the instigation of Johannes and especially my rashness. But I ask you to be more lenient, for Johannes prefers to respond through me rather than bear such a burden alone. As for myself, I say nothing else than that I wanted to repay that greeting you wished for me with the same spirit, so that you would see it was most pleasant to me. Therefore, receive, dear Christoph, what we respond in the name of both of us.</p>
      <p>And at the beginning, we do not despise anyone, since everyone stands or falls before the common Lord, and no one comes to this doctrine of God unless the Father draws him. We do not need external support, as we attempt to consume the porridge mixed by God rather than by men. We promise nothing difficult about ourselves, but in the meantime, we are certainly more certain that the doctrine drawn from the law, the prophets, and the apostles and preached in our time cannot be false, just as it is not false that the heavens will never fall. Therefore, we attribute nothing more to ourselves than the faithful remnant, than even your Ambrose, and ours too, when he said: "I do not want us to be believed, let the scriptures be recited."</p>
      <p>You later emphasize some kind of Christian modesty, which is not unlike the reproaches of the Lutherans you attribute to us. And what can we, my dear Christoph, respond to you here, except what Paul commands his Timothy, saying: "Preach the word, be ready in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all patience and teaching!" Thus we see that John the Baptist, Christ himself, Peter, and Paul were somewhat harsher whenever hypocrites, having rejected the word of God, attempted to play a masked comedy. We also know that we must receive the weak with gentleness according to the apostle's command, but the weak in faith, not openly impious and opponents of the truth, who are to be utterly abandoned and driven away by the word from the people of Christ if they persist in being subverters: 1 Tim. 1 [20]; Tit. 1 [10ff]. There are many examples of this kind among the prophets. But hey, where is your Jerome now? Where is Origen? Where is Augustine? Did they allow their adversaries to do whatever they pleased? So who is that Rufinus, who is that Celsus, Faustus, and Julian, against whom the most holy fathers inveigh with such indignation? We do not say this because we have taken up the defense of calumny, which is nothing so venomous, impious, and unchristian, but because we deny it is calumny whenever zeal for God and the benefit of the people resists perverters with pen, mouth, and deeds.</p>
      <p>But if you look more at the life of the teachers than at their doctrine, see that it does not happen to you what is known to have happened to Barnabas, who, when he observed Peter's behavior more than his doctrine, fell into such hypocrisy that he needed Paul as a liberator. The place in Galatians 2 [13ff] is well known. Or what reason, then, that the Lord commands the Pharisees to be heard, but forbids them to be imitated? What? Does the Lord want falsehoods to be heard? Does he forbid following those who do good? Therefore, it can happen that those who are evil in deed are good in doctrine. What? Would you reject the truth even if offered by a troglodyte? I do not think so. Therefore, who compels you to believe liars? How often must it be emphasized? If we speak the truth, it is right that you believe the truth, but if otherwise, turn away! Furthermore, what the scriptures teach is true, what is proclaimed beyond this is false; we are compelled to say this. However, we do not deny that any true Christian expresses in deeds what he more easily explains in words.</p>
      <p>Are you the one who judges us as servants of another master? Are you the one who accuses brothers of crimes? For you write thus: "You do not do deeds worthy of Christ, but you set forth some kind of faith even without works." Is this your Christian modesty? To accuse those who strive for charity and innocence (as much as is given, for no one ever suddenly reaches the heavens) of paganism? Please use good words. For what else are deeds unworthy of Christ than the fruits of children walking in darkness? And if you do not know, read Ephesians 4 [17ff] and 5 [8ff], 1 John 2 [9ff] and Romans 1 [18ff]. Oh, therefore, and oh, our wretched souls, if they were forced to be subject to such rash judgment! May your mind give you your own. And what kind of faith do we set forth? I seem to see that you still do not know what we think about faith and works. Therefore, receive briefly and abstain from intolerable mockeries. We assert that faith is an anointing from God, by which the faithful are assured of that salvation they have obtained through Christ. Its office, condition, and nature are to pacify the heart, justify, and produce good fruits, not indeed those that contribute anything to justification, since faith alone by itself is absolute justification, but those that are necessary by providence. All of which the divine apostle taught thus in Ephesians 1 [4ff] and 2 [8ff], Romans 4 [1ff], 3 [21ff], 10 [4ff], Galatians 3 [1ff], 2 [15ff]. But perhaps you would prefer brevity, so receive this. Nothing pacifies the heart except faith alone, therefore nothing justifies except faith alone. The antecedent of scripture is Isaiah 57 [15ff], Acts 15 [8f], Romans 5 [1f], Galatians 3 [1ff], Hebrews 9 [14]. The progress is supported by this, that righteousness is nothing other than the peace and life of the heart: Galatians 2 [19f]; 1 John 5 [11 ff]. Again: once a testament is confirmed, nothing should be added, nothing taken away, provided we believe Paul's words, Galatians 3 [15]. Since with the testament a single seed has been assigned to us, in which we obtain the blessing, and it is not established in many, Genesis 22 [16ff], Galatians 3 [15ff], who does not see the immovable sentence: Christ alone is the sole righteousness of the human race, which is not established in any other seed, and is communicated to us by faith alone? If you doubt, read John 1 [18], 3 [13ff], 6 [46], 12 [44ff], Romans 3 [21ff]. Again: it cannot be that any reward or justification is due to works done out of duty and necessity: Luke 17 [10]; Romans 4 [2ff]. But all the works of Christians are done out of duty and that necessity by which God disposes all things from eternity, Ephesians 2 [10]; therefore, it cannot be that any righteousness is due to works. Indeed, we do not separate faith from hope and charity, except where one extends more widely than the other. Therefore, what need is there for scriptural passages among those who do not deny good works, but indeed demand them? Yet they do not attribute justification to them, lest the blood of Christ be made void: Galatians 2 [21]. We pray to God, the best and greatest, that he may so correct the morals of our bishops, that we may not too often feel wolves from their fruits, and grant to all equally professing the gospel, that they may be blameless lights of the world and such as the apostle wants bishops to be.</p>
      <p>About my marriage, you write: "I do not disapprove that you have taken a wife, but that you have taken her in such a way that you cling to her and forsake Christ." So hear what the apostle answers you: "But this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a snare upon you, but for that which is comely and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction." Behold, with what acumen the apostle compresses the whole discussion into a few heads, and wants all the nerves of counsel to be directed here, that we may conduct the matter in such a way that we may attend upon the Lord without distraction. Now, since none are more torn from the Lord than those whom the flames of the flesh burn, I thought I could adhere more strongly to God if I extinguished them by marriage, which otherwise I could not extinguish without grievous offense to God; for as "marriage is honorable among all and the bed undefiled," so "God will judge adulterers and fornicators."</p>
      <p>Now what you wrote about the sacrifice of the mass has refreshed us with no small joy, because we saw you liberated from a pernicious error and therefore wish you to become more instructed in this matter. In every sacrifice that ought to abolish sins, it is necessary that blood be shed, because "without the shedding of blood there is no remission": Hebrews 9 [22]. But in the mass, which has been sold for the expiation of the living and the dead, blood is not shed, since the blood of Christ, once shed, always suffices to take away all sins of all: Ephesians 1 [7]; Galatians 1 [4]; Colossians 1 [14]; Hebrews 10 [11ff]. Therefore, it cannot be that the mass is a sacrifice.</p>
      <p>But in this you still err, as you seem to urge me to a peculiar sacrifice. I confess that among Christians there is one sacrifice, namely the calves of the lips and the mortification of the body: Hosea 14 [2]; Psalm 39 [40,6ff]; 49 [50, 14]; Romans 12 [1f]; Hebrews 13 [15]. But who is there who does not know that all Christians equally are priests according to this sacrifice? Consult the text Exodus 19 [6], Isaiah 61 [6], 66 [20ff], 1 Peter 2 [9]. What religion, then, is it to devour widows' houses under the pretext of a long prayer and peculiar sacrifice? As if, indeed, the sacrifice of an anointed and shaven, or rather cloaked, priest were better, and not rather this better, which is more ardent. The judgment of the scriptures is this. Therefore, there is no reason to reproach us with Luther's different opinion or the impiety of that Rütling. What does it matter to Christ that Origen once thought the same as the Rütling rogue? Therefore, is faith in Christ vain because Sabellius and Valentinus thought ill of Christ? Indeed, what does it matter to the faithful that Pomeranus, Zwingli, Luther, Oecolampadius, Regius, and Fabritius disagree? As they do not regard the person, 1 Corinthians 3 [5ff], 4 [1ff], and who undoubtedly know that heresies must exist, namely, that the more approved may be tested: 1 Corinthians 11 [19]. Do you not know that all flesh is grass, but the word of the Lord alone remains forever?</p>
      <p>Therefore, when we have sailed to the rock and the sacred anchor of the ship stands firm, there is nothing that can tear us away from the word of God, even if the whole cohort of doctors should fall away, even if the whole world should be in turmoil; so, my dear Christoph, your ironies are in vain. You lament: "Where now is the easy scripture?" - But the royal prophet sings: "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple." "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." And Peter calls the prophetic scripture a lamp; therefore, what do we say about the apostolic? You add: "Which even idiots ought to understand." But Christ, the salvation of the human race, prays: "I thank you, Father, that you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to babes." Which will be most clear elsewhere in Corinthians: 1 Corinthians 1 [18ff] and 2 [10ff]. What, that elsewhere Paul thus pronounces: "But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing; in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, lest the light of the gospel should shine on them?"</p>
      <p>After much, you finally demand scriptures from me, you complain that I have not yet refuted Erasmus's book on impiety; from which I could easily suspect that you have not observed more closely what we wrote in passing about the providence of God, for we could not give certain things, being very busy with other matters, and we thought these would suffice for the learned. Therefore, we will give scriptures, but also these in passing. It is written: "In God we live, move, and have our being." It is therefore evident that all things begin, happen, and end by the power of God. Which is written elsewhere thus: "From God and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory!" To which the wisest of the prophets, Moses, subscribes in Deuteronomy 31 [6ff], the royal prophet David in Psalm 103 [104,1ff], and the apostolic church in Acts 4 [24ff]. He who detracts from the divine operation and power, is he pious or impious? And he who attributes to man by free will what is God's, does he not detract from the divine operation and power? Add that it is written: "For in his hand are we and our words and all wisdom and the discipline of the knowledge of works."</p>
      <p>And "it is God who works in you both to will and to do." And more clearly: "We are not sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God." Who, then, is he who attributes free will to man? For salvation is not in our hands, but in his: John 10 [28f]. He draws whom he wills and hardens whom he wills: John 6 [44]; Romans 9 [18]; Isaiah 45 [7]. And the understanding of man knows nothing but carnal things, meditates on the same, and the will: Romans 7 [14ff]; 1 Corinthians 2 [6ff]; Ephesians 2 [3]. Therefore, Paul says: "These are contrary to each other" (flesh and spirit), "so that you do not do the things that you wish." Add to these the story of Balaam in the Mosaic Numbers. Finally, the body is not taken by its own will: Matthew 5 [29ff]; 6 [25ff]; 10 [17ff]. Consult Psalm 38 [1 ff] and in summary Romans 8 [3ff], 9 [11ff]. Elsewhere it is thus concluded: "In Christ we are predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will."</p>
      <p>Therefore, I repeat: "If there is providence, there is no free will; otherwise, providence would not be providence. If, however, there is free will, then there is no providence; otherwise, free will would not be free will." But enough of these things. You have, I believe, the scriptures, you have the impiety of man, more escaped than devised. For I am not so ungrateful to those who have deserved well, as I am wont to be angry with those who detract from God and extend the boundaries of our powers beyond the law of God. At present, I could not give more copious things, as I am constantly exercising my pen, as you pray, for the glory of Christ; if only you understand it, in which we believe and confess that Christ alone "is given to us by the Father as wisdom and righteousness, sanctification and redemption."</p>
      <p>Then you ask why I do not despise those who introduce new rites in the matter of the Eucharist without scripture, such as our Zwingli. But come, let him be ours, since he is a Christian! In the meantime, consider what we should answer. He who asserts that the bread of the Eucharist and the wine of the cup are nothing other than bread and wine, furthermore that the body of Christ sits at the right hand of the Father, teaches what the entire primitive church, the holy scripture, and the catholic faith have taught. But he who preaches an impanated god brings what no scriptures admit and what is akin to many heresies. Let us not be believed, let the truth be heard, which you will find is not lacking in us. And the whole question revolves on this hinge, whether this particle "is" has caused by divine power that the bread has been transformed into the body of Christ and the wine into blood. Therefore, it must first be investigated what kind of body of Christ it is, what blood, of which Christ spoke here; then whether this can be eaten or drunk, that is, whether the sound understanding of this place can prove what you have hitherto taught about the natural body and blood. First of all, there is no doubt that the body of Christ is a certain substance, visible, having human dimension, whether you consider quantity or weight, and therefore that it does not differ from our body, compact of flesh, nerves, and bones, except in that it is without blemish. For thus the apostle writes: "Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same. For he does not take hold of angels, but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham" etc. Hence it happens that he hungers, thirsts, is cold, is tormented by pain, and is refreshed by joy. The rest, which can be said about this, we will treat in the following. Now let us see whether Christ speaks of this body. He says: "This is my body, which is given for you." Therefore, he who was God suffered according to the nature he assumed. For thus Peter: "Since therefore Christ," he says, "suffered for us in the flesh" etc. Therefore, a visible and natural body was given for us, and not a spiritual, not a glorified one. Of the visible, I say, and quantitative (so to speak) Christ says: "And let this be a brazen wall." Now if that particle "is" causes a metamorphosis, it is absolutely necessary that the bread be transformed into that body of which he makes mention. But he makes mention of a natural and visible one, of which we see nothing in the bread, moreover, which cannot be eaten, as he himself commanded, that we should eat what is offered; indeed, if it could, it would not profit when eaten: John 6.</p>
      <p>If you answer: the body of Christ is to be eaten in spirit, I agree; but what does this have to do with it, since nothing is said here about spiritual eating? For if he speaks here of it, then Christ will also have suffered in spirit, that is, in a phantom. For he adds: "This is my body, which is given for you" [Lk 22,19; 1 Cor 11,24]. But this was long ago proscribed by the ecclesiastical leaders as semi-heretical against Marcion and countless other heretical phalanxes. So now I will not bring up that "the spirit does not have flesh and bones" and that Christ is eaten by faith alone. But if you do not believe me, believe even Christ himself, John 6[35], and your fathers: Augustine, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Ambrose. To this is added that there is one person of Christ, which you confuse in your bodily presence whole in the individual breads of the churches, after the manner of Nestorius and the Aetians, and that faith itself teaches that the human nature sits at the right hand of the Father, from where it is not moved except on the day of judgment: Acts 1 [9ff]; 3 [19ff]; Hebrews 10 [12].</p>
      <p>To which Ambrose subscribes, "On the Mystery of the Incarnation" ch. 5: "For his flesh is not among men, because according to the flesh we no longer know Christ. The earth says: He is not with me, because he has risen. Finally, the angel says: 'Why do you seek the living among the dead?' [Lk 24,5]." Augustine in John ch. 6 thus:</p>
      <p>"For the body of Christ must be in one place, but the truth of it is spread everywhere." But he taught in the preceding that place is the right hand of the Father. Tertullian, however, in the book on the resurrection of the flesh thus: "Jesus still sits in the royal heavens at the right hand of the Father, man, even if God, flesh and blood, even if purer than ours, yet the same in substance and form, as he ascended, such also to descend, as the angels affirm, to be recognized by those who pierced him. This mediator of God and men, called from the deposit of both parties committed to him, also keeps the deposit of the flesh in himself, the pledge of the whole sum. For just as he left us the pledge of the spirit, so he also received from us the pledge of the flesh and carried it into heaven as a pledge of the whole sum to be redeemed there someday" etc. Thus he. Behold, what could be said more openly? Behold, how your carnal presence obscures the lovely covenant and sweet pledges: "But Christ is God, and therefore can be whole in all places." - I answer: First, you incur the crime of idolatry, for if he is whole in many places, then there are many gods, against the article of faith: "I believe in one God." For there is one power of God, which fills the whole world and the heavenly spheres with its glory; which if whole in various places, each place would have the whole God, distinct by plurality. Then you confuse the natures in Christ after the manner of Timothy and Apollinaris, for you attribute the property of divinity to humanity. Against which Ambrose writes thus in the book we cited a little before, in the same chapter: "Therefore do not mix the ink of nature with the splendor of glory." And Tertullian "Against Praxeas" more openly: "We see," he says, "a double state not confused, but joined in one person, God and man Jesus. But I speak of Christ; and so the property of each substance is preserved, that the spirit did its own things in him, and the flesh performed its own passions" etc. See also Ambrose, chapter 6 of the previous book. Therefore, when you say that divinity can be everywhere and then add: "therefore also the body," do you see that you have confused the properties of the natures or substances and attributed to humanity what was proper to divinity? We confess that there is one person of Christ, in which there are two natures, and that according to the divine he is present in all places, but according to the human he sits at the right hand of the Father, true God and man. See "Ecclesiastical Definitions" ch. 2, and On Consecration, distinction 2, canon "Prima quidem."</p>
      <p>But to what end are these things? All to this end, that we may teach that the very condition of the matter and the catholic faith convince that there is a trope in the word: "is," whether it is now a metaphor or a metonymy. For the Lord wanted to indicate the mystery of the Passover and to abolish the paschal lamb. First, therefore, he eats the Passover with the disciples, then he adds that he will not eat of it from now on, "until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God" [Lk 22,16]. Which Hebraism means nothing else than this: In the future I will not eat of this lamb, nor do I want you to eat of it, because now the kingdom of God is at hand, in which the type is satisfied by me, who am the true lamb taking away the sins of the world and all blood, I stand by my own. Therefore, the Passover signified Christ to suffer, and its eating was a memorial. Therefore, it was necessary to change it, lest after Christ suffered, it should be expected as a sign teaching that he was to suffer. Therefore, he takes bread and commands that they eat it in place of the paschal lamb in memory of the fact that Christ was given for the human race, and so that just as the lamb signified Christ to suffer, so the bread signifies the true body of that true lamb, which has now been given. For thus he adds: "Do this in remembrance of me" [Lk 22,19].</p>
      <p>Now see, my dear Christoph, whether Gregory's decrees and the monuments of all the ancients have not handed down the same about this type, whether all things do not fit well together, whether each is not most pious. But if we do not want to admit a trope, there will be a danger that we will be forced to devour bowls, cups, and chalices. For in the same way he says: "This cup is the blood" [Lk 22,20]. How then will we meet the Arians objecting: "The Father is greater than I" [John 14,28], unless we have examined each thing, as we have previously given an example of this in the treatment of the body?</p>
      <p>But are all things possible for God? - I hear; but he does nothing beyond order and decorum, as the master also taught in the "Sentences." - But see Tertullian "Against Praxeas." But things are to be believed, not more curiously inquired into? - But tell me, I ask, is not "faith from hearing, hearing through the word of God"? Therefore, give the word of faith that prescribes this to you! You answer: "This is my body" [Lk 22,19 and others]. In the meantime, see whether the words sound like this: "Take and believe that this is my body," or: "Take, eat this bread as a symbol of that thing, that you may believe my body was given for you." See Basil, On Consecration, distinction 2, canon: "Fear and faith." Therefore, faith teaches first to eat the flesh, that is, to believe that the flesh of Christ was cut for us, then it also commands to eat the bread, by which I show myself to be of the number of those who believe themselves redeemed by the death of Christ. Hence Paul: "Let a man examine himself, and then let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup" [1 Cor 11,28]. These eatings, since the scholastics, especially Aquinas with his followers, did not observe, they led us into these Scythian fields. Indeed, how could it be that we would sell in place of faith what directly contradicts the articles of faith, as we showed above? Therefore, this faith differs little from that which they demand, who exercise curious arts; since the Christian is nothing else than a holy anointing, certifying hearts of the most certain salvation. And may I perish if innumerable heresies do not lie hidden under this wheat god!</p>
      <p>Now we must see what the nature of the blood of Christ is. And at the beginning, just as Christ differed in nothing from us in body, so neither in blood, the liquid by which the limbs are nourished, in which also the soul lives. But it is not shed everywhere nor many times, but only in the passion, since once shed it always suffices. Paul, the author of this matter, thus taught: "We have an altar from which it is not lawful to eat for those who serve the tabernacle." "And Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time without sin to those who eagerly await him for salvation." Likewise: "But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God. For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified" etc. Now since wine is taken and poured so many times, now since "Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more, death no longer has dominion over him," it cannot be without blasphemy that wine is blood, and the very property of the blood of Christ convinces that a trope lies hidden in the words of Christ. Which will be clearer from the words of Paul than from our conjectures. Thus Paul, in the place you rely on, 1 Corinthians 11 [25]: "This cup is the new testament in my blood." First of all, it is clear that wine cannot be a testament, but rather a sacrament, indeed a symbol of the testament. A similar place is Genesis 17 [10ff], where the Lord calls circumcision a covenant or testament; although it was not a testament, but a symbol of the testament, as follows from the very sequence of words.</p>
      <p>And lest you can doubt anything, consider. There is only one testament in the world, which as it was from the beginning, so it will never be abrogated. The testament is thus: "I will be your God and the God of your seed, Abraham" [Gen 17,7]. "Walk before me and be perfect" [Gen 17,1]. "For I will make you a father of many nations" [Gen 17,5], "and in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed": Genesis 12 [3]; 15 [5]; 17 [4ff]; 22 [18]. Furthermore, that it is one and perpetual, the prophets and apostles teach Genesis 28 [4.13ff], Exodus 32 [13], Leviticus 26 [42], Deuteronomy 4 [23.31], 2 Kings 17 [2 Kön 17,13ff], 4 Ezra 3 [15], Psalm 104 [105,8f], Isaiah 51 [2], Matthew 8 [11], Acts 3 [25], Romans 4 [1ff], Galatians 3 [6ff] etc. To which Tertullian, "Against Marcion" book 4, Lactantius, book 4, chapter 20, and Augustine in chapter 8 of John agree; by which it is manifest that wine cannot be, except abusively, a testament.</p>
      <p>Why then does Christ call it new, if it is not interrupted? First, because all the types of the old are here fulfilled and shown to us in the very truth, which happened to them in figure. Thus where there is new, the former is antiquated. See 2 Corinthians 3 [4ff]. Then it is called new because of the new people; I mean the Gentiles, who were once far off, made near by the blood of Christ, and it was delegated in the testament that the Gentiles would be blessed. All of which Christ also explains in this place, almost as if he were taking a paraphrase: Hitherto many myriads of cattle have been sacrificed in the old testament, in which only the Jews were considered the people of God; but now that time has dawned, in which the prophets must be satisfied through me. Therefore, you have heard that I am about to expend my body for you, now what is the fruit of it, draw and take this wine as a symbol of the new testament, that is, of that thing, that all things are renewed through me, sacrifices antiquated, and that new people admitted into the testament through my blood, which is shed for the expiation of the world, the reconciliation of the Father, and the unity of the peoples etc. - For thus Paul himself interprets these things 1 Corinthians 10 [1ff], Ephesians 2 [1ff]; to which also Christ's word in Luke 24 [47] is added, where he discusses the calling of the Gentiles and the remission of sins.</p>
      <p>But you say that the simple words of the Lord are to be believed, while we strive entirely for simplicity, indeed if this is to walk simply, to seize whatever is obvious and unexamined? What do you say? No one has ever seen God, but the world has seen Christ; therefore, he is not God! Therefore, there is need for examination in these and similar matters. In all these things, where is the wine blood? I hear that the blood of Christ, once shed, suffices to exhaust all the sins of all, meanwhile nothing about the invocation into bowls. I hear that the blood of Christ gathers Jews and Gentiles alike into one body, meanwhile no mention of transmutation. Briefly: blessing or remission of sins is the testament, Christ is the mediator of the testament, and the death and blood of Christ are the opening and sealing of the testament, furthermore, bread and wine are the symbol of the confirmed testament, reminding of redemption and union. See the rest in Hebrews 9 [11ff]. I could not give longer things.</p>
      <p>Therefore, this bread must be eaten in the assembly of the faithful as it was instituted 1 Corinthians 11 [20ff]. Therefore, we are not moved by what you oppose, that it will happen that any bread will signify the body of Christ. You see whether from the singular follows the general?. Among the sophists, I do not know what follows; but this I know, that among the faithful all things are conducted in a certain order 1 Corinthians 14 [40]. And when you add again that it will follow that in other six thousand axioms "is" will be taken for "signifies," if we admit this proposition: "Bread is the body of Christ" that is "bread signifies" etc., you would almost have given proof that you do not know which places give entrance to which tropes. But irreverence for the sacrament drives you to this fervor. But tell me, do they not show greater irreverence to the sacrament, who adorn fairs from it, or who show its sound use? Who feed the most filthy bellies from it, or who expound it for thanksgiving? Who display it as God and sacrifice it as flesh, or who say that Christ sits at the right hand and that his sacrifice, once offered, suffices?</p>
      <p>See now, good man, who introduces a new rite, and if you do not disdain, read Oecolampadius's booklet, in which he renders the meaning of these words: "This is my body" from the ancient fathers. Certainly, I do not see how that should be called new, which relies on so many scriptures and such great fathers. May God grant that you understand his mystery soundly and piously. But if you wish to respond to these things, let it be done with scriptures, lest I be forced to reproach you with what you unjustly imposed: that I promised scriptures, which I have not yet given, while you in the meantime have opposed nothing less than scriptures to ours.</p>
      <p>We beseech you by Christian charity, dearest Christoph, to love Christ ardently, adhere to his word, give him glory and magnificence, that is, to be what you are called, we name you Christoph with reverence; you strive to be most devoted to Christ, and consider our matters favorably. Heinrich will not fail you from his heart, provided you at least deign to subscribe me in the last place of your friends' list; which, my dear Christoph, we earnestly beg. About Johannes here, because he is otherwise very close to you, I write nothing.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I ask that you do not pierce with the obelus of Aristarchus the character and diction of one who is hasty, indeed tumultuous among great and many business affairs; for what we have written, we have written with such speed that, reading it again later, which happened scarcely once, we ourselves were often offended.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell in the Lord, dearest Christoph.</p>
      <p>From Kappel, across the Albis from the monastery of the Zurichers, 3 days before the calends of March 1526.</p>
      <p>Johannes Enslin and Heinrich Bullinger, yours from the heart.</p>
