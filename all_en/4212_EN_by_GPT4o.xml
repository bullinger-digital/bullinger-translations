      <p>Grace from God the Father through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Although we are not unaware that rumor travels faster than our letters, most esteemed lords and brothers, so much so that we assume you are already informed of the death of the dearest man Johannes a Lasco, we nevertheless thought it worthwhile to inform you of the mourning of this church and to implore you to assist us with all your power and counsel. God, the best and greatest.</p>
      <p>Johannes a Lasco had brought considerable benefit to this little church through his ministry, and his presence was exceedingly formidable even to the enemies of the truth.</p>
      <p>The piety of one man, adorned with singular learning, was so powerful that, since it is very well known to you, it does not need our proclamation. You see, therefore, dearest brothers, that we, deprived of this most noble instrument of the Holy Spirit, are cast into the deepest sorrow. For whatever hope his life had brought, death has utterly taken away.</p>
      <p>We do not say this as if we believed the salvation of our church depended on him, but we are not ignorant that his death is a sign of divine wrath. For our ingratitude has deserved that we should be deprived of that minister who excelled in the knowledge of divine matters and the administration of the church. While he lived, we sought your help and counsel in doubtful matters (which at this time almost overwhelm us), how much more do we need your assistance now that he is dead? Therefore, most esteemed brothers, we first ask you to help us with your prayers, and then to promote our endeavor with your work and counsel. Since you have done this willingly before, we do not doubt that you will assist our church all the more ardently in the future, especially now when it most needs your counsel and work. Farewell, most esteemed brothers.</p>
      <p>In Pinczów, February 10, 1560.</p>

      <p>The noble man and truly most devoted to religion, Lord Stanislaus Szilniczki, who will bring you these letters, most esteemed lords and brothers in the Lord, is about to set out for those restored churches and has urged us to adorn him with our testimony and commend him to your piety. Although his piety and truly Christian morals do not need foreign ornaments or proclamation, we nevertheless beseech and implore you by the common love of Christ, that if he needs your work or counsel in any matter, you assist him as a true member of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Even though we do not doubt that you will do this according to your piety, we nevertheless ask you that he may understand that this commendation of ours has been of assistance to him. Farewell in the Lord, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>In Pinczów, March 10, 1560.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, pastors and professors of the holy church of God in Zürich, most esteemed lords and brothers.</p>
