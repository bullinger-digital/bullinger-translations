      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I am sending here three copies of my sermons on the first discourse of Jeremiah, one for you, the second for Philipp Galliziani, and the third for Mr. Friedrich von Salis; kindly accept these gifts from me, your most loving friend.</p>
      <p>Your people correctly report that Bollweiler is threatening the town of Savoy, Bourg-en-Bresse. However, the day before yesterday, Mr. Warner, coming from Geneva, asserted for certain that the efforts of the French coming from Lyon have somewhat restrained those plans and audacity. Meanwhile, the Bernese, Valaisans, and Fribourgers have prepared a just army to oppose Bollweiler if he wishes to proceed.</p>
      <p>The army is said to exceed the number of 20,000 soldiers. May God turn it for the good, lest greater calamities follow. Duke Philibert of Savoy, the supreme commander of the Spanish army, who has recently become more arrogant from the victory reported by the constable, has sent envoys to Bern (as it is reliably reported) to reclaim the lands occupied by the Bernese, Valaisans, and Fribourgers. This seems to be quite abundant material for great and lasting evils. May we not see sometime the cup of divine wrath, as in the age of Jeremiah, Jeremiah 25, walking about. You ask whether Calvin disturbed the Worms colloquy with a bitter writing. Calvin did not disturb it. For before his last response against Westphal was published, some Saxons conspired against Philip. About this matter, Mr. Andreas Hyperius writes to me in a letter dated the last of September from Marburg: "On the 5th of September, Mr. Erhard Schnepf and Mr. Victorinus Strigel from the Jena school, Mr. Joachim Mörlin and Mr. Martin from Lüneburg, and also Erasmus Sarcerius from the county of Mansfeld immediately sought a colloquy with Mr. Philip after lunch at a certain place. They had, however, set forth in writing their opinion on the Lord's Supper and with a long speech urged Mr. Philip that he and the other Wittenbergers should confirm it not only in writing but also by oath. Philip refused to do this. The debate was prolonged until evening. When asked what necessity drove them to these actions, they replied that they had received this mandate from the dukes of Saxony, the captured sons of Prince John Frederick.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the most illustrious princes of the Palatinate and Württemberg sent a delegation to those Saxons to find out whether they had ordered it, and if they had, to allow that contention to be put to rest and to strive to restore concord." - Now learn from Philip's own letters what happened next. For on the 20th of September, he writes to me among other things: "Reverend sir and dearest brother Bullinger, we here endure double struggles, for some are eager to write accusations against those who reject bread-worship. Many envoys have opposed. May God be present with His church. I could not write more." etc. On the 23rd of September, he writes to me again in these words: "Reverend sir and dearest brother, it is written in Xenophon that the Spartans are to be scattered at home, as bees are driven away when smoke is made under their hives. Our antagonists cleverly imitate this: leaving aside other matters on which we agree, they begin with bread-worship, and to distract us, they ask who will defend it.</p>
      <p>This debate is not yet resolved here, nor has anything else been done here so far." etc. Again, on the 5th of October, he writes to me in these words: "Reverend sir and dearest brother, when our colleagues could not achieve that we approve the condemnation of your churches, they separated from us and privately presented it to the judge Julius Pflug, from whom they requested that it be publicly recited in the assembly.</p>
      <p>However, the judge's moderation was such that he did not want it recited in the assembly. Afterwards, they departed from here.</p>
      <p>Now, therefore, we doubt whether that begun conference will proceed. Whatever the outcome, I hope wise men will not disapprove of our contention, because we did not want to immediately confirm the idols and murders of the popes without the matter being debated and explained. But I pray to the Son of God to guide us.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and happily.</p>
      <p>I wish health to all of you and especially to Mr. Peter Martyr and Laelius.</p>
      <p>In Worms" etc.</p>
      <p>From these words of Philip, you have the whole business as it was reported to me; I preferred you to hear and read him speaking in his own words rather than mine. We responded to him these days and gave thanks and encouraged him to steadfastness, etc. With Philip, the envoys of the princes have acted so far, I say the envoys and learned men of the Palatinate, Hesse, the Elector of Saxony Augustus, Württemberg, Pomerania, and Prussia with the schools of Wittenberg, Leipzig, Marburg, Königsberg, Tübingen, Heidelberg, etc. What will happen, we do not know, we commend the matter to God in our prayers and also urge this from you. We wish to be informed about Italian affairs and especially about the persecution of the faithful, against whom we hear the deacon is pouring out conceived fury through the three-horned beast. We hear the war of Ferrara is to be settled by the Venetians; we particularly wish to be informed about it. We have nothing certain from the Netherlands and the affairs of the French.</p>
      <p>Friends write from Augsburg that peace has been made between the Emperor of the Turks and King Ferdinand for seven years. If this is true, I pray to the Lord that this peace is not drawn into the ruin of the church.</p>
      <p>They themselves indicate that the Voivode has taken a wife or made a betrothal either with the daughter or the sister of the King of France. Our envoys, who went to supplicate the King of France, have not yet returned, nor have we heard anything else about the faithful in the churches of France, except that they are in the greatest danger; may the Lord comfort and strengthen them through Christ. Greet Mr. Philip, Mr. Pontasel, the consuls, and all friends in order. Then you will send these letters, either copied by you, to Mr. Friedrich von Salis; for I do not have so much leisure to write to each one individually. May all good men among you be safe, to whom you will kindly commend me. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and keep you forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 29th of October, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, the most vigilant minister of the church of Chur, his most esteemed and dear compatriot and brother.</p>
