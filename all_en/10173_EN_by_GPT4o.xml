      <p>Christian illustrious prince and lord, my humble service to your grace beforehand.</p>
      <p>Your grace's letter dated 15th September, I have received with joy. I express to your princely grace my sincere thanks for all your friendly offers. I also desire from God nothing more than a rightful reconciliation and unity in Christian teaching with all those who preach Christ purely and clearly, and that there would be no discord concerning the Lord's Supper among us, who otherwise unanimously teach Christ Jesus. Therefore, we are also willing to do everything that we can justify with the truth. We had therefore thought that the highly learned Dr. Martin Luther should not press us further, since we have always conceded and still believe and confess that in the Lord's Supper the body and blood of Christ are present as Christ was crucified among the Galatians, Galatians 3 [1], namely in the view of faith, which makes the body of Christ truly, but not naturally, present, as can be found further in our writings. I write this so that your princely grace may see that it is not lacking on our part for reconciliation and unity, and that we are desirous of it, as long as we are not compelled away from the simple truth.</p>
      <p>I hereby ask your princely grace once again to kindly accept my writing, to have the truth above all, and to commend me, also to graciously accept this letter in your grace's favor and service.</p>
      <p>May God preserve you long for His people and maintain you for His honor.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 22nd October 1532.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's humble servant</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the Christian illustrious prince and lord, Mr. Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, my gracious lord.</p>
