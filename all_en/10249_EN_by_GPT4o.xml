    <p xml:id="regest1">People no longer wish to attend the church service in the parish church in W체renlos, as the Mass has once again taken over there. The salary of a dedicated pastor has been discussed with Niklaus Brunner and the dean, Michael H채cker. Since their own resources are insufficient, the communities, as before, request support from Z체rich. Assurance of their humble loyalty.</p>

      <p>Highly and well-educated, pious, prudent, honorable and wise, especially gracious, kind and dear lords, our completely humble, willing service is ready for you beforehand.</p>
      <p>As we have been drawn out of our rightful parish church for several years, due to the ceremonial works and the rejection of the deceptive Mass, we have undertaken and achieved to obtain our own preacher with the help and support of our gracious lords, which Mass, partly by the grace of God, has also been abolished there. Therefore, we have been ordered back into the rightful parish and have been told to go back together. However, since our tribulation in the same parish church, the idolatrous Mass has once again gained the upper hand and does not want to allow us to go further into the same parish church, we have commonly decided and, with the help and guidance of the honorable, wise Master Niklaus Brunner, then our bailiff, and the dean of the chapter, started to deliberate on how we might come back to a preacher and his maintenance, so that our children and weak believers do not fall back into the old, misbelieving idolatry from daily viewing of the idols and hearing of the idolatrous Mass. And we have found that we can manage with six or seven measures, including a meadow (Wiese), which can yield thirty pounds annually, assigned to a preacher. We cannot and do not know how to give more. Therefore, our diligent request and desire to you is to assure our gracious lords in a pleading manner that they may once again, as before, provide support and share something with us, so that our poor are not deprived of the holy word of God and we may raise our children in the demonstration of God's will; we will always remain faithful as the believing and humble to our Christian lords, and also wish to hear further the instructions of our envoys with their assistance.</p>
      <p>And as a testimony, sealed with the honorable, wise Master Rudolf Hoffmann, our bailiff and gracious lord's own seal, on Saturday, the day of the Holy Cross, in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Always humble and willing prayer communities</p>
      <p>Otelfingen and Boppelsen.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-educated, prudent, honorable and wise lords, presidents, proclaimers of the word of God of the city and land of Z체rich, now gathered there in synod, our kind and gracious lords.</p>
