      <p>Year 49, on the 20th of October from Köln.</p>
      <p>Greetings, most distinguished Bullinger, I delivered your letters to Mr. Florian; however, I have not seen him since then; he left without saying goodbye to anyone. He received some thalers from my wife, which he promised to return in Frankfurt; furthermore, I lent him some crowns a few months ago, which he has not yet repaid; we here cannot quite understand his situation and character.</p>
      <p>I hear that the Protector of England has been captured along with some other great men of counsel; may God avert this evil; for we have not yet received certain news.</p>
      <p>We eagerly await Mr. Calvin's agreement on the matter of the sacrament. Our most reverend one still perseveres in the true religion, and his elder brother, who was the Bishop of Münster, having now left all ecclesiastical benefices, lives quietly on his own resources. Those two pious and true princes send their regards to your lordship and all others. If it were possible for your lordship during your leisure, I would wish for your consolatory letters to them. Medmann was with us; he is the secretary of the Countess of Friesland and Emden, and he greatly wondered at your silence. Inform Mr. Pellican that I have received nothing from Friesland.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is using his wood in Brussels, restored to health, and is coming to Speyer. The Prince of Spain is inaugurated in the regions of Brabant, Holland, and Gelderland; whether he will come to Köln is uncertain.</p>
      <p>I desire your assistance in printing the English Bible; for your exhortation to that noble Englishman, who is with you, is and will be of great value. There are those who grieve over the English rumor.</p>
      <p>Would that the best and greatest would avert this evil from them. If the rumor is true, true religion will be in danger; yet God will preserve His own. Greet Mr. Pellican, Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, Mr. Zwingli. We would have written to Mr. Gesner, if it had been possible amidst our occupations; I wish you to tell him that Mr. Bernard Dessen, the physician, has informed him that he will give him nothing until he has Mr. Gesner's letters; Mr. Echtius has nothing to communicate in this matter; Mr. Bernard has something from Friesland and Holland. Farewell, my Mr. Bullinger, and continue to love your Birckmann.</p>
      <p>Your obedient Johann Birckmann, bookseller of Köln in the Falcon.</p>
      <p>Before these letters were closed, we received letters from a friend, who transcribes these words: "The current state of English affairs is such that, if I think a little more carefully and truly lament it from the heart, because I see the devil more fiercely plotting in those places where the voice of the gospel begins to sound than in almost all others. The Earl of Warwick, second to the royal protector, after he had suppressed the rebels of the Norfolk region, became, as is usual, more insolent with the success and inflamed by the envy of the victory gained by the king of the French through the negligence of those who were left as a garrison in the Polish field, on the first of October, accompanied by a retinue of thirteen nobles, entered the council of the royal senate and accused the protector of treason for the loss of some places in Scotland and France, and having taken to himself the goods of the treasury and all the fortifications of the city of London, the administration of which was in his hands, and having cleverly drawn to himself all the nobles, or as they call them, milords, he declared the protector an enemy of the country. The protector, with the boy king and some other leading men of the kingdom, accompanied by four thousand armed men, fled by a swift journey to a certain fortified place thirty miles from the city of London.</p>
      <p>The Earl of Warwick, with a chosen band of the most audacious men, pursues him to that place until he has the opportunity for battle; he has skillfully drawn to himself the minds of those who in the Cornish field still spurned the king's rule on account of the matter of religion, because he promised to restore the doctrine of that Roman church, although he is so far from the matter that it is thought he is planning nothing else than, with the royal protector removed and the king subjected to his power, to place himself in the king's position.</p>
      <p>The Scots have recovered the metropolis of Edinburgh and all those places which the English had captured in previous years and fortified at great expense, having slaughtered a great number of Spaniards and Italians who had come to the aid of the English. Poland or Bologna, being besieged all around, will undoubtedly soon be forced to surrender.</p>
      <p>While Bucer was teaching in London, he was attacked from the pulpit by the bishop with public invectives, and he asserted that the form of religion which was used in England during the time of the deceased king was orthodox, which, although he was prohibited by the royal council, he could nevertheless clearly perceive that plots were being laid against him. Therefore, being more vehemently moved by the injustice of the matter, and then more grievously struck by the disastrous state of English affairs, he fell into a very difficult illness and, having been left by the imperial courier four days ago, is undoubtedly believed to have breathed his last.</p>
      <p>You have the state of English affairs, which I have therefore written to you at length, because it seems to me to depict the [Greek] of that republic, in which, after the spark of the gospel has been somewhat kindled, the devil continually stirs up infinite evils and seditions. But enough of these things.</p>
      <p>Brussels, 14th of the calends of November.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed lord. Zürich.</p>
