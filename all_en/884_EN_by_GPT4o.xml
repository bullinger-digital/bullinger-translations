      <p> Greetings. In recent days, our Coelius Secundus delivered to me the third Decade of your most holy sermons, most esteemed lord and brother Bullinger, which you sent to me as a gift. I was greatly delighted, both because I had long been affected by some desire from reading a few sermons of the first Decade to know the remaining Decades as well. If only it would please the Lord God (if only it would serve the glory of His name and the benefit of the church), that He would finally at some point free me from these profane professions of letters; for indeed, in explaining Aristotle, such a blind and obscure writer, I must consume so much of my time that sometimes, though rarely, very little space remains, which I can devote to sacred reading. Hence, I have not yet been able to thoroughly explore the earlier Decades of your Sermons. However, what I have read in them, I approve so much that I congratulate others, to whom leisure is given to engage in these heavenly and truly salutary discussions, on their happiness, but I bitterly lament my own situation, who am unwillingly forced to spend almost my entire life in other, earthly subtleties and sometimes trifles. But since this is my calling at present, I will pray to the Lord to grant me His grace, so that these profane studies do not block the path of salvation for me or imprint any mark of impiety on me, which the blood of Christ does not seem to be able to wipe away. For I see that this handling of profane arts has some kind of impious deceit inherent in it, by which whoever is ensnared will be very far from the kingdom of God. Were not the most impious men of all ages found among the philosophers themselves?</p>
      <p> Hence originated the widespread popular proverb, the more learned, the more depraved and perverse. Witnesses are many, including Porphyry, Simplicius, Galen, Averroes, in whom, however, I must engage because of the explanation of Aristotle. Do you not think, my lord and brother Bullinger, that I would prefer to read your salutary and consolatory commentaries and those of other pious men on the oracles of God rather than the thorny and often horrific subtleties and acrimonies of these philosophers on human inventions? But because this is now my (as I said) calling, to narrate and explain the most obscure of profane writers, I must work on it, whether I like it or not, so that I do not seem to have adorned the role I have taken on too little for my part. In the meantime, I will await the will of my Lord, who knows, even without my speaking, what I need, and I do not doubt, will generously provide it in His time and will fatherly rescue me from this pagan impiety, which He knows I most hate and abhor.</p>
      <p> To you, my lord and brother Bullinger, I give and have immortal thanks. If only I could someday return worthy thanks, for you have honored me with a copy of the third Decade of your sermons, and be assured that I hold this and the previous two in the highest esteem and read them whenever leisure is granted to me, in which I find things that I greatly admire and respect. May Christ the Almighty grant that you also share the remaining seven with us shortly. Farewell with your most excellent wife and sweetest children in the Lord Jesus happily, whom I greet respectfully with my words and those of my family. I also wish to greet your son-in-law, Master Huldrich Zwingli, my dearest godfather, Master Rodolph Gwalther, and the other brothers. Farewell again and remember me and mine. Given in Basel, April 13, in the year of human salvation 1550.</p>
      <p> Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinianus.</p>
      <p> To the most learned man in sacred and human letters, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the city of Zürich, his lord and most beloved brother in Christ.</p>
      <p> Zürich.</p>
