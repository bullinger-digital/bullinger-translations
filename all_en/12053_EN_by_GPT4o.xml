    <p xml:id="regest1">Since he became acquainted with the Gospel through God's mercy, he was filled, even as a boy, with the desire to get to know the [proclaimers and spreaders] of the Gospel, and therefore he went to Wittenberg, where he studied theology for four years; afterwards, he wished to be instructed in other evangelical churches, especially the [Zurich] church because of its purity in conduct and doctrine, in order to be able to benefit the church in his homeland, which was in decline; therefore, a year ago, at the instigation of Johannes a Lasco, he set out for the [Zurichers], but since then he has been held up in Strasbourg, particularly by the hospitality of Matthias Zell and his wife [Katharina]; yet he still feels the desire to become acquainted with Bullinger; since he did not want to disturb Bullinger inappropriately by letter, he was forced to postpone this to a later meeting. He wanted to come to Zurich on the first day of the Michaelmas holidays [September 29] to spend about a year with the [Zurichers]; Bullinger has already learned this from the Emden provost Enno [Cirksena von Emden], who, together with Dr. [Joachim] Mynsinger [von Frundeck], was staying with [the Zurichers], and perhaps Bullinger was also asked by Albert Hardenberg to take in thom Camph; because of this, thom Camph now turns to him with this letter, so that Bullinger does not consider him to be fickle. He cannot come to Bullinger, not due to a change of mind, but because he received neither letters nor money from his friends at the Frankfurt fair contrary to their promises, so that he is now stuck [in Strasbourg]; Bullinger should keep the place in his house that might be intended for him until his arrival. He does not feel worthy to seek Bullinger's friendship; Bullinger should accept him in Jesus Christ as a weak brother. Johannes a Lasco apologizes to Bullinger and Pellikan for not writing to [the Zurichers] through the same messenger, but he promised to do so at this Frankfurt fair; thom Camph does not know why the letter was not delivered, but he will bring it along with the expected letters from his friends to [Bullinger]; a Lasco is glad that his old friend Pellikan is still alive, whom he believed had died two years ago along with [Heinrich] Glarean, so he did not write to Pellikan and also did not mention him in the letter to Bullinger; therefore, Bullinger should tell Pellikan, from whom thom Camph also heard in Wittenberg that he had died, this. Recommends the possible letter bearer [Johannes Christophilus], who, although they would have preferred to keep him in Strasbourg, wanted to go to Basel or Zurich and believes, according to a divine mission, that he must work as a schoolteacher, but he could also work as a scribe; the disfigurement noticeable in him was acquired in Heidelberg as a law student due to an illness, after which he devoted himself entirely to the study of theology. Bullinger should include thom Camph in his prayers. [After the signature:] The book [„Antiquissima fides et vera religio“], which Bullinger sent to Albert Hardenberg, was handed over to thom Camph three weeks after dispatch along with the letters to Bucer and [Hardenberg]; thom Camph immediately handed Bucer his letter, the book and the letter [No. 1972] for [Hardenberg] he keeps until his arrival; [in Strasbourg] they would like to know where he traveled and when he will return.</p>

      <p>Since some knowledge of the revealed Gospel of the glory of Christ was given and granted to me again through the pure and free mercy of God, so that I may not boast of myself, I was immediately filled with the greatest desire, even as a boy, to see and hear those through whom God sent us this clear light of the Gospel while we were groping and erring in the densest darkness. Therefore, as soon as the first rudiments of letters allowed it, I went to Wittenberg. There, after I had listened to those learned and pious men lecturing for four years and had also made their acquaintance, and had already grasped the first elements of heavenly doctrine, and my judgment in other matters had also begun to grow, I was burning with a wonderful zeal to visit the other churches that held this saving doctrine, especially you and your churches, who from the very beginning have promoted the cause of the Gospel and the contending faith with the innocence of life and the purity of doctrine with the greatest effort. I was eager to be instructed and conformed by you, especially in those things in which I lack both knowledge and piety, so that, having been properly taught and confirmed in this heavenly doctrine (as far as my weakness allows), I might finally return to my own people and be able to benefit the church, which lies neglected and despised by many among us, with a good conscience according to my measure. With this intention and at the instigation of the most illustrious man and lord Johannes a Lasco, I set out for you a year ago.</p>
      <p>However, when I arrived in Strasbourg, this church, the constitution of the school, and indeed the piety of my host M. Matthias Zell and his wife, combined with the greatest humanity, held me back from my intended course, so that I was forced to stay here for a year (detained by love for them), and yet I do not think this was without detriment to my intended plan. But while I am here, most learned Bullinger (so that you may finally understand why I have undertaken this narration), I am deprived of your most delightful company, which I had long desired with the greatest wishes, not without the greatest pain of mind, and to alleviate this, I often resolve with myself, indeed I begin to seek and even beg for your acquaintance - since I did not dare to seek friendship - through letters; so that, having known your humanity towards me as towards others, I might be able to write to you more often about those things in which I was stuck and troubled in mind, and wished to be taught and instructed by you. But when I again consider and ponder with myself how indecorous and impudent it might seem for a young and inexperienced man to interrupt a serious and highly decorated man with all kinds of disciplines, whom he had neither seen nor known, with unpolished letters about such great matters, I was therefore compelled by an honest shame to defer and postpone all these things to that time (although reluctantly), when I might experience your humanity in person (which I have heard praised in many wonderful ways) and be allowed to contract acquaintance with you, if only a perpetual friendship in Christ, the true source of friendship, so that with this access now opened to me, I might first, and then about all other matters freely - with all suspicion of simulation, arrogance, and impudence removed, but with the sole zeal of piety and learning - confer with you.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I had certainly resolved with myself to fly to you at Zurich on the first day of these Michaelmas holidays, so that I might spend a year, or as long as the Lord would grant, with you in the Lord. Since I know that this has already been indicated to you about me by that noble and highly expected young man among our people, Enno of Friesland, the provost of Emden (after he was with you with Doctor Mensinger), and I do not doubt that Doctor Albert Hardenberg, my greatest friend and compatriot, has already urged you to receive me into your house as a guest. Therefore, lest you rightly accuse me now of being inconstant and daring to deceive such a man, since I do not come to you, I am now compelled by necessity to write to you (with all former shame expelled) to clear myself, although I had resolved not to send any letters to you before I had met your humanity in person.</p>
      <p>But why is there need for many words? I had to comply with this present necessity. And I did so more willingly, because, even if this had not been the case, I would have been forced to write to you for the sake of some friends, to whom it would have been a crime to refuse this, as you will understand shortly. Therefore, I believe you will grant this pardon to me, a young man, for visiting you, a man most learned and busy in every way, with these my unskilled and disordered letters, and burdening your most delicate ears with my unpolished speech, after you hear that I was not incited to this by arrogance or impudence, but driven by the necessity of honesty and the urging of friends.</p>
      <p>Now, therefore, why I have not come to you at Zurich at the time I had set, nor have I yet begun the journey, is not due to a changeable or alienated mind from you, whom I have always loved with such great love, as you have heard (and with the same love I will pursue you as long as I live, especially you, from whom I have been instructed not a little in the matter of religion), but the cause is the negligence of my friends, who neither sent me any money nor letters at the Frankfurt fair as they had promised. As you can consider with yourself, until these are returned to me (which I hope will happen shortly), I am forced to remain here with great annoyance; but as soon as I receive them, I will come to you as quickly as I can. Therefore, as I said, I think my inconstancy should not be excused, but the carelessness of my friends. I therefore ask, if you have already assigned and granted me a place in your house at the request of a friend, that you keep it intact for me until my arrival through your piety and humanity, I beg. And if I cannot repay you according to the dignity of the matter, there is one who will repay with greater gifts than we can think or hope for; for whatever I ask of you in this matter, I do it for His (God's) sake.</p>
      <p>Now, however, since I wish to be held as a most friendly person to you, I did not dare to seek your friendship in return, since I judge myself unworthy of your friendship, especially since friendship is firm among equals. However, I cannot be your equal either in learning or in the appreciation of good things, unless you are willing to embrace me in Christ Jesus as your weak brother and dishonorable member of one body. For among these members there is firm and mutual friendship and benevolence. Therefore, imitating the nature of these, I would revere you as the most honorable member in that body, and you would care for and adorn me in return as a weak member; and if I could not compete with you in dignity, I would compensate with my zeal and love towards you and would not allow myself to be surpassed by you in these, although you might surpass me in more excellent duties. But what need is there for words? The matter itself will declare, if you count me among your friends.</p>
      <p>As for what I said I could not refuse to friends, this is the first: The most illustrious lord Johannes a Lasco, our common friend (although I also consider myself unworthy of this friendship), when he last wrote to me, asked me to excuse him to you and the most learned Pellican for not writing to you through the same messenger. For he was not able to do so due to the business (with which that good man is distracted by countless matters in the greatest confusion of affairs among us). However, he promised to write to you all copiously at this next Frankfurt fair. Why these letters were not delivered, I truly do not know. However, I expect them along with the letters from my friends, which, as soon as I receive them, I will bring to you. He is very glad that his old friend Pellican is still alive, whom he thought had migrated to the heavens along with Glarean, his old friend, two years ago. Hence he says it happened that he neither wrote to Pellican (whom he writes he loves very much) nor made any mention of him in your letters, otherwise he says he would have used his help in securing your friendship, if he had known he was still alive. Therefore, I would like you to convey this to Pellican, whom I also heard in Wittenberg had already passed away, and I was not made certain of his life until I came here. I am therefore very glad for the church and in my own name that he has been left to us, whom you would say greetings in the Lord in my name, if you would not be burdened by this trouble.</p>
      <p>It remains for me to commend this man of God (as I may gather), who will perhaps deliver these letters to you, very much in the Lord. For although he is despised by the world, I do not doubt that he is highly esteemed by God, since he thinks, breathes, and speaks nothing but Christ Jesus. Although they would have gladly kept him in Strasbourg, he said he was admonished by the instinct of the spirit to go either to Basel or to you in Zurich, where a purer church is still held free from idols (as he says). For the sake of this matter, he has suffered much, as he will tell you. He believes he is divinely admonished to instruct children, to whom he would gladly devote himself entirely, if he could be of use to you in this matter, and he would not be compelled to do anything against Christ (he uses these words). Therefore, if you wish to keep him with you for Christ's sake and to consult his infirmity, with which he struggles, you will be able to do so in no other way than by appointing him to this office.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, if you need it, he could be useful to you in writing, for he can write very well; but he will write nothing unless it contributes to the glory of Christ. I ask, if his manners do not please you in every respect, that you attribute this to his infirmity, which he contracted from a serious illness, as he will tell you if you press him. For when he was studying law in Heidelberg and conducting himself in such a way that he was pleasing to all, he fell into a very serious illness (by what counsel of God I do not know), from which he contracted this defect, which you will notice in him[!]. From that time, however, he devoted himself entirely to the study of theology and spends day and night in this, and now he so despises the study of law in comparison to this that he even disdains to read and will write nothing unless it contributes to that. I have this partly from him, partly from others who knew him in Heidelberg. But you, most learned man, will be able to perceive all these things better in person than I can commend them to you in these letters. But I wanted to write this to you so that you might attribute something to his infirmity (for no one is blessed in every respect), if there are things in him that do not please you at first sight, and so that you might consider that the spirit of God nevertheless works in this man and strives to perfect his power in this man's weakness, so that he may put to shame the things that are strong in the world, so that glory may be to the only wise God, and whoever wants to boast, may boast in the Lord. Amen. Since you see that these things have been written so freely by me, you will not think that I have written these to the most learned Bullinger, but to the most pious brother, who will receive all things with a benevolent mind, which he sees are undertaken or done for the glory of his Christ and the benefit of the brethren; which you will not doubt has been done otherwise by me in this matter. Therefore, take these things, however they may be, in good part, and if there are any errors or things not painted as they should have been, forgive the haste, for this Johannes Christophilus was urging the journey. Farewell, therefore, most learned man, in the Lord together with all the brethren, and please have me, the most wretched sinner and weak brother, commended in your prayers to God the Father through Jesus Christ, that He may also perfect what He has begun in me from the abundance of His goodness for His own sake to the glory of His name, the benefit of His church, my salvation, and to the shame of all our enemies. Amen, amen.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Strasbourg, October 7, in the year 1544 after the birth of Christ. Gerard thom Camph, Frisian</p>
      <p>From Emden, your brother in Christ, if only a singular friend.</p>
      <p>The book you sent to Mr. Albert was first delivered to me three weeks after you sent it, along with the letters given to Doctor Albert and Bucer. I immediately delivered Bucer's letter, and I reserved the book and Albert's letter for his arrival. However, we would like to be informed, if possible, of the time when our Albert is expected to return to us and where he has gone. But we want to free your humanity from this labor. I did not want to keep this from you, so that you would not be anxious about these things. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the man endowed with singular learning and outstanding piety, Heinrich Bullinger, sincere preacher of the word among the Zurichers, his lord and brother in Christ, always to be respected, greetings.</p>
