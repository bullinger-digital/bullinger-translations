      <p>My willing service and friendly greetings beforehand, venerable, faithful, dear godfather. I have previously informed you of the good that my late lord of Cham offered me, and, as I thought, in the name of my gracious lords, when I complained about the change and informed you how I had served a whole year at Hirtzel and then 14 years at Martalen with running and working at Rhinow and for several years with very meager payment, so that I could provide very little for the many of my children and only in the last 4 or 5 years have I received a good competence from my gracious lords and from the lord abbot at Rhinow, where I could first improve for the good of my children, so I had to leave it and thus had to pay for my loyalty and work, which I should have rightfully enjoyed. He replied to me that I should not complain about the profession; for my gracious lords were not inclined to deprive me of my payment, but since this was such a dangerous place to preach, my gracious lords had appointed me there in the best way, as I had won the peace of the land and achieved much good at Rhinow, thus hoping that I would not be neglected in Glarus, etc. The people of Glarus from both religions had also offered to meet someone with a payment in such a way that one could behave decently and well with them. They wanted to remind and admonish my gracious lords of Glarus, and if they did not give me a good outcome that I could well endure, they would consider me, so that I would have to have it better than I had it at Martalen, etc.</p>
      <p>Item, and when Master Burckhart Leeman announced the bread of the offer to me before the writing of my gracious lords, cheerfully by command, that I should prepare myself to meet the writing of my gracious lords with a friendly answer, he told me almost the same words that my late lord of Cham had spoken with me, and so much more he said my lord of Cham had spoken, and if (he understood me) my gracious lords did not replace what he gave at Martalen, I could say I wanted to replace it from mine; for it is fair that he does not pay for his well-being, etc.</p>
      <p>Of this, I think, Master Burckhart would still be of the same opinion. Now you can think, dear godfather, how things stood together, as I now have no more than 200 florins (the 25 florins they give me in addition, I do not consider; for they were given to me for the running, of which I have many daily from vagrants and others, to whom I have to use it again, etc.) against what I had at Martalen, namely 37 bushels of wheat, 10 bushels of rye, 8 bushels of oats, 16 loads of wine (equivalent to 32 eimers), 35 guilders in money, item house and orchard, hay and straw for 2 cows, enough wood. First, I had 30 guilders and 5 bushels of wheat from my gracious lords.</p>
      <p>And I have had the benefice for the longest 4 years and gradually brought it to order with the help of my gracious lords. Now I have nothing on earth but the two hundred and twenty-five guilders and fodder for one cow for the winter, if I can bring it together with costs, and an orchard by the house, must buy wood, ink, and other things that one thinks we should have in abundance, as expensive as in Zurich in the city. Make the calculation yourself, if one has 7 children and must have a service and besides that, whoever comes to the house and yard must be a master, how one must live sparingly. Here I have just received a load of wine from all my vines, and if I want to send it equally, I cannot bring a load to Glarus for a guilder.</p>
      <p>Let me show you the attached writings with humble request, whether I might now remain with what my gracious lords had arranged for me, where I had it twice as good as I have it now; if I did not have so many children, it would be the same to me if I could now go out like this. But I must truly take up what I have already abandoned. If they had let me keep half the benefice, I would have delayed and endured more, as it had almost worn me out; for the move cost me over 30 guilders; so I had to pay the pastor 20 guilders, item and the one who provided me to Glarus in my move, 4 florins; my lords spoke of that, etc. Therefore, you can do your best and insist whether the 30 guilders and 5 bushels of wheat might remain for the 4 years that I was told to serve in Glarus. If I can do that, I want to earn it for my gracious dear lords and for you, faithful, dear godfather and father. I myself wanted to go to the synod; but this autumn there are so many and strange illnesses that I could not travel anywhere because of the church and the sick; otherwise, I would certainly not have troubled you; but I assure myself of your inclined will because of my dear late father, whom you loved dearly, who had helped you work faithfully in God.</p>
      <p>There is no news with us, except that we are concerned that God, through the miraculous sign that appeared to us on September 29 with the eclipse of the great light of the sun, which appeared to us very frighteningly, signifies that he will deprive us of his true light and divine shine of his word because of our great ingratitude and impenitence and will cast us back into darkness through the Turks or others.</p>
      <p>Indeed, our dear confederates have made a consideration of how to meet the Turks, as the decision of the last held day indicates. But nothing has yet been fundamentally dealt with, for which God is particularly angry; for since they do not abolish the pensions and blood money, which cause idleness, pride, arrogance, drunkenness, and gambling in our lands, item if they do not abolish the usury that sticks to the common people and the common man, item if they do not abolish other vices both in the high and the low, then it will go with us as the Lord speaks in Isaiah 1. Even if we see many preachings and prayers among us and they have many crosses and bell-ringing, it is all in vain, because their hands are still bloody. But if it happened as in the time of Jonah, that the king, the priests, that is the council, and the spiritual state, that is the powerful, would step forward with penitence, then one could hope it would be better if they tackled the great vices and seriously tried to abolish them, then the lesser sins would also be reduced. But since no place wants to speak to the other and each place looks at the other and each says it is up to the other to bring about something that would improve it, nothing happens with this, and if the great is not abolished, then nothing will help what they advise about chickens and other bad things, as you may have read in the decision given to my gracious lords. Therefore, I say that I fear greatly that God will punish us impenitent ones after a long temporal hunger also with spiritual hunger and loss of the shine of his divine word, etc. May God graciously protect us from this. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet your household, all good dear lords and brothers. My wife and my children greet you.</p>
      <p>Given in haste on October 18, anno 71. Your always willing Johannes Hugo of Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, and faithful Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich, his very dear lord and father, to his hands.</p>
