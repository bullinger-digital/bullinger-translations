    <p xml:id="regest1">Haab thanks for Bullinger's report [not received]. Unfortunately, he does not have the time to inform Bullinger in detail, but Bullinger can learn more from Mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Just this much: Some wish that the Confederates mediate between Emperor [Charles V] and the Protestants. However, in his opinion, the Confederates would only make themselves look ridiculous in doing so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [P.S.:] Greetings from [Guild]master [Itelhans] Thumysen.</p>

      <p>The grace of the Almighty be with us all at all times. Dearly beloved, highly learned, gracious, dear sir, I thank you kindly for your report, etc. And although I would like to write to you much and in detail, I do not have the will. However, my gracious, dear Mayor Lavater will let you know how things stand.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As for the weather, some good-minded people think that we Confederates should offer ourselves as mediators between the Emperor and the Protestants, but at the moment I cannot find a good reason for this, as I fear we would be more mocked than appreciated.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>May the divine will be done at all times according to His grace. Amen. In haste from Baden, Wednesday, the 7th of July at 3 in the afternoon in the year 1546.</p>
      <p>M. Thumysen sends you warm greetings. Your ever faithful friend and benefactor, Hans Haab.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Minster in Zurich, my gracious, dear lord and friend.</p>
