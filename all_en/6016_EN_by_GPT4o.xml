      <p>Most illustrious man, I hope to come to you shortly; now it was not possible, for I am going directly to Stuttgart. I sent you letters, which should have been given to Mr. Franz Betto, now I add, if he is absent, they should be given to Mr. Werner von Castiano.</p>
      <p>Mr. Viclamus de Schartres, a Frenchman, a great man in every respect, whom I love greatly, was recently in TÃ¼bingen; there our friendship was initiated.</p>
      <p>You indeed have many who love and honor you, but I think there is no one who loves you more and holds you in higher regard.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you ought to love in return.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well, dearest Bullinger; greet for me the family, the school, and the church; for thus I am accustomed with you. May the heavenly Father increase His gifts to all of us, spirit and faith through Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>In Schaffhausen, on the 15th of January, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your brother, Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, my honorable brother. In Zurich.</p>
