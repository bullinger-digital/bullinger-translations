    <p xml:id="regest1">Hindermann thanks for the recommendation expressed in Bullinger's letter [not received] to practice Christian patience rather than thinking of revenge. He always wants to meet Bullinger's expectations. What he and his [Zurich colleagues] have decided regarding the [Zurich students in Marburg] is clear to everyone. The [students] are very grateful to have been heard [in Zurich].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Since they are free to decide where they want to stay, they would like to spend the summer in Marburg, especially since the education is conducted under significant teachers and also corresponds to their goals. Leaving [Marburg] would be disadvantageous. Additionally, they have two Bernese compatriots [Adrian Blauner and Benedikt Marti] who are helpful to them, having previously studied in Strasbourg and Wittenberg, among other places. Since they are allowed to extend their stay [abroad], they would like to go to Leipzig or Wittenberg in the coming winter. Bullinger and his [colleagues] should indicate whether they approve of this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The [students] will present the evidence of their expenses at the next [Frankfurt Autumn] fair. The people of Zurich should consider that the students had many expenses at the beginning, especially for books. Now the costs will be lower.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings from everyone.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from Christ Jesus our Lord. It cannot be expressed how much your most kind letter delighted me (most revered father), in which I clearly understood what you wish me to do, and moreover, how you are not at all inclined or ready to take revenge, but rather to overcome with patience, following the example of our archetype Jesus Christ, and to lead back to the right path. What you have entrusted to my diligence and care, I will diligently attend to as long as I live. It is not hidden what you think of all of us and what you all together have decided. Therefore, we all, and also all others who have kindly deemed us worthy to be heard in this matter, are most grateful to you, and we will repay this gratitude someday, if the Lord permits. We will diligently ensure and be wholly committed to fulfilling your wishes.</p>

      <p>However, since you have allowed us the freedom to act where we please, I announce that we will remain in Marburg for the rest of the summer, partly because we have great supporters, especially some learned ones, and partly because the studies and lectures correspond very much to our purpose and goal. For by moving from place to place, we would suffer a considerable loss in our studies. The variety of lectures hinders more than it helps. We also remain more willingly because we have two compatriots from Bern, upright and learned young men, who have already devoted themselves to studies in Strasbourg, Wittenberg, and elsewhere for six years. They help us greatly and are very familiar to us. For the coming winter (since you have extended the time for traveling), we will head towards Leipzig or Wittenberg, if it is done with your consent, which you can easily indicate to us soon.</p>

      <p>We have also gathered the expenses we have made and will make by the next fair, as will be apparent. If we seem somewhat extravagant, consider how much we were forced to spend from the beginning. Hereafter, we will make much smaller expenses, as we have the necessary books while we are abroad, and then we will also be free from many others. You, in your wisdom, will decide what is fair.</p>

      <p>Farewell. Everyone else greets you with the whole family. On Palm Sunday, in Marburg. Yours, Opisander.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful minister of the word of God in the church of Zurich, to master Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered patron.</p>
