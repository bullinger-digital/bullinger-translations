    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks for the letter [No. 2399] delivered by the Zurich student [Markus...]. Musculus' remarks on the [Second] Regensburg Religious Colloquy were particularly welcome. Bullinger wished that such discussions would be avoided in the future, as they harm the Church. As a result of those negotiations, the opponents only become bolder. They even claim that the [Protestants] already regret their reform. The brothers, [who negotiate with the Catholics], fall under suspicion [among their own]. The weak begin to doubt, while the strong become annoyed with the mediations. Nothing is to be expected from these discussions, even if the [upcoming] Imperial Diet will probably order such again. The interlocutors appointed by the wicked Pope [Paul III] and Emperor [Charles V] are godless people who are hostile to the Protestants and consider them heretics. They behave like Pharaoh, Jannes, and Jambres of old, and would not give up their doctrine in the slightest. [Paul] recommends being wary of such people; indeed, even resisting them. While the Lord calls us to clarity, we humans obscure clear matters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Alfonso] Diaz, who killed his brother [Juan] like Cain once killed his brother Abel, deserves to be broken on the wheel. This incident clearly shows that nothing is to be expected from discussions with such people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The Confederates held their Diet in Baden and dealt with a request from the Schmalkaldic League, which asked the Confederates through an embassy to refuse any passage of foreign, i.e., Italian and Spanish, troops towards Germany. A friendly and accommodating response was given.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [Johannes] Haller, who praised Musculus' kindness in his last letters, should be recommended to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings to [Konrad and Claudius Pius] Peutinger.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I received your friendly letter, most excellent Musculus, dated March 30th, quite promptly through a student of our college, which delighted me not a little. It was especially pleasing to me that you wove together with a certain narrative what is useful to know for sure, but is spread by such vague and vain rumors that you do not know what to believe. I have therefore understood from your letter the reasons why that Regensburg Colloquy dissolved into smoke and mist and without any fruit, though not without great expenses. I wish that some end could be found for such colloquies. So many colloquies have already been attempted without any fruit, and I wish with little detriment to the church! It is certain that the adversaries become more intolerably fierce from the colloquies (whatever they may notice in the colloquies for their own cunning); indeed, they begin to breathe something, as if we regret our reformation. They boast among their own that the matter will soon be better. The brothers come under suspicion. The spirits of our people are tested and almost fail, especially those who are otherwise weaker. The stronger ones bear this indignantly, so that little utility returns to the church from those colloquies. I certainly conceive no hope from them, although they are soon to be restored and composed into a better form by the Diet. For those with whom our people must confer are openly and professedly impious and manifest and most cruel persecutors of our religion. There are atrocious edicts of the Pope and the Emperor: The most disastrous deeds are in the sight of God and the whole world. Those appointed by them are impious, obstinate, Pharaonic, and like Jannes and Jambres, composed only to contradict, and think of nothing else than to defend their own by any means and in defending to either break or distract the spirits of our people. For they hold fixed in their minds that we are heretics and that they must not yield to us even a hair's breadth. Hence the apostle not without cause commands not only to flee from such, but to turn away from them, 2 Tim. 3, [5]. The Lord Jesus did not rashly demand from his own a simple confession of the gospel and a simple doctrine. Moreover, there is nothing in any matter so plain and open that the tongue of a crafty man cannot make it intricate and obscure, so that I do not now mention other consequences of disputation, which Paul mentions in 1 Tim. 6. I see that the apostles dealt simply with adversaries, proposed the truth constantly and plainly, and left the rebellious and blasphemous. I fear, therefore, lest, while we wish to illustrate the business of truth with our wisdom, we obscure it more. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>

      <p>The cruel deed you narrate about Diaz, the judge of the apostate court, is worthy indeed of being entangled in the wheel of justice. What happened here is what happened once at the beginning of the world, when Cain killed Abel, brother against brother. These are examples. What can we expect from such people who gather councils and rush to colloquies? Let us watch and pray.</p>

      <p>There is no news with us, except that the Swiss held a Diet in Baden mainly because of the Schmalkaldic League. It sent a delegation to them, advising them not to allow the passage of foreign, Italian, or Spanish troops through Switzerland to Germany, should anyone attempt to pass. Our people responded very amicably that Switzerland favors Germany, finally giving thanks for the advice and always taking care of Germany's safety, etc.</p>

      <p>Farewell, my beloved brother, and have our Haller recommended to you, who praised your kindness to me very much in his last letters, for which I give you great thanks. Zurich, April 22, 1546.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Greet most amicably the Peutingers, always to be honored, and all brothers and supporters.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his Musculus, the Augsburg churchman, Bullinger.</p>
