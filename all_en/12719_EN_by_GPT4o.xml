    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger announces [in a letter not preserved] that he will write less often, as if the war were already over!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger would speak differently if he had heard the flattery of some nobles [...] at the Basel [Martini] fair. Based on some letters from the [imperial] camp, they praise the war fortune of the Emperor [Charles V], his wealth and land ownership, and think he is invincible. They also claim that the German mercenaries have grown dear to him. Consequently, the [Protestants] have no reason to boast at all! But the mutual comforting of these nobles is only an expression of their doubt and despair.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] So if Bullinger had heard these conversations, he would not have announced fewer letters for the future, but would continue to write as often as before, just as Myconius will continue to inform! But enough joking! Indeed, Myconius is very grateful for Bullinger's letters. May the Lord reward him for this kindness!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger has not reported anything about the messenger [the Regensburg city clerk Nikolaus Dintzel], who was sent by [correctly: to] [Antoine Perrenot], the [or the] son of [Nicolas Perrenot] de Granvelle, and was arrested with a letter from [correctly: to] [Antoine]. The letter laments that the Emperor did not set up his winter camp in Württemberg, especially since everything necessary would have been abundantly available there. At least in the spring, they should go there, as this duchy would be very suitable for the Emperor's plans!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] [Sigismund Stier], the chancellor of Count Georg [of Württemberg-Mömpelgard], wrote to [Matthias] Erb that Sebastian Schertlin had taken Donauwörth and Neuburg [a.d. Donau] by killing all the imperial forces. Now it appears from Bullinger's letter that this is not true. This is also evident from the [confiscated] letter of the messenger. On the contrary, it states that sufficient resources are provided to the imperial forces in the territory of the Augsburg Bishop [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] to continue the war the following year.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [Nicolas Perrenot de] Granvelle is said not to have traveled directly through Basel, but near it to the Basel Bishop [Philipp von Gundelsheim]. Previously, he is said to have reported to his wife [Nicole Bonvalot] about the Emperor's war fortune, who could have taken Ulm effortlessly if he had only wanted to. Yes, the Memmingen councilors had practically begged him to occupy their city! This was told to friends by some Burgundians [Wilhelm and Johannes Vermod?].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Myconius asks for occasional information about the activities of the Inner Swiss.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings, also to Gwalther and the colleagues.</p>

      <p>S. You announce to me that you will write less frequently in the future, as if the war were already over!</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>If you had heard the nobles around Basel, who were here at the fair, you would say otherwise. Good God! How they flatter themselves! How they console each other! They boast with letters sent from the camp about the Emperor's (Charles V) fortune, his wealth, the multitude of lands and islands, and therefore they say: it is impossible for him to be defeated. They claim that the German soldier is loved by him as his own soul. Therefore, they say it is nonsense for us (the Protestants) to boast. Thus, they are accustomed to lift each other up with letters, although it is clear that in their hearts they are cruelly torn and utterly despairing.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>If you had heard them, you would have said otherwise, namely as before. What I will learn in the future, I will not hide from you. But enough joking! I know with what spirit you have written so far; and I say from the heart that I boast about this matter among good people, and I rejoice greatly within myself. Therefore, I give thanks, and I pray to the Lord to repay those benefits, which are the greatest and most noble in my heart, richly!</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You did not write about the intercepted courier, who was sent by the son of Granvelle (Antoine Perrenot) and carried letters, in which he laments that the Emperor did not make his winter quarters in Württemberg, where there would have been an abundance of all necessary things. It is said he advises that what was now omitted should be accomplished in the spring; for that duchy is very suitable for fulfilling the Emperor's plan.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The secretary of Count Georg (of Württemberg-Mömpelgard) had written to Erb that Sebastian Schertlin had taken Donauwörth and killed the imperial forces to the last man; similarly, Neuburg. Now from your letters, I see it is not true. Also, from the letters of the courier, which state that strong reinforcements are to be placed in the territory of the Bishop of Augsburg (Otto Truchsess von Waldburg) to be more prepared for renewing the war in the following year, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Granvelle is said not to have passed through our city, but not far from the city, to the Bishop of Basel (Philipp von Gundelsheim). He had written to his wife shortly before about the great fortune of the Emperor, which he would use in war; for he could have easily taken Ulm, had he wanted to. The senators from Memmingen had practically invited the Emperor to occupy it, and many things of this kind. Some Burgundians told these things to friends, etc.</p>

      <p>Tell me about the endeavors of the Inner Swiss, if you have anything and can do so at leisure.</p>

      <p>Farewell in Christ with Gwalther and the pious brothers. Basel, 12th of November, 1546. Yours, Os. Myc.</p>
