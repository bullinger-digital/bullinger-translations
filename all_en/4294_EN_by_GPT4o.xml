      <p>Greetings. I believe you have understood from others that I have returned safe and sound to my people (reverend father in Christ). I found everything here peaceful and quiet, except for that angel, about whom I have spoken before, who has caused new disturbances. He is boasting of a new apparition, and when the gentlemen of the Upper League gathered together on May Day, he revealed his fable to everyone, which has been recorded in writing as it came from his mouth. I received a copy from my lord mayor Ambrosi, but I have returned it; it will be given back to me. One might wonder why clever people should build so much on fables, but as it happened, those who wrote all this to Lucerne and had it read in all the churches, which the evangelicals took with great displeasure, will be dealt with at the next assembly. Among other things, it states: the angel said that the people of Glarus have committed a grave sin and should fear great bloodshed, and if the people of Chur do not improve, it will go for them as it did for Thusis; thereby it is clear in what pot this must have been cooked. And what is even more: all this has also reached Rome through the envoys of the Five Places, who were sent there to wish the Pope well. This is confirmed by the governor of Dietikon, who was there at the same time when bailiff Lüssi from Unterwalden arrived in Rome. This bailiff Lüssi is the same one who, when the ten banners were defeated in the last papal campaign, is said to have shouted to the soldiers: "Flee, dear Confederates, or none of you will escape," and thus he made a clean escape in his cowardice. Therefore, when he came to the camp of the other Confederates a few days after the battle, he is said to have been welcomed by Captain Frölich and Fuchsberger in the name of a hundred thousand devils before all the soldiers and mistreated by them in such a way that it could have cost him his life; he is also said to have been stripped of his honors at home (as some of ours say). They have now restored his honor and recently sent him to the Pope in the name of the other places. In Rome, according to governor Dietikon, he received more honor than the envoys of Philip or Ferdinand. But when Hannibal from Unter-Ems was invited as a guest and asked to join governor Dietikon and someone from Reitnau, they hesitated for a long time, and when they came to the table and it was brought to the governor, he did not want to give an answer, nor did the Reitnauer, until young Hannibal signaled to them so much that they did not want to offend their guest. And when governor Dietikon was asked why he and the Reitnauer had refused to drink with him, he replied that they feared, since this man from Unterwalden had previously been stripped of his honor at home, that this might be a disgrace to them among the nobility. I have briefly added these things here in passing, so that, if you did not know, you might understand in some way the state of our affairs and those of the Five Places. I have nothing new from the legate.</p>
      <p>He himself affirms that the French movements are somewhat calmed; but how much faith should be placed in them regarding their own affairs, you know yourself. It is reported from Constantinople that the Turk is negotiating peace with the Sophy and that there is good, indeed great hope for its success, as the envoys on both sides have been treated magnificently, but the Turk has a fleet ready and now all the risks of war are to be borne by Philip. Therefore, those who come from Genoa affirm that Philip is repairing the fleet and recruiting reinforcements. I assume you already know what was done in Baden by the Bishop of Chur; but in what state the affairs of the people of Glarus are and whether the one in Unterwalden, who compared himself to Zwingli, has escaped, and if there are any reports from France or Germany, we are eager to know briefly from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and revered father in Christ, with all your people, whom all of ours wish well. I have not written to Mr. Collin, to whom I ask you to convey through one of your people that everything is well with us. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Chur, May 27, in the year of our Lord 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius Montanus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
