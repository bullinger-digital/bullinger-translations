      <p>Greetings. After the unfortunate city of Konstanz turned away from the truth and Christ to falsehood and the Antichrist, to the great disgrace of the illustrious city, I know, my brother, I know how much this pains your heart, which is full of piety and love for your homeland, especially since you understand that the expelled Satan has allied himself with seven other more wicked spirits and, having returned, will make everything that follows worse than what preceded. The crown of your glory has fallen and withered, but in the weaker and hypocrites, not in the sincerely pious, whose number I hope is greater in the Swabian churches than we might think. Elijah once thought he was the only one left who sincerely worshiped God, but he heard: "I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed their knees to Baal." Why should we not hope the same today? Even if the number is smaller due to the corrupt state of the last age, it is certain that our labor in preaching the gospel is not in vain; and even if countless people fall away, it is still true what John said: "They went out from us, but they were not of us, otherwise they would have continued with us." Nor are we the first to suffer this from our churches. You know what Moses suffered, you know what happened to Zechariah, who is read to have been killed by Joash. Jeremiah experienced remarkable ingratitude from his people and was eventually covered with the greatest insults and a storm of stones. But why do we mention these things? The Lord Jesus taught for several years, performed astounding miracles, and bestowed great benefits on his people; but they denied him before Pilate and crucified him. You are not unaware of what happened to the apostles in the early church. How many kingdoms betrothed to Christ by the apostles have defected to the most disgraceful man, Muhammad, over the past nine hundred years? Those who fall away from the truth harm themselves, not those who would gladly keep them in duty. They indeed suffer loss, says the apostle, but they will still be saved.</p>
      <p>There has always been a change of affairs and a remarkable transformation of religion among the people. This can be seen in the Book of Judges and in the Books of Kings. Therefore, I have no doubt that the papacy will soon be overthrown again, unless the Lord himself abolishes it by his coming in judgment.</p>
      <p>What then can we do in these disturbances and most disgraceful defections of the last age other than persevere in faith, hope, and patience, especially since we know what Daniel predicted to us in chapter 11? What else can we do but constantly and unceasingly pray to the Lord, first that he may remit his anger towards us, then that he may keep us from defection and confirm us in his grace and true faith, and also that he may bring back the wandering sheep, comfort and encourage the faint-hearted and fearful in true piety. Amen.</p>
      <p>When I know that you, brother Consul, and our Zwickau have been expelled from your native seats, I promise you all my efforts, and I wish I could comfort you in exile, I wish I could help your affairs. You will find me faithful and diligent in what is within my power. For this calamity of yours greatly pains my heart. May the Lord Jesus, in whose name you endure these things, comfort and preserve your hearts in his will and in all good, and protect you from all evil. Amen. Therefore, I wish to understand from you what you have planned. You have your gifts from the Lord; you will not deny them to the churches of the Lord. What then, if something were to be done with some pious men of the Bernese church? For you could serve that church with great fruit. I have said nothing to anyone about this matter so far, except to Haller, because I did not know what you intended, and because I judged it unjust to abandon the church of Konstanz, which had not yet rejected the yoke of Christ, nor yet taken up the yoke of the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>But now, since all hope has disappeared, we can discuss these things with a good conscience among ourselves. So if I can serve your brother, whom I hear has lost almost all his possessions, or if I can serve Zwickau, let them command and greet them a thousand times in my name through you. May the Lord repay them and all of you in the eternal homeland for what you have lost in the earthly homeland. May he grant you and us, who await the same fate, his grace, so that, forgetting earthly things, we may seek only heavenly things. Greet your wife, your household, and your dear sister, and finally all good people, and if my dearest friend Hieronymus Hurusius has also left the city, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell eternally. October 20, 1548.</p>
      <p>I have no new news, except that there are rumors that the Five Places, along with Freiburg and Solothurn, want to send messengers to Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen to present some articles concerning faith and some other matters, although the rumors are not consistent. When I have a clear, good, and truthful basis, I will inform you. If you think there is no danger on the road and that you might receive some comfort from the change of place, I would be very pleased if you all came here to visit me, to see how things are arranged here, and to visit your good, old friends. If that is possible and would be convenient for you, I ask you to come to me. The rest can be shown to you by M.</p>
      <p>Gregory, the bearer of this letter. God be with you. My dear brothers Musculus and M. Gervasius, along with our other brothers, greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his incomparable brother. Griesenberg.</p>
