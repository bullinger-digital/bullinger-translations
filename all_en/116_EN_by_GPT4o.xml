      <p>S. P. I arrived in Bern on the 3rd day after my departure, with great expectation from everyone and the utmost joy from some of the good people. I appeared before the most honorable senate; they congratulated themselves and me. Today I delivered a sermon and am just now returning from it. The count will leave immediately after lunch; they gave him two crowns and 6 ells of cloth in the color of Bern.</p>
      <p>I met Sultzer and Beatus, even though they had not greeted me when they saw me several times. I began to argue with Beatus right away; for he kept desiring a different appearance for the church. I pressed him on what that appearance would be; he said it was too long to explain, and I took my leave. He complained about the importunity of the fellow ministers, asserting that they were the cause of these disturbances. I, however, believe that those who are eager for new things and wish to overthrow the original appearance of the church with new inventions are the ones causing the disturbances. After much discussion, we parted ways. They have now appeared before the senate for the third time, requesting to be allowed to present their case once more before the deacons and to explain their views on their doctrine. They were denied twice; the third time, when they asked the mayor to convene the senate, they claimed they only wanted to request testimonials of their departure. He granted this to them. When they came to the senate, no mention of testimonials was made, but they again requested a larger senate meeting to hear their apologies. Thus, the senate, more gravely angered by their impudence, ordered them to leave as soon as possible, since they dared to lie and deceive the mayor by pretending one thing before him to gain admission, and then proposing something else, about which they had already sufficiently heard opinions. Therefore, nothing remains but for them to depart.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we will see to it that everything is directed in a pious order. I will meanwhile deal with Cosmas Alderinus, who is related to me and has ample houses with a small family. This seems good to the senate. D. Jodocus asked me to inform you that your letters written to the Bernese senate have been retained by him and other good men, so that, while these disturbances intervene in the middle of the cause, they may not seem to have stirred up something against them; for you have entrusted this matter to his judgment. Otherwise, I have nothing now, except that Schertlius is with me in my lodging, who greets you a thousand times, as do Jodocus and all the brothers. I commend my family to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell and always love me, as you do. In Bern, on the very day of the Lord's Ascension, 1548. Your most devoted Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and perpetual compatriot, to be honored. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
