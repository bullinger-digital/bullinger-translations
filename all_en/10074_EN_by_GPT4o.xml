      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>That I lament the calamity of our times, dearest Heinrich, the letter does not allow. By the order of friends and the leaders in our senate, we have sent this messenger to you, since you have been forced to leave your homeland - the Lord knows by whose fault this happened - and now, as is certainly reported to us, you have a prepared calling from both the people of Basel and Zurich. The most sincere brothers in Bern implore you not to disdain their calling, even though they have not deserved anything from you; for it has long been prepared for you. Basel has countless learned men, as does Zurich; Bern alone, which is nevertheless the most populous, with 187 parishes, has no one. Megander has been ordered to rest from preaching; you have undoubtedly received the reason. If it is accepted, as I hope, your calling is nonetheless most certain and prepared. Francis is daily failing due to old age, Berchtold is so burdened by gout, hernia, and bodily mass that it is more than enough. Therefore, in the entire dominion, we have almost no one who can do anything with reading, languages, or knowledge of scripture. Since you can thus both win over and preserve such a people for Christ through the Lord, unless you do not wish to be a Christian, you will not deny yourself to us. Therefore, the leaders from the senate and also certain citizens and the common people want to be sure that Bullinger will become a Bernese, which is why you should inform us of your decision with this message, as we all hope. I hear from adversaries that your library has been devastated; do not be troubled: you will find everything necessary with us, nor should you doubt anything about the conditions. In summary: we pray, we hope, indeed we want Bullinger to indulge our calling; let him respond with nothing other than that he wishes to be ours. Meanwhile, once we understand your mind, our senate will call you with a legitimate messenger and letters, so that you can more conveniently satisfy both the people of Zurich and everyone else. These things that I write, I have written to your heart, which I wished to have discussed with you before this warlike tumult. Do not doubt me; you will have your most dutiful supporter Berchtold, indeed if you please, a brother by blood. You will also have the favor of the people in the city, who mostly know and have heard of you. Nor will the senate be lacking, a large part of whom, even those we believe to be papists, desire you greatly. They have been embittered by the bitterness, which you undoubtedly learned from Francis, so do not fear anything. The Lord has achieved more through me with modesty than with bitterness.</p>
      <p>Farewell and write back according to our wishes, for if you do not, I would certainly prefer to die soon than to be so abandoned, which I also hope. Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>6th of December, year 31.</p>
      <p>Yours from the heart, the smallest coin</p>
      <p>Bercht. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, learned and pious, his always dearest brother</p>
