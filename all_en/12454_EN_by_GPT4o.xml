    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks for Myconius' letter to [Rudolf] Gwalther, which he read to him. However, he believes that it is the bloodthirsty Emperor [Charles V.] who is spreading the [rumor of his departure to Spain]. From the Duchy of Milan, he can quickly retreat to Barcelona [if necessary], but also return to Germany if all goes well. Bullinger, who does not trust the Emperor at all, relies solely on God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Should the messenger [Markus...] returning from Augsburg bring interesting news for [Basel], Bullinger will share it. In view of the [upcoming] spring book fair, Bullinger has written letters to Philipp [Melanchthon] [No. 2404], Johannes a Lasco [not received], Albert Hardenberg [not received], Gerhard Westerburg [not received], [Dionysius] Melander [not received], [Johannes] Pistorius [No. 2401], and many others. In doing so, he tried to advocate for the pure doctrine and the church in danger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Here is an excerpt from a Vadian letter [No. 2400] that arrived in Zurich on [April 1]: [Johannes Schuhmacher, called] Otmar Gluß, Dean of the Abbey of St. Gallen, has succumbed to madness since February due to lack of sleep; the capture of [Duke Henry of] Brunswick [and his son Charles Victor] affected him greatly. He had himself taken to Wil, where he had been governor for a long time. On March 27, early in the morning, he jumped out of a second-story window. He was found motionless and silent. At 3 o'clock [in the afternoon] he died. On March 29, he was buried in St. Gallen. He hated the [Protestants]. On [March 28], the St. Gallen council again forbade its citizens from associating with the Papists and the Anabaptists. So much for Vadian.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Myconius will have already heard about the planned assembly in Baden. It was convened because of [a letter] from the [German] Protestants. They warn the Confederates of the impending dangers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- There is nothing specific to report about the Devil of Rottweil. Bullinger also knows nothing about the storm in Radolfzell.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- He cannot write more due to exhaustion. Greetings from Gwalther, [Heinrich] Buchter, [Konrad] Pellikan, and [Theodor] Bibliander. The missing parts were supplemented from the context.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. What you wrote to our Gwalther, most esteemed lord and brother, he read to me diligently; and I thank your kindness. However, I believe that the Emperor is using his bloodthirsty arts as a pretext. He will be stuck in the middle of his kingdom in Milan. There he will gather an army. There he will have the most holy father nearby; he will have an open and back door, through which, however things turn out, he can escape to Barcelona and hide in Spain, where the Germans will never reach. If fortune favors him, he can quickly return from Italy to Germany. I may be wrong in my conjecture; and I wish I were wrong! I trust nothing from the Emperor! I expect all evil from the Emperor! But again, I trust in divine mercy and expect liberation and all good from the Lord, who, as he is just and merciful, is also most truthful. Let us pray to him, that he may never abandon us in these doubtful matters! Let us encourage all entrusted to our faith to true faith and repentance!</p>

      <p>I expect news from Augsburg at any moment. If I receive anything worthy of you, I will share it. I wrote at this fair to Mr. Philipp, Mr. Johannes a Lasco, Mr. Albert Hardenberg, Mr. Gerhard Westerburg, Mr. Melander, Pistorius, and many other learned and pious men, nothing other than what I hope will pertain and contribute greatly to the safety of sound doctrine and the endangered and most afflicted church. Let us pray to the Lord, that he may turn everything for the good!</p>

      <p>Yesterday Vadian wrote to me in these words: "Mr. Othmar Gluß, dean of the Abbey of St. Gallen, has fallen into some madness (insanity) since February due to lack of sleep (he grieved over the captured tyrants of Brunswick). He had himself taken to Wil, where he had been governor for many years. There he lay miserably in his melancholy until March 27. On that day, in the morning between 5 and 6 o'clock, the mentioned Mr. Othmar ran out of his room in his madness. He threw himself out of a window, two stories high. He was picked up as dead and speechless. He is said to have lain there alive, but without reason and speech, until the 3rd; he miserably passed away and yesterday, the 29th, was brought to us in the monastery and buried with much singing and bell ringing. Do not believe that there was any more cunning, hateful, and hostile enemy and adversary of our religion in the entire Confederation. Perhaps it seemed to providence that the most violent hypocrite should be extinguished by a violent and deplorable death. Our senate the day before yesterday forbade all its members anew from communion with both Papism and Anabaptism under great penalties." So much for Vadian.</p>

      <p>You are not unaware, I think, that the assembly in Baden was convened for no other reason than to hear the Protestants. They have something to propose to the Swiss about the plots and dangers threatening Germany.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There are various rumors about the demon of Rottweil. Since I do not care, I will say nothing certain. I have heard nothing about the cloud vomiting fire at Radolfzell.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed Myconius. For I am so exhausted from writing these days that I could hardly manage this. Zurich, April 2. Gwalther, Buchter, Pellican, Bibliander greet you. 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Oswald Myconius, most vigilant bishop of the church of Basel, his most esteemed lord and brother. Basel.</p>
