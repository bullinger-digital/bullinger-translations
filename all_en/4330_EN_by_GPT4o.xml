      <p>Greetings. You may perhaps judge me as somewhat negligent, most kind Mr. Bullinger, because I have not yet sent you the description of the most miserable expedition made by our people to the Zurichers in the year 1531. But there is no delay on my part; I was hoping to receive it from the treasurers of our city, who have repeatedly given me hope that they would find what has been written about it, but they have found nothing yet. Therefore, I must pursue this matter by another route, namely through the inventories of the tribes, and I will inquire with the tribunes, where everything that is written and collected is certainly kept, and I will send everything to your kindness as soon as I can.</p>
      <p>We have absolutely no news; if there is any, we hope to hear it from you at some point. There is a rumor that our neighbor, the Count of Zurich, Wilhelm Count of Sulz (after a division of inheritance has already been made between him, his brother Count Alwick, and his nephew), is instituting a reformation of the church and the abolition of the papacy, all according to the canons of the Augsburg Confession. If this is the case, as we will soon hear more certainly, it is surprising that this reformation is not being done according to the rite of the Zurich church and its magistrate, of which he himself is a citizen. Also, if the Zurich magistrate learns of this, should they not, by duty, admonish him to establish a religion conforming to the Zurich church? If you have any information about these matters, please let me know.</p>
      <p>Vergerius has returned to Tübingen, as his nephew reported to me; he did not recount what he brought or accomplished; surely he will write to you. That maritime disaster, which Philip suffered, inflicted by the Turk, has surely been reported to you, which indeed has secured a longer peace for the Bernese.</p>
      <p>It is undoubtedly not unknown to you that Philipp Melanchthon has passed away; hence it is feared that more sectarians (who have so far been restrained by his authority and writings) will emerge. May the Lord preserve His church.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all the fellow ministers and learned men, whom you will greet in our name. All of ours, especially Mr. Simpertus, greet you.</p>
      <p>May the Lord repay the benefits, which you have recently bestowed upon me and always.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, June 29, 1560.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Jakob Rüeger.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in learning, piety, and kindness, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, president of the Zurich church, and his much-revered father in Christ.</p>
