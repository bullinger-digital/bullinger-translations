      <p>S. The day before yesterday I wrote through a certain Paul, a Jew.</p>
      <p>Now, I have nothing to add to that, except that I earnestly request you to respond to my previous letters; for if you do not indicate someone who can teach theology in Lausanne, it will happen that a decision will be made here about one of our own, whoever he may be. I hope this choice will be free of danger! Please also remind my brother to write back through these means; for I have something to expect from him as well. There is no need for me to recommend the Frischings to you, as their very closeness, by which they are connected to you, recommends them.</p>
      <p>I had both of them with me for two years; they are of good character. The elder is simpler and therefore more upright, the other is clever but also more impudent. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 25, at nightfall, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
