    <p xml:id="regest1">Zwingli, to whom Mötteli owes much, rightly bore the name "Huldrych", because names are meaningful, divinely intended, and not coincidental, as examples from the Old and New Testament show; this also applies to Bullinger's first name "Heinrich". Since Martin Mötteli is being opposed by the judge Joachim Mötteli [vom Rappenstein], but the people are well-disposed towards him, he does not know whether he should take office or withdraw again; therefore, he asks Bullinger, who will learn more from Albrecht [Wecker], to decide on this matter.</p>

      <p>I am daily tossed by many calamities, which, due to the weakness of my spirit, distract me with numerous concerns. It pleased me to use your chosen, cheerful benevolence, especially for the reason that my spirit foresees something good from Zurich, not only because your complete and sincere doctrine about Christ strengthens my faith daily, but also because I have regarded the man of holy memory, Master Huldrych Zwingli, as the sincere father of my faith; for he laid the foundation for me with his articles. Just as this man of holy memory sincerely upheld his name with his cheerfulness and ease towards all who were devoted to the truth, so that he was both known and loved as "Huldrych", and truly, by making the truth, which he brought forth so augustly and clearly from the dark fog of feigned hypocrisy, he compelled the minds of all, so that even the adversaries have nothing to which they can respond, even with their own witnesses, whence he was rightly called "Zwinger". For although these names may seem fortuitous to the world and its wise men, we are taught by the spirit that all things are done by God with predetermined plans; for did not God give the name Abraham to Abram, Jacob to Israel, and did not the angel from heaven predict the name of John and the Lord? Can the same not be rightly understood here, that by the very name they show the reason for their mission, office, and works, especially since the experience of things themselves testifies to the same everywhere. If I interpret this correctly, no one will blame me: For what is "Gheimrych" but rich in the mysteries of God? If anyone denies it, the matter is proven by the demonstration of the experiment and the fact itself. For how many mysteries hidden for ages do you elucidate everywhere, let those more learned than I judge. You have the reason why I gladly use your authority.</p>
      <p>Behold, excellent man, our affairs are greatly oppressed: The suffragan (as they call him) Joachim Mötteli, although he cannot accuse me of any crime, nevertheless hates and curses my name so much that I fear I may never be able, at least with a clear conscience, to reconcile with him, whence I, wishing to avert his fury by yielding, as some advise, gladly. However, the people, promising much to themselves about me, strive to retain me. I am driven from both sides, I do not know what to do. It is intolerable to remain in such a situation with so many tricks and deceptions prepared to harm. It seems unworthy to leave those who love you for the sake of the gospel, considering the loss; it is also to be feared that some tumult may arise, lest there be slaughter. Some think it should be awaited to see what the matter will bring, where the divine will and fate will lead, others believe it would be better to change the place, trusting nothing in the matter. I willingly obey your judgment, which I earnestly pray for. If there is anyone who wishes to come to us, I will not be offended. If the matter requires it, I will fill his place. Whatever you sincerely understand from your Albert to be convenient for the matter, I will comply.</p>
      <p>Your Martin lives up to this point, whom I hear is announced dead among you.</p>
      <p>From this, you can easily see how candidly these men deal with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with a happy year with all yours.</p>
      <p>Weinfelden, January 2, 1536.</p>
      <p>Martin Mötteli, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my kind, dear lord and brother.</p>
