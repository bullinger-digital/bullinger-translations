    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's [not received] letter through Girolamo Mariano, who praised Bullinger's brotherly love and helpfulness; this is also known to Curione, and it is demanded by the bishops, as can be read in Paul - Bullinger thereby proves himself to be a true bishop; Girolamo [Mariano] was [in Lausanne] not suitable for any office and wants to continue his journey to Graubünden. Bullinger's Bible gift did not arrive late without understandable reason, as [Eberhard von Rümlang] also wrote to him on Bullinger's behalf; Curione never misunderstood the delay, but shared the events with Bullinger to excuse the long absence of his thanks. Curione would wish for an admonition like the one from Bullinger's last letter to courage and proclamation more often, because on one hand he is sometimes sluggish, on the other hand he is frightened by human beasts, who are worse than the Turks; trusts in God's imminent help. This little, as he can just use his servant Timotheus, whom he brought from Italy and whom Bullinger has already seen once, as a messenger; he is on his way to Italy, and Bullinger can give him [letters there] to take with him. Greetings. [Pierre] Viret and Béat Comte return Bullinger's greeting.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>From Girolamo Mariano, the Italian, I received your most delightful letters a few days ago. He recounted and praised your love towards him, which was not new to me, as I have often been received and dismissed by you with great kindness. I know the unique piety of Bullinger and his fervent spirit to support the miserable and those afflicted for the cause of the Gospel. This is truly the role of a bishop: to guide the minds of the people with exceptional Christian learning and eloquence, and to alleviate the poverty of the especially good and unfortunate through hospitality. These are the two qualities that Saint Paul requires in his bishop, as he says he must be apt to teach and hospitable.</p>
      <p>You have fulfilled these and all other qualities. Therefore, you, I say, you, my best brother, and those like you, not those who sell themselves with certain tiaras and mitres, are bishops and can rightly be called so. But to return to Girolamo, I supported him as long as he wished; however, being a good and modest man, when he realized he was not suitable for any function with us, he wished to proceed to Graubünden, hoping to be of some use there. Indeed, I did not want to hinder the man's decision, especially since it was not a bad one.</p>
      <p>That the Bible, your most holy and precious gift, Bullinger, was returned to us late, I know was not without just cause; for the one to whom you entrusted the task also sent me very kind and pious letters, and I never interpreted the delay negatively; I only thought it right to inform you of what had happened in this matter, so that we would not seem to overlook such a great gift sent after such a long interval in silence, for which we ought to give you eternal thanks.</p>
      <p>Your exhortation, in which you encourage me in your last letters to bravely endure adversities and to propagate the glory of the Lord and the church, greatly inspired me, and I wish to be stirred by such a voice more often; for when I am often sluggish, certain monstrous men terrify me, who, though they are called men and bear the Christian name, surpass even beasts and the Turks in cruelty and impiety; for they seem to thirst for nothing but human blood and the ruin of the true Christian republic and church. You know what I mean. Yet I trust that shortly our Lord, the King of kings, will take severe and indeed atrocious vengeance on all brutality and impiety.</p>
      <p>I wanted to address these few things to you because I have found a messenger to my liking. He is my servant Timotheus, whom I brought with me from Italy, whom you have seen; he is traveling to Italy to see his father. If you wish to entrust him with anything, it will be diligently taken care of.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Jesus Christ and greet your sweetest wife and children in my and my wife's name; also, please greet those excellent brothers there. Lausanne, July 29, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Celio Secondo Curione.</p>
      <p>Mr. Viret and Mr. Comte send their greetings in return.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most excellent man, the most holy and vigilant bishop of Zurich, and the most esteemed brother. In Zurich.</p>
