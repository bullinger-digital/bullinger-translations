      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, my honorable and most beloved father and godfather, and I give you immense thanks for your perpetual benevolence towards me, with which you recently received and embraced me in person and now and always pursue me in my absence. If only I could show myself as grateful to you as I ought to be! I understood from Mr. Steiger what the envoys from Augsburg reported. Our people are not very pleased with it; meanwhile, we rejoice because of the steadfastness of the Palatinate, and we do not doubt that, once this struggle is overcome, both his private affairs and the common cause of truth will be better managed. As for us, since I returned, we have received nothing new of any significance, except that it is written from Geneva that the queen mother has granted the Spaniards permission to pass through France with an army into Lower Germany to suppress those who oppose the harshness of the inquisition there. If this is true, you can imagine how much war and how many disturbances will ensue there. Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to help the churches and protect them from the rage of these wolves. We hear nothing more about the Turk, nor do your letters contain anything about him; we suspect those rumors were fabricated to extract money. These are old tricks; but it is to be feared that they may eventually experience what happened to the boy in the fable, who called the villagers to catch a wolf that was not there, etc.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the ministers of the county and the Neuchâtel classis have written to me and earnestly request that their name not be omitted if our Confession is ever to be published again; for they wish to be united with us entirely and complain that they were omitted in the previous edition. I excused you to them for this and gave them hope that they might be joined with us in the future. Therefore, if it is ever reprinted, please remember this. I have nothing else now, except that I pray the Lord to preserve you and all yours, whom you will greet in my name, for a very long time. Farewell. Mr. Steiger, Diesbach, Madiensis, Zehender, father-in-law, mother, wife, and many others greet you in return.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 4, 1566.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zürich church, my lord and godfather, to be honored with the highest reverence and respect.</p>
