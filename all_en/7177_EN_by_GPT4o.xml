      <p>Reverend fathers in Christ, since it seemed good to you to read aloud the letter of the bishops of London and Winchester in our presence, in which they attempt to justify themselves before you in such a way as to obscure the truth and to make the cause for which we contend seem very trivial and frivolous; we have deemed it necessary to respond to each of its points in this writing, so that the truth may be more clearly revealed to you, who have most kindly promised all your efforts. But if in reviewing the points we either omit something or err, you will grant pardon; both because we conduct these matters nowhere else but with you, and because our memory is not strong enough to follow each detail.</p>
      <p>Letter. - They say that very few have been dismissed, and as for the pious, none except one Sampson is learned.</p>
      <p>Response. - We respond that many of them are so learned that they were deemed worthy by the Bishop of London to preach at St. Paul's Cross before the most renowned and learned congregations of all England; such as Lever, Penne, Gressop, Crowley, Gough, Philpot, Wiburn. The rest were either distinguished with degrees in the academies or proven during the time of persecution, later appointed to the ministry, and presided over the churches with the highest praise. And although some of them were not skilled in the Latin language, yet with the help and assistance of certain books of Calvin, Musculus, and others, which have been translated into English, they were able to interpret the scriptures excellently.</p>
      <p>Letter. - They say that only one proposition, which they recite, is controversial; namely, concerning the matter of vestments.</p>
      <p>Response. - On the twenty-sixth day of March, in the year 1566, all the ministers of London were summoned and appeared before the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, the Dean of Westminster, and some canonists: and there they were asked whether they would acquiesce in the royal proceedings concerning matters of religion, established and to be established; nor was there mention of vestments alone. Those who refused were dismissed.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop also, when granting a license to preach to someone, binds him with these words: Provided always that in your sermons you do not persuade the people to institute any alteration or innovation in religion, other than or against that which the royal majesty has made or will make. If ever any proposition concerning vestments was proposed alone, or any dispute held, as is evident in the booklet published by the bishops in defense of the vestments, they defended them in such a way that both the sacraments and the ministers might recover their former and ancestral dignity and esteem, now almost lost; as is evident from the examination, first figure, first section.</p>
      <p>Letter. - They deny that women baptize. They also deny that extortion of faith from an infant and the signing with the cross are approved by them.</p>
      <p>Response. - How truly they deny these things is apparent from the form of baptism which we have handed over to you, and it is also evident from the bishops' admonitions in article 16, where they themselves command that an infant should not be baptized in any other way than that which is prescribed. Moreover, the bishops' commissioners have borne many brothers to be punished with imprisonment and treated less piously and Christianly, who refused to choose godfathers and godmothers for their infants.</p>
      <p>Letter. - They deny that the archbishop has a court of faculties.</p>
      <p>Response. - Everything proceeds from there in the name of the archbishop, by the supreme royal authority. And although the bishops call this court of faculties in one place of the letter a fiscal court; it can in no way be called such, unless perhaps you concede that it is a fiscal court, from which also individual bishops grant a license for the solemnization of marriage in any place, and at prohibited times; which times also remain with us in the same way as they were in papism.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, if this court was not fiscal when the legate of the Roman pontiff from the side (who used to linger in England during the time of the primacy prevailing with us) held it; it can by no means now be called fiscal. The reason is, because when the primacy was transferred to King Henry the Eighth of pious memory, and all things which by canon law pertained to the Roman pontiff as the monarch of the church were given to him, then he, king and pope, appointed another archbishop, namely of Canterbury, as his legate, yet with the condition that he would pay an annual tribute to him, as the legate from the side used to do to the Roman pope. And this Archbishop of Canterbury has that court by the same reason, and in a similar manner.</p>
      <p>Letter. - They say that the quavering chant of boys and musical organs are not approved by them.</p>
      <p>Response. - Yet they all support them in their churches, and especially with their money the Archbishop of Canterbury has taken care to have organs built in his metropolitan church.</p>
      <p>Letter. - They say much about a synod, where the ministers are three times (as they say) more numerous than they are, to whom it is free to know and decide about anything.</p>
      <p>Response. - They know and decide, but in such a way that nothing is considered firm and valid unless with the assent of the queen and the archbishop. Hence it happened that many things concluded by the penultimate synod for the greatest utility of the church were suppressed, nor did they come to light. Our cause was proposed to the synod at the last assembly by a certain most learned man pertaining to the Bishop of Norwich; but a certain bishop interrupted the man, saying, What does this concern you? We began this matter, and we will bring it to an end. He replied, We thought the queen was the author of this matter, but now we see that you are: and thus they did not allow this cause to be pursued. Moreover, the power to introduce whatever ceremonies they wish throughout the churches of the kingdom is given to the queen and the archbishop by an act of parliament.</p>
      <p>These things, most reverend fathers and lords in Christ, whom we greatly respect, relying on your usual goodness and piety, of which you have made us witnesses in the church of England, we have written both because we do not want the truth of the cause to be hidden from you, and so that you may have writings rather than words from which to seek it. For we have written nothing except what we know to be most true and clearer than the midday light, agreeing to the subscription of the same.</p>
      <p>For everything we have previously done is evident from the bishops' admonitions, from certain royal injunctions, from the form of both baptisms, all of which we have previously handed over to you translated into Latin. The beginnings of the church with us, its progress and various changes, the origin of our controversy, the church truly lacking ministry, are clearly described for you to see in the letter destined for the most illustrious prince of Heidelberg. Now, fathers, we ask, and in Christ we contend again and again, (which you have most kindly promised of your own accord,) that you may soften the embittered minds of the bishops of London, Winchester, and Canterbury, and if you can do nothing more, at least obtain this: that they may be willing to be more lenient to our brothers still remaining in England, and removing the dregs from their churches, if not to help, at least to tolerate, and to connive at their deeds: and that you may pay the just praises of their piety to the reverend bishops of Norwich, Worcester, and Durham, as you promised in your letters; and that you may encourage them, along with the brothers ministers striving for the purification of the churches, to continue in their purpose. If we obtain these things through your great kindness (as we trust), we will not only not trouble other churches with new prayers, but we and all the truly pious will owe everything to you for the peace and concord your work has brought to the church, and God the best and greatest will grant you an eternal crown through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted to your dignity, George Withers, John Barthelot, Englishmen.</p>
      <p>To the reverend fathers in Christ, and their most esteemed lords, Lord Heinrich Bullinger and Lord Rudolf Gwalther, the most faithful ministers of the Christian church in Zurich, etc.</p>
