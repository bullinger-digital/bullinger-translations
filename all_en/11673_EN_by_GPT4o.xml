    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks God for Bullinger's recovery, but remains concerned about Leo [Jud], [Konrad] Pellikan, and Theodor [Bibliander]. Is worried about plans for a closer alliance of the Confederates with the French [King Francis I], which allegedly emerged after [the Imperial Estates assembled in Speyer] urged the Confederates to participate in the Turkish campaign and threatened the King; fears renewed tensions among the Confederates or the unrestricted return of the pension system. After a victory over the Turks, the Evangelicals would even be threatened in their existence, but these concerns are premature as long as the Diet has not yet taken place. Nevertheless, wants to discuss this with Bullinger and believes that the Confederates could easily refuse participation in the campaign at their own expense, while the mercenaries already sent to France by the Five Places could hardly be recalled, especially in view of the French response to the letter from the Imperial; however, has not yet seen the circulating copies himself. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The person who delivered this letter informed me that you have recovered. I thank the Lord and pray that He will keep you safe and sound always. He said that Leo (Jud) is not yet well, which grieves me, as I can do nothing else. When Pellikan (Konrad Pellikan) last wrote, he did not complain; now I hear that he too is not well. I am deeply troubled for Theodor (Bibliander), as it is not fitting for a man of his age to be tormented by such pains. I wish he were not the cause of his own troubles due to untimely studies and immense labors! It pains me that he does not allow himself to be advised. May the Lord kindly extend His mercy to all, I pray.</p>
      <p>I spent a sleepless night because a rumor reached my ears, which made me fear either greater discord among the Swiss or the eventual return of the pensions, as we call them, to everyone. The occasion was this: A nobleman came to me, explaining that he had received letters from the leading figures of the Empire addressed to the Swiss, full of threats unless they proved themselves to be Christians in this time against the Turk. There was soon a consultation among some private individuals: It would be better, therefore, for us all to return to the French (King Francis I), since he too has been attacked with the gravest threats by the German princes unless he satisfies the most Christian name. This consultation is to be discussed in the current Diet, as I hear. I immediately thought: If our people persist as they have so far, while the others try to pursue the begun plan, the appearance of concord, which has appeared for a time, is over. If the consultation is approved, the Gospel is lost, and we must expect all kinds of evils. For with the Lord fighting against the Turk for the Germans and victory achieved, arrogance will give counsel to our ruin.</p>
      <p>Thus I became anxious until the Diet convened, from which I was to understand first the matters that so tormented me. I therefore reproached myself for that untimely vexation, since it was uncertain what had been reported to me through rumor.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I could not hide this torment of mine from you, both so that you might understand the care I have for the fatherland, but more so for the Gospel, and so that, if you knew anything about this matter, you might inform me, whether you console or torment me further. It seems to me that whatever the Imperialists demand, it can be easily answered, especially by the Christian Swiss. But before I say what is on my mind, I will hear from you. Indeed, I will say what I feel: We cannot all set out together if it were to be at our own expense. Meanwhile, however, we will remain at peace and meet the Turk with prayers as best we can. But if someone were to promise to pay the stipend, we would do what is fitting for the pious and brave in the Lord. Therefore, if no one gives anything, who will compel us? Or who will bear it more unjustly, that we cannot do what we cannot? But in the meantime, I hear that the Five Places have sent soldiers to the French. What will you do here? I will recall them home, threatening all harsh things to the disobedient and bringing contempt to the scorners. But I am easily persuaded that this cannot be done, considering their dispositions, which you know so well that words are unnecessary. They will be more obstinate, once they see (and perhaps have already seen), how the French respond to the letters of the Imperialists; for they are circulated in Latin and German (although I have not yet been allowed to see them). The French act here in such a way that they have won over their supporters. I will try, if possible, to obtain them. In these straits, indeed, I am enclosed, and who will deliver me but the Lord? There is no one among us with whom I can speak a word. Therefore, whatever it is, I suppress it and pray to God to deliver us from evil. Consider it a good thing that I impose this burden on your shoulders as well; I could hardly bear it otherwise.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in the Lord and admonish Theodor, as you do, to preserve himself for himself and for us. Greet all the brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 14, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, brother in the Lord, to be especially revered.</p>
