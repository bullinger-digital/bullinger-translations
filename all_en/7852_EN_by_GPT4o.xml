      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter, reverend and honorable brothers, is Bonifacius Mundtbrat, the son of the esteemed Mr. Rodolphi Mundtbrat. He has asked me to write to you, my fellow ministers and brothers, and request that you take up his cause and advocate for him with his parent; for he wishes to commend himself to them and be assisted by them. Although I do not know the man personally, I have been informed by those who know him better that he is not a bad person, nor does he live dishonorably or idly, but conducts himself well.</p>
      <p>However, he is broken by long illnesses and oppressed by poverty, so that unless he receives some assistance, he will soon be entirely ruined. Since our heavenly Father has commended such people to us, it was not burdensome for me to take up his advocacy with you. And I hope it will not be burdensome for you to intercede faithfully for him with his parent, of whom I expect nothing but fairness and goodness, as his piety and humanity are praised by all good people. I also join you in beseeching him to show himself kind and generous to his son according to his means. He knows from whom to expect recompense, and the munificent Lord will bless you as well if you faithfully advocate for the cause of the poor.</p>
      <p>Forgive me if I have caused you any trouble with this matter; in return, if I can gratify you, my honorable lords and dearest brothers, in any way, I will devote myself entirely to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the Lord bless you and keep you from all evil. I also urge you, in this perilous time of ours, to pray for us and for the brothers in France who are afflicted in a remarkable way.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 15th of April, in the year of our salvation 1569. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, minister of the church in Zurich and your fellow minister, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the reverend men and distinguished servants of Jesus Christ, the faithful ministers of the church in St. Gallen, my honorable lords and dearest brothers. St. Gallen.</p>
