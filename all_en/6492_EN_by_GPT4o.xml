      <p>Greetings. I give you immense thanks, reverend father, for the news sent to me; for I was curious about what was happening in the monetary matter. Almost no one has come to us in these past days, from whom we could learn anything about your affairs and your health; we are in a place removed from the noise of the crowd. The bath exerts its strength on almost everyone, so I hope it will benefit all my children.</p>
      <p>I asked the courier about all your affairs. I hope Katharina, my brother, and others will come to you by Sunday, so that we may learn about all your affairs in detail.</p>
      <p>I return what you sent and thank you for them. Farewell, most distinguished man; do not disdain to greet your entire family in my name.</p>
      <p>In Aeugst, the day after St. John's Day.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] f[ully] Ludwig Lav[ater].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father-in-law. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
