    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer has tasked him with reporting on the discussions in Bern, but Bullinger will already be sufficiently informed from Bucer's letter, the transmitted documents, and oral reports; therefore, he only briefly reminds that a division would put the continued existence of the church in question. Concerns held against the Concord are unfounded, as its conditions are established in the [First Helvetic] Confession; it must be promoted with all efforts. Bullinger could undoubtedly agree with all the statements made by Bucer on the way regarding the doctrine of the Lord's Supper; Gryn√§us asks him and his colleagues, especially Bibliander, to advocate for the Concord.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ the Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>Bucer, departing from here, instructed me to write to you about what has been happening in Bern these days. Indeed, since he himself has written much and a copy of the proceedings is being sent to you, and since the news has already reached you, I think it is unnecessary to write much. I will only say this, which I have often remembered complaining to you: It seems miserable if we pass on a confirmed schism to our descendants. This will inevitably happen if the concord that has begun cannot be achieved at this time, when all good men have worked for it for so many years. For if it now falls apart and nothing can be done - who, I ask, will then attempt this matter, which will seem impossible in every way? Therefore, our church and fatherland, barely looking up to the light of the divine word, will always have this cloud of miserable discord before its eyes and will never be able to see the pure sky and the sun of Christ's doctrine. And this blemish on the face of the true church will be in the eyes of all nations. Thus, the kingdom of the pope stands immovable through our civil war, while our true church (oh dire matter) cannot stand any longer. I testify to the Lord Christ that no more bitter thought can occur, especially when I see that mere suspicions divide us and that no one with a mind worthy of Christ wants to consider such a great matter due to the mere arts of Satan.</p>
      <p>When I ponder and see these things, I willingly devote myself, my dearest Bullinger, to this matter, and I do not take a single step without praying to the Lord to unite us in truth. Indeed, if concord cannot be achieved now, which seems to me to have almost come together, let us only strive to prevent it from being torn apart by the rash zeal of certain men. I see no reason for us to fear anything, as we have entered into it under conditions that are in every way the safest and most fortified by truth. It is surprising how coldly our confession, in which the conditions of concord are set for us, has been treated in Bern by some, whose character you know well, and it was almost the case that this church alone was completely alienated from concord with us. What is this matter, I ask, dearest Bullinger: What once pleased and still pleases, I see now displeases because it seems to unite us with that from which our mind recoils. Or how can peace with a Christian be burdensome to Christian men, or what kind of servants of Christ will we be, fostering eternal discord among ourselves? But, as usual, the Lord is superior and prevails, and I believe the efforts of good men will eventually triumph. Your kindness has greatly helped us in this whole matter so far. Therefore, let us continue, despite Satan's opposition, to establish this concord of the church. Since it is based on truth, it can also fortify our church against every attack of the enemies and overthrow the pope with all his conspiracies. May the Lord Christ grant that we approach this great matter with the most vigilant minds.</p>
      <p>Regarding the presence of the body of the Lord remaining in heavenly glory and in no way descending to our corruptible things, and its life-giving consumption through faith, also regarding the faithful but unworthy participation, and the useless and pernicious consumption by the impious, I have heard Bucer speak throughout this journey in such a way that I do not believe you would speak differently on these matters or vary by a single word. I will pray to the Lord that He may fully reconcile all good and sanctified minds with each other. I ask you not to cease devoting your pious and sincere heart to the supreme matter, namely the concord of the church. I ask the same of all of you, especially our Bibliander, a singular ornament and instrument of the church. May the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we conquer and who Himself lives in us as the best teacher, teaching and guiding us every moment with the present and living breath of His Spirit, truly reconcile us in Himself. Amen.</p>
      <p>3rd of October, in Basel.</p>
      <p>Your brother in the Lord, S. Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>To the excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
