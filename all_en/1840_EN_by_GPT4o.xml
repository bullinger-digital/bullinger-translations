      <p>Greetings. I send you in haste some excerpts of news from letters written from Augsburg to Mr. Musculus. Otherwise, I have nothing to write now, except that I wish you and all yours well. Farewell. April 4, 1553.</p>
      <p>J. Haller, all yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
