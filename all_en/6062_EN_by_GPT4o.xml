      <p>Greetings, Reverend Father in Christ.</p>
      <p>I am awaiting your letters; when I wrote this, our people had not yet returned. Bern is the one to whom I gave these; but since I did not know the man, I did not want to entrust him with the letters of Mr. Martinengo along with the acts of the council, which I have here for you. However, I doubt whether our people will depart due to the intense cold.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I wanted to inform you of the state of our affairs.</p>
      <p>I hope God will still be with us; for the Milanese are complaining about the proposed articles; therefore, they have written to the ambassador not to proceed further, which has alarmed him not a little; he set off yesterday, has departed, and left his secretary here, intending to inform the Duke so that he may be satisfied with the proposed articles, and plans to return after Easter. You have the summary.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we must be vigilant, so that you will do your best and inform us at all times of what is discovered in all places, so that if there is any deceit behind it, we may know better how to guard against it.</p>
      <p>This is written in haste; if our people depart, more will follow. Our consul Tscharner will come to you in 8 days and report everything in person.</p>
      <p>Farewell, Reverend Father. March 13, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>We wish to know from you what has been done in the Glarus matter and whether the plague is spreading among you; in Chiavenna, it is certainly stirring. To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and honorable father in Christ. ZÃ¼rich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
