      <p>God grant you all many thousands of good years; that is what we all wish for you. I have nothing to send you except what is enclosed, which I received from Augsburg; send it back to me with this messenger. He is coming to you, you will bring it; make sure he returns soon.</p>
      <p>It is generally believed that the king will soon be overthrown; for the Huguenots and other aggrieved parties are resisting fiercely, and there is concern that the shedding of innocent blood will be avenged dearly. May Almighty God have mercy on us. Greet Susanna and the children for me. In haste.</p>
      <p>If you have sent my letter from Schaffhausen, I would not be pleased; but if you have noted something from it, that is fine.</p>
      <p>Look, look, that your assurance from Rhinow arrives, and write to me about your situation; I hope well. Pray to God faithfully for health.</p>
      <p>On the last of December late at night etc. 72. Heinrich Bullinger the elder.</p>
