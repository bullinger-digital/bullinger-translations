      <p>To the most esteemed patron and father, Heinrich Bullinger, from Josua Maler, greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>It seems something unexpected has happened to us, especially to me, that we have received a response from you, most esteemed lord, to our letters, even though they are quite barbarous and unrefined; for neither were ours, especially mine, worthy of a response from you amidst your many occupations. Yet your paternal love for us and all scholars has prevailed, so that you not only sent us a letter but also encouraged us towards all kinds of virtues. Among these, you especially wish to commend gratitude to us, both towards God and towards men. From your most learned letters, we understand how it is necessary to be grateful, namely if we also have religion joined to this. May the Lord increase this grace in us, so that we may be willing to labor in good letters, so that neither you may regret your pious admonitions and great expenses, nor we our labors. May the same Lord support us with His benevolent hand and increase the grace of the Holy Spirit in us, so that we may be able to offer all duties of honor and gratitude both to Him, who alone protects us, and to you, our most esteemed patrons and fathers. And since we are instructed in this, that we may someday serve the Church of Christ, may that kind Father make it so that we conduct ourselves as is fitting for those of whom no small hope seems to have been conceived. For I desire, indeed I also strive, to give effort, so that I may not seem ungrateful to God, nor to my parents, nor especially to you, especially since I perceive your paternal love towards me so evident, that even though I am unworthy, you do not disdain to call me by the name of son. May the Lord grant grace, lest I commit something that would be less fitting for a good son; may He also make it so that I do not forget those things which I recently observed in Z端rich, both from others and especially from you, to be observed in good and well-composed civil manners. I know what is to be rendered to God, what to men, what to my most just patrons; yet I find that I cannot accomplish these things without the help of the Lord. Therefore, I wish to be commended to your prayers and those of all the pious. Meanwhile, I too, relying on divine assistance, will strive to reach the destined goal according to my duty, etc.</p>
      <p>We give you the greatest thanks, that you have such paternal care for us, that you wish to provide for us and our studies not only at home with you but also among foreigners, and that through your most humane recommendations. For Master Viret has reported to us how diligently you commended us to him in the last letters sent to him. And for this very reason, although he had previously performed all friendly duties towards us, he now also offers himself and all his things to us and piously encourages us to study, indeed he loves us more than other Germans and especially favors the Church of Z端rich and its ministers, among whom you rightfully hold the first place, and he wishes to agree with it in all things. The other learned men also treat us with all humanity and have good hope that our church will agree with theirs, if there are those who have some knowledge of their language. I am very eager to acquire this knowledge, if only I could obtain the opportunity to converse with them a little longer through the humanity of all our people. I hope, however, that you will be accommodating to those who ask for something neither unjust nor of little use. Viret is entirely focused on this, that I also apply myself to the French language, the same thing that, as I receive from my father's letters, Master Gwalter, whom I must especially honor and observe, advises me. I would not wish to spurn their advice, since I see how honorable and useful it is, if only I could somehow move you, my most esteemed patrons and fathers, with my prayers. But concerning these things, it is not necessary to do anything now; I will be obedient to you in all things; I know you will do nothing unjust or without my benefit with me. Therefore, I wish to be commended to all of you, and especially to you, most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for a long time for the benefit of all scholars and of His entire church. Farewell and, if it pleases you, keep us commended to you.</p>
      <p>Given in Lausanne on the 14th day before the Kalends of October in the year of salvation 1549. Josua Pictorius, most devoted to your humanity.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Z端rich, most esteemed patron and father. In Z端rich.</p>
