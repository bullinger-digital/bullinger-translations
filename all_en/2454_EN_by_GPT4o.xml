      <p>S. D. I had very much in mind to write to you, most illustrious man, about many things and on many subjects, but, I do not know how it happens, certain obstacles prevent me from fulfilling what I desire. For letters have come from the most illustrious prince to the professors about transferring the school to another town because of the plague, and it has already been decided that this should be done. We are therefore ordered to pack our belongings, which certainly we cannot do without great detriment to our studies and domestic affairs.</p>
      <p>However, our Johannes Hugo can serve in place of a lengthy letter to you, as he will explain to you more extensively in person the state of both our public studies and my private affairs than I could encompass in writing. I commend him to your dignity and to the other most honorable lords as diligently as I can, since he has conducted himself among us as befits a pious young man. I hear that our most illustrious prince is now joined with the other confederates, namely King Ferdinand, the Elector Count Palatine, the Duke of Württemberg, the bishops, and several other princes, and some believe that he is being asked to take upon himself the imperial office against any enemies that may arise against the empire, a duty which Henry, Duke of Brunswick, having been victorious over Albert, Margrave of Brandenburg (whom you have no doubt heard defected to the French), has long since performed. Some princes will soon convene in Frankfurt, and when this assembly is dissolved, more certain information will be known. What I recently mentioned about the church in Cologne and had been conveyed to me by the conversations of some, and even by letters which I had heard read to some, I now understand could not succeed because of the adversaries of sound doctrine, who immediately obstructed it. This was reported to me by the letters of a certain pious man and prefect in the Duchy of Jülich, who added that the Queen of England had attempted something through envoys to arrange peace between the Emperor and the French, but, while each side proposes harsh and unjust conditions, it is in vain.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, however, a new Hesdin is being built by the Emperor, and by the French, Morinum, commonly called Terouanne. The plague is spreading everywhere here and along the Rhine, also in the Duchy of Jülich and Aachen and elsewhere, and we fear that it may become more and more severe. May the Lord Jesus deliver us both from bodily plague and from pestilent men, indeed from all contagion of the soul. Farewell. Marburg, 4th day before the Ides of November, 1554. I ask that you greet the other fellow ministers in my name, especially your sons-in-law Zwingli, Lavater, and Simler.</p>
      <p>Yours, Andreas Hyperius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most honorable Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his lord to be respected.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
