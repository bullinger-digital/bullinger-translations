      <p>Grace and peace from God, the Father, through Christ Jesus, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Knowing, pious, wise, and well-learned sir, as it has come to my attention through credible people, that we, from the County of Toggenburg, are being slandered and accused before you, as if we are those who pay little regard to the honor of God and His Word, but rather pursue our own interests, seeking temporal gains. So know, pious sir, that in this case, we are mostly wronged; for our intention has never been otherwise than, if in the goodness (arbitration) our dealings were handled, that we have always desired first and foremost to remain by God's Word and the sound teaching of the Gospel, and thereafter that the government, through which such is protected, be granted to us. For we can otherwise well recognize, although much is said against us concerning God's Word, that we must be concerned that it might be poorly upheld for us in the long run; as has happened to several honest (upright) people, which is undoubtedly not unknown to you. In summary, our intention has never been otherwise: If in the goodness our dealings could be handled (which would be very dear to us), then we desire God's Word first and foremost, thereafter the government or the authority and the remission of the "Fall," and that the same be valued, as honest, upright people, who handle the matter kindly, might recognize. However, it is no less, if it should come to a legal proceeding, that we desire the purchase according to all knowledge, measure, and form, as it has occurred, and we have the letter and seal thereof. Such, well-learned sir, I wanted to inform you of, so that you are informed of our will and intention, so that you do not lightly believe those who disparage us and our dealings before you, and hereby also most friendly and faithfully request you to speak and act for us in the best way possible before your lords and superiors (as we trust you and them with all honor and goodness). If we can deserve such and especially I from you, we are willing and ready.</p>
      <p>Herewith commended to God, and we greet your faithful collaborators in the divine word, Leo Jud, to whom you will also present this our intention, for which I have earnestly requested you.</p>
      <p>Given on the 8th of April in the year 1538.</p>
      <p>Your willing Martin Edelmann, bailiff in the Turtal.</p>
      <p>To the pious, wise, and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my especially gracious and dear sir.</p>
