      <p>It is a strange day; a Neapolitan count passed through Frauenfeld; the bailiff dined with him. He claimed that he came directly from the Emperor; he is now well, and the matter of his health is on a good path. Secondly, that the imperial majesty intends to have peace and quiet this year, and although something has arisen and flared up because of the Turks and Italy, he has good ways and means to settle it without war; for he is determined not to wage war this year.</p>
      <p>Regarding the council, this count said he was entirely convinced that nothing would come of it; the high priests themselves are disunited and just as useless as the worldly potentates; one cannot and will not endure their pomp and arrogance. He also told the bailiff to be certain that the new teachings, as they are called, are thriving in Italy, as well as in other places, and that they will not be easily extinguished.</p>
      <p>The bailiff himself told this to a good man, who reported it to me. May God, in His grace, direct it for the best.</p>
