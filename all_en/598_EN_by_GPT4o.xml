      <p>Greetings. It seemed appropriate, most pious Bullinger, for you to know that Hieronymus Hurus, when he was recently seen at the assembly in Solothurn, had no mandate from Konrad Zwick. I recently informed you about myself, that he was there without my knowledge.</p>
      <p>I also did not want you to be unaware that in these days it is said that a captain of no small renown, an advisor to the Emperor, will come to Constance. However, the magistrate is taking care to repair the bridge, part of which the Spaniards had broken and destroyed, with sudden and hasty work. The king is expected at Oenopont, from where Lord Bolviler returned the day before, sending me a letter from the city imposing a fine of a thousand gold coins on me, yet preserving the protest and right of the Constance senate. A similar letter was delivered to Konrad Zwick. We will consider what seems to pertain to the mitigation and explanation of harsher conditions; but if the royal officials persist in being harsh, I will follow the advice of the Zurich senate, my forefathers. I am contemplating moving with my family this month to the estate purchased in Kempten, unless I am hindered by necessary occupations. I pray to Christ that you convey in our words, to favor this entry.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Butler, our friend, convey my greetings, saying that I learned from Onophorus that his letters, one and another, have been returned to him, but that he does not yet have a response, though he has written to others about the same matter, whose response he now awaits. I urged him to hasten; therefore, he promised to hasten.</p>
      <p>Farewell, honorable Bullinger, and love me, as you do, in the Lord with our brothers. At my estate in Vultureio near Constance. July 21, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blaurer.</p>
