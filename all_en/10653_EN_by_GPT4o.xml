    <p xml:id="regest1">The news of the death of his son [Heinrich], which he received the previous evening at 9 o'clock, has shaken him. He asks Bullinger and Utinger for advice and help; for as soon as he informs his family of the matter at daybreak, he will no longer be able to leave [Kyburg].</p>

      <p>To the well-learned, honorable, etc., my particularly trusted lord and dearest friend and benefactor.</p>
      <p>Your friendly letter, along with the comfort, exhortation to patience, and all friendship, etc., I received last night at the ninth hour with great shock and heartache. And although I recognize that true trust, faith, patience (composure), and no impatience should be borne, yet (nevertheless) the flesh with its temptations constantly brings it to light. And there is nothing else: If he had otherwise died, I might have been able to handle the matter much more easily, but the way is still very difficult for me, as the mighty hand of God presses so heavily upon me; for I have borne the miserable yoke for a long time and all my life. But despite all this, I still hope in my gracious Lord and God, that He will not completely cast me out; for surely no greater sorrow could befall me than that which has been my dearest child. And perhaps I have trusted him too much, which God, through His foresight, has turned to the best through this means. Therefore, I ask you and others, my dear lords and friends, to pray to God for me, that nothing worse (more severe) may happen to me, and that I may bear my misery and distress patiently. Who knows the judgment of God? Perhaps it all happens for my good and humility, so that I do not leap too high, etc.</p>
      <p>Further, I ask you for advice, as unfortunately the matter has developed in such a way, whether I should immediately send a messenger down, or whether you would like to handle the matter, and what is to be done or left undone here. I intend to send a servant there in the coming days for the answer. I had intended to be in Zurich myself last night. I have been so very ill that I could not ride, and now I cannot leave home; for there is great sorrow and distress here, although I have handled the matter as gently as possible, as soon as it becomes day. And with this, I have always commended myself to you. I also express my highest thanks for your friendly compassion and mercy. You will also understand my writing as the best intention and thus from a troubled person.</p>
      <p>Given at the second hour of the night on the 13th day of June in the year of our Lord 1535.</p>
      <p>H. R. Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable, my particularly dear lords and friends M. Heinrich Bullinger and Mr. Heinrich Utinger.</p>
