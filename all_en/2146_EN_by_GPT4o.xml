      <p>Greetings. I give and hold the greatest thanks to you, most learned man, for your kindness and humanity, which you always show towards me, partly by replying, even though you are occupied with many honorable affairs, and partly because you are willing to share with me so benevolently those things which I have requested. But I am not sure when I will be able to visit Zürich to receive from your kindness the things I desire; however, I hope that you will have more leisure time at some point, so that, if I do not meet you in person, you can inquire and send them to me. I do not wish to be a burden to your kindness. Moreover, I received the bundle of books, about which Mr. Vergerius wrote, eight days ago and would have sent it long ago; but there were no messengers. Now a convenient one has presented himself, the son of Michael; therefore, I am sending him to you.</p>
      <p>I will ensure that what you sent is carefully delivered to Mr. Vergerius. Now I have nothing new to write, not even about the assemblies.</p>
      <p>For your kindness, if you have enough leisure, I ask you to share the rest, which could not be noted in the previous letters, especially those concerning the gospel, England, and the entire church of Christ and the strange tricks against it; if not more, give just a single line, another time another; for besides you, we have no one through whom we can be informed of such matters. May the Lord grant you strength of mind and body, for which we will also pray, and may He keep you safe for a long time for His church, to which I commend you with all the brothers, asking that you keep us and our church commended to you, as you have been accustomed to do until now. Farewell and live with all others, most humane man. Schaffhausen, the day after the calends of January 1554.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Jakob Rüeger. To the most excellent in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
