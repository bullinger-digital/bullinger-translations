    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] When will Bullinger break his silence? And why must Haller wait for a month for Bullinger's advice in this catastrophic situation? The Zurich pastors employed in Augsburg [Haller, Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] will only be able to delay their departure for a few more days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Anton Fugger has secured a peace with Emperor Charles V, but under such conditions that its acceptance by the Augsburg council is surprising. Although religion and freedom are to remain untouched, a high monetary fine is imposed, imperial occupation troops are to be stationed in the city (to prevent a citizen uprising), and Sebastian Schertlin and Bernardino Ochino are to be handed over. Yet, the Augsburg Great Council decided to accept the peace! This is the doing of merchants, tax collectors, and such good-for-nothings. They prefer a disgraceful peace to a risky freedom and to the cross of Christ! The common people are outraged. An uprising is to be feared. Therefore, the Augsburg pastors must also express themselves more cautiously. Although they and Georg Frölich urged the merchants to stand firm, it was in vain. To pay homage to the Emperor, four envoys [Marx Pfister, Konrad Maier, Sebastian Seitz, and Jörg Hopfer] are being dispatched today.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Haller has long seen this coming. Strange that Bullinger writes nothing! He should urge the Zurich council to quickly recall the Zurich pastors, as they do not want to submit to the forerunner of the Antichrist [Pope Paul III]. Moreover, one can well imagine what the Spaniards will do in the city!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bernardino Ochino is being sent away from Augsburg. Apparently, Sebastian Schertlin is also supposed to leave the city. However, he threatened with an armed uprising of his remaining 2500 soldiers and the peasants [from the surrounding area]: One will hear from him everywhere! Therefore, haste is necessary before the roads are blocked and the Spaniards come. Better to resign voluntarily! The Zurich pastors hope not to do a disservice to either Bullinger or the Zurich council. Haller knows well that it will not be easy to enforce the departure from Augsburg, especially since the Augsburg authorities want to avoid talk among the people. Approval from Zurich would make it easier for the Zurich pastors. But even without such approval, Haller would rather go into exile with his wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli] and children [Agnes and Johannes] than submit! Surely other preachers will also leave. They are waiting for the departure of the Zurich pastors (who have the most reason to leave) to then also be able to leave the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings. In haste. Haller asks for indulgence. He is so troubled that he does not know what to write and do.</p>

      <p>Greetings. When will your silence finally end, esteemed father? Why am I left without your letters and advice in these most turbulent times? I have been waiting for a whole month for your counsel on what we should do. Matters have reached a point where, unless we receive your and the Zurich council's letters within a few days, we cannot delay our departure from Augsburg any longer.</p>

      <p>Fugger has secured peace with the Emperor, but of a kind I never would have believed our council would accept! He promised to preserve religion and freedom, but in the meantime, demands a very large monetary fine. He also wants to station some of his soldiers in the city to prevent a citizen uprising. He demanded that Schertlin and Bernardino be handed over to him. Our council, after much deliberation, decided to enter into peace under whatever conditions they could. This was the work of those scoundrels, the merchants, tax collectors, etc., who prefer a disgraceful peace to a dangerous freedom, who would rather bear the cross of Christ. I have never seen such treachery! The common people are protesting. An uprising is to be feared, which is why we must speak more cautiously about this matter. We have faithfully warned them, specifically pointing out the issue, but to no avail. Even Mr. Laetus worked hard to prevent them from giving in, but in vain. Today, four envoys are being sent to humbly fall at the Emperor's feet, asking for forgiveness and surrendering themselves.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I wrote about these things long ago, foreseeing what would happen. Yet you have not responded (which I find very surprising). I therefore ask again that you persuade the council to recall us without delay. We do not want to submit to this impious defender of the Antichrist. Consider what will happen when the Spaniards enter the city. You know what they seek. They have openly decided to let them in.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Bernardino will be sent elsewhere. I also hear that Schertlin is to be exiled, but this is not yet confirmed. I know, however, that he has threatened: If he must leave, he will hang all his servants, of whom he still has 2500 with him, and all the peasants on him, and start such a commotion in the land that everyone will have to talk about him. Therefore, it is time. I fear we will be cut off, that the roads will be blocked. We do not want to wait for the Spaniards. Rather, we will take leave ourselves, hoping that we do not do a disservice to you or my lords, although I know that I must tear myself away with great difficulty. For they will be reluctant to let me go because of the common people, and so that they do not have the word that the preachers are leaving them. Therefore, I would like to be written to, so that I have a better excuse. But if we are not written to, I will rather go into exile with my wife and children, wherever God leads me, than submit. Other preachers will also be ready to leave, all looking to us, as we have more reason to leave than they do.</p>

      <p>Farewell. In haste. Forgive me. I am so troubled and uncertain that I do not know what to write or do. Augsburg, January 25, 1547. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord. Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
