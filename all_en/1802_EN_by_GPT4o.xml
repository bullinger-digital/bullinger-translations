      <p>Greetings. I give thanks to our savior of all; who, having mercy on us and our churches, has granted us the pleasure of your presence for a longer time. May He confirm what He has begun, for many years! Indeed, all the pious who love you for the Lord's sake and intercede with their prayers for your health greatly rejoice in this.</p>
      <p>You have surely heard of Evander's death among the people of Bruges. I therefore pray that, as much as you can with your help, you work for Clauser to be given to them by the lords of Zürich; for indeed, I see no difficulty remaining with the people of Bruges, since we have recommended him to them, so that I do not doubt that they will soon call him, provided you grant him to them. Hardly any other condition could have been more suitable to his character and talent. Today, the principal people of Bruges are here with us, the little fox, the town clerk, and others, who give us certain hope of his calling; for the power of choosing a schoolmaster is in their hands; ours have nothing beyond confirmation. I therefore ask that you do not fail this man, the school, or our church; for I do not know, as God loves me, who else could be more suitably appointed to this school; we certainly have no one.</p>
      <p>As for recent events, we have nothing, except that Schertlius arrived here the day before yesterday and today, I think, is about to depart. I dined with him yesterday, but I could not elicit anything certain from him.</p>
      <p>I think that under this spring he will gather new soldiers; for he says he does not yet smell any peace. The ministers of Augsburg are almost in conflict with each other; for three ministers called from Saxony are trying to burden the church with some new ceremonies, which others resist, wishing to retain the old form, and the imperial magistrate sets them against each other and pours cold water on the hatred of religion.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, we have nothing now.</p>
      <p>Our church is now quite peaceful; may the Lord confirm us in this peace! I do not know what monster our magistrate is nurturing; I know some things that I would like to communicate to you; but it is not safe to do so by letters. Pray to the Lord for us, that He may not lead us into temptation. Farewell with all yours. Mr. Treasurer Haller greets you in return and gives great thanks for your little book. I ask that, if you ever write to him, you commend Schlatter to him, for he is his neighbor, so that he may embrace him with even greater goodwill for your sake. Musculus, Schlatter, and others also send their regards; greet your entire household from me and mine. Also Gwalther and Frisius, whom I am still expecting. Bern, February 6, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and most faithful minister of Christ and the church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
