    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] After Blasius had already sealed this letter, he learned from a reliable source that in these days 7,000 Italians will come to Milan to move from there through Venetian territory to Trento. However, it is believed that the Venetians will not let them pass. As soon as Blasius learns more about this through scouts or merchants, he will certainly report it.</p>

      <p>After I had sealed this letter, I received credible information that in these days 7,000 Italians are supposed to come to Milan, intending to move next through Venetian territory towards Trento, and it is also reported that the Venetians will block their passage. If more specific information comes from Milan through scouts and merchants, I will certainly inform you.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Blasius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Master H. Bullinger, to his own hand.</p>
