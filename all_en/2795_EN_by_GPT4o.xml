      <p>S. Today here in Chur there is a meeting of all Three Leagues, where the (former) land judge in the Upper League wants to go to Rome with the Five Places and Solothurn and Fribourg to the Pope, to wish him well for the office, as he has become Pope; secondly, that he brings us Three Leagues three hundred ducats, which the Pope has owed us from ancient times; thirdly, that they help, if possible, to make and accept an eternal peace from the Emperor and the King of France. It is intended that all Three Leagues should also send with him and the aforementioned Confederates; however, we think that nothing will come of it, as many do not agree, and consider it a childish and ridiculous matter. When the meeting is over, I will let you know what has been done. Farewell in the Lord, most excellent of men. From Chur, on the morning of the last day of December in the year 1555.</p>
