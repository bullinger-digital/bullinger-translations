      <p>Greetings. It was pleasing to me yesterday, most excellent father Bullinger, to have seen the summary of what you responded to the letters of Mr. Sulcer, and certainly the response was not inappropriate, therefore it cannot be entirely disapproved, especially if the matter stands as Mr. Sulcer wrote to you, namely that you are to be called to the synod, if you wish, as if you should either provoke the adversaries to a colloquy or voluntarily insert yourselves into their colloquies and as if this synod is to be convened solely for your sake. However (as I seem to have received from Mr. Marbach), the matter stands differently: several princes, true devotees of piety, for many reasons desire that some good method be found by which the German churches may agree with the Swiss in the doctrine of piety and especially in the matter of the sacraments, or at least be reconciled in such a way that henceforth neither side condemns nor attacks the other in any way; they judged that this method could not be found more conveniently or easily than if the principal and most learned men chosen from each side were called to some friendly colloquy, where the learned men themselves chosen from each side might discuss and confer amicably among themselves about finding this method. And since they were not certain whether the Swiss, if called, would come, they wished, before they announce the synod, to be informed of their willingness. Therefore, our senate, which had taken this matter upon itself, wrote to the Basel senate about this matter, also asking that they investigate and report what the willingness of the other Swiss churches is regarding this matter.</p>
      <p>You have, most excellent Bullinger (if the matter stands thus), the desire of the pious princes, you have the purpose for which they wish this synod to be convened, you have the subject on which they wish to speak with you and yours amicably. Now, if the matter stands thus, if to such a colloquy, for such a cause at this such a time, when such a colloquy is more than necessary for the church of Christ, you most learned men and pastors of the churches, to whom nothing should be more desirable, as I trust it is not, than that all churches, if not in all doctrine and every form of speaking, at least in part and in charity, be united, if, I say, you being thus called refuse to come and it depends on you that so holy and by all the pious so long desired a synod is not convened and such a good, if perhaps it can be obtained from the Lord, is not attempted by this means, I do not see, most holy Bullinger, how your counsel can be approved, indeed I do not see how you can avoid incurring many reproaches from almost all the pious.</p>
      <p>For they will say that you are held by no desire for the uniting of the churches, that you care only for your own, that you are content with your own peace, that you finally make nothing of the fact that many in France are burned under the name of sacramentarians; for I am beginning to hear some such things not without great pain of my mind, although to... understand. Or you will have to say that you indeed desire concord and the union of the churches, but you see no way by which this can be done, nor do you have any hope of future concord for the reasons which you brought forward in the letters to Mr. Sulcer.</p>
      <p>But, my dearest Bullinger, besides the fact that not all will hear these your reasons, how prudently and piously that can be said, you see best, if you weigh the matter diligently. For we must do our duty, obey the divine calling, which certainly in my judgment is this, by which through pious magistrates pastors and teachers are called by God to a holy synod and Christian colloquy for the salvation of the church, then with hope placed in the Lord the outcome of the whole matter is to be committed and commended to the Lord. What? Now if it is also permitted to use human conjectures and reasons, greater at this time than ever is the hope to be conceived that in this colloquy many controversies and especially about the sacramentary matter may be settled; for among you there are now in the present many more learned men and of great authority with all than perhaps there ever were or at least will be hereafter, and among others, whom you call adversaries, there are some and indeed principal ones who follow our opinion, I mean Philipp and some others. Philipp, although he is timid so that he often does what he does not approve (so I hear), I do not doubt, however, if he sees you in the same colloquy and is urged by you, that he will with all his might strive that the truth of the cause may have its place. How great his authority is among the Germans, we all know; with Philipp dead, certainly so much good (I speak according to man) cannot be expected.</p>
      <p>There are indeed very many others who, although they do not hold the matter so well, are not far from the truth, and since they are modest and lovers of truth, they can easily be drawn to your opinion when they hear you in person. For who does not know that the very presence of the most illustrious men is of great value and urgency. Especially now it will happen if you use some form of speaking which both expresses and retains the truth of the matter and does not offend the weakness of their ears, which in my judgment is not to be neglected, where there is some hope of settling the whole controversy and reconciling peace among all churches, provided always that such expressions are abstained from which might provide some material for confirming idolatry. For what is not to be attempted and done for the salvation of the churches, provided it does not conflict with the word of God. There are indeed (I confess) very many who are somewhat furious, somewhat rabid and they are generally unlearned; but they will be compelled by God with the truth triumphing to be silent and to keep themselves in order.</p>
      <p>But if these things cannot be obtained by God not willing because of our sins, at least wisdom will be justified by her children, and therefore your coming will in no way have been useless. I write most modestly, candidly and simply, most illustrious Bullinger, I see no glory to God or utility to the churches or praise to you arising from this your refusal of the most holy colloquy. Thus all friends and learned men here judge, as many as I have heard.</p>
      <p>You are (as it is said) in your own matter; also give something to the judgment of your friends.</p>
      <p>Now this is asked of you, as much as it can be done, to show all that you are and will be most ready for any friendly colloquy with other pastors of the German churches for the salvation of the church of Christ, whenever you are summoned, and that you will by no means and never, if it is required of you, deny your effort to pious princes or magistrates for building and uniting the churches. Now I judge it superfluous to respond to some of your reasons in the letters to Mr. Sulcer; for I do not dispute with you here, most excellent father, but only... I wanted to explain most simply what I have heard here and what I think about this matter and to lay it all in the bosom of a father as a son. May the Lord Jesus, who is always present with his church, persuade you and others, whose interest it is to consult for the churches almost torn apart, by his holy spirit what is to be done for the union and salvation of the churches. Here there is nothing new, as far as I know, except that we all by God's benefit are well.</p>
      <p>Farewell then and prosper, and may the Lord keep you safe for a long time for the benefit of the church. Greet... the most honorable sons-in-law, Mr. Gwalther, Gesner and other pious and learned brothers. Mr. Marbach, having been greeted by me in your name, in turn wishes you much health. Strasbourg, March 8, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Hieronymus Zanchus.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished and incomparable pastor of the church of Zürich, Heinrich Bullinger, most revered father. Zürich.</p>
