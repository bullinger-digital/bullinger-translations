      <p>Greetings. By the grace of God, we are doing well here, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Would that you were also in good health! You undoubtedly exacerbate that headache of yours, which recurs from time to time, more and more with your excessive and continuous studies, to which are also added more frequent sermons than your age can sustain. It is necessary for you to take care of your health, to preserve yourself for your own sake and for ours to enjoy.</p>
      <p>Here are the latest news with us: The King of France, Francis, has written to our Confederates; he truly desires the friendship established with our ancestors to be firm and valid, and he promises his support and services generously.</p>
      <p>He extends his mission to this envoy and commends him to our people. This is the summary of the letter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the renewal of the alliance, nothing has been officially declared yet; these are just preludes. We submit to our people, since this alliance still lasts for five years, that nothing should be done rashly in the meantime, but we should wait; for it is not yet clear what can be expected from the new king. We believe that this enthusiasm should be curbed with these and similar considerations.</p>
      <p>There are those who assert that the supreme power will be in the hands of the King of Navarre, whom they believe is not so ill-disposed towards our religion. It was reported here that the King of Navarre, when he hurried to the court upon hearing the news of the king's health, fell from his horse and broke his leg, and that the Duke of Savoy is not in good health; however, I would not say this for certain. Those who come from Milan among us report that ten companies of infantry from Piedmont, after arriving in Milan and hearing the news of the king's death, were detained and sent back to those parts.</p>
      <p>Recently in Milan, a certain citizen, a saddler, was burned in the name of religion, and I hear that hardly a week passes without some cruel example being made against the pious. There is a very persistent rumor about the death of the pope.</p>
      <p>Those who want to believe this say that Cardinal Medici, when he was on his way to Como to initiate a new bishop and had already progressed as far as Milan, was recalled from the road for this reason and, changing his course, hastened to Rome on swift horses. However, there are those who say that it was spread among the people by doctors that he was in a state of hopeless health, and from this the rumor of his death arose, which I would also believe to be the last, and it may be that the cardinal hurried to Rome to prevent his death. Yesterday, when I was dining out, Consul Tscharner told us a strange and new story, which I will briefly relate here: A merchant from Nuremberg comes from Italy, well known to the mayor and our people, a man to whom faith and truth can be entrusted. With him is another from Augsburg, a factor of the Welser family.</p>
      <p>They say that while they were in Padua for their business, the following story occurred: In front of Padua, there were some houses and barns along with a chapel, which they intended to close due to the current war cries.</p>
      <p>But at the chapel, there was a beautiful image of Mary. To this, a cripple on crutches crawled from time to time, lamented his plight before the image, whereupon the image supposedly answered him, saying it would help him; but he should proclaim and praise the proven goodness in the city. Thereupon he was healed, left his crutches by the image, ran into the city, told everything about this image at length, whereupon a large number of people from the city ran to the image, bringing their sick, who also received help there. The influx increased so much in a short time that those in the city had to worry about the crowd and therefore decided to move the chapel, which was also done. They took the image and the entire piece of the wall out with instruments, whole and uninjured, and built a new chapel a large German mile from the city of Padua in a wide, large field, where they placed the image with the piece of wall in the same manner and measure as it stood before. When the chapel was dedicated, many thousands from the city and surrounding areas came there on horseback and on foot. Among them was this merchant from Nuremberg, who saw with his own eyes many lame and crippled and otherwise afflicted people become straight and healthy before the image, through which he received a shock and came somewhat into doubt about religion.</p>
      <p>But when he told all this at length to the other, his companion, and also asked how it was going, he was further informed by him how the devil, by God's permission, brings about such things; for it is also foretold by the Holy Spirit that the Antichrist will come with wonders and signs and so powerfully that, if it were possible, even the elect would be led into error; he should not let himself be deceived by this, through which he was strengthened again, and the next morning, to please his companion, he rode back there.</p>
      <p>They found about 6000 people by the image, and saw the same signs as the previous day. Within 6 weeks, the priests collected about twelve thousand ducats.</p>
      <p>I thought it necessary to inform you of these things; for they are (if they are true) among those that preceded the pope's death. However, I do not doubt that you have collected more of such things for your use; for I remember hearing similar things from you at some time. But if you would share something like this with me, I would consider it a great favor and would faithfully send it back to you, copied, through reliable people. Farewell, most illustrious man and reverend father in Christ, with all your people, for as long and as happily as possible. Give my regards to the most illustrious men, Mr. Rodolph Gwalther, Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Lavater, and my other patrons. All of ours send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Chur, in the year 1559, the day before the calends of August. As I was about to seal the letters, some merchants from Augsburg, who are traveling to Italy, came to us, saying that the Scots have expelled the mass-priests and have destroyed and leveled many monasteries. They affirm this for certain; what is true, we are eager to hear from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>When I opened your letters, our bazio fell out, from where I do not know; it may pertain to the letters of either Salicis or his son, which I do not know; let me know to whom it belongs. Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant head of the church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
