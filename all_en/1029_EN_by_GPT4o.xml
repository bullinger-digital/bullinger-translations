      <p>S. P. Greetings in Christ Jesus our Savior. Indeed, I would have written to you earlier, most kind and learned Bullinger, if either a worthy way had been offered to me or if I had not known you to be more occupied than to whom I would think it necessary to add more business with my trifles. However, when the magnitude of your benefits to me and my Claudians came to mind, and because at this time it was permissible to use wisdom with audacity, I did not think it should be omitted that I should finally converse with you from Gaul through letters and provide evidence of a grateful and mindful spirit to you. What the state of my affairs has been since the time I departed from you, the authors of my salvation (for so I can and ought to rightly call you), I think you have already partly known from the letters sent to you from Augsburg and to Gesner, to whom our letters have been more frequent.</p>
      <p>Therefore, having left Louvain the previous year because the elder son of Fugger and Maecenas was expected there from Italy, I went directly to Paris with two Claudians and Schleicher, their nephew. Here we have now spent more or less eleven months. What the fame and power of this city are, I do not think it is of this purpose to recount to you, since you can better learn these things from domestic and familiar sources. Regarding the course of our studies (since we have managed the economy and private way of living so far), I do not have much to write to you, and indeed, Gesner, an old host, will explain to you; for I have written what outcome and end of my affairs I foresee for myself. Whatever it may be, it certainly cannot be worse than if I were established in some college and had to either simulate religion or could not confess Christ. Therefore, as the matter demands, I would rather choose a life of poverty, but joined with piety and honesty, than to be thrust into some school and allow that yoke to be imposed on me, and yet everything is to be expected from the generosity of Maecenas, etc. But let us leave these things to divine providence.</p>
      <p>You have the explanation of past affairs and what course of our life I foresee for the future. I have written these things to you especially because I understand how much my and my people's safety has always been a concern for you.</p>
      <p>I hardly have anything new to write to you; however, so that I would not send nothing to you besides the mention of our affairs, I also thought to write to you things that, though obliterated by the passage of time, lack the grace of novelty.</p>
      <p>In these recent past days, envoys were sent by Ferdinand from Germany and from Spain, his sons, also from Scotland, to lift up our king's son Charles Maximilian, as they say, from the font. I was not present at this; but I understand from our Germans that such expenses were lavished here as are scarcely to be mentioned.</p>
      <p>Thanks were given to the envoys, and they were honorably dismissed, accompanied by some nobles, not without royal gifts. I pray and wish for that friendship of the King of France to be happy. Today, which is the 28th of this month, there is a constant rumor that the King of France will enter Rouen with great pomp and royal manner. There are those who say that such a multitude of English has gathered there as has scarcely been seen elsewhere in France, both because they have long been prohibited from the kingdom of France and also because that city is not so far from the sea. I could not attend this triumph because of the nature of my condition and the difficulty of the burden I bear; otherwise, I would have written to you about each detail. Sad and complaint-filled letters are now daily brought from our Germans from Brabant, about the inquisition, which they call Spanish, which is said to have already been promulgated in Holland and Flanders. It is known that noble and men of principal dignity of those parts have already been subjected to punishment, and everything in the whole of Brabant, especially the court of Antwerp, is tending towards sedition, where we now hear that some cohorts of soldiers are being maintained at public expense by the senate. Such great disturbances have been stirred up as scarcely anywhere else, and this because of the frequency of English merchants and Germans, who oppose that edict. The chief consul, struck with fear, keeps himself at home perpetually, nor are there lacking those who incite the people to sedition, whether they are moved by love of Christ or by the ample hope of plunder. May God, the best and greatest, deign to assist the endangered church and to increase your constancy and greatness of spirit, so that a place and refuge may perpetually be granted to the faithful of Christ with you, where they may safely recognize and profess the Savior without danger to life. I know, my Bullinger, that I will not bring you joyful news, who with such zeal feed, protect, and defend the flock of Christ. Yet, the magnitude of the pain and the zeal for the endangered church, which I know is so much a concern for you that nothing exists in this life that you would not place after love for it, compels me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is not necessary to commend it to you or the brothers. I only ask that you judge me, whom you once began to love, not unworthy of your perpetual love and benevolence, not because any of our virtue deserves the favor of such a great man, but because we know that this is proper and almost hereditary to your humanity. All my Claudians greet you. Please convey my greetings to your wife, the most honorable matron, with the brothers Pellican, Theodor, and Walter, and the whole most pious family. When you wish to send any letters to me, you will give that task to our Gesner; for he knows about our place and lodging, etc. Farewell in Christ, most learned Bullinger and ornament of all Europe, etc. Hastily, as you see, from Paris, September 28, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours devotedly, Johannes Kielmann, tutor of the Peutinger family.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the Zurichers, lord and patron most to be revered.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
