      <p>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>We indeed wish, most esteemed brothers in the Lord, that all of us who have been reborn in Christ may so unite in Him that we may perpetually feel the same. But since this is the nature of our condition, that as long as we are here, we wish for this rather than achieve it, and few are those who see rightly, few who prefer to believe others rather than themselves, those who bring the best men into counsel to judge more serious controversies seem to us to do very well. This matter has led us, when at this time it happened that we disagreed with our brothers and dearest fellow ministers of the Bernese church, to think it worthwhile to call upon you especially, whose singular piety and learning are commended by all the saints, as honorary arbitrators to resolve this not indeed contention (for may all hostile discord be far from us!) but disagreement of judgments. The whole matter is as follows.</p>
      <p>Ever since the restoration of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ to us, this has been the political custom in all our churches, introduced and confirmed by the authority of synods, that when the church was divided into certain classes, and each class again into other dioceses, the ministers of each diocese would meet every week on a certain prescribed day in the morning and in a public place, and in these meetings, after solemn prayers, a book of scripture would be expounded by each in turn, then compared, where possible, with the Hebrew truth, Greek and other interpretations, and each would inquire or bring forth what seemed to him or what he wished to inquire about or interpret regarding that place of scripture (even if he did not perform the ministry). Finally, after the matter was decided by the unanimous counsel of the brothers and the authority of the dean, inquiry would be made among the ministers of the word about the doctrine and morals of the one who had spoken that day, about the cause of the poor, and other matters pertaining to the church, and finally, after giving thanks, the council would be dissolved.</p>
      <p>However, just as in other classes only the ministers would usually meet, so in this our Lausanne academy, into which, as into a certain harbor, besides those who are supported by the benevolence of the most magnificent Princes, many learned and pious men have also fled to avoid the storm in Gaul, there were never lacking those who would either learn or say something serious and useful in this assembly. This custom used to be observed by us, and so religiously that we can solemnly testify to you in the Lord that hardly any other matter brought greater benefit to our churches. Therefore, while we were contemplating nothing else but to watch over the flock committed to us, behold, an edict from our most magnificent Princes is brought to us, by which we are prohibited from meeting more than four times a year, unless something arises that needs to be reported out of order. Nor is there any reason why we can complain about the best Princes: for it is clear from the very words of the edict that our Bernese brothers advised all this. Therefore, if there is any fault, they themselves must bear it rather than the best and most pious Princes, who, although they perhaps received something false about us, nevertheless wished to decide nothing without consulting the brothers.</p>
      <p>They seem to have been driven to advise this for two reasons: one, to free the brothers who live in the countryside from the inconvenience of coming to the city, the other, because these colloquies have departed much from their original purpose and have given occasion to many dissensions. We responded briefly to both, though late, but through the fault of those who thought we should be condemned without a hearing. First, in a matter that was never troublesome to anyone, but rather very pleasant to all, what inconveniences can we imagine? None of ours (unless perhaps it was done secretly) complained or should have complained about the inconvenience of the journey, since no one was ever forced unwillingly, and this whole matter was one of duty and will: it is certainly clear that it was very pleasing to most, as a large part of the classes complained to the senate about this advice. We deny that anything was changed by us in the order and form of the colloquies themselves. As for the dissensions, although we would gladly not allow this wound of our church, which seems to have been healed, to be reopened, we think it necessary to explain the whole matter to you briefly.</p>
      <p>There was a certain Zebedee here, the successor of Coelius Secundus in teaching the scholars of our most magnificent Princes. He, seized either by envy, ambition, or some other disease of the mind, began to criticize the sermons of Pierre Viret and even some of his books and to accuse him of Lutheranism: finally, lest he omit any scandal, he began to interpret almost everything said in the colloquies sophistically and calumniously. This matter, as it was troublesome to all (unless someone secretly favored him), so it stirred up various disturbances here, since this hypocrite, although he was publicly answered, so that he openly confessed himself satisfied, nevertheless made no end of calumniating. What more? The case was heard at Bern, what was done there, and what all good men judged about the innocence of Pierre Viret, we prefer you to understand from the Bernese brothers themselves rather than explain in these letters, lest we seem to favor ourselves.</p>
      <p>Now see, we ask, should these evils be attributed to the colloquies themselves or rather to the turbulent nature of a wicked man?</p>
      <p>But if it pleases to transfer the blame, come, let the use of sermons also be abolished, let the books written most Christianly and eloquently about the ministry of the word and the sacraments be burned, since he has calumniated all these things. But the comparison is unjust, since the use of sermons must necessarily be retained. We indeed admit this, but we also add, having experienced it in reality: this custom of colloquy, (although not entirely necessary in all churches) is nevertheless so convenient and useful to ours that it cannot be abolished or changed without significant detriment. Then indeed, by what reasoning, when, if there is any fault in this matter, it belongs to our class alone, should the punishment reach the innocent? Is it fair that common benefits be inhibited because of the judged fault of one man?</p>
      <p>But enough has been said about these things. Therefore, we move on to another matter that certainly offends us not a little. For while we cannot but approve the Christian action of our most pious Princes in consulting the brothers, ministers of the word of God, we also say that, even if we grant that whatever the brothers advised was fair, it was nevertheless done as a very bad example, that, when it was a matter of a custom established by the authority of the whole church, they alone dared to give advice about changing it without consulting anyone. We say this cannot be done rightly by them, and even if we admit that they are free from all ambition, we cannot allow this very bad example to be introduced into the church. We rejoice that they watch over the peace and concord of our classes, and indeed we know they must do so, since they are closest to our most magnificent Princes. But we regret that under this pretext they dared to advise a change in the polity of churches, which most of them have not even seen, so that, having seized this example, henceforth any Bernese ministers may finally fix and unfix synodal decrees with their advice. If this is to happen, what will be the face of the church? But certainly, our Lord did not in vain distinguish the power of kings and princes from the office of ministers, as the miserable tyranny of the Roman church proves.</p>
      <p>However, let it be far from us to accuse the brothers of this crime, from which we are certainly persuaded they are alien. But in turn, we ask that it be granted to us that we could not have ignored these things without great crime.</p>
      <p>And these indeed are the matters, dearest brothers, of which we wished to inform you, not out of any ill will towards our brothers (we pray that Christ may be propitious to us), but out of zeal for the peace and tranquility of the churches, which, as it can never be as great as it should be, so it will be none at all unless all agree in doctrine, and the ministers of the word render an account of both their morals and doctrine. For this was the chief cause of calling these assemblies, to say nothing of how much this kind of colloquy serves to exercise those who are being trained for the ministry, and finally how much benefit this comparison of opinions brings to the whole church, while each contributes his own symbol, and the diligence, industry, eloquence, and piety of each can be easily understood by all.</p>
      <p>This is therefore our opinion on these matters, which, although we have fully explained to the Bernese brothers, we could never persuade them to change their opinion. However, another edict was written according to another of their suggestions, indeed a little less harsh, since weekly colloquies have been restored to us, but nevertheless written in a form which we cannot sufficiently approve, and indeed more harsh in that earlier one, because they thought it should be forbidden to us to seriously advise, let alone execute, what no one, as it seems to us, ought or can do with the polity of the church intact.</p>
      <p>Moreover, so that you may understand all these things more clearly, we send you a copy of both edicts, faithfully translated into Latin, along with the mandates which Pierre Viret presented in the name of all of us before them, and also the letters which we thought should be written to them about this matter. Although we do not doubt that the affairs of your church are greater than that you can have leisure to look into foreign matters, we nevertheless trust that you will never consider those things that pertain to the churches of Christ as foreign to you. Therefore, we beseech you, best brothers, that having understood our cause, if it seems to you to be just and honorable, you may assist us with your authority with our [brothers] in Bern, so that the original form of the colloquies may be restored to us, or certainly another which seems to agree more with the opinion of Paul writing about this matter to the Corinthians: if not, do not hesitate to teach us all those things in which you judge us to err. For what we have written, we have written so that, if we are convinced by reasons, we may most willingly change our opinion. May our Lord Jesus keep you safe, and continue to strengthen you with His holy spirit as He has begun. From the general assembly of our whole class at Vevey, on the 27th of November, 1549.</p>
