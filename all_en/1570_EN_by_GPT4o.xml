      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your two letters and understood your dedication towards me, for which I give you immense thanks and will reciprocate when the opportunity arises. I received the sessions of the Council of Trent fathers, I will read them and return them in good faith through a reliable person.</p>
      <p>But hey, I am sending you the propositions that our Mr. Borrhaus is pushing in these dangerous times; they have the scent of Osiander's doctrine. I wish to know what you think and judge about them. Our people have debated, but they have not touched upon the propositions concerning Osiander's righteousness, because they have not read his doctrine. What if a man full of doctrines continues to disturb our church? I await your opinion on this matter.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am sending the apology of the French king against the writing of the Emperor, and I am accustomed to wonder why he makes no mention of the war in Parma. Regarding recent events, we have this: Martin de Rossa has gathered soldiers in Lower Germany in the name of the Emperor. The flooding has caused great damage to the people of Brabant. In Nuremberg, 350 houses were burned, a miserable spectacle. Not far from Amberg, a church in the countryside, known for many signs and adorned with curses, was burned, and no one dared to approach to extinguish the fire; the temple was struck from heaven, and thus the Lord destroyed idolatry in that place. If only He would show His hand to the hypocrites in Trent, so they would finally stop raising their mouths to heaven.</p>
      <p>I hear a certain miracle happened in Trent, when they were singing the office of the Holy Spirit one day, an owl flew into the temple over the altar, which they caught, and it overturned the chalice on the altar. Thus, the Holy Spirit usually comes to these most holy fathers.</p>
      <p>They say the Dane has a huge army in Holstein, where he will send the soldiers is still unknown. Germany will be troubled from all sides.</p>
      <p>It is rumored that it was concluded by the Emperor's men that German bishops should be sent to Spain and Spaniards to Germany, so that better tranquility of the church might be established; but I think it is a fable. But this is certain, no bishop will dare to leave this conference without the Emperor's consent.</p>
      <p>They also say that Philipp Melanchthon was in Nuremberg, but was recalled by the prince; otherwise, the good and pious man would have perished. The preachers in Augsburg have, in a strange way, instituted the anointing of oil and established an anointing consecrated by the bishop alongside baptism; they are rascals, and whatever they have taught so far, they now show that they have never taught with a good heart.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Basel, February 19, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my gracious lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
