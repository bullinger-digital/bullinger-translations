    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas would much prefer to speak with Bullinger in person than to disturb him, who is so busy, with a letter. However, he must deliver the enclosed letter addressed to Bernardino Ochino, so that Bullinger can forward it as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Enzinas will set off for Zurich in three or four days. Then they can discuss everything in detail.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Should letters for Enzinas arrive in Zurich from Basel or other places, Bullinger should keep them. This should also be communicated to Johannes Fries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings, also to the colleagues.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I would indeed prefer to speak with you in person rather than trouble you with a letter, as you are already quite busy. However, these letters had to be sent to Bernardino, and I earnestly request that you send them with the first messenger.</p>
