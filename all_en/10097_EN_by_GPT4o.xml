      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ, most learned Heinrich.</p>
      <p>How greatly the Church of Christ is troubled by persecutions today, I call you as a witness, and just as Christ taught: "If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; for it is not possible that the servant is greater than his master" [John 15:20], so I can say. For after our most pious brother and lord Ulrich Zwingli was killed by bloodthirsty and cruel men, they would not have held back their hands from us either, had they caught us. And what troubles me more: Those who loved him while he was alive and adorned him with endless praises, now slander him after his death for the loss of a small estate or some money. If they speak against such a great man who deserved so well of his country, what then will become of us men of the lowest rank? "We have been made a spectacle to the world and to angels" [1 Cor 4:9]. Therefore, most learned Heinrich, now that I am released from my lord, I am utterly ignorant of where to turn. There are many things that have delayed me, the inclemency of the weather, poor health, and, being older than I would like, if it had seemed good to God, and since I have been stripped of all my possessions and have few coins left, through Christ and through the communion of the Holy Spirit, I earnestly ask you to help me, poor wretch, with advice and assistance, so that I may be placed in some evangelical function, where I may have something to live on, and as you have helped many, do not leave me completely desolate, I implore you by our common God. Wolfgang will tell you the rest.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Aarau, 25th of February, in the year of restored salvation 32.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Muntprat, formerly preacher in Hitzkirch.</p>
      <p>To the man of distinguished piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, evangelist of the church in Zurich, most dear brother and lord.</p>
