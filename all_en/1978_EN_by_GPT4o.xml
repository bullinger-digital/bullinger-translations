      <p>S. D. P. I received your most kind letters and it troubled me that the letters of Mr. Vergerius made you anxious about the handwritten booklet and the gold coin, which (as I immediately informed him, even if the letters have not been delivered) I received long ago and handed over to the printer. I have received everything you have sent me so far, and I am grateful that such a great man, occupied with more serious matters, still deigns to serve your friends and lesser brothers in Christ even in the smallest matters. This makes you an example to many, both in the highest matters and in Christian gentleness. I am sending my letters to Mr. Vergerius again through another messenger to Clavenna, to satisfy him on your behalf and mine.</p>
      <p>However, a few days ago I sent a small bundle in the form of a book, in which there are 10 Responses of Mr. Vergerius to the Cardinal of Trent, which I believe have not been delivered to you. I gave it to a woman from Zurich, whose name is Dorothea Louwin by der Lowinen bim Büchsenhuß. Your kindness will ensure through a boy that, if she has not delivered it, she will deliver it. Recently, that is, yesterday, I also sent letters to your son-in-law Mr. Josias and all these things of Mr. Vergerius, not for my sake, as he troubles me with his frequent letters. But I bear everything gladly and would bear stronger things in the Christian business with my Lord strengthening me; here bearing is nothing new. Farewell well, pray to God for me also and know me as yours and yours through all ages. From Basel, the last day of August 1553.</p>
      <p>Your true Guglielmo Grataroli, physician. To the most illustrious and best pastor of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed superior. To Zurich.</p>
