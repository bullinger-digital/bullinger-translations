    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over the establishment of the First Basel Confession and requests a copy. Asks for news from France, especially about the unrest in Paris. In Zurich, it is suspected that France is planning new wars: Christian Schreiber, a former St. Gallen resident in royal service, tried to have a pamphlet "Oratio" printed in German against the Habsburg ruling house in Zurich, but in vain, as it was feared that the aim was the future recruitment of mercenaries. Bullinger also warns Myconius and the people of Basel against printing this pamphlet, which in the German version was softened to the extent that it seemed to be about the defense of German freedom against the Turks. Recommends the bearer and requests the forwarding of an enclosed letter to Strasbourg. Greetings from Heinrich Utinger.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I rejoice with you for having achieved such a holy concord, which we indeed have wished for, but have not yet been able to obtain. However, I hope that many churches will follow your example. For it should not be thought that this counsel was provided to you alone by the Lord. I have not yet seen the edict, about which I hear. Therefore, in your diligence and faith, ensure that I receive it with the first messenger, along with any certain news you have about the French and the turmoil in Paris.</p>
      <p>We have no certain news, except that from some conjectures we fear that the French will undertake new wars. Not many days ago, Christian Schreiber, formerly a citizen of St. Gallen but now a royal minister, was with us. He offered a certain speech, that is, a very learned but very bitter invective against the House of Austria, that is, against Charles and Ferdinand, to be printed. Suspecting, as was the case, that there was some deceit involved, we refused. For he wanted to make the minds of the people hostile to the Emperor and loyal to himself, so that he might find them more ready for an expedition at some point. Perhaps he will attempt the same with your printers. Therefore, be vigilant. The speech has been translated into our language and moderated in such a way that it seems to be about repelling the Turk and preserving German freedom.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter, a truly pious and holy man, will explain how our affairs stand.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me as you are accustomed. Send these enclosed letters to Strasbourg with the first messenger.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 12 February 1534.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Utinger wishes you well.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, chief pastor of the renowned city of Basel, my most beloved lord and brother.</p>
