      <p>Having been greeted more often by many in your name, my dearest Bullinger, I can easily gather that you send no letters to these regions in which you do not hold an honorable memory of me. For this benevolence of yours, I give you infinite thanks and pray to the Lord that He may never forget you on that day. The Spaniards are said to be numerous in Italy, and more are expected with the arrival of the Duke of Alba; but where they are going, no one has yet been able to find out. I dare to affirm this to you for certain: the Pope, the Spaniard, and the Frenchman are in excellent agreement. But where their plans are directed, who does not know it is against the kingdom of Christ? The Turk, as they say, who recently came to us in Vienna, has made a truce for a decade with the Emperor. Whether this is certain, I do not know; but I expect my son Rudolf from the Emperor any day now. He will inform us of all these matters. About these and all other things, once I am informed by him or from elsewhere, I will not hesitate to inform you.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell, and in your prayers, you will beseech the Lord to always be with me. You will also greet in my name the most illustrious and magnificent lords, the city prefects. I greet your domestic church. May the Lord bless your holy labors.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Chiavenna on the 25th of April, 1567.</p>
      <p>Hercules von Salis, yours always.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and most pious father, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
