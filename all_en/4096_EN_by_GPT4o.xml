      <p>S. Saxo, whom you recommended to me, venerable brother, has found a good and kind host in Macarius, one of our colleagues, with whom he will comfortably reside. You congratulate me on my moderate health, which you do out of your usual benevolence and fraternal love towards me. You have also performed the duty of a friend by narrating those things which, although not entirely pleasant, are nevertheless useful to know. Hotomanus had written to me the same about the response of Count Erbach.</p>
      <p>A little earlier, I had received letters from his brother Eberhard, in which he showed what he has always professed before, that he greatly desires the princes to convene to resolve the disputes. As he is a man of exceptional prudence, and entirely ours, he seems to speak not without reason. If he hopes for a good outcome, the opportunity should not be neglected.</p>
      <p>For he himself mentioned this matter, which I had not even touched upon with a word. Therefore, I wanted to advise you so that, if it seems appropriate, you may deliberate with Mr. Peter Martyr and other brothers on what should be answered. Our Beza has gone to Strasbourg, I do not know for what, or, as I more suspect, to accomplish nothing. But because an expedition of great importance, which concerns us, is being undertaken by some, and Sturmius was vehemently demanding a conversation with me or Beza, we thought something should be done so that he would not think himself despised. Now in Paris, the cruelty of the enemies of the gospel is more severe than it has been seen before. Commissioners have been ordered to go through the whole city and inquire from house to house how each person conducts themselves, whether they attend all masses on feast days. They penetrate not only into rooms but even to beds, chests, and cabinets, so that they may immediately drag to prison those with whom they find a suspect book. After examining all the furniture, they announce that the heads of families will be liable to punishment if they are found to have a Lutheran among them. Each neighbor is also strictly enjoined to diligently observe one another.</p>
      <p>If anyone neglects this duty, they will pay the penalty for negligence. Under this pretext, quite a few houses have already been plundered.</p>
      <p>Recently, however, an incident occurred that will further inflame the rage of the enemies. Fifteen noble men, or thereabouts, were dining in an inn.</p>
      <p>A commissioner rushes in: the officers burst through the windows. Because the matter was conducted tumultuously and hostilely, the foreign guests began to repel the force with drawn swords. One of the officers was killed, several were mutilated.</p>
      <p>Thus, unless God intervenes promptly, there will be no end to the shedding of blood. A far greater number of people have been thrown into chains than two years ago.</p>
      <p>Especially the most dreadful dungeons are filled with wretched people. Many are summoned repeatedly through the streets with the sound of a trumpet preceding them.</p>
      <p>The goods of the absent are seized.</p>
      <p>The faithful in Provence, attacked by private individuals with force and swords, have begun to defend themselves.</p>
      <p>So far, they have been superior with few killed, although they could all be destroyed to the last man. We have so far restrained the Normans, but it is greatly to be feared that if they are excessively oppressed, they too may rush to arms. Therefore, God must be entreated to calm these so turbulent waves by His admirable goodness and wisdom. Meanwhile, I sincerely pray that He may protect, guide, and bless you with your family and colleagues. Viretus and the others send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>In my name, you will convey many greetings to friends and brothers. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother, to be cherished by me from the heart.</p>
      <p>Geneva, October 3, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and faithful minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed brother and fellow minister.</p>
