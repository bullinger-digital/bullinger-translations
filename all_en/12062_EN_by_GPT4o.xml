    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Amerbach's letter [above No. 2011], which was especially welcome to him because Amerbach received Bullinger's writing [above No. 2009] in a well-meaning manner. Once again recommends the mutual friend [Leonhard] Hospinian, who seeks protection with Amerbach and brings a prerogative drafted by the [Zürich] council to the council [in Basel], as Amerbach had advised. [Christ] may preserve the friendship that Amerbach extends to him and take them both to himself after death.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Your letter was most welcome to me, most illustrious and esteemed sir, not so much because you responded beautifully and according to my wishes to my request, but because you took my words in good part. For that humanity of yours, I give you eternal thanks, and in return, I offer myself and all that is mine to you and yours; ready and willing to undertake whatever you impose on me.</p>
      <p>Again, I commend to you Hospinian, our mutual friend - otherwise, I know well, he is already most commendable to you - and an excellent man. For he places his greatest reliance especially on you. He brings to the most illustrious council of Basel a prerogative from our most distinguished council, as you advised.</p>
      <p>Indeed, he gladly follows the advice of good men. Moreover, it is especially pleasing to me above all else that I understand your great devotion to me. May He, who is the highest love, ensure that we, embracing each other with the most sincere affection in these lands, may finally, when we depart from here, be transferred to Him, who is the perfection and reward of Christian love. In whom I wish you to be well, most illustrious and always esteemed by me.</p>
      <p>Zürich, 18th of October, in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Heinrich</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Dr. Bonifacius Amerbach, his always esteemed lord.</p>
