    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] On October 9, when the Zurich preachers departed from Augsburg, Donauwörth was taken by the Imperial forces through the betrayal of some citizens. The two [Schmalkaldic] companies stationed there fled. No one was plundered or mistreated (unlike the troops of Emperor [Charles V.] had done in Neuburg [on the Danube]). This is probably thanks to the German soldiers of the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Emperor had set up his camp near Nördlingen, opposite the Schmalkaldic forces. On October 11, he moved with the entire army to Donauwörth, where he positioned himself on a hill not far from the city. The [Schmalkaldic forces] continuously report to the Augsburg council that their situation is good, but Haller is not so sure, as the responsible parties seem to neglect everything. Villages are being burned, and mothers wander with their children. One also comes across the corpses of starved and frozen children. The people are complaining and are close to rebelling against their authorities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Augsburg church servants are all undaunted and continuously admonish, but nothing happens. God seems to intend to punish us. In Augsburg, they expect to be overrun by the Imperial forces at any moment. They are preparing for a siege, although it is hardly conceivable that the Emperor will remain before Augsburg throughout the winter. However, an attack is to be feared. The population is brave, but the council behaves childishly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Swiss troops stationed at the Klause [Ehrenberg] have been sent to help the city of Augsburg. Bullinger will know what the [Schmalkaldic forces have written about the Swiss mercenaries] to Zurich and Bern.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] So far, [Sebastian] Lepusculus and [Hieronymus] Gunz are still in Augsburg. Gunz is learned but does not preach particularly well. Bullinger knows Lepusculus.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] A request for prayer in this worrying situation. The enemy is cunning and powerful, but God is on the side [of the Schmalkaldic forces]. May He save them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Haller can hardly study anymore. He would much rather fight. Greetings to the colleagues.</p>

      <p>S. On the very day and almost at the same hour when our brothers departed from Augsburg, namely on October 9, the Imperial forces occupied Donauwörth through the betrayal of some citizens. There were only two of our banners there, who, seeing the Emperor's troops and the betrayal of the Donauwörth council, fled for their safety. However, they did not treat them as they did in Neuburg: They plundered nothing and harmed no one. This was done only by the German soldiers of the Emperor.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Emperor with the greater part of his forces camped near Nördlingen against our army. On October 11, he also moved with the entire army to Donauwörth and, as I hear, positioned himself on a certain hill near the town. I cannot quite understand what our people are doing. They continuously write to our council that things are going well; they themselves will neglect nothing that pertains to the matter, yet in the meantime, they neglect everything! Oh good God, what misery you would see! Villages are being burned. In the fields and forests, children wander everywhere with their mothers. The corpses of children, dead from hunger and cold, are also found. The common people cry out and almost incite rebellion against the negligent authorities.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>All the ministers are undaunted. We cry out, exhort, and urge. Yet, in the meantime, nothing happens. Therefore, the hand of God heavily threatens us. We now expect at any moment to be overwhelmed by the Emperor's army unexpectedly. In short: They are preparing for a siege, although it is hard to imagine that the Emperor can remain before Augsburg, as winter is upon us. However, an attack or strong advance is feared. May God grant us grace that we are not overwhelmed in this terror! The common people are good and brave. However, the council, in my judgment and that of many others, seems to act childishly in such a serious matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Swiss Confederates at the Klause have been sent to aid our city. What has been written to Zurich and Bern, you undoubtedly know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Lepusculus and Guntius are still with us. Guntius is a learned man, but not successful in preaching; you know Lepusculus. Nothing has yet been done with them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I can write nothing more to you now than to pray to God for us with all the pious, for it is truly a worrying state. We have a cunning and powerful enemy, but a much wiser and stronger leader on our side: God the Lord. May He save His honor and graciously come to our aid through the one He has given us, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I cannot study. I would rather be there and help in the fight, so that the grudge may leave my heart. If it comes to that, I will conduct myself honorably and bravely. Whatever happens to me, let me and mine be commended to you. Given in Augsburg hastily, October 12, 1546. I wish all brothers well. Yours most devotedly, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my especially kind lord, to his hands.</p>
