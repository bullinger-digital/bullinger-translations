      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>If you wonder, most learned man and dearest brother, why I have not written for so long, I ask you to think anything else of me than that this mind is not in all respects always most observant of you. However, I lacked either leisure when a messenger was available or a messenger when leisure was available.</p>
      <p>Now, first of all, regarding your relative, know that I have diligently acted both with the governor of the Margrave in Rötteln, to whose jurisdiction the small town of Schopfheim belongs, and with some of our senators, so that he might be received. But in neither place has the matter succeeded so far.</p>
      <p>With us, the position of court clerk was vacant. Although I thought the citizens would push forward, my calculation was that Hans Züger, the steward in the German House, would become court clerk; then your brother-in-law would have been promoted to the same stewardship. Therefore, Hans Züger himself would have done the best.</p>
      <p>But another court clerk was appointed, whom we did not consider, and thus my plan failed. However, another opportunity will be given to us, I hope.</p>
      <p>I have also been informed about the solicitation of the Strasbourg senate with our senate and about your response, which you wrote to Mr. Sultzer.</p>
      <p>I would not want you to be unaware that your response was not unexpected to me, especially since it is not yet certain whether any national synod will take place, let alone what kind and where. However, I believe the matter is being handled by those who indeed wish to come together in concord, and who would not want that, but in such a way that they would not deviate even a hair's breadth not only from their opinion but not even from the carnal and most crude forms of speaking.</p>
      <p>There is a certain learned man here who recently, with great zeal (if it pleases the gods), inveighed against the Zwinglians; saying that he wonders whether they would even resist if it were demanded that one must speak corporally, carnally, indeed even bone-ly. Some are so ridiculously stubborn in their opinion, which is nothing but papist.</p>
      <p>What then prevents us from agreeing with the papists if we must agree with them? However, I fear that even among our theologians there are those who would prefer such concord to maintaining the sincerity of truth and transmitting it to the future generations of our churches.</p>
      <p>May they fare well, as they deserve.</p>
      <p>The people of Aarau are now causing me great trouble, constantly requesting that I leave that church and serve their church. May the Lord make me more certain of what He wants; for the people of Basel have been asked by the people of Bern to release me to the people of Aarau; they have plainly refused. What then should I decide in such a case, I ask, my brother, that you also communicate your advice to me soon and always keep me commended to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 17, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your brother in the Lord, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church in Zürich, his esteemed and dearest brother.</p>
