      <p>S. D. I congratulate you on returning home safely and unharmed to your family; I am sorry, however, that you could not bathe as you had planned. Yet, I see the Lord's goodness often remedies our untimely plans; while we strive forward, He pulls us back either through illnesses or other reasons, not to destroy, but to save. What if for this very reason He afflicted you with illness now, so that you would not bathe, that is, so that you would not continue to harm your health? However, when I hear that you have returned home safely, I ask you for your old duty of writing, especially about what is happening in Italy with the Council of Trent and with the Prince of Florence, and whether there are Turkish ships in the Adriatic or Tyrrhenian Sea. Above all, I wish to hear and see what was done in your past synod; for in your haste to the baths, you asked me to keep my mind in suspense until you returned. Meanwhile, we have been afflicted here by a calamity of hail; for the kind Father applies the rod to those who do not obey words. The fields and vineyards below the city have perished; those above the city by the lake are still unharmed by the Lord's mercy.</p>
      <p>May the Lord continue to protect us.</p>
      <p>You know Johannes Schleher, the one-eyed, not a bad man otherwise.</p>
      <p>He left Glarus a year and a half ago and stayed with us. Now, when he visited the baths at Pfäfers and returned to Wesen, he was captured and taken to Schwyz. Our magistrate wrote there; the response received was, "there are some who will be considered." Therefore, the treasurer Sprossius was immediately sent to assist the unfortunate man.</p>
      <p>He was warned abundantly enough; but he did not heed the warnings.</p>
      <p>The treasurer has not yet returned; we do not know, therefore, what is happening or what has happened. Many predict bad outcomes; I expect the worst from the [Five Cantons]. - The king's envoy Coignetius writes that the pious have presented a supplication and confession to the King of France; the king's principal advisors have therefore dealt with the Parisian parliament for 8 or 10 days on the matter of religion; he does not know, however, what has been decreed, but knows that there were free speeches; in the court of Navarre and Condé, the gospel is preached freely and openly in Paris; Savoy was forced to make peace with the Agronians, who retain their full religion. - When Tobias Egli traveled up to you, he is said to have distributed some booklets in Wesen, for which some almost lost their lives, and it has been reported to those of Schwyz that Egli traveled up to the Grisons, and it is to be feared that they will also make a case against him as they did against Schleher. Therefore, warn him in time, if he wants to come down, that he tells no one about it and seeks another route than through Schwyz.</p>
      <p>The Frauenfeld matter would be added to it; one cannot be too careful there; for these men rage against us. May the Lord protect us.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 11, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Philipp, the consuls, Pontasella, and other acquaintances.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, his esteemed and dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
