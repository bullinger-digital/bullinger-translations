    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] [Johannes] von Ulm will act according to Blarer's advice. However, Blarer should also show himself helpful, as Johannes is really making a good deal with the purchase [of the books offered by Johannes Fries]. Blarer's plan seems suitable. Bullinger only fears that someone else might preempt him in the purchase.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Regula [Mayer] complains about [Konrad] Hofherr and believes that he is deceiving her. Bullinger no longer wants to take up the matter. So much for Blarer's first letter [No. 2716, 2-38].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger did not really accuse Blarer of negligence [in the transmission of news]! But it is true that he always longs [for Blarer's letters] because of the frightening circumstances, if only because he hopes for a good outcome of the situation. So if Blarer does not write for a long time, Bullinger becomes nervous. But Blarer is doing it right. He should just continue like this. In the meantime, he [Bullinger's] next letter [will not have been received]; also Bibliander's letter, namely through the Zurich messenger [Heinrich Tischmacher] sent to St. Gallen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer should help, advise, write as much as he can! If only Ulm does not leave the [Schmalkaldic] League! But if the devil makes the city do so, one must not separate from it despite everything, for it would only get worse! If one is lulled to sleep by the song of the sirens, disaster will already break in! One should not believe the news of the death of the Emperor [Charles V.]! It is only a ruse to make [the Schmalkaldic League] negligent. The Emperor is as dead as the cat in Aesop's fable! He is the "king experienced in deceit" [Dan 8, 23], the true son of the Antichrist! One must not trust him at all!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Enclosed [Georg] Frölich's letter [to Blarer], which Bullinger returns with thanks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] If Duke Ulrich of Württemberg wanted it, a victory would already be half certain. But if he lets himself be beguiled by the Emperor, it would happen to the great detriment of the cities! The protecting God (who was already such when Württemberg was still under Ferdinand I.) still lives!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] On Wednesday [December 15], the Small and the Great Council decided by majority that the military officers should immediately prepare the artillery and the wagons with artillery. It was also decided to send deputies from house to house to check that everyone keeps their armor and weapons ready. Those who are not ready should make up for it by the next inspection, otherwise they must expect a penalty. Furthermore, everyone should equip themselves appropriately with money, clothes, and shoes. As soon as the situation requires, captains, banner lords, and ensigns will be called up, while the others, young and old, prepare themselves. Everyone agreed with these measures. May God grant grace!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings to [Thomas] Blarer and [Konrad Zwick].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Hans von Ulm will take the matter in hand, as you advised. You should also do your best in this, for he truly gains much from the purchase, and he is exceedingly well-to-do. I only fear that the long delay might cause someone else to slip into the purchase.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding Curio, the good Regula complains bitterly. She says she is being deceived by Curio, etc. I do not wish to burden myself further with this matter. So much for your first letter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have not really accused you of negligence, as you understood and calculated. I am very troubled! And such terrible things are said that I am anxious, only wishing to see the matter resolved well. When you do not write for so long, I become somewhat impatient. But you are doing enough. Continue as you are! I suppose you have now received another letter; also, Buchman's letter, delivered to you by our messenger who ran through St. Gallen to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Help, advise, write, do what you can; only that Ulm does not separate from the League! But if the devil deceives them, do not separate from them. Truly, you will have it worse later and will have to endure more costs! If you let yourself be lulled to sleep by the song of the sirens, you will be quickly awakened to your ruin. Do not believe the talk of the Emperor's death! It is a trick and deceit, only to make you negligent, so that you do not resist anywhere! He is as dead as the cat in Aesop. The king is experienced in propositions and enigmas, the true son of the great Antichrist. If he deceives you, he does not deceive you!</p>

      <p>Here I send you Laeti's letter with thanks.</p>

      <p>If Duke Ulrich wants it, the matter is half won. If he lets himself be deceived, it is a great harm to the cities. But he still lives, who protected us when Württemberg was still under Ferdinand.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>On Wednesday, the council decided to order the military officers to prepare the artillery and wagons, as if one wanted to march out tomorrow; the people appointed for this purpose go from house to house in the city and country, inspecting armor and weapons; whoever is not ready, should prepare in the following days, and when one returns, be ready or expect punishment and disgrace from my lords; that everyone is properly equipped with money, clothes, and shoes; as soon as the necessity demands, captains, banner lords, and ensigns will be taken and everyone in between, young and old, be ready. And by the grace of God, everyone is willing and united. May God grant us all his grace!</p>

      <p>Greet my dear brother and cousin, my gracious lords, and assure you of our constant loyalty and true love. December 18, 1546. Bullinger.</p>
