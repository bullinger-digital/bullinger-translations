    <p xml:id="regest1">Renato was pleased with Bullinger's letter [No. 2245] and values the open exchange about the Lord's Supper (coena). - He also assigns a place to faith in the celebration of the Lord's Supper, especially since it prompts the believers to the meal (coena). However, the communion with the body and blood of Christ is already effected long before the Lord's Supper through faith. Without faith, no one would partake of the bread and wine together with others. Hence the admonition: "Let each one examine himself" [1 Corinthians 11:28]. For if one comes to the meal without or with diminished faith, one would partake unworthily to one's own detriment. Essentially, faith precedes the religious ceremony (libatio). Without faith, no one understands what it means to receive the body and blood of Christ. Therefore, the remembrance of the body and blood of Christ should not be confused with their reception, especially since this has already taken place beforehand (namely through faith). - Bullinger should not think that Renato wants to teach something new. Rather, he fears expressing claims without scriptural testimony: A trick of the devil to impair Christian piety. "In the meal," says Bullinger, "signs (signa), symbols (symbola), and word (verbum) are presented simultaneously, so that the soul of the Christian can only be nourished." And so it is indeed. But not only the sight of bread and wine, but also participation in pious assemblies, prayer, preaching, thanksgiving, all this nourishes faith. If Bullinger means this by the feeding on the body and blood of Christ, then he must be aware that this [experience] is by no means limited to the Lord's Supper. - Does Bullinger really not believe that on Christ's command the meal (epulum) was connected with the ceremony (libatio) [of the Lord's Supper]? Paul seems to have emphasized in connection with the meal abused by the Corinthians that [what he communicated to them], he had received from the Lord. And from whom could one better learn the appropriate order of the Lord's Supper than from the apostles? Moreover, if one believes old testimonies, even up to the time of Tertullian, the meal was said to have been connected with the ceremony. Furthermore, consider that not even Paul abolished the meal when it was abused by the Corinthians. Rather, he established an order for it. Finally, it would be absurd, just considering the word "meal," to want to limit it to a tasting (degustatio) of bread and wine. - Renato does not want to be a nuisance to Bullinger. If he writes about the meal again, it is because in the religious realm, the truth only comes to light properly through repeated treatment of a matter. - In Trent, some cardinals, bishops, and abbots are said to be staying without apparent reason. - The evangelical [imperial] free cities of Germany are said to be afflicted by war. Bullinger should report on this and express his opinion. - Greetings. - [P.S.:] The pastor of Chiavenna, Agostino Mainardi, thanks for the sent [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”] and sends greetings, especially to [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Camillus Renatus to Heinrich Bullinger, greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letter, dearest Bullinger, was most delightful to me, in which you expressed that you were very pleased that we freely shared our opinion on the Lord's Supper, and what you yourself thought in contrast. We certainly retain the freedom of speech, especially in this kind of matter, but without recklessness, as we believe. While we do not entirely reject your opinion, we think it should be considered. We certainly do not exclude faith from the Supper; indeed, it is undoubtedly by faith that we are driven to partake. But that faith is not one by which we are to take the body or blood of Christ anew beyond the bread and wine of remembrance, but one which we have long possessed before we come to the Supper. For unless we were certain and convinced that we belong to the fellowship and communion of the body and blood of Christ, we would never truly partake of the bread and wine with others. For it is said: "Let each one examine himself," etc. Therefore, whoever approaches with no or diminished faith, as they approach unworthily, so they partake to their own great detriment. Faith precedes that spiritual reception of the body and blood, and this precedes the offering of bread and wine. This offering, if we consider the matter in order, follows that reception; it is the fruit of faith. Neither can the body and blood of Christ be properly or significantly understood to be received when the bread and wine are taken from the minister's hands at the table, just as the body is not broken when the bread is broken for me, but it is already long since broken and believed. Nor is it properly said, in my judgment, that to recall the body and blood is the same as to receive them. For what is recalled and commemorated is not truly received at that time, but was received some time before. If we neglect the propriety of things or speech in the handling of divine matters, I do not see how it can be permissible. However, do not suspect that I wish to bring anything new to this matter, but rather fear that some opinion might creep into the minds of the people in the future by the cunning of Satan, which we still lament, that is not supported by any place in Scripture and thus hinders the progress of Christian piety. We do not attain truth by human conjecture, but by the sure oracle of Christ. Indeed, there is no place left for error or even Antichrist if simplicity is retained. "In the Supper," you say, "both the signs and the symbols and the word of God are presented, so that the soul of the Christian cannot but be nourished." We certainly admit this; for we feel that the sight of the bread and wine, the sanctity of the assembly, prayer, preaching, and thanksgiving nourish faith, confirm trust, inflame the spirit, and grow in the knowledge of the Lord. If you consider this to be feeding on or receiving the body and blood of Christ, you are speaking of the common aspects of the Supper, not the unique ones. For the same often happens while we pray alone, attend a sermon, meditate, read, or converse together about faith, the death, and life of Christ. But we seek what is unique to the Supper, not those common things with others. I would like you to consider this more diligently, if it is worthy, and more accurately.</p>
      <p>Regarding the meal, I wish to know from you: do you believe it should be joined to the offering according to Christ's prescription? Paul, unless I am mistaken, in 1 Corinthians 11, speaking of the corruption of the meal, seems to affirm that he received it from Christ.</p>
      <p>Then, from whom should the form of the Christian Supper be more rightly taken than from the practice of the apostles? The authority of Scripture must certainly be retained.</p>
      <p>Finally, if there is any faith in the examples of the ancient fathers, we read that the meal was joined to the offering even up to the times of Tertullian, nor did Paul separate the meal from the Lord's Supper because the Corinthians had corrupted it, but he prescribed a certain order and manner for the Christian meal. The corruption should be removed, the thing itself retained. And it would be inappropriate to deprive the name of the Supper of its proper meaning. For a Supper is not made by the mere tasting of bread and wine; you must add the rest to truly have a Supper. But these are lighter matters; those are more serious in my judgment.</p>
      <p>If I seem perhaps bothersome to you by writing these things, I ask you to forgive me, most gentle Bullinger. We are compelled by religious zeal to write these things more often and with more words, so that by frequent consideration and handling of matters, the face of truth may be more clearly seen by us and our speech purer. If this is a fault, forgive it; if not, as it is for your benefit, write to us very often about the same matter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Council of Trent, as I hear, some cardinals, bishops, and monks are still staying in Trent; with what mind or purpose, it is uncertain.</p>
      <p>Here, it is said that the free cities of Germany, which are very devoted to the gospel of Christ, are afflicted by war. If this is so and what you think will come of it, it would be most pleasing if you would write to me in more words. Meanwhile, we will pray to God to be with us in the name of Christ Jesus and to turn all things for the best. The brothers greet you in the Lord and the church of Zurich. Farewell and love us, as you do, and that in the Lord. November 2, 1545. In Chiavenna, Agostino Mainardi of Piedmont, minister of the church of Chiavenna, a man truly of no small knowledge and piety, sends you many greetings and gives great thanks for the book you sent him, which was very pleasing to him, and he will certainly repay you if he thinks he can be of any service to you. He asks you to greet Pellikan and the others in his name. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man in the best letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most upright teacher of the gospel. In Zurich.</p>
