      <p>Kaspar Megander and Heinrich Bullinger to their Stumpf.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>We beseech your kindness, most learned Stumpf, to take up the cause of Finsler and to obtain from the brothers of the chapter through our prayers, that they may grant him his small poverty, with the bond of law dissolved. He promised us at the last synod to comply with whatever we instructed from you. Since we know the poor man is afflicted by poverty and need, we have not hesitated to write to you, beseeching that you grant willingly what he has not been able to take from you. We hope, however, that our prayers will prevail with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 15th of November, in the year 1541.</p>
