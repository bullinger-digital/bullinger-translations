      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, honorable father, both the ones you wrote on the 12th of this month and those on the 17th of the same, and I give you my greatest thanks for what you sent. I shared them with Mr. Steiger and others, as you instructed, who also thank you and send their regards. I also understood from the latter that you received what I wrote about the people from the lower forest regions. Meanwhile, they responded to us very amicably and humbly. The main point is: they have kept the peace and cannot understand that anyone would be willing or intend to disturb the peace and the country's tranquility; however, some have complained that the pass to St. Beatenberg was blocked for them, yet they have not been able to gather the entire community at this time; but this will happen shortly; then they will respond more extensively to their writings. There has also been no response from the other Confederates. In the meantime, they have walled up St. Beatenberg and filled it with large stones. Meanwhile, while these things are happening, the Lord has finally visited me privately (lest my house be perpetually free from that common calamity, which has lasted so long), and not in just one place; for here my five-year-old daughter, stricken with the plague, died, and on almost the same day in Lausanne, another ten-year-old, who was staying there with her sister, my brother-in-law Blasius's wife, similarly passed away. To these calamities, it is also added that Blasius's house was closed by the magistrate of Lausanne according to the impious custom of that people, and the whole family was disturbed, so that I now expect him to come here with his wife, where we will jointly await the Lord's good will towards us, what he will decide for us further. Pray to the Lord for us, that he may protect and preserve us. Your Bullinger from Bruges has long been received and summoned here; we are surprised, however, that he has not come in the end. Perhaps he is delaying because our college is also infected with the plague, and it might be better for him not to hurry. Clinger has a place at Aretia's table, and I hope that he will be provided for here. As for why our senate has not written to your senate about those disturbances in the lower forest regions, I know it was not done out of contempt; they wanted to wait for their response first, and the matter was tumultuous. However, I believe they will write in these days; for they have been reminded of this.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I wish health to all of yours. Our people greet you, especially Steiger and the Zehenders. The wife of the younger Ludwig Zehender, whom he married a year ago, is at this hour almost at the point of death, so that we have abandoned all hope of life. May the Lord be gracious to her!</p>
      <p>Bern, the last day of October 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my lord and compatriot, to be honored with the highest respect.</p>
