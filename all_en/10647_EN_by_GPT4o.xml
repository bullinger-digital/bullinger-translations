    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends back the copy of a letter from Bullinger addressed to Megander; the latter seems to no longer be upset and has completed his commentary on the Epistles to Timothy. Shares Bullinger's opinion expressed in his letter to Bucer [above No. 562] regarding the opinions obtained by Chelius. Intends to address further writings sent to him [HBBibl I 72 and 721] at the next opportunity. His hernia forces him against his will to limit his preaching activities. After the trial sermons by Peter Kunz and Rhellikan, the election [of a successor for Franz Kolb] is imminent. Hints at his unfavorable opinion of Konrad [Hermann].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Unexpectedly, I received your letters, dearest Heinrich, and likewise unexpectedly, your messenger returned from Freiburg in all the rain and storm, which meant I could not respond to your letters individually. However, I will ensure that the next messenger finds the letters ready. I am sending back the copy of your letter to Megander. He himself showed your letter when he returned from Bruges, and we met in BÃ¼ren for the synod, seemingly very pleased and content. I hear nothing more against you than what he has against everyone, as you have depicted him in his true colors. He has written a commentary on both Epistles to Timothy; the judgment is left to the readers.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I will certainly send back your very true and free letter to Bucer. You share my opinion about the advice of Melanchthon and Bucer to the King of France. If it is so easy to depart from the truth and permissible because we are learned, then eventually in all scripture, anything will be allowed, and we will have nothing to object to the papists. I had subscribed to Chelius at his will, but certainly without danger, since you advise nothing except what the Spirit of God has long commanded and admitted in the scriptures.</p>
      <p>Regarding this moderation and what you write in Galatians and Ephesians, I will respond with the next messenger, meanwhile thanking you for your concern for me.</p>
      <p>You encourage me not to neglect preaching. Ah, my dear Heinrich, what more would I want! But since I cannot and will soon be more useless to the church than Franz (whom you barely understand when he speaks), what should be done here? For a long time and until now, it has always been decided with me that, however the hernia grows, I will not cease from my function, which I have now undertaken for almost 16 years, but the illness itself turns me away from my purpose, and friends turn me away, but too late.</p>
      <p>The magistrate heard Peter Kunz and Rhellikan for the sermon, intending to choose one of them, although I hear the former is preferred over the latter.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I could not provide more, as the messenger was unexpectedly forced to leave.</p>
      <p>5th of July, year 35.</p>
      <p>Let me add this one thing: Not all preachers are disliked by everyone. I will depict Konrad for you in his true colors, whom I would have recommended to you more if you had not found this indication described at the beginning of the letters: To God alone be the glory. Consider asking to be asked.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
