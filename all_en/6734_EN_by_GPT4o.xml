      <p>Greetings. I write this to you so that you may know I have returned safely to Switzerland and remain fond of you. In France, everything seemed to be quite peaceful with the disputes among the leading families settled; whether they have truly reconciled in good faith, the outcome will reveal. But we all believe it was done with dignity and for the public good; for it can hardly be said how many gladiators on both sides those disputes were sustaining, who themselves, as much as possible, were also sustaining those disputes. Since a war from the Turk is feared in Italy, many are contributing to the public good there; as a result, the people of Geneva are somewhat in fear, especially since Namurtius, the cousin of the Duke of Savoy, is expected in Anysii, a town near Geneva, with a large retinue from the Guise family, and they suspect it because so many soldiers are being discharged in France. But when I explained the reasons for the discharge, namely serious and necessary ones, I seemed to have somewhat alleviated their fear. They certainly take diligent care for the safety of their city. If you have received any more certain information about the Milanese treaty or the Pope, I ask that you inform me.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May the Lord preserve you and the most learned Gwalter in safety for as long as possible. Farewell. Solothurn, March 21, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, P. Belli√®vre.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
