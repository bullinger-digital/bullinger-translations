      <p>Through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I did not respond to your recent letters, most excellent and kind Bullinger, because there was nothing new to write. However, now that I have received certain news from a messenger returning directly from England, two things have compelled me to write to you: one is that we have heard you have married one of your daughters to Zwingli, the son of the great Zwingli and a most distinguished man; the other is the concord regarding the mystery of the Lord's Supper, which I hear you have established with Calvin and his followers.</p>
      <p>Regarding your daughter's marriage, since I hope that the most honorable girl has married an excellent young man who in no way degenerates from his excellent and distinguished parent, I congratulate you and your most loving wife, and I pray to the most good and great God that it may be firm and auspicious. As for the concord on the Lord's Supper and the sacramental matter, since I have always been most eager for peace and concord, what else can I say but that I strongly approve of it? For I do not doubt that it is such, because I recognize you as such, that is, pious, religious, and most devoted to truth, that it deserves the approval of all good people, although I myself, as far as my own opinion is concerned, can pronounce nothing, as I have not yet read the writing itself. Indeed, a certain writing is being circulated by an uncertain author, which has caused me not to care to read it thoroughly. Nevertheless, it would be pleasing to me if something of this kind, originating from you, were offered to me to read. But enough about this.</p>
      <p>Regarding English affairs, I believe you have been informed by our Laelius; for I have received nothing in the letters of Bernardino and other friends that he has not received, as they are friends of both, and perhaps you yourself will receive more letters from England from this very messenger, and indeed the messenger himself will be able to tell you certain things about the state of England and the travels of the Emperor, if you please to inquire from him. I indeed have nothing else new; if you have anything, which I do not doubt, especially about those assemblies now dissolved and the French alliance and your Swiss concord, I ask that you write to me; for you can confidently share with me, as if you were doing it with your own mind. If you do this, you will have done something pleasing and convenient for me; for thus I will be able to suspect something about future matters and the outcome of things and consult my own affairs beforehand (with the Lord as leader and counselor).</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and most esteemed Bullinger, with your whole family, and greet your wife in the name of my wife; she did not order me to write this. Also, greet your son-in-law, who is very dear to me, and whom I pray to remember us from time to time.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 18, 1549. Please greet for me, if you can, Mr. Bibliander, Gesner, and Gualter, the best and most learned and certainly most dear to me. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coelius S[ecundus] C[urio] signed</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, truly learned and holy Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
