    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] It is certain that the people of Strasbourg sent envoys to Emperor Charles V again twelve days ago to negotiate a peace with him. However, the people of Basel do not know what has happened since then.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] But when the Strasbourg councilors heard of the victory of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony (who killed 15,000 [Imperial troops] in two battles) and of the [decision] of the Hanseatic cities, they immediately sent a rider [...] after their envoys to delay the conclusion of peace as much as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Yesterday, an envoy [...] of the French King Francis I arrived in Basel. Nothing is known about his mission. He left early this morning with two counts [...] for Strasbourg. Allegedly, the king intends to provide the people of Strasbourg with an army, as long as they do not submit to the emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] What Bullinger wrote [regarding the victory of the Elector] seems credible. However, the Imperialists will claim it is fabricated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Someone [...] from Antwerp reported that four ships full of gold and silver had arrived there for the emperor's campaign against Germany. This is not credible, as neither Francis I nor the English King Edward VI would have allowed the ships to pass. Moreover, the emperor sends the gold to Spain, and not elsewhere from there!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The fact that the emperor is recruiting new troops in Italy shows how untrue it is that he and Pope Paul III are at odds!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] May the Lord soon let his army march against the enemies of the Gospel! Greetings, also to Rudolf Gwalther and the other colleagues. In haste.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is certain that the people of Straßburg sent their envoys twelve days ago to negotiate with the Emperor. What has happened in the meantime, we do not know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>However, after the news arrived about the 15,000 killed in two battles by the Elector and the maritime cities, they immediately sent a mounted messenger to the envoys following the Emperor, so that, if the agreement has not yet been made, they may suspend and delay it as much as possible until they are otherwise informed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Yesterday, a courier from the French King arrived. What he brought, I do not know. Early the next morning, he left hastily for Straßburg together with two leaders. Rumor has it that the king will gather an army for them, as long as they do not surrender to the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You wrote credible things, although the Imperialists say everything is fabricated, so much so that they are pained even to dream of harm to the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There was someone here from Antwerpen. He reported that four ships loaded with gold and silver had come to Antwerpen against Germany. Since this is not plausible, I do not believe it: neither the French nor the English (enemies of the Emperor) would have allowed the ships to pass; and the Emperor imports gold into Spain, not exports it!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Is it not clear how much the Pope and the Emperor disagree, since he is seeking a new army here from Italy!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, our Emperor, that he may also bring forth his forces against the enemies of his word. Farewell in Christ. Greet Gwalther and the other pious brothers. I had neither more nor could I write more. In haste, Basel, March 21, 1547. Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zürich, brother in his Lord.</p>
