      <p>S. I am again deeply troubled because I understand that a message must be sent from the Rhaetians to the senate on account of the Engadiners, as I perceive the offense, about which I wrote to you recently, which I sent through a certain honorable Englishman. But because the most illustrious man, Mr. Travers, has undertaken to manage the matter with some moderation and without extreme rigor, as far as he is able, provided that the mark of infamy is removed and the restoration of reputation is also considered (for thus I understand his response to you), it seems that even without any indication to our senate, that which the Engadiners can both demand and desire can be excellently accomplished and the integrity of the name can be abundantly restored in this way. There is still with the printer another volume of Münster's Geography of blessed memory, not yet given to the press, in which a new treatise on Rhaetia is contained, to be published at the first opportunity. Therefore, a suitable retraction of those things which are noted in the first published copies can be inserted into it, even under the name of Münster as the author, because he wrote, having been poorly informed at first about the customs and character of that people, which he has since learned to be quite different, as among whom there are also established ordinary courts, which are exercised against thieves and other criminals according to the laws, etc. Then, as the printer desires, if there are any memorable things of that people recorded in histories or included in maps, or a fuller description of the valley, which, as Gallicius judges, is found to be very faulty in many parts in this first volume, let it be communicated and inserted into the new volume I mentioned. By this, not only will the stigma of disgrace be removed (for we recognize that this is fair), but this people will be illustrated with greater glory from the truth. And lest anything be lacking, we desire the leaders of the region themselves, and especially Mr. Travers, to compose and prescribe the form by which they wish to be satisfied, nor do I doubt that, when they understand the will of the printer, they will be of such fairness and Christian charity that they will not seek to vindicate in posterity what the deceased unwisely designated, especially when the printer offers satisfaction, by which he also hopes that our senate will finally be appeased. Therefore, I pray you, my Bullinger, that you will again be willing to interpose yourself in this matter with serious exhortation and that as soon as possible before perhaps the messenger is sent. At the same time, you will give thanks to the noble and most illustrious man, Mr. Travers, in the name of our printer and ours, whose faithfulness and diligence we recognize and whose fairness of judgment we also strongly approve in this case. I am grateful to you for the matters written to me about Italy. I have very little about German affairs, except that the cavalry of Brunswick is reported to have entirely joined the Emperor and that the Emperor, with a great force of infantry and cavalry and with a body as never before strong, is meeting the French army and seeking battle, and recently in a skirmish 1500 from the French forces were killed and about 1500 noble leaders were taken captive and brought to the Emperor. Several friends have written to me about the acts of the Diet of Neuburg; but no one has communicated them, because all assume that I have been provided with them from elsewhere; therefore I ask you to let me have them from you on some occasion. Albert of Bavaria is raging excellently against religion and deceives the hope of many; for he recently ordered about 700 citizens to be thrown into prison in Burghausen because they had used the sacrament in both kinds (as they call it), and in Munich, when he attempted the same, he did not have subjects obedient to his commands, because there are many citizens there who sincerely breathe Christ, for whom the Lord must be prayed, that they may remain confirmed and stable and that his efforts may be broken. Our Erbius writes to you himself, who also greatly cheered me with his letters, because I had abandoned all hope of his restoration, as he seemed to me recently, when I visited, to be inclined to dropsy.</p>
      <p>But the hand of the Lord is by no means shortened, by which even the dead are raised and those things which are not are called as though they were; to Him we rightly render thanks, because He has regarded His church with a holy and wise overseer preserved as if by a miracle. But farewell, most distinguished man, with all yours. Basel, July 26, 1554.</p>
      <p>Of the booklets, which you wish to be obtained, I could find none at all here in the shops except the one I send, and our booksellers doubt whether they even exist in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
