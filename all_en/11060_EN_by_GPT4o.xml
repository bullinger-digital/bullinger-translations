    <p xml:id="regest1">Heard from Gregor Mangolt and others that Bullinger and his family are doing well; he himself and his son are healthy, while his wife has been feverish for a year. He is grateful for Bullinger's support in the matter of his aunt [Verena] Heilmann. As he is heavily burdened by students and boarders, he would like to send his son - who is eleven years old and has been in Latin school for two years - to Zurich using the hundred guilders inherited from his aunt; he asks Bullinger to take in the boy. He is interested in the well-being of Bullinger's mother and brother, with whom he shares many experiences. Greetings to Hans Abiberg and Heinrich Schwyzer. He recommends the pastor [Hieronymus Kranz], who was dismissed and expelled through an intrigue in Calw, against the will of the community; years ago, he was a schoolmaster in Stein am Rhein, taught the sons of the old mayor [Hans Schulthaiß] in Konstanz, and preached for a long time in Kreuzlingen against the priest [Michel von Üsigen].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and also whatever I can offer in love, honor, and goodness, is always willingly prepared for you from me.</p>
      <p>Dear cousin and especially good friend, I have often heard and inquired about your and your entire household's health and well-being from Gregor Mangolt and others who travel to Zurich, and I have rejoiced at this from the heart. Likewise, I cannot refrain, as the love and friendship that your parents, as well as you, have had towards my parents and me, compels me to report to you about my well-being (by the grace and goodness of God), namely my and my son's health. However, my wife has had a fever for almost a whole year, which has recently subsided somewhat.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am still mindful of the loyalty you have shown me in the matter concerning my cousin, Heilmann, for which I still acknowledge myself indebted to repay. I thank you most sincerely, for I have seen and experienced your friendly heart and good will, which you have applied with all seriousness. Therefore, if I could show love and service to you, your family, or anyone else on your behalf, you will find me willing.</p>
      <p>Regarding my son, I should inform you that he is now eleven years old, studying Melanchthon's grammar, Erasmus's copia, Terence, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Proverbs of Solomon, and the Psalter. Now you know well how his aunt bequeathed him a hundred guilders, praise be to the Lord. I would like to attach them to him, as I am truly burdened with so much business that I cannot instruct him further myself. Therefore, I have sent him to our Latin schoolmaster for almost two years now. As this, my dear lord and brother, can well tell you, I have about 150 students and twelve noble boys at the table (boarders), all of whom learn to write and calculate, and for two whole years now, I have always had two full tables occupied and thus been so occupied with them that I cannot attend to my son. Therefore, my entirely friendly and earnest request to you, my dear lord and friend, is that you would advise and assist me in this matter, as I have a special trust in you; for I have heard that you have some young men with you who are very well kept and talented, although I do not desire it from you, I would like you to advise me where I should send him, where he would be well accommodated; for I do not hear praise and commendation of any place more than where there are also many young boys, as with you. Therefore, if it were possible for him to be provided for, I would gladly have him with you in Zurich from the heart. I kindly ask you to write to me what your good opinion is in this matter. I will receive this from you with such high thanks, as highly and greatly as I esteem it, and nothing dearer could happen to me from you at this time.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, dear lord and friend, I would like to understand how your mother is doing and about your brother Hans in Ottenbach; for he and I have endured much together. I kindly ask you to tell him much good from me. I would like to see him from the heart and hear something from him.</p>
      <p>Master Hans Abiberg, Heinrich Schwyzer, send their greetings in my name.</p>
      <p>And finally, I also earnestly and diligently ask you to assist and advise this my brother, the bearer of this, for God's sake and for the advancement of His word, also for my sake; for he is truly a pious (righteous), learned fellow and was recently unjustly and undeservedly expelled from Calw in Württemberg by the enemies of Christ and His word. For when Master Ambrosius recently came home, his servant, whom I hosted, informed me how the adversaries are said to have accused him in the chancery, as if he had preached some articles (teachings) not pleasing to them, about the authorities, etc., and made such a complaint as if it had been ordered by a community, namely the bailiff, town clerk. But all this happened behind the community's back. Therefore, I have well learned from Master Ambrosius's servant that he was treated very unkindly. He has been in Calw since then, tells me how the pious people lamented so heartily about him and hoped he would return to them, which, however, could not be. He also considers it not his desire to expose himself to such great danger of life and limb. But in truth, there is no fault in his person; for I have known him for a long time, when he was a schoolmaster in Stein am Rhein years ago, and later instructed the sons of our old mayor, who are now in Basel, with whom he stayed for three and a half years, and also preached for a long time in Kreuzlingen against a devilish (malicious) papist (of whom you have heard much, who was long imprisoned in Frauenfeld) and truly accomplished much good in the Lord's vineyard through his divine grace. Therefore, I would like to commend him to you, and whatever good happens to him, I will consider it as if it had happened to me. With that, may the Lord with His grace be with us all.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz, on the 10th of July in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Your good friend Augustin Heilmann, court clerk in Konstanz.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my dear and especially good friend.</p>
