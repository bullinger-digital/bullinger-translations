      <p>First of all, we congratulate you on the admirable happiness of your most serene queen in settling disturbances, in defeating enemies, in keeping subjects in their duty, and in wisely and bravely defending against the wicked plots treacherously woven by rebels. We diligently pray to the Lord that He may not only preserve but also amplify the most abundant gifts in her, and protect her from all evil.</p>
      <p>This maiden beloved by God (by the testimony of all) surpasses all the kings who now reign throughout the world, in wisdom, modesty, clemency, and also in justice, in the skill and admirable success in managing affairs; from which indeed all the pious throughout the kingdoms take comfort, and are confirmed in the true religion, because they clearly see Christ the Lord so powerfully present with His worshipper, and prefer her in glory and all kinds of heroic and divine virtues to the princes. However, it grieves us not a little that in the propagation of truth, and in the expansion of the boundaries of the Church of Christ, so many obstacles and hindrances present themselves to you, arising even from those who most wish to appear evangelical. But during the beginnings of the reformation of our church, the same trouble exercised us. For there were those to whom nothing seemed pure enough in the reformation, hence they separated themselves from the church, and established peculiar conventicles, which were soon followed by schisms and various sects, which presented a pleasant spectacle to our papist enemies.</p>
      <p>But eventually their hypocrisy and disorder became known, and they dissolved of their own accord.</p>
      <p>The merciful and compassionate Lord will undoubtedly also free you from this trouble. etc.</p>
