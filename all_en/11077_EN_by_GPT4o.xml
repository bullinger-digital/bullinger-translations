    <p xml:id="regest1">Although they have already refuted Caroli's accusations through the confession sent by Grynaeus, they are still suspected of teaching falsely and having attacked Caroli too harshly. After their response, only two points of Caroli's criticism of their confession remained disputed: the use of the terms "Trinity" and "Person" as well as the divinity of Christ. They avoided the mentioned terms solely because they reject the compulsion to prescribed formulations and did not want to give the impression that they needed to correct their previous teachings. That Christ is God and not only shares in the divinity of the Father is already taught by Cyril; this is also expressed by the Holy Scripture when it calls Christ Jehovah. The instigator of the conflict is Caroli, who began to argue about intercession for the dead and eventually accused Viret of Arianism despite his restraint; only when Calvin and Farel could not calm him with reference to the teachings of the Geneva Catechism did Calvin demand to be allowed to answer before the Bern Synod. The clear outcome shows that they were right to defend themselves; they are solely concerned with clarifying the matter and strengthening the connection with the Zurich church.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Esteemed brothers. When Charles stirred up those disturbances for us, the rumors of which almost moved all the churches of Germany, and although we hoped they would soon be extinguished, as they were utterly baseless and born from frivolous slanders: nevertheless, so that no scruple might settle in the minds of good men, we did what we could to ensure that our innocence was testified to the neighboring churches. Nor do we doubt that Grynaeus, as requested, sent our confession to you with a brief letter, from which it was easy to see how unjustly we were attacked by that beast. However, since we hear that there are some there who do not conceal their murmuring and claim that we are secretly plotting something, and others who blame Charles's actions on our wickedness and petulance, claiming that he, not otherwise a bad man, was driven to disturb the churches of Christ with such intemperance, it seemed right to briefly address both issues as they stand.</p>
      <p>For to pursue the whole story in detail is scarcely possible due to time constraints. But indeed, we have no answer for those overly critical censors who seek grounds for suspicion in a matter so plain and straightforward. What do they want? They accuse us of cunningly plotting something: but from where do they gather even the slightest evidence of such craftiness? Indeed, in our confession, nothing seems to have been omitted that would remove suspicion, nothing is placed so obscurely or perplexingly as to give the appearance of evasion.</p>
      <p>Charles, initially burning with a desire to bite, attempted to attack it in about ten places, and indeed he seemed to take this upon himself by right, since it is enough for the Sorbonne, when they wish to condemn something, to shout heresies and schisms with full mouths. However, having been dislodged by our response and convicted of so many slanders for which he had spoken against us, he shamefully withdrew and dared to charge us with nothing else in the entire accusation than that the names of the Trinity and the persons were too stubbornly omitted there: then that we assert the divine essence of Christ to be from itself. But what could be more diluted than that first quibble? That we do not abhor such terms is clear from the fact that we have always wished for their free use in the church, and we have declared the Helvetic confession published in Basel to be pious and holy, which nevertheless contains mention of the persons. We only did not want this example of tyranny to be introduced into the church, that one should be considered a heretic who did not speak according to another's prescription: while he, on the contrary, strenuously contended that no one could be a Christian without the three creeds. And lest anyone think that this was done by us out of a desire to quarrel, know that we have repeatedly and explicitly testified that we avoided the appellation of persons for no other reason than that it could not be accepted by us at his demand without simultaneously acknowledging the charge he had brought against us. For he had cunningly provided for himself with all orders that if we seemed to concede to his demands, our faith would be rendered suspect: which he also openly declared, asserting that our doctrine would be suspect to him until it was approved by the subscription of the creeds. Thus, if he had obtained what he demanded, not only would everything that had been built by our ministry have wavered, but it would have collapsed entirely. What else, then, remained for us but to present a clear example of our doctrine, by which it would be evident that it had been unjustly accused? We certainly considered this to be our duty. Now, as for that point which Charles vociferates contains a horrendous heresy, it seems to need hardly any excuse. For when the divinity of Christ is discussed separately, whatever pertains to the one true and eternal God is rightly attributed to him: but the note of distinction has its place when he is compared with the Father, which we too have diligently observed. For we do not deny that the eternal Word is begotten of God the Father. However, we do not understand begotten as a kind of outflow, so that it is a part of the Father's essence, but that he is wholly in the Father, having the whole Father in himself in turn. In this way, Cyril, who often calls the Father the beginning of the Son, nevertheless considers it a great absurdity elsewhere unless the Son is believed to have life and immortality from himself.</p>
      <p>The same teaches (in book 10 of the Thesaurus) that if it is proper to the ineffable nature to be from itself, it rightly pertains to the Son. Indeed, he even reasons that the Father has nothing from himself unless the Son also has from himself. But why do we dwell so anxiously here, when those words of ours express nothing more than the name Jehovah encompasses, with which the Scriptures designate Christ: and therefore we do not see what those Aristarchs who accuse us of acting too cunningly desire in us. Now we come to the second head of detractions. They object that Charles was compelled by our importunate insolence before he stirred up those tumults. If they wanted their slanders to be colored with some pretext, they ought to have lied a little more modestly. For we restrained that rabid beast, although exulting with a desire to harm and raging, with our modesty for several months so that he would not pour out his poison, until he publicly attacked all those in a public sermon who taught that the dead are not helped by prayers. Viret, his colleague, who is wise beyond his years, publicly ignored it so as not to stir up an even greater fire by contending, and instructed the people as if there were no controversy between them, until he was dragged by his faction to the Lausanne council, which abhorred the word of God, and was accused of Arianism not obscurely or figuratively but in plain words.</p>
      <p>Calvin also, when he had hurried there at the request of our church, was accused of Arianism along with Farel by that sacrilegious mouth before the Bernese legates, who had been sent at that time to settle the affairs of the province. He replied that he had a strong enough defense of his innocence in his little book. But so as not to abandon Farel's cause, whose integrity was as well known to him as his own, he produced a passage from the Catechism used by our church, where we explicitly assert that the divinity, glory, and essence of the Father, Son, and Spirit are one: and we teach that Christ is proclaimed the Son of God, not as the faithful are by adoption and grace, but naturally and truly, and therefore uniquely, so that he is distinguished from others: and that he is also our Lord, not only according to the divinity, which he has had one with the Father from eternity, but in that flesh in which he was exhibited to us. Are these the words of Arians? But since that wicked man made no end of quarreling and contending, the matter was referred to the Bernese council, where Calvin went to request a synod in the name of our church, where those lies with which the most shameless slanderer had besmirched us might be wiped away with a fuller purgation. The matter finally progressed to the point you see, beyond our expectation, but not without the admirable providence of God. For what would he not have dared in uncertain matters, who is not yet ashamed to sow everywhere that the divinity of Christ is denied by us? The handling of the case was such that it was clear he was utterly mad, and we were merely opposing his madness: but we prefer that you understand these things from others, and the letters are almost snatched from our hands by the hastening courier. Nevertheless, we ask of you that you do not receive this our apology among you in any other way than with the spirit in which it was written. For we know what the arts of informers are and how much they profit where no voices are raised for the truth. Indeed, we already experience from elsewhere how harmful silence has been to us. Therefore, since we do not doubt that Satan is also attempting the same among you, we wished to prevent such whisperers from alienating your minds from us with false detractions. Nor do we distrust your prudence, but no diligence can be great enough in cutting off occasions for divisions. As far as we are concerned, we are so disposed towards you that we would leave no means untried that might serve to strengthen the union of our church with yours. More than enough has been contended with hatred and disputes among the churches of Christ, evils which would never have been so labored under if all had mutually received each other with candor. Now we beseech you by the sacred name of Christ, that if you think we err in any matter, you do not hesitate to admonish us. For nothing do we desire more than that whatever we do in this our administration be approved by you and those like you. May the Lord Jesus continually enrich you with new increases of his Spirit.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 30th of August.</p>
      <p>Your most beloved and esteemed brothers, the ministers of the church of Geneva.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and esteemed men, brothers in Christ, the ministers of the church of Zurich in Zürich</p>
