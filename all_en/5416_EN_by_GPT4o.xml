      <p>S. D. Your letters sent through Konrad Sulzer, the servant of Albert the merchant, have made me very sad, initially indeed because of the money that the prince requested to be lent by our people; for I do not doubt that those who are ignorant of our poverty will interpret it badly, that the requested sum was not paid. But I have previously explained to you the reasons why our people cannot; I can add nothing else. Then it grieves me exceedingly, what you write about the Bernese.</p>
      <p>I had hoped they would make friends for themselves with that expedition, by which they gravely offended a good part of Switzerland; but I understand they have gained no favor with you and the French, etc. From the merchant's servant, I also learned that the largest forces of Condé, enclosed in Orléans, are doing nothing and are doubling expenses. Others say the soldiers, weary and broken by the long delay, are gradually withdrawing.</p>
      <p>I pray the Lord to rightly direct the matter. You think the Pope, harassed by Turkish galleys, cannot wage war in France. But today I received letters from Hercules von Salice, who reports for certain that the Pope has prepared 7,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry: furthermore, Count Johann von Angosciola has led 3,000 infantry from Milan and Piacenza to Genoa, from there to proceed directly to Provence and there to await the Pope's army, which is soon to follow. I did not want you to be unaware of this.</p>
      <p>The Diet of Hermetschwil has ended, and matters are now more dangerous and worse than before. May the Lord protect the faithful from evil and strengthen them with His Holy Spirit!</p>
      <p>Farewell together with all the fellow ministers and brothers. May the Lord be with us all! Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>August 7, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Johannes Calvin, faithful minister of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
