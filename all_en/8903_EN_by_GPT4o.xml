      <p> Greetings. So often does the memory of you occur to my mind and you come to meet me, that these letters have been forced from my pen, with which I might incite you to write, so that I might fulfill my long-standing desire and no longer be deprived of the benefit and delight of your letters. For it cannot be said how pleasantly the letters of friends, such as you are, are received, even if true friendship does not depend on their duty. The disturbances in France and the civil wars, which are always miserable and full of evils, have delayed the mutual duty of writing. But by the grace of God, we enjoy peace and honorable leisure. We had to be careful not to continue to provoke His wrath and to produce fruits worthy of those who have repented; for if similar events are to be expected from similar causes, it is conjectured that we should not be secure, since piety grows cold and true virtues are despised, to say nothing more serious. However, that dark cloud, which has afflicted us with the greatest calamities, seems to be looking towards Flanders, about which you will be able to understand more certain things. </p>
      <p> Moreover, so that you may know what our son is doing, since I have decided to recall him at the beginning of autumn, lest it be grievous for him not to see the neighboring regions and ancient monuments, I have allowed myself to be persuaded that at the beginning of last April, with faithful, good, and learned companions, he should visit Bologna, Rome, Naples, and the principal cities of Italy, observe their laws and customs, keeping himself safe from contagion and not pricking himself on the thorns among which he must walk. Perhaps you will disapprove of my ease and indulgence in this matter. I commend myself and him, dear to you, to your prayers. I trust it will be pleasing and mindful of your kindnesses. I will have the son of the Count from Upper Saxony, who seems to me a son not unworthy of his excellent parent and of good character, most highly recommended, and if I can gratify you or your friends in any matter, you will find me most ready. </p>
      <p> My wife greets you; you will greet in my name the most honorable council and all friends. Farewell and love us, as you do. </p>
      <p> Paris, May 12, 1572. </p>
      <p> Yours sincerely, Coignet. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich. </p>
      <p> In Zürich. </p>
      <p> The letters of Mr. M. Coignet written after the war in the month of May 1572. </p>
