      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Having found a sufficiently convenient courier, I continue to trouble you with my letters, most excellent man. From the Martinmas fair, I sent three letters to you via Christoph's servant, but from your letters, I could not ascertain whether you received them: one for you, another for Franz, and a third to Master Thomas Grynaeus in Basel. For Paul Blasius passed away on the very day of St. Martin, who, while staying in Basel with Grynaeus, incurred debts even with others. The heirs are requesting a delay so that it can be gathered more conveniently and sent without loss and expenses. Titus passed away on the 17th day after Paul's death. Two small children, a two-year-old boy and a one-year-old girl, are left behind. By Froschauer's servant, to whom I sent the letters, I also sent my Sara two small cloths; whether the drunken man lost them or delivered them, I cannot know. Regarding Franz, I think a lot, bringing in a year about 23 guilders; if he were a strong lad, it would be fine. However, whatever you do, for or against it, I will neither do nor say anything, but rather settle and pay it properly. Now I send him two thalers on good account, etc. From Italy, we have nothing at all worth knowing; we perceive the dearness of provisions everywhere.</p>
      <p>No one has yet been appointed in place of the deceased Johannes Blasius. Farewell. From the court of Chur in Rhaetia, December 16, 1550. Lucius Haimius, consul, and Johannes Pontasella send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>I wish health to all your colleagues. Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, rector of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
