    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The people of Bern are sending two boys to Zurich again: [Ismael], the son of Johannes Buchser, and [Samuel], the son of Heinrich Schneuwlin, who was from Sursee and buried in the Bern region. The people of Zurich should take good care of the youths so that Kilchmeyer's efforts are not in vain and the Bern council can see that Kilchmeyer and the people of Zurich are taking good care of the Bern students supported by public funds.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In Bern, it is heard that the Bern boys sent to Zurich last school year are not being sufficiently supervised. They have too much freedom, lead too loose a life, spend evenings in taverns, and chase after disreputable girls instead of reading books! The Bern council is annoyed about this and has already reproached Kilchmeyer several times. Bullinger should ensure that these young people do not go astray but are well-educated. For the [Lutheran] opponents in Bern are pleased with this rumor and even fuel it to portray the people of Zurich as negligent. They are trying to snatch Christ away from the youths and cause their return to Strasbourg so that Bucer's rule in Bern can be restored, which, with God's help and the efforts of many, was pushed back and almost completely eradicated.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The two students will report in detail on the situation in Bern. They should be introduced and recommended to Benedikt Euander, a teacher at the Fraumünster school. He should take particularly good care of them so that, if needed in half a year, they could be assigned to a church. In Bern, there is a recurring lack of good and sincere pastors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] A woman [...] from Schwyz, who lives in Bern, a relative of the [Schwyz] bailiff Dietrich Inderhalden, will come to Zurich. For Kilchmeyer's sake, Bullinger, together with Junker Jakob Rordorf, should take care of her matter (which she will present herself). She is honorable and of good reputation. Even if she is not entirely successful in her endeavor, a decent and influential citizen [...] from Bern would still marry her.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] When Kilchmeyer was recently tasked, together with the noble Glado May, to inspect the school in Brugg, he wrote from there to his godfather, the schoolmaster Johann Jakob Ammann, and asked him to pay more attention to the Bern students. He enclosed 12 crowns with the letter. Have the letter and money arrived safely? Bullinger should inform the already so curious Kilchmeyer of any news and also ensure that he is not forgotten by the Zurich councilors, especially since he does not want to die in Bern. Bullinger should ensure that Johannes Haller is appointed in Kilchmeyer's place!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to Anna [née Adlischwyler], to the family, to Rudolf Gwalther (whose letter and money Kilchmeyer has received), as well as to Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, Heinrich Buchter, Johann Jakob Ammann, Johannes Fries, and all colleagues.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. Behold, once again two young men are being sent to you, one of whom is the son of Master Johannes Buchser, formerly the pastor of the Lord's flock in Sur, and the other is the son of Heinrich Schneewly from Sursee, buried in the Bern region. I ask and beseech you to take care of them, so that my efforts in sending them to you are not in vain, and that our magnificent council recognizes both me and you in Zurich as the most diligent guardians of all those who are supported by public funds for the glory of God, the welfare of the church, and the salvation of the homeland.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>There is certainly a great rumor among us that those who were sent to you last year are not being properly cared for, but are living with too much freedom, leading a dissolute life, found among feasts and drinks, and that at night and in public taverns, they are pursuing prostitutes rather than turning and reading books! The council hears this with great annoyance and has reproached me more than once. Therefore, you will ensure with the utmost diligence that our youth do not perish miserably with you, but are formed and educated with the diligence that is certainly needed and which we hope for from you. Our adversaries, indeed the adversaries of Christ, not only rejoice when they hear that our people are neglected by you, but also increase the rumor with slanderous tongues, seeking to have them sent back to Strasbourg, so that Bucer's reign may be expanded and resurrected among us - which by God's grace and many efforts has already been largely demolished and almost extinguished. It is superfluous to write more to you about this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>For you have before you noble young men who will be able to explain to you abundantly what is happening among us, whom you should entrust and commit to Euander at the Abbey, so that he may apply the utmost care and diligence in shaping them, so that after half a year, if necessary, they may be recalled and appointed to churches. For we are in constant need of good and sincere pastors.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>A certain woman from Schwyz, now living in our city, a relative of the bailiff Dietrich Inderhalden, will come to you, to whom I would like you to extend your assistance in my name, with Junker Jakob Rordorf joining you in the matter, which she will explain to you. She is honorable, modest, and of such praise that, even if her affairs are only slightly successful, she will be received in marriage by an honest citizen, who is also of great authority among us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In recent days, when I was conducting an inspection of the classes with the noble man Claudius von May, I wrote from Brugg to the venerable schoolmaster, my godfather, Master Johann Jakob Ammann, that greater care should be taken in the future for our students, sending 12 crowns. Whether the letter with the crowns has reached him, I have not yet learned. Therefore, make sure to inform me of this and other news, of which you know I am most eager, and see to it that I am not forgotten by our lords in Zurich. For in Bern, unless God wills otherwise, I will not die, and it will be your responsibility to ensure that Master Johannes Haller is reinstated in my place!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord always with your wife and entire family, and love me as your brother, always commending me to the Lord God in your prayers. I bid farewell to Master Rudolf Gwalther, from whom I recently received both letters and money. And you will greet in my name Master Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, Heinrich Buchter, Johann Jakob Ammann, Johannes Fries, and the entire college of Christ. Farewell again! Bern, July 2, 1547. Jodocus Kilchmeyer, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant preacher at the provostry in Zurich and his brother to be observed in all ways.</p>
