    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Hospinian is so heavily occupied that he is only now able to respond to Bullinger's letter [not received]. Bullinger should not interpret the delayed response any differently than Hospinian interprets any interruptions in Bullinger's correspondence. Hospinian is and will always be concerned for Bullinger, just as Bullinger is well-disposed towards him and his family.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] As a token of friendship, Hospinian had sent his insignificant [edition of the Greek grammar] by Urbano [Valeriani]. And with what a significant gift [the commentary on Luke] has Bullinger now reciprocated! Such unequal gifts remind one of the exchange between Glaucus and Diomedes! Hospinian is all the more grateful, as he particularly values the human and divine wisdom of the Evangelist Luke.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He sends his regards and those of his brother Christian.</p>

      <p>S. P. D. To your most beloved and sweetest letters, most esteemed Bullinger, I am responding later due to my incredible occupations, with which I have been and still am very much occupied from the time I received them until today. Therefore, I beseech you, if I need to plead with you, most humane man, not to interpret this delay any differently than it was made by me. I have been, am, and will be (as long as I live and the greatest and best grants me this mind) most devoted to your name and reputation. What could prevent me from doing this, since I know that you wish well for me and mine from the heart?</p>

      <p>I sent some of our trifles to Urbanus as a token of my love for you. But, I beg you, what have you sent back to me? If it is permissible to compare a profane thing with such a sacred thing and it is not a sin to compare a man endowed with such great prudence and divine wisdom, as everyone truly proclaims you to be, to a boastful and barbaric man, such indeed was the exchange of Glaucus with Diomedes. Be that as it may, I give you great thanks for those golden commentaries of yours on Luke, and I am grateful, intending to reciprocate if possible. Know this: Your gift is all the more pleasing to me because I have always been more delighted by the diction and history of this evangelist than by others. For it shines forth from this evangelist (in my view) not only a singular and exceptional splendor of divine but also of human wisdom. But let the cobbler stick to his last!</p>

      <p>I commend myself and my brother Christian to you. For I neither have the ability nor the desire to detain you longer at this time.</p>

      <p>Farewell most happily in the Lord Jesus. From our study, October 13, 1546. Please convey my greetings and those of my family to your wife and children. Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinianus.</p>
      <p>To the most eminent and greatest theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the divine word among the people of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother in Christ. Zürich.</p>
