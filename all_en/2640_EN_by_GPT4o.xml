      <p>S. Regarding the history of the Bishop of Valence, I have not heard anything further; but the one who first reported it to me is a serious, learned, and trustworthy man. The rumor about the death of Mary of England was confirmed by some captains from Valais who came to Solothurn, whom Musculus encountered at Fraubrunnen in an inn, as he was traveling to the district to visit Haller the treasurer, where he is receiving treatment. They also added that Elizabeth has already been inaugurated as queen.</p>
      <p>Some people from St. Gallen, coming from Lyon, also told me that the vicar of Lyon wrote this to his people from the king's court.</p>
      <p>Our people are surprised that the king or his envoy in Solothurn has not written anything about this matter, as they usually inform us immediately of anything noteworthy. We will soon hear more confirmed news.</p>
      <p>Concerning your letters sent to Blaurer, I have not heard anything further; however, I know that he has reported certain things to some of our people somewhat indiscreetly.</p>
      <p>This night a messenger comes from Geneva, bringing bad news that the unrest in Geneva is spreading further; for on the 16th of May (as I think I wrote recently), some rebels broke into an honorable man's house at night, claiming he was harboring some rebellious Frenchmen; they wanted to search for them. But they found no one, and the matter was quickly settled, though some of the rebels were arrested. Meanwhile, as they began to inquire more closely into the conspirators and the cause of their rebellion, Captain Perrin, a powerful man in Geneva, escaped with some citizens in a boat on the Rh√¥ne, which worsened the situation. I do not know what else has happened. My lord, the city scribe Escher, who is now before the council and citizens, as I write this, might hear more about it and inform you, more than I know.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, one of the ministers from Geneva is here for the sake of Calvin and his doctrine, and some ministers from our region have been summoned again, and this matter is being discussed with great offense and irritation among all our people, and if the Lord had not given us special grace to agree on this matter, it would have been over for this church.</p>
      <p>There is also another matter that is troubling me now. A certain itinerant magician was captured here and has now been released, and, as disbelief prevails everywhere, there are many who support him. But the Lord will make them soon realize they have been deceived to their great harm. He promises to find hot springs not far from our city and does many other things, professing empiricism and covering all his wickedness with the pretext of the gospel, and almost demands to be given the power to preach.</p>
      <p>May the Lord confound him and all who rely on these vanities. We will oppose him for the time being until he is expelled or the Lord confounds him. This is all I have for now. Farewell with your whole family. Mine greet you and all yours; may Gwalther and all the sons-in-law be safe. Bern, the last day of May 1555.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and compatriot.</p>
