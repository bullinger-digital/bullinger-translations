    <p xml:id="regest1">Cannot yet provide the promised response, but Thomas [Blarer] has already written and likely also spoken with Bullinger about predestination and the situation in Württemberg. Additionally, Konrad [Zwick] might soon come to Zurich; for these reasons, he sends back Bullinger's [treatise on predestination] without comment. The Memmingen [pastor] Simprecht [Schenck] has been called to Strasbourg by Capito and Bucer; perhaps because he did not follow Bucer in the doctrine of the Lord's Supper and in the pursuit of unifying the Swabian churches, while Gervasius [Schuler] in Memmingen, the Ulm [Martin] Frecht, and the Augsburgers have already been won over; perhaps he is also to represent Bucer and Capito during a trip to France. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Oh, thrice and four times miserable me, who so often promise to respond to the next messenger, yet do not do so. But your kindness alone consoles me, and also the fact that you are not unaware of how much can intervene between the cup and the lip. However, my cousin Thomas has written to you. Furthermore, I do not doubt that he has discussed many things with you in person, especially about the doctrine of predestination, and also about the state of affairs in the Duchy of Württemberg. Hence, I can certainly be excused if I not only delay but entirely refrain from writing about these matters, of which he has made you most certain through letters and in person. Moreover, it may happen that you will soon see my brother Konrad in Zurich. Then you will have living words instead of mute letters. Nevertheless, I am sending back the booklet, lest you perhaps be troubled by its absence. Expect a response. Now, even if you kill me, I cannot give it.</p>
      <p>I add this one thing: Sympert from Memmingen has been called to Strasbourg by Capito and Bucer. He has gone there through us. He does not know the reason for the call, but unless my nose deceives me, I smell something. Sympert has been slower so far in embracing the doctrine of the real presence of Christ's body in the supper, and he also somewhat resisted Bucer in Memmingen; therefore, he may have been called to Strasbourg to absorb this doctrine. Furthermore, since Bucer, certainly a most honorable man, is entirely focused on (as I suspect) uniting several Swabian churches and reconciling them according to the economy written to the Münsterites, and since Sympert does not seem likely to join, he has perhaps been called to be more fully instructed for this purpose. Meanwhile, in Sympert's absence, Gervasius acts in a way that he either could not or could not so conveniently do in his presence. Bucer has Ulm's Frecht, he already has the Augsburg brothers, who have subscribed themselves, if only in good faith and from conscience. From Strasbourg, however, a law emerges. If he adds Memmingen, he may be less concerned about the remaining churches. There is nothing to hope for from our church. Whether he has Ambrosius, I do not know at all. However, there are those who suspect that Bucer and Capito are going to France, with Sympert meanwhile performing duties in Strasbourg, as Memmingen can easily do without him. Whatever the case, I will know shortly. Meanwhile, we must pray to the Lord not to lead us into temptation.</p>
      <p>Farewell with my dearest Pellican and your families.</p>
      <p>3rd of July, 1535.</p>
      <p>Forgive, I beg, such a minimally Latin writing.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
