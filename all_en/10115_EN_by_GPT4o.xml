      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Perhaps I would complain undeservedly, most learned Ambrosius, if I accused you of neglecting our friendship. For although you have not written for a long time, perhaps I am at fault, as I have not written anything to you either. Yet my feelings towards you remain the same. I hope yours towards me do as well.</p>
      <p>I hear many excellent things about you, dearest brother, which the virtue of our Lord Jesus works through you. Meanwhile, I pray that He may keep you safe with us for a long time. We have seen your letter written to your people of Constance, full of apostolic spirit. May the Lord guide your steps, so that through you, that Satan with his forces may be slain by the sword of truth. I beg you, my brother, never to forget me, to hold me in your esteem, and to pray to the Lord for our church and for me.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell, and if you love me, write to me soon.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 9, 1532.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours entirely in Christ.</p>
      <p>To Ambrosius Blarer, most illustrious man, proclaiming the gospel of Christ in Esslingen, brother and dearest fellow laborer.</p>
