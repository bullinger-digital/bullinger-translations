      <p>Your Reverence, Reverend Father, I have received everything.</p>
      <p>But because I have strained my eye a lot by reading these and communicating with the consuls and distributing them here and there to be copied, today the pain, which had somewhat subsided, has returned, and therefore the doctor has strictly forbidden me to read or write anything. But who writes? The letters of Coignet and the king, by which he calls the soldier, were delivered to us yesterday. A note was attached, reminding me of my duty.</p>
      <p>But, as I wrote before, care must be taken that he does not distribute money to the captain against the decree of the Three Leagues, which has not yet been made; but I hope it will be entirely forbidden for our people to engage in military service, following the example of your senate. I have written everything to Carlinus; but I have already read his letters to the consul, in which he urges the consul to be vigilant. He presses the consul to hasten the work, that one should write a bylaw and forbid by life, honor, property, and if anyone takes on the soldier, that one should immediately set a right judgment on him. Certainly, we do not neglect our duty.</p>
      <p>Everything has been written to Traversius and the other brothers; the outcome is now in the hand of the Lord.</p>
      <p>If Junker Stoffel receives money, he will make a move in the Upper League. It is not unlikely that they are asking for a captain in the Upper League, and one who should be well evangelical, but a completely corrupt and otherwise a wicked person. I could not return your writing now, I will send it in 8 days.</p>
      <p>There is no one here who can help with copying at the moment. The consul has taken care to have it copied for himself.</p>
      <p>Our lords are quite amazed that an honorable council of the city of Zurich does not write anything. If it were possible for them to write before the bylaw or on the bylaw to the common Three Leagues, not for our sake, who do our duty, but for the sake of the adversaries. Otherwise, one will rely on the brave as before.</p>
      <p>If you have anything further, let us know as well. Those in the Upper League now occupying their offices somewhat hinder the bylaw.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Excuse me to Mr. Coignet, for I can barely write this; the eye rages, the inner heat boils with water...</p>
      <p>Chur, April 21.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and father in Christ, to be honored.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
