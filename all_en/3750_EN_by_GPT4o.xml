      <p>Farewell, concerning the churches in Valtellina.</p>
      <p>We, the envoys and council messengers of the Three Leagues, now assembled together at the Diet in Davos, acknowledge and make known to everyone with this decree that, according to the articles of the Diet, many esteemed persons, our dear and faithful subjects of the County of Chiavenna, Valtellina, and Worms, have appeared before us, on their own behalf and in the name of all others of both religions in the mentioned places, and have presented their concerns, opinions, and desires to us. And as we have now sufficiently heard and understood them, and have also considered the matter, we have recognized and do recognize, ordain, and decide that the preachers who preach the Holy Gospel in Chiavenna and the County of Chiavenna shall be given forty good gold crowns each year, individually, from the goods of the parish churches or others that lie there, with the reservation that will follow. Likewise, the preachers in Valtellina and Worms, or those who will be there and preach the Gospel, shall also be given annually 40 good gold crowns from the places where they preach the Gospel, namely from the goods and rents or income belonging to the churches or the mass priests who take the benefices but do not personally reside or serve the churches as they should, as well as from the churches or revenues that the Bishop of Como has in Valtellina, and likewise from the Abbey of Saint Abundius and other similar churches and revenues, wherever they may be.</p>
      <p>From all this, as and where the commissioners, who will soon be sent to Valtellina, will arrange. However, in all this, it is not our intention that other persons who have the right of patronage, or those who have otherwise been assigned the benefices for their lifetime, should have the same taken and withdrawn from them. Furthermore, where there are persons in the parishes where the Gospel is preached who have so far been obliged to give something to the mass priests, these persons may now henceforth give the same to the preacher or mass priest; it shall be at their good will, to whom they grant it more. But if something is lacking that cannot be found or obtained from the Bishop of Como or the Abbot of Abundius, and there are two mass priests in the parish, then from the revenue and income of one mass priest, as much shall be taken until each preacher receives his 40 crowns.</p>
      <p>But if all this fails and nothing can be obtained from any of them, then the community of the parish where the preacher will be shall be responsible for ensuring that the preacher does not lack his 40 crowns. Thus, this ordinance shall be observed by all our subjects of the County of Chiavenna, Valtellina, and Worms. They shall live together neighborly and do the best for each other on both sides. We also hereby command all our officials from the mentioned places to ensure that this is observed so that our command is followed and fulfilled. As a true testimony, etc.</p>
      <p>Done at Davos in the year 1558, on the first day of November, etc. Thus far the decree.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is set and ordered that the monastery of Morben shall be inventoried and no more monks shall be taken in, and those who are currently there and were not raised there from childhood shall each be sent on their way; the others shall be allowed to die in peace, etc. On the 6th of November, a messenger came, reporting that the camp had been broken up and the troops had been divided into the frontier towns on both sides, as they were. But regarding the peace, about which no one had any doubt, it seems it will start anew to be blocked; for the English do not want to acknowledge Philip, having also in a move, as if he were unfaithful to them, since he wants to leave Calais behind. Thus, 15 more days have been added to the previous 20 days of the truce.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Savoy also suspects King Philip somewhat. Philip's own servants (or a part of them) have plundered Arres and caused great damage, etc. From Venice, it is written, also to the French lord, that the Turks are raiding up to Vienna. But you may perhaps know more about this.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his honorable, gracious lord and father in Christ, to answer. Zurich.</p>
