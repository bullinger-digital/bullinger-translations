      <p>François Hotman sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Dearest father, I hope you have received from our Stucki a copy of a certain writing, which contained news from France. Since that time, the devil has devised a notable stratagem; the assemblies of the estates, which in individual cities opposed the ambition and tyranny of Semiramis, have been postponed to the first of August, and at the same time a decree was made that the king should be taken to Reims to be inaugurated by his cardinal, although according to all the ancient customs of the kingdom, kings should not be inaugurated before the completion of their 14th year. However, the course of the Gospel, as I hope, will not be hindered; such is the progress of all the churches now.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Navarre surpasses all; the Admiral and Condé profess our religion so openly that anyone of us in our churches would do the same. I had asked Mr. Peter Martyr, my esteemed father, to write letters in Italian to Condé and the Admiral and send them to me; I ask you to speak with him again and add your own letters; for Condé always had your sermons written in French in his hands. Therefore, I earnestly ask you to be willing to gratify me in this matter...</p>
