      <p>God be with you! What I have received since Easter and at Easter, I am sending to you enclosed here. However, I do not want to withhold from you that the papal legate in Solothurn, in his report, consistently maintains and asserts that Count is dead and all is lost, therefore dismissing this current news as a nullity.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I do not know what is right or wrong; we must thus wait again for the time to reveal what it brings. I am informing you of this so that you may use this news more cautiously and also await the certainty.</p>
      <p>From St. Gallen, I wrote on April 11: "We have truly believed here that the Count was defeated and his people scattered; but now we hear otherwise, that it went very differently, with 20,000 men on both sides and the victory remaining with the Count." Recently, I received a letter from Heidelberg, in which it was briefly written in haste: "The Prince of Cond√© was defeated and dead here for two days; now he is alive again with a great victory," etc.</p>
      <p>Thus, indeed, it was written to me; what is true or untrue will be revealed in time, as mentioned above, and will not be able to remain hidden for long. I pray to God that He may graciously put an end to the miserable bloodshed, send peace, and give minds everywhere that love peace and hate discord; for otherwise it is written: "Dissipa, domine, gentem, quae bella vult." With this, you and your household are commended to God. Greet for me the mayor, Mr. Carolus, Pontisell, Ganthner, and all our friends. I ask, if you have the opportunity, that you also write something in my name to young lord Friedrich von Salis and greet him and his son young lord Hans in my name. God be with you!</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, Friday after Holy Easter Day, in haste, 1569. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful pastor of the church in Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
