      <p>Greetings. Concerning Castalione, there is no need for you to be anxious, most esteemed lord and godfather; for we already knew all the same things beforehand, of which you remind us. Meanwhile, I give you the greatest thanks for your diligence and pious concern, which you bear for us. I suppose you have meanwhile learned from my letters what has happened regarding Hyperius's calling.</p>
      <p>The messenger who was sent to summon him has already left, and we hope that within a few weeks we will have the desired response from him, or rather not just a response, but himself in person. We have also spoken about Mr. Zanchi; but our people have an excessive aversion to Italians, so his calling could not be obtained.</p>
      <p>From Geneva, we have nothing else than what I wrote before, nor any other news. The person who delivers this letter wishes to speak with you, to whom I have also given this letter so that he might have the opportunity to meet you, which otherwise I would have given to Löffelsperger, through whom you sent yours. He is a Silesian by nationality and acts as a court preacher in Montbéliard.</p>
      <p>He has come to these parts of Switzerland for the sake of seeing them. We have provided him with the services we could; I am not unaware of the kindness with which you are accustomed to receive travelers; therefore, there is no need for me to recommend him to you more diligently. Farewell, my most desired and esteemed godfather. Please convey my greetings to your wife and your entire household, along with all the brothers and fellow ministers, in my name. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>In Bern.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and dearest godfather.</p>
