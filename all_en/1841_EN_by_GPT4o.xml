      <p>I had written that I feared some commissioners entering the Valtellina might disturb my business. But God has freed me from this fear; for they will leave tomorrow with everything safe, thanks be to God; it is a great victory. As soon as the messenger who brings the letters returns, I will immediately mount my horse and come straight to you, my dearest Bullinger. In the meantime, I would like you to diligently investigate whether the king's envoy is in Solothurn or perhaps elsewhere, and inform my messenger to proceed there, which I ask you again and again. The cause is Christ's, believe me, not the world's, for which I send, as you will hear from me in person. The Cardinal of Augsburg returns to his homeland; he senses something, I know not what. The entire papacy fears a national council. The Cardinal of Ferrara was at the point of death in Siena. That expedition seemed to be dormant. Italy has nothing new besides this. Farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>Pray for us all. In Chiavenna, April 5, 1553. Use Ziegler as an interpreter, so you can speak with my messenger.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
