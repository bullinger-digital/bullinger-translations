      <p>My friendly greetings and entirely devoted goodwill are always with you from me. Honorable, gracious, dear sir, in the recently past month of May, I received a letter from you, dated March 14th, along with a Christian booklet titled "Vom Heil (der Gl√§ubigen)" (On the Salvation of the Believers), which I received well. In response, I immediately wrote back to you through a pharmacist's son from St. Gallen, hoping it would surely and certainly reach you. However, as I received another letter from you on December 25th, I cannot understand from it that my aforementioned letter was answered, which I do not like. Therefore, I ask you to excuse me in this matter; for I do not wish to diminish the love and friendship you offered after the passing of my dear brother Leonhard, but rather, in whatever way I can, to show you and all your people all good will in return, to which I willingly, also dutifully and readily, acknowledge myself.</p>
      <p>I thank you kindly for your faithful compassion, comforting and Christian writing concerning my illness. The Almighty God has nevertheless sent it back for improvement; to Him be praise, honor, and thanks for eternity. May He also grant further what is beneficial for His glory and our soul's salvation. I have nothing particularly noteworthy to report to you, of which you are not already well aware. Much and various things are said about the new pope's Christian intentions, which, if even half of it were implemented, would be commendable and useful. But the thousand cunning and crafty enemies can present their matters attractively until they achieve their intentions, for which the Almighty may graciously protect His own and keep them in the true knowledge of His Son until their end, to whom I also commend you herewith in long-lasting well-being. Dated Augsburg, January 19th, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your honorable servant, David Haug, signed. To the honorable, well-learned, and distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich, my gracious lord.</p>
