    <p xml:id="regest1">Johannes Blasius plans to accompany his son [Paulus] to Zurich to ensure he receives a good education. Therefore, he has asked Pontisella, as his teacher, to recommend [Paulus]. Pontisella is happy to do this, especially since he can vouch for the boy's good manners. Bullinger should help Blasius find a suitable boarding place with a learned and pious man for his son. This would reassure Blasius and please Pontisella.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Since the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Blasius, the most worthy preacher of the divine word among us in Chur of the Rhaetians, had in mind to bring his son to you in Zurich for the sake of cultivating his intellect, he thought it would be in his interest to have a testimony from me, his teacher, regarding his son's character. I have provided this with the utmost willingness; for I have found his character to be such that I can rightly commend him to another. Moreover, since Mr. Blasius wishes his son to reside in the house of some learned and pious man, we wish to ask you (most excellent man) again and again, for the sake of your kindness, to interpose your authority in this matter, and if your kindness would deign to do this, then certainly Mr. Blasius will have nothing to fear, and he will be able to achieve what he desires. As for the boy's character, I assure you (most excellent man) and take it upon myself that his character is such and his integrity and respectfulness are such that, if he becomes known to you, you will consider him worthy of careful recommendation. It will indeed be most pleasant for me to hear that you embrace him with your benevolence. And this is what concerns Mr. Blasius's boy.</p>

      <p>However, regarding my current situation, I do not dare to trouble your dignity; you can learn about the state of our school from Mr. Blasius.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Now farewell, most excellent man, and I pray that you consider these writings, made for the sake of a friend, kindly; I also pray that you deign to have me commended to your kindness. Please convey my many greetings to your most honorable wife, Anna, née Adlischwyler, and to the whole family in my name; furthermore, I wish my patron, the Provost Felix Frey, the schoolmaster Johann Jakob Ammann, and the other gentlemen and benefactors to be well. Farewell again, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>Given in Chur of the Rhaetians, April 27, in the year 1546.</p>
      <p>Johannes Pontisella, most observant of your dignity.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, the most esteemed patron of his lord.</p>
