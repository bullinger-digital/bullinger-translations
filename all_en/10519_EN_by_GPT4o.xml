    <p xml:id="regest1">Had a conversation in Augsburg with Bucer about the planned Eucharistic concord. Bucer, who has already asked the Zurichers in writing for a secret meeting of the Reformers at a location convenient for them, now wishes Bullinger to propose Constance. Schuler joins this wish and asks Bullinger to participate in this meeting together with the representatives of Bern and Basel. A continuation of the controversy would promote the work of Satan and have dire consequences.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father, etc.</p>
      <p>On the second of December, I was in Augsburg with our brother Bucer and spoke about the future matter of concord between us and Luther. In the previous letters sent to you, the Zurichers were given the option to choose a more convenient place for us to meet. However, for many reasons, he wishes for us to meet in Constance, where everything could be discussed more conveniently and safely. He instructed me, as someone closely connected to you, to write and encourage you to propose Constance as the meeting place. If my letter reaches you in time, please do what I ask and what Bucer desires from you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I beg you not to be absent from this holy meeting with the people of Bern and Basel. I know the turmoil that awaits us if we persist in this long-standing disagreement. Satan is plotting marvels against us. We must carefully examine this small rift of discord so that it does not prevail against us, and all efforts should be directed towards uniting our minds, we who are entrusted with the word, and this not without truth. I would have many things to communicate to you beyond the present matter, but besides the delay, I am compelled to add a conclusion.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Dated December 4, Kempten, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant leader of the Church of Zurich, brother and lord to be especially revered. Zurich.</p>
