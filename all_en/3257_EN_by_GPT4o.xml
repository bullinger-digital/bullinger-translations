      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Before I left my home, I wrote to you, and I believe you have received my letters. However, my journey has been quite successful so far, and I have been very kindly received and graciously heard by the most illustrious Venetian Senate. Yet, I have not received any response so far, although I have no doubt that I will soon be dispatched. What I have to discuss before the most illustrious Senate on the mandate of my illustrious lords, you will learn from the bearer of this letter. He is Mr. Peter Perna, my friend, who, relying on my patronage, has accompanied me on this journey more boldly, although it seemed quite dangerous to him due to religion, as you yourself know. However, it has turned out well by the goodness of God, who has brought him here safely and will also bring him back. To Him be honor and glory forever.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding new matters, I have this to write: The army of Lord de Guise is idling in the March of Ancona.</p>
      <p>I wish that this idleness is not as harmful to his army as Livy testifies it was to Hannibal's in Capua; for I perceive that many of his soldiers are perishing from some disease and from contracted infirmities, and if this is true, I indeed grieve and very much so. The Supreme Pontiff has given certain fortified places into the power of the aforementioned Lord de Guise, namely Ancona, Fermo, Ascoli, and Civitavecchia, and the same Duke de Guise remains around those places, as if he wants to protect them with a garrison. In the Roman region, however, it has been reported that Marco Antonio Colonna is causing trouble for the Pope and has besieged a certain town called Paliano (for the Pope violently took it from Marco Antonio after his creation) with a certain expectation of soon capturing it, especially since the aqueducts, which the town used, have been taken away. But on the 23rd of this month (as it is certainly reported here), the Pope sent those Swiss, who recently set out from the Three Leagues to Rome, along with 5000 Italian foot soldiers and 300 horsemen, as well as 18 cannons and provisions and other necessities, to relieve the siege of Paliano. Upon learning this, Marco Antonio Colonna ambushed them all, and scarcely had the battle begun when the Italians sought safety in flight, while the greater part of the Swiss were slain, and the banners were lost except for three. The surviving Swiss soldiers retreated to a nearby hill, waiting for reinforcements from the Pope, although it is doubted here that they can hold out much longer without surrendering to the enemy, especially since they are suffering from a severe water shortage. However, we will soon learn what has happened to the survivors. Certainly, my excellent Lord Bullinger, (if these things, as they are certainly reported here and as I write, are true, and as I also fear they are) I grieve for the fate of the Swiss, who have perished so miserably. I wish that they may finally learn wisdom from the fisherman's blow.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Duke of Ferrara, it is said that he wages war so slowly that he seems born for leisure and pleasures rather than for war, and because of his softness and inexperience in waging war, he is the talk of everyone. He recently attempted to capture a certain not very fortified castle, named Guastalla, which belongs to the Duke of Mantua, but having failed and lost some of his soldiers, he finally withdrew. There was alarm here about the arrival of the Turk; for it was rumored that he was approaching with a great fleet; but now that rumor seems to be fading. The Venetians themselves seemed to be preparing a fleet, lest they be overwhelmed by some sudden event while unprepared. But now, raised in hope that no danger threatens them, they handle everything more leniently, although indeed 90 Turkish galleys were seen around Corfu in these days, and the Venetians immediately sent out some sails as if to scout, etc.</p>
      <p>Last week, 600 German horsemen passed through the Veronese countryside, heading to Piedmont. But from Piedmont, these news have been brought here that the French have besieged Cuneo, a fortified place, and that the Marquis of Pescara, with the besieged suffering from a lack of provisions, wanted to bring relief.</p>
      <p>Upon learning this, the French, abandoning the siege, intercepted the Marquis as if by ambush and forced him into the town of Fossano, where, after staying for several days, he finally returned to Milan by a different route than expected with his infantry forces; the cavalry of the Marquis also reached Milan through the enemy, as it is said.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it is certainly reported that the King of England is troubling France with a large army, while England is being harassed by Scottish soldiers at the instigation of the Most Christian King. Indeed, I groan that Christendom is being shaken everywhere by wars and hardships. May the Lord lay His hand and grant us His peace.</p>
      <p>In this most illustrious Venetian dominion and throughout Italy, where the Pope, as they say, holds spiritual jurisdiction, very harsh inquisitions are being conducted against the faithful. For the inquisitors have been given very ample authority to seize anyone at their whim or with the slightest accusation, to subject them to questioning, to condemn them, and, what is more atrocious than death itself, to send them to Rome, which was not customary before the creation of this Pope. But what can be done? The adversary does not cease and exerts his strength everywhere; but the Lord God will prevail. It has been said here that the King of Portugal has died and that Philip, the King of England, has succeeded him, which I do not wish and indeed do not believe to have happened. Here almost everyone predicts that the beast will be trampled and Babylon will be plundered. May the Lord God lay His hand.</p>
      <p>And these indeed, my most esteemed Lord Bullinger, are the matters of which I could inform you; but I wish to have written them to you on this condition, that if they are found to be less true, you should not blame me, but the common people, in whose mouth they are; for as I received them, so I have passed them on to you. My entire company and I have often made honorable mention of you on this journey and have often wished that you were present. I would have gladly sent you some new work; but I found nothing worthy of you.</p>
      <p>I am waiting here daily for the dispatch and hope to achieve it soon. Once this is done, I will hasten back to my homeland and, as soon as I arrive there, I will inform you of the entire success of my mission. I wish to be gifted by you with a copy of your commentaries on the Apocalypse, and when they are printed, I ask that you send me one. But it is fitting to finally sound the retreat. Therefore, farewell much, my Lord Bullinger, singular honor and ornament of all Switzerland, and love me in return. I ask you to greet your most honorable wife and your entire little family, as well as my son, whom I earnestly commend to you perpetually. You will also greet the excellent men, your sons-in-law, all of whom are most esteemed by me, Lord Walther, Lord Johann Frisius, the venerable elders Lords Bernardino Ochino and Peter Martyr Vermigli, Lord Martin Murald, and any others known to us and favoring the gospel, to all of whom I wish happiness. You, my Lord Bullinger, will forgive me if I write confusedly; for that is mostly my habit. But now I have written especially with a running pen; for it was not otherwise possible due to the economy of time, etc. I send you through the bearer of this letter a small clock and to your most honorable wife a small piece of sugar as a sign of my love for you.</p>
      <p>I ask you to take it in good part. I have bought a lute for my son, which I will soon send through a certain merchant, my friend, named Laurentius Limaceus from Plurs. Therefore, it would be pleasing if he learns to play it well, indeed I wish him to be given access to all the liberal arts and to be educated in them as much as can conveniently be done.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in whatever you see the boy takes delight (provided they are worthy of a free man), do not spare the expense; for he is my only one and therefore not to be neglected, etc., for the sake of economy.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell and again, my friend and most esteemed Lord of all to me.</p>
      <p>Given in Venice on the first day of August 1557. The same, as above, most devoted to you, Friedrich von Salis, envoy of the illustrious Lords of the Rhaetians to the Venetians.</p>
      <p>[...] to the most distinguished and illustrious man, Lord [Heinrich] Bullinger, his Lord and patron [to be] honored and respected. Zurich.</p>
      <p>The Swiss were slain at Paliano on July 23, 1557. Friedrich von Salis.</p>
