      <p> Greetings in the Lord. This young man, my dearest compater in the Lord, whom our school authorities are sending to your school to be educated in good and sacred letters, I also commend to your faith and kindness, since his progress, as far as it concerns my listeners and is destined for the church of God, is also dear to my heart. We know your diligence and zeal there, about which none of us hesitates; nevertheless, we do what is our duty. </p>
      <p> My household begins to be somewhat refreshed by the grace of the Lord after my wife's very serious accident and almost extreme debilitation. </p>
      <p> We are visited and chastised by the Lord from time to time, yet we are not delivered to death; He who strikes also comforts those who are struck; to whom be glory forever. </p>
      <p> Concerning the Council of Trent, it is written to me by friends in Augsburg that it has been suspended for several months; may that noose, by which it is suspended, never be untied. </p>
      <p> Concerning the Emperor, not a word is mentioned by anyone from Augsburg. It is said that the prince, his son, left Augsburg on the 19th of this month to head to Italy and from there to Spain, but after barely a day's journey, he immediately returned to Augsburg. The reason is unknown; some speculate that he was hindered by the Turkish fleet, preventing him from crossing to Spain via Genoa, others say he was suddenly seized by some illness. We have no certain news here about the people of Magdeburg. I have not yet received the letters from friends in Augsburg that were brought to Zurzach; the person entrusted with them enclosed them in a small vessel, which has not yet been delivered. If I receive any new and certain information from them, I will share it. Farewell very well, my dearest compater in the Lord. All of mine greet you and your household. Your little son Johannes Heinrich, beginning to chatter, has nothing so frequent in his mouth as "du Schwab;" he does not want to be a Swabian, he calls all the other children Swabians. Greetings to the lords and brothers, Dr. Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf, Pellican, and Butler. Bern, May 30, 1551. </p>
      <p> Wolfgang Musculus, your compater in the Lord. To the most renowned theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest compater in the Lord. In Zürich. </p>
