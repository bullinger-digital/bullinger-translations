      <p>S. On the 24th of this month, Claudius Maius finally returned and brought me your letters. I am sending back to you, through him, what you sent through him. I can add nothing to this, except that I have been expecting for several days now to be summoned either to the council or (as they had indeed threatened) to court because of the Locarno case, which I had somewhat agitated from the pulpit. Although I did this very modestly and as a duty, I nevertheless greatly offended many, who rage as if against me, especially those who were delegates at the last assembly. For they think that everything was said against them alone. But no one has summoned me yet. Without a doubt, their conscience of guilt strikes them, and they fear that if summoned, I might expose everything more severely than before, and the public might finally learn everything.</p>
      <p>Through the grace of the Lord, I had prepared myself very well so that I would not fail in my duty if summoned. But from this delay, I suspect that everything will subside. The presence of two Freiburg inquisitors at this sermon, which was held here, increased their bitterness, in front of whom they were very upset to be criticized, although I did not know at all that they were present; for it was against their custom to attend the sermon, and I have never known them to be present during the entire time I have served in Bern.</p>
      <p>But the spirit must be hardened against such things. The deed itself torments me, not the importunity of these people. I hear nothing about sending delegates; everything is conducted in secret, which is why they succeed so well.</p>
      <p>There are very few among us who understand correctly what has happened, which our HÃ¼rtzelius here can explain to you.</p>
      <p>From Geneva, I again expect disturbances. Hieronymus was sent away because he called Calvin a heretic. However, upon returning, he obtained residence again from the council (out of hatred for Calvin, I am sure). From this, we will have enough disturbances. Thus, as he said, we have battles outside and terrors within. But He who comforts the humble also comforts us. To Him be praise.</p>
      <p>I write nothing to my brother due to my occupations. Greet him in my name along with all yours. I will take care of your letters to Calvin and also those that Mr. Gwalther sent to be sent to Lausanne.</p>
      <p>I greatly approve of your freedom towards Calvin; for he always seems to defend Luther and Bucer too much and to accommodate himself too much to the ambiguous speeches of the latter, although it is quite clear in what matter both have stumbled. The Lutherans are so crude that nothing surpasses it, and they are more confirmed in error by such accommodating speeches than led out of it. Therefore, the mask must be removed from them so that they can see how greatly they are blind in a clear and obvious matter. For all this, I give you my utmost thanks.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of mine greet you and wish you and all yours happy times. May the Lord grant you to serve His church for many more years in good peace. Amen. Bern, December 28th, after the birth of the Savior.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed and dear lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
