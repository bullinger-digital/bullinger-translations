    <p xml:id="regest1">According to the request of the [Zürich teachers], Schmid must disturb Bullinger with this letter, which he has also written on behalf of his fellow students. Bullinger should excuse the poor style. In order not to disappoint the hopes placed in him by his teachers, Schmid will study diligently, especially since, according to Quintilian, studying enhances the ability to express oneself better. - The journey to Marburg went well, and [the Zürich students] have high expectations for their studies there. - Kaspar Rudolphi teaches dialectics according to [Jodocus] Willich's [textbook], Reinhard [Lorich from] Hadamar teaches rhetoric based on Quintilian, Wigand Happel teaches Hebrew. [Andreas] Hyperius explains the Epistle to the Hebrews and [Theobald] Thamer the Gospel of John. [Johannes] Lonicerus lectures on the Greek [author] Heliodorus. Ethics and mathematics classes are also offered, as well as a series of lectures on [civil] law. On Happel's advice, the Zürich students attend the lectures of [Rudolphi], [Lorich], [Happel], Hyperius, and Lonicerus. They eat at the so-called old provost [...] and live with [Happel], who would immediately reprimand them if they behaved badly or neglected their studies. - Gwalther can report more about the Marburg church customs, which Schmid does not approve of. Every Sunday, the Lord's Supper is celebrated, and the words of institution [Mt 26, 26] are sung [in Latin], while two white-clad youths stand by the pastor with lights. Before the sermon, Latin songs and organ pieces are alternately sung and played for an hour. - The [Zürich students in Marburg] will study diligently. They ask the [Zürich] to continue to support their studies so that they do not have to be prematurely terminated. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ, I pray from the heart.</p>
      <p>That with these my letters I am an impediment to your most honorable studies, and that I disturb your mind, burdened with many other matters, by the reading of my letters, know that this was not done inconsiderately by me. For when I considered that you, our patrons (Mäzene), had diligently enjoined us, upon our departure, to inform you of our status, it was our duty not to show ourselves disobedient, but to obey your commands with a willing mind. Therefore, since this is done by the command of all, I hope you will not take these my letters amiss, which, if not adorned with elegance, consider not that purity, but the mind, which is eager to write most elegantly (unless words fail me in my desire to speak, and the greatest fruit of my studies, which according to Quintilian is the ability to speak, is lacking); which deficiency, however, I hope to remedy by frequently hearing the reading of learned men, God granting His grace, lest you, holding good hope of me, be disappointed, and I at the same time appear ungrateful to you for so many benefits conferred upon me. I hope to conduct myself in such a way that it will be to my benefit, but especially to the benefit of the church. May the gods favor our undertakings!</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will briefly and concisely summarize our status since our recent departure from you. I want you to know that our journey to Marburg has been successful. We also hope that our studies will be wonderfully provided for here, especially with such a great number of learned men, who, by exerting themselves to the utmost and not neglecting any effort, faithfully impart their knowledge. And if we are not negligent in listening to them, we are fully convinced that we can make great progress in a short time.</p>
      <p>Receive these principal lectures: Dr. Caspar Rudolphi teaches dialectics according to Willich. Reinhard Hadamarius teaches the art of rhetoric by reading Quintilian. Dr. Wigand Happel is a professor of the Hebrew language.</p>
      <p>Hyperius explains the Epistle to the Hebrews. Dr. Lonicerus reads Heliodorus in Greek. There is also someone lecturing on ethics, whose name I do not know. Theobald the theologian explains John. Mathematics is also taught; likewise, some jurists read at different hours. From all these, on the advice of Mr. Happel, we have chosen these lectures for ourselves: Dr. Caspar, Hadamarius, Vigand, Hyperius, Lonicerus. We have arranged board with a most honorable man of the city of Marburg, called the old provost, each for 24 florins per year. We have lodging with Master Vigand, who, if there were any lack in the integrity of morals and diligence in reading lectures, would not omit any time in his care and frequent exhortation to us (which, however, we do not need, if we continue as we have begun). He can also greatly assist us privately in Hebrew lectures. So much for the lectures.</p>
      <p>What the Marburg church rite is, you will better understand from Mr. Gwalther; but I do not believe it is approved by me, nor by other pious people. For in distributing the bread in the Eucharist, which is done every Sunday, the minister pronounces these words by singing: "This is my body," etc. [Mt 26, 26]; to which two younger men standing by, holding lights in their hands, dressed in white stoles. It is also customary that they sing alternately for a whole hour in Latin words and with the organ, before the minister begins the sermon. However, I leave these matters to the judgment of the learned.</p>
      <p>You have the principal lectures copiously outlined. We now earnestly pray you, that just as we will not be negligent in listening to them, so you, by providing the opportunity for these lectures, as you have been accustomed to do, do not cease, lest the most necessary things be prematurely taken from us in the course of our studies, before we reach the desired end.</p>
      <p>Now may you fare well in Christ and always hold me commended to you. Greet your wife and dearest children very much in my name. All my fellow students greet you.</p>
      <p>Given at Marburg, in the year 1545, on the 22nd of September. Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful antistes in the church of Zürich, his most esteemed patron.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
