    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller recently wrote [with No. 2663] through the servant [...] of the merchant Stephan Veit, with whom Bullinger will certainly also respond. Today [the city clerk Georg] Frölich received a letter from [Ambrosius] Blarer in Konstanz, to which a letter from Bullinger [was not included]. And just now, as Haller, Bernardino [Ochino], and the learned Italian [Francesco] Stancaro, who is well-disposed towards the Protestants, were dining with Frölich, they read Bullinger's letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] This war is remarkable! The plans of both sides are being thwarted (while God's plan is being fulfilled), so that Haller does not know what to write about the current situation. Today Frölich reported that on November 13, Emperor [Charles V] secretly left his camp with some horsemen and advanced so far towards Nördlingen and the Duchy of Württemberg that the [Schmalkaldic] army can hardly catch up with him. He is said to have left the defensive structures, artillery, and the remaining infantry in Dillingen and Lauingen. Due to the plague and the completely halted supply of provisions from Bavaria, he was no longer able to stay in the camp. However, it is unclear whether this might be a ruse of war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Three days earlier, the [Schmalkaldic forces] attacked the imperial camp, killed 400 men, and captured 300 head of cattle.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is unknown what they will do now if the news of the Emperor's departure is true. If the Emperor had moved to Regensburg for the winter, the [Protestant] princes [Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Elector John Frederick I of Saxony] had intended to set up their winter camp with the bishops of Würzburg [Melchior Zobel] and Bamberg [Weigand of Redwitz].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] What Haller wrote at the end of his last letter about Duke Maurice is unfortunately true! With the help of the Bohemians, he has already occupied some towns in the Elector's territory. Some believe that he is preventing the Bohemians from occupying the absent Elector's territory. But given the old animosities between Maurice and the Elector, this is hardly likely. The rumor that the Elector will leave the [Schmalkaldic camp] is also not true.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] From Hungary, it is reported that [Sultan Suleiman I] is preparing a campaign for the coming spring. He is said to be sending artillery and provisions to Buda (Ofen). Oh, unfortunate Germany, attacked from all sides! Its only fortune is that it possesses the light of the Gospel. May God come to its aid!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] On November 9, the [Imperials] conducted raids up to a mile from Augsburg. This region is being terribly devastated! This week, wagons full of children and household goods from refugees have been constantly arriving in the city. They are met with mercy. Thank God!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger should now learn what was experienced with a refugee named Georg Caesar! He is a young pastor who, like his three brothers, is a master of the University of Wittenberg and fully supports the doctrines taught there. He fled with three or four others to Augsburg. The village [...] near Neuburg [a.d. Donau], where he served as pastor, was plundered by the Imperials. Although he and his companions were kindly received in Augsburg, he began to argue with [Wolfgang] Musculus and [Michael] Keller about the Lord's Supper, to the extent that even Musculus found his extreme view of the Lord's Supper too much. Yesterday [Sunday], he stood with some of his followers in the square near the inn where Lorenz [Meyer] and Rudolf [Schwyzer] live and spoke ill of the [preachers in Augsburg]. [Leonhard] Bächlin encountered the refugees there and was asked by Caesar where he was going. Bächlin replied that he was on his way to the Swiss pastors, possibly to join them for the sermon. Caesar then bitterly regretted that the people of Augsburg had not appointed Swabians but enthusiasts from Helvetia as preachers. Bächlin replied that Helvetia was the land of Canaan, where excellent church servants are trained. Caesar retorted that it was rather the land of Belial [the devil], where Zwinglian heretics are trained! He should show him a Helvetian who teaches correctly about the sacraments! Bächlin named Haller, who was appointed by the parish college and the authorities of Augsburg precisely because he teaches correctly. But Caesar insisted that Haller was an enthusiast and, despite his youth, had already led four others in the first year: three from Zurich [Meyer, Schwyzer, Thoman Ruman] and one from Basel [Sebastian Lepusculus]. Bächlin asked if Zwingli had not taught correctly. Caesar replied: "As he lived and taught, so he died!" Bächlin reported this to Haller and the other Swiss pastors. They immediately consulted with Frölich and decided that, according to Christ's instruction [in Mt 18, 15-18], Caesar would be summoned today before the meal only in the presence of those involved, Haller, Lorenz, and Schwyzer, and the witness Bächlin. They expressed surprise that, as a refugee who had found a friendly reception in Augsburg, he was not ashamed to make such statements. He was admonished to refrain from this in the future. He had also asked for a Swiss who teaches correctly about the sacraments; he had three before him, especially Haller. How can he accuse him of enthusiasm when he has never heard him speak about the sacraments? Furthermore, he had condemned the blessed Zwingli, whose works he had not read or not understood correctly! In summary: He acts against the church where he found refuge; he slanders the souls of the deceased as well as the entire people of Helvetia and its church servants, even the preachers and the church of Augsburg, to which the Zurich preachers belong, as evidenced by their [participation] in the holy communion. He must therefore improve! He replied that he would not deny any of these accusations, for he knew for certain that Zwingli was a heretic, whose followers were all like him. He was even willing to dispute this privately or publicly. The three Zurich pastors indicated to him that they were also ready to give an account of their faith and teaching based on the Holy Scriptures, publicly, especially since the steadfast church in Augsburg could not tolerate such quarrelsome behavior. He should rather stop condemning the innocent! He then said that not even Musculus shared their opinion. The Zurich pastors replied that, even if Musculus expressed himself somewhat differently from them about the Lord's Supper, they were ultimately of the same opinion. Then Musculus is just like them, he replied! It is feared that he could infect others with his poison. He even shouted: "I will never think or speak differently about Zwingli. Farewell with your Zwingli!" and added: "I told you so!" Everything was first reported to Frölich, then also to Musculus. The Zurich pastors then went to the mayors, taking Musculus with them, to make it clear to the authorities that they were not acting alone. The matter was presented to the mayors. It was emphasized that no one should be tolerated who claims that the Zurich pastors teach falsely about the Lord's Supper, especially since they were appointed by the authorities and confirmed in their office by the other Augsburg pastors. If they were now considered heretics, they should be dismissed. If not, such wolves [like Caesar] must be removed from the flock. This greatly troubled the mayors. However, the matter also provided a good opportunity to explore the sentiments of each mayor. Those who had been little inclined towards the Swiss preachers until then did not dare to make a sound. But the very mayor [Georg Herwart?], who is considered quite Lutheran, was outraged by the attackers' crude view. Tomorrow the matter is to come before the council. The outcome is uncertain. The good thing is that the Zurich [perhaps] will be spared from such attacks in the future.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Schwyzer is extremely reckless and careless! In the presence of Musculus, he said: "If I had [Caesar] in front of me when he stood at the gate, I would have stabbed him with my dagger!" Haller saw how Musculus was horrified by this and also replied: "You do not know what spirit you are of and what you are saying!" Furthermore, Schwyzer expressed himself in a very clumsy way in a sermon about the imagined presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper. Haller was ashamed of this; after all, he had made such great efforts until then to mediate the dispute with modesty and seriousness and to restore Zurich's reputation among the people of Augsburg! But now the old wound could reopen. For if Haller had to defend Schwyzer's chatter, as honor demands, he would thwart all his past efforts. But if he lets the stubborn Schwyzer fall, then some might think that he is giving up the truth. The Zurichers have truly burdened him with Schwyzer! A fierce conflict is to be feared because Schwyzer so sharply and inopportunely condemns the sacramental expressions [of the Augsburg church order] that he does not understand. Bullinger knows how much Musculus clings to these expressions. Through polemical attacks, he will never be dissuaded from them; rather through patience and frequent conversation. Lorenz [Meyer] is more learned than Schwyzer and therefore much more prudent. Bullinger should not think that Haller is fearful! These expressions also make him indignant; but he constantly thinks about how to avoid the dispute and eliminate the bad reputation that the Zurich church has. Yes, everyone should understand that the Zurichers also hold wise and appropriate opinions in spiritual matters, with the aim of offending as few people as possible and edifying as many as possible. It is ultimately thanks to Haller's one-year work in Augsburg that the authorities there have appointed more Zurich pastors. But now he reports about Schwyzer, not so that Bullinger will reprimand him, but because he seeks his advice. How should he dissuade Schwyzer from his destructive recklessness? Only if Haller explicitly requests it should Bullinger write to Schwyzer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The Zurich pastors have been commissioned to preach twice a week in the Katharinenkloster. Many nuns still live there. In the Martinskloster, the apartments for the Zurichers are being prepared.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] [Sebastian] Schertlin launched an attack on November 10 with 200 horsemen, 2000 arquebusiers and lancers, and four light cannons on the castle Bocksberg, previously occupied by the Imperials (it belongs to a miserly citizen, Georg [I.] von Stetten). The occupiers resisted and killed so many besiegers with projectiles and stones that the latter were put to flight, especially since they would have had to fear the deployment of cavalry from the nearby imperial camp in a prolonged siege. The unsuccessful expedition returned to Augsburg amid great mockery.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Today, horsemen have again left the city. Also, an imperial trumpeter [...] arrived. Allegedly, negotiations are underway with the authorities about a prisoner exchange.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] The Nurembergers have imposed severe penalties on those who insult the imperial majesty. A woman [...] was fined 50 guilders. She was told that the penalty would have been even greater if she had been a man. This is Nuremberg's half-gospel!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Haller will inform as soon as possible about new developments. Greetings, also to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther, and the other colleagues, to the family, and to Haller's father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli]. Greetings from the colleagues and from Frölich.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace. I recently wrote through the servant of the merchant Stephan Veit, through whom I also expect you to respond. Today, letters from Mr. Blaurer in Konstanz were delivered to Mr. Laetus, which also included yours addressed to him, which we read just now while dining with Mr. Bernardino and Mr. Stanggaro, the Italian, a very learned man and a great supporter of our cause.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The war is proceeding in a remarkable manner. The plans of both sides are being thwarted and rendered ineffective (the Lord's plan is advancing), so at this hour and moment, I am uncertain about what to write to you. Today, Mr. Laetus informed us that on the next Saturday, November 13, the Emperor left his camp with a select group of horsemen and traveled so far overnight, before our forces could find out, that it is difficult for our army, especially the infantry, to catch up with him again. He is said to have headed towards Nördlingen and the Duchy of Württemberg. He has placed all his baggage along with the artillery in the small towns of Dillingen and Lauingen with the remaining infantry. Such a plague and stench have invaded his camp, along with the mud, that it was impossible for him to remain there, especially with the supply from Bavaria failing, which has been not only exhausted but completely devastated by these tumults. However, it is doubted whether there is deceit involved or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Three days before this happened, our forces attacked his camp, drove away 300 cattle, and killed more than 400, both horsemen and infantry.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Now, what they will do (if it is true what is said about the Emperor's departure), we still do not know. Our princes had decided to winter with the bishops of Würzburg and Bamberg if the Emperor had moved to Regensburg. However, since things have turned out differently, the plan will be changed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>What I mentioned at the end of the last letter about Duke Maurice, alas, is true! He has occupied several towns with the help of the Bohemians, although many interpret this action in a favorable light for him, as he is supposedly protecting the Elector's province from being plundered by the Bohemian enemies in his absence. But whether this is the case, I very much doubt, as I am not unaware of the old, hateful rivalry between these princes, despite their close blood relationship. Some have foolishly claimed that the Elector will leave our side; but there is nothing to it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>It is written from Hungary that the Turk is preparing a major expedition for the coming spring. He is sending all his artillery and provisions to Buda. Thus, Germany is attacked and harassed from all sides (fortunate only in having the light of the Gospel - otherwise most unfortunate)! No end to the troubles is in sight, nor is salvation to be hoped for, unless the Lord finally brings judgment upon his enemies; something all the pious eagerly hope and expect he will do soon.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>On November 9, raids and plundering occurred just a mile away from the city. It is incredible how miserably this region is being devastated. Continuous wagons have entered the city this week, loaded with children and belongings of those fleeing the enemy incursions. Mercy is indeed being shown to them. Praise be to God, the best and greatest!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>But listen to what happened to us with a certain exile and refugee! There is a man named Georgius Caesar, one of three brothers (all of whom are masters from Wittenberg and ardent teachers of the doctrine held sacred there), a young man still and somewhat practiced in letters. He came to Augsburg with three or four others, having fled when his village near Neuburg, where he served as pastor, was plundered by the Emperor's forces. After arriving here, he spoke with Musculus and Cellarius and even began to argue about the sacrament, to the point that even Musculus could not bear his gross ignorance and reported to us all what kind of person he is. He and his companions were received honorably and, through our intercession, obtained from the authorities enough to sustain life at this time. However, yesterday, November 14, Caesar, standing in the market with some of his followers, spoke ill of us. The place where they stood was not far from the lodging of our Laurentius and Rodolphus. As they stood there, one of our companions, Leonhardus Rivulus, joined them, and Caesar asked him where he was going. He replied that he was going to see the lords of Zurich and perhaps attend the sermon. Caesar, unable to contain his bitter bile, burst out with these words: "What evil demon vexes the people of Augsburg that they do not seek preachers in Swabia but continually call such enthusiasts from Helvetia?" To which he replied: "Oh, Helvetia is the land of Canaan, the best nurse and fosterer of the ministers of God!" Then Caesar again: "It is the land of Belial, the fosterer of Zwinglian heretics. Show me," he said, "one among all the Swiss who sincerely teaches about the sacraments!" He, however, moved, said: "I will show you our Haller, who, unless he taught solidly and soundly, would never have been received by our college or magistrate." Then he: "We know," he said, "what kind of enthusiast that Haller is! He has already, though young, begotten four others in the first year: three from Zurich and one from Basel. What will he do next?" "Did Zwingli not teach correctly?" "As he taught and lived," he said, "so he died." Hearing these blasphemies, he came to us and reported them. We immediately consulted with the chief scribe and today, before lunch, summoned him alone according to the rule of Christ, with one witness, Leonhard, who had heard these things from him. We addressed him kindly and fraternally, wondering that he, a man promoted by our prayers, was not ashamed to pour out such things in our churches, over which we preside blamelessly in doctrine and life; therefore, we admonished him not to pour out similar things in the future; moreover, he had asked to be shown one Swiss who teaches correctly about the sacraments; now he sees three, especially me, of whom he particularly complained of enthusiasm; why does he dare to say this, having never yet heard me speak about the sacraments? Furthermore, he condemns the holy man Zwingli, whose works he has neither read nor, if he has read, understood correctly! Therefore, he acts against the peace of the church to which he fled; against the holy souls whom he condemns by cursing; against the entire Swiss nation and its ministers and churches; against us also and our entire church, into whose members we have been received; and we have testified this with that very symbol of the holy supper, for which he condemns us. Therefore, we pray him to return to better fruit, lest he provoke wasps against himself. To which he: he does not deny any of this. For he knows that Zwingli is a condemned scoundrel (these were his words), and all his accomplices are like him, and he wants to contend with us in public and private disputations, and other similar things, etc. We, however, replied that we are prepared to give an account of our faith and doctrine from the divine scriptures, not so much privately as publicly. We know that the church is so solidly established that it will not suffer him to sow such disturbances and seditious altercations. Therefore, we admonish him to desist and not to condemn the innocent so contumeliously. But when he rejected countless insults and among other things also said: "But Musculus does not agree with you!" - "But indeed he does," we said; "although the words still differ somewhat, the sense is the same." - "Then he is also like you!" he said. But when we found him so exacerbated and morose, fearing that he might secretly spread his poison against us and infect those who have scarcely returned to a sound mind, moreover, no longer bearing (not so much us being thus slandered and dishonored, but also other holy men, the venerable homeland, and all pure churches), we ordered him to remember all these words. To which he: "I will remember, nor will I speak or think otherwise of the Zwinglians as long as I live! Farewell (adding) with your Zwingli!" And with great virulence, even at the last, he shouted "I have spoken!" as if he had done well to speak so insolently to our face. We reported the matter to the chief scribe, then to Musculus, and taking him with us, lest we seem to act alone, but as public members of this church, we presented the matter to the consuls, complaining that we cannot bear that anyone should be free to say that none of us teaches soundly about the sacraments, since we have been called by the lords themselves and have sufficient testimonies from the churches over which we preside, moreover, we are joined to the other ministers of this city; therefore, either let them dismiss us if they consider us heretics, or remove such wolves from our flock. This greatly troubled the consuls, but nevertheless provided an excellent opportunity for all minds to be revealed. Here even those who are otherwise little favorable to our cause did not dare to speak. Indeed, one of the consuls, who seemed most inclined to Lutheranism, had an open confession against their crudeness. The matter will be brought before the senate tomorrow. What will happen, I do not know. I am glad that we have been given the opportunity to do this one thing, so that we may be safer from others in the future.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Schwyzer is exceedingly reckless and imprudent. He said in the presence of Musculus: "If I had gone out before the gate, I would have stabbed him with a dagger"; whereupon I saw that Musculus was greatly horrified (for he said: "You do not know whose spirit you are, what you say!" etc.). Furthermore, he immediately poured out all his heat in the upcoming sermon, babbling ineptly about the feigned presence of Christ, so that I was ashamed to hear him utter these things in the preparation of this cause. I fear that he may reopen the old wound, which I have scarcely healed with utmost modesty and gravity, and have made the name of Zurich, as far as it was in me, pleasing to all. I fear, lest, while I defend his nonsense as honor demands, I may destroy many things with some importunity, or, if I wish to leave him to his own head and not defend him, I may seem to have deserted the cause of truth itself (which may it be far from me!). Therefore, you have imposed a great burden on me through him. For he so inopportunely condemns those sacramental expressions, which he does not understand, that a not small contention is to be feared. You know how much Musculus still clings to these. We will never be able to remove them from him by contentions, but by gentleness and frequent conversation. Laurentius is more learned in this matter and therefore more prudent. Nor should you think that I am perhaps faint-hearted or evasive. Nothing less! I am equally impatient with that nonsense as they are, but I consider and meditate on how this can be removed in the best way without offense, and I take care as much as I can that the name of the Zurich church does not suffer ill through me, but that all may see that we too can judge spiritual matters spiritually, prudently, and as is fitting, yet with such simplicity, such candor, that we offend as few as possible, and gain as many as possible. How much I have achieved in this church in this one year, the whole church will testify, nor is it a small argument of it that our lords have again called ministers from the Zurich church. I wanted to write this to you alone, not that you should write or admonish him now (for it does not seem advisable at this time), but I write this only so that you may assist me with your counsel. For I see how much labor is needed to restrain this man from destructive recklessness. Nor do I write to wish him ill, but I wish him well all the more, as I think of consulting the common cause of the church. Therefore, do not write anything to him about this matter, I would like, before I advise.</p>

      <p>They have been assigned two sermons per week in the convent of St. Catherine, where many most obstinate nuns are still nourished, until they either repent or die. Their lodgings are being prepared in the convent of St. Martin.</p>

    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>You wonder what has been done by our people (the citizens) in the meantime. I will tell you: On November 10, Schertlius set out with 200 horsemen, 2000 arquebusiers (Büchsenschützen), and lancers (Lanzenträger), also having with him 4 falconets. He came to the castle Bocksperg, which belonged to a certain very avaricious citizen, Georg von Stetten. That castle, having been previously occupied by some of the Emperor's forces, Schertlius wanted to capture them there. However, they resisted in the castle as they approached, and having fired upon them with artillery, they wounded and killed many of our men and tore many of our men to pieces with stones, so that they were forced to withdraw again with the matter unfinished, for since that castle was not so far from the Emperor's camp, fearing that if they delayed there longer by besieging the castle, the Emperor's cavalry would come upon them and destroy them all. They therefore returned to the city with great mockery and shame. This is what has been done in the meantime.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Today, horsemen have again gone out. Also, an imperial trumpeter has arrived. What he is doing with the lords, I do not know, except that I hear he is negotiating about the redemption of captives.</p>
