      <p>Greetings in Jesus Christ, who is the true and only salvation.</p>
      <p>Reverend sir, I cannot restrain myself from writing a little to your kindness, having found a messenger, partly to testify my love towards you, and partly to refresh your memory of me. I would be exceedingly ungrateful if I allowed your kindness and courtesy towards me to fall into oblivion, and there is reason for me to cherish you for the very friendly and indeed brotherly benefits that I once experienced in the waves of my affairs. Farewell in Christ the Savior, along with your family, most happily.</p>
      <p>In haste, very quickly, Augsburg, October 6, 1557. I gave our Christoph 1 florin for a new fever remedy, 1 florin for shoes and some (so?) cups, which he owed to his mother’s family, also 1 florin for repairing trousers, making 2 florins.</p>
      <p>I do not write this for the purpose of demanding money, but so that you may know how difficult it is even for a young man to live here in Augsburg in such a great scarcity of things. Again, farewell and greet your whole family for me, all good people, especially my host Mr. Theodor Bibliander with his whole family.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Ehinger. Regarding what happened at Saint Quentin, as well as the great flood in Rome and Florence, which caused great damage, I am sure you have as good knowledge of it as we do here. With much piety, outstanding learning, and sincere doctrine, to the most excellent lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant and worthy pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
