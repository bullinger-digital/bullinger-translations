      <p>Greetings in the Lord, most learned Bullinger. I am sending here the catalog of books printed in Basel.</p>
      <p>The Froschauer have published nothing; they have under the press the works of St. Gregory and a more complete edition of Basil the Greek than before.</p>
      <p>Isengrin has published nothing except Glarean's booklet, which you have. He has Simplicius's Greek commentaries and Aristotle under the press.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Petri has published some various fathers and the Postil of Artopoeus, which were printed long ago.</p>
      <p>Brylinger has Pantaleon's Chronography, which you know what kind of book it is, and the biblical books in Greek and Latin.</p>
      <p>Oporinus has published: On Isaiah chapter 53, about the passion, death, and resurrection of Christ; on Psalm 21 about the morning deer; on Psalms 1 and 2; annotations and arguments on the Gospels of Nativity and Trinity by Georg Aemilius of Mansfeld, read in the school of Siegen.</p>
      <p>On the power and office of a prince in the well-governed republic, book 11, by Jacob Omphalius of Andernach.</p>
      <p>The entire human philosophy divided into three parts, namely rational, natural, and moral, book 3 by Hermann Wildenberg...</p>
      <p>Polybius's Stratagems to the emperors Antoninus and Verus, 8 books, containing the most extensive military doctrine, translated from Greek into Latin by Justus Walter Wetteranus.</p>
      <p>Four books of Colloquies by Johannes Moriseti, a physician, to his son Constantine; the same author's booklet on the paregmenon against the detractors of Cicero.</p>
      <p>Six books by Nicolaus Gerbel of Phorcensis for the declaration of the picture or description of Greece by Sophianus.</p>
      <p>Ten books of Pausanias on all of Greece, translated by Abraham Loescher.</p>
      <p>An explanation of the Nicene Creed, faithfully reciting the doctrine of the church of God in order, with a preface by Philipp Melanchthon.</p>
      <p>An exceedingly complete oration on the greatness of God's mercy, first written in Italian by Marsilio Andreasi of Mantua, now translated into Latin by Celio Horatio Curione, son of Celio Secundus. Also, three sermons by Bernardino Ochino on the office of a Christian prince, five sacred declamations.</p>
      <p>The history of Francis Spiera, who, because he denied and condemned the profession of evangelical truth once undertaken, fell into horrendous despair, described by four men... Martin Porrhai's judgment on the use that Spiera's example and doctrine provide.</p>
      <p>On the usurpation of laws and the studies of those who take on the profession of jurisprudence, book 8 by Jacob Omphalius.</p>
      <p>The topography of the city of Rome to Francis, king of the Gauls, the invincible liberator of the same city, comprehended in 5 books by Bartholomew Martian, knight of St. Peter, author.</p>
      <p>Added to the previous edition by the same author: Descriptions of the city and its notable buildings and many other things worthy of memory. Some errors removed. Titles and inscriptions most accurately expressed as they were on the marbles themselves, which have been published by others in a neglected order and incorrectly found.</p>
      <p>A historical calendar written by Paul Eber of K/Rillhingen.</p>
      <p>A book of various poems by Vitus Amerpachius and some others.</p>
      <p>Commentaries by Xystus Betuleius of Augsburg on M. T. Cicero's three books on the nature of the gods and Paradoxes.</p>
      <p>Hervagius: Ten treatises on astrology by Guido Bonatti of Forlì, comprehending the entire judicial reasoning concerning nativities, art, and weather.</p>
      <p>Added: The book of Claudius Ptolemy... with the very ancient commentaries of George of Trebizond.</p>
      <p>Six books by Euclid of Megara, philosopher and mathematician, the first on the principles of geometry in Greek and Latin together with demonstrations of propositions without the notes of letters, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the rules of algebra, due to the examples of numbers, are added to the propositions throughout these books, prefaced by Johannes Scheubel of the University of Tübingen, ordinary professor of Euclid.</p>
      <p>The works of Nazianzen in Greek and Latin, all that exist. These are the books that Basel published at the Frankfurt fairs. Good God, what a fertile producer of books Basel is. I wish to know what is happening in Augsburg; various things are being spread: they say Granvelle is dead by an execrable kind of death, some say otherwise. If you have any certain information, share it.</p>
      <p>A medical woman has been thrown into prison, although ordered to leave, but she came again into the territory of our city. She had various arts of deception and indeed acted deservedly against those impious men who consulted her. About which matter more copiously next time. Marcus and Sultzer were called to her, what they did there... I still do not know.</p>
      <p>The Turk has two camps in Moravia or, if you prefer, towards Moravia, from which he inflicts great damage on the rural people and those without walls and ditches. A Turkish war is undoubtedly imminent in the coming spring. What do you think will happen with our Gumpenberg? He has some friends unknown to us, who perhaps, as they say, spur him on.</p>
      <p>Persecution has begun in Lower Germany; may the Lord console and strengthen the pious, so they do not deviate a hair's breadth from the truth of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours.</p>
