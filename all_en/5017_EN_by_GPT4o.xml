      <p>S. How unwillingly I involve myself in civil matters, God is my witness; but I am sometimes so urgently pressed that I do not dare to refuse what I could have honorably declined. Gorgius Carli, who has otherwise deserved well of me, came to me and earnestly asked me to write to you in this matter, etc. The Bishop of Konstanz, who has passed away, was very closely related to him by blood; therefore, he is also an heir along with others. But when the bishop initially took office, he found great debts and therefore extended his own goods to the amount of eight thousand guilders to redeem the pledged silverware.</p>
      <p>Now, however, he has died without a will; the heirs fear they will be delayed by the chapter for a long time. Therefore, the common Three Leagues write to the chapter; our senate also writes to the honorable council of Z端rich with a request to give a recommendation to Captain Gorgius and Joachim Gugelberg to the chapter. Therefore, Mr. Gorgius earnestly requests you to speak well to one or two of the council, especially to the city clerk, so that he may pursue this recommendation in the best form. For if the chapter senses earnestness from Z端rich, it will do much about it.</p>
      <p>My lord mayor Tscharner, whose stepbrother is Gorgius Carli, also requests you to do your best. They also promise to be indebted to you in good matters.</p>
      <p>I earnestly ask you not to take it badly that I trouble you so often. I know your occupations.</p>
      <p>I also had six hundred other things to do; but Gorgius Carli is not a bad Z端richer and has not once revealed many secrets, of which he is aware, and can do so in the future. I return Mr. Coignet's letters; he wrote to me in the same sense, but a little more modestly. They are also accustomed to this; so they have it.</p>
      <p>For a while, their greatest complaint was that they did not want to take the money from them. But, what I think, I have written back.</p>
      <p>Philipp's messenger will not carry out his task so very firmly; but he continues to nest; for then the pot comes together flatly. The people do not want to notice that, etc.</p>
      <p>You should know this secret, that the Five Places have made an agreement with the previous chapter and bishop of Konstanz and the chapter, that as soon as the Glarus war begins, they will also rise with force. It is well to suspect that if another is chosen, the bell will be cast anew. Gorgius Carli has already told our consul this with the attestation that as soon as war arises, he would also have written to the Z端rchers; in the meantime, because he was so closely related by blood to the bishop, he wanted to keep this silent.</p>
      <p>He knows about all the dealings.</p>
      <p>Therefore, keep a watchful eye on the chapter and the new bishop; do not believe all good words. This suddenly.</p>
      <p>May God the Lord preserve your reverence in all good! In Chur, on the 8th of October, in the year 1561.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
