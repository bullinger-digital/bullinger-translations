      <p>S. I have sent the letters written from Vienna.</p>
      <p>From the letters written by the king on the 12th of this month, I understood nothing except that everything is in order in the army, in which he himself is present. Colonel Frelich informs me that the king has not decided to attack the adversary, who is struggling with hunger and disease and is in great financial difficulty, although they outnumber us. Would that God incline the hearts of the princes towards peace and to those things which they ought to care for most! If you wish to send anything to me, do not hesitate to give it to the postmaster, who will send anything to me more safely than a personal messenger.</p>
      <p>When I have something worthy to be entrusted to letters, I will write to your most honorable council or to Mr. Consul.</p>
      <p>Greet them and my friends in my words.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 20th of September, 1558.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>The Castle of Santal in Piedmont was captured by the adversaries with great loss to their own. The Duke of Florence is preparing arms.</p>
      <p>The Pope is very ill.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
