      <p>Worthy and highly favorable, dear sir. This little letter, which is enclosed here, I kindly ask you to send to Mr. Fr√∂lich with the first opportunity you may have, so that it may certainly reach him.</p>
      <p>We have no news, except that the King of Denmark, along with the Hanseatic cities, has agreed on a certain alliance and is now holding meetings to unite with each other, God grant grace. The King of England is supposed to have been asked by the Emperor to accept the Interim; however, he does not want to and remains steadfast. Duke Maurice and his brother Duke Augustus are said to be highly at odds because of the Interim; Duke Maurice wants to have the Interim, but the other does not; he has the daughter of the King of Denmark.</p>
      <p>I would like to know from you whether the King in France, my lord, has called for this day on the 24th of February, or whether it happened at his request and desire, or solely because of the common affairs of the Confederates.</p>
      <p>So I ask you, as my highly trusted, to inquire with some of the authorities there: if I could not stay in Basel or if the Five Places would not tolerate me there, whether I might be allowed to stay with you in Zurich for my (s?) to be tolerated and whether it would be good, then I would come to you myself before this day. Committed to the grace of God.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel on the first of February in the year 1549. S[ebastian] Schertlin, knight, signed.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, etc., my favorable lord, to be delivered.</p>
