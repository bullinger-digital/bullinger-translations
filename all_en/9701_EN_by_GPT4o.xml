Reverend Father, we received your letters quite promptly, and I had intended to respond to them immediately; but I was delayed by Lady Magdalena, who promised to write together, if she had first prepared certain things to be sent to your reverence.

However, in that place, he was struck by a severe and acute illness and returned home, where he became so weak that we almost despaired of his life. In that grief, all of us, especially his wife and sister, were, as your reverence can easily imagine. But, again, honor be to God,...</p>
