    <p xml:id="regest1">Nowhere else has Frölich found such friendliness as in Zurich, and regarding scholarship and piety, he rightly marvels that the [Zurichers] are so far ahead of other theologians. - After Frölich and [Jakob] Funcklin were accompanied a little way out of Zurich by Bullinger and Gwalther, they reached Baden on the same day. The next day they ate in Kaiserstuhl and spent the night in Schaffhausen, where they met the local pastor Simprecht [Vogt], who treated them in a somewhat rustic manner. On the third day, they arrived in Stein [am Rhein], where they dined with the pastor Georg [Wimpfer]. Then they reached Konstanz, where Frölich spent one and a half days with the brothers [Ambrosius and Thomas] Blarer, Konrad Zwick, and others. Frölich will depart at one o'clock in the afternoon. - On the way, he composed some verses and left them with Jakob Funcklin in Konstanz, who will send them to Zurich. - Frölich has given Bullinger's lecture on concord [in religious matters] in [Konstanz] for copying; if the copy is error-free, [the original] will be returned to Bullinger with this letter; otherwise, Frölich will take it with him to Augsburg and send it back from there. - He belatedly delivers a letter addressed to him from Matthias Erb and another [above No. 2248] from Nikolaus [Müller, known as] Maier [to Bullinger]. - Bullinger should provide the [Augsburgers] as soon as possible with a pious and steadfast [pastor], so that Lutheranism does not gain influence. - Greetings to the [Zurich colleagues] in the haven of scholarship, [whose names] Bullinger has written down for him on a list.</p>

      <p>Greetings. With what expectation and desire I arrived in Zurich, my most esteemed Heinrich, I know, and I am not unaware of how abundantly and plentifully everything I sought with you was answered. For if I consider humanity, I testify that I have never seen anything more humane; if I consider doctrine and piety, I am rightly astonished that some of theological renown are left so far behind by you, so that I will never cease to give thanks to the most good God for such men given to us and to intercede for their preservation - which I ask you to understand from me with no other feeling than that of truth and affection.</p>
      <p>After the semi-secret and delightful company of you and our Gwalther outside Zurich, on that day Funcklin and I safely reached Baden. The next day we had lunch in Kaiserstuhl; afterwards, we reached Schaffhausen in good time, where we spent the night. We greeted Simprecht, the minister of the word there, who behaved somewhat rustically towards us. For when we found him engaged in a rather childish task, namely repairing a somewhat broken box, he did not address us, indeed he allowed us to stand before him until he finished his little task; which took almost a quarter of an hour. But I bear no grudge and would not wish it to be revealed to anyone, since perhaps the man's manners and custom bore it without any sinister affection. On the third day, we had lunch in Stein, where Master Georg, the minister of the church, met us familiarly and graced our table.</p>
      <p>Then with favorable steps, we returned to Konstanz. I spent two nights and a half day in Konstanz and enjoyed myself with the excellent men, the Blarer brothers, Konrad Zwick, and others. Today, indeed, at the first hour of the afternoon, I am about to set sail from here in the name of God.</p>
      <p>On the journey, which I undertook from Zurich to here, I composed some extemporaneous verses, which I left with Jakob Funcklin in Konstanz, who will send them to Zurich at some point.</p>
      <p>I have given your lecture on the matter of reconciliation to be copied here, which copy, if it is accurately written, will be sent to you from Konstanz with this letter; if not, I will take it with me to Augsburg, from where I will send it back to you. I am sending you the letters of Mr. Nikolaus Maier and Matthias Erb now, asking that you do not take my negligence too harshly and that you reply to Mr. Maier.</p>
      <p>Finally, and most importantly, gather the brothers and consult about providing us with a pious and steadfast man, and do not omit any effort to expand the sincere religion of Christ, and confer your work of love upon us, and do so quickly, lest some Lutheran wolf rush into the fold.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell, most distinguished man, and convey my greetings to your renowned abode of Pallas, to each of the lively organs of Christ, truly respectable and pious men, whose catalog you have given me in writing.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, the last day of September in the year 1545. Yours, Georg Laetus, chief scribe of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, perpetual friend and brother.</p>
