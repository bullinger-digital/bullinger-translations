    <p xml:id="regest1">Because the Reformation work of Erasmus Schmid, who has been active in the lordship of Reichenweier since the winter, is not yet completed, the Zurich pastors should persuade the council that Schmid does not have to return to Zurich - as happened with Grynaeus in Tübingen - but that he can stay for another three or four years beyond June 24.</p>

      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings beforehand, highly learned, honorable, dear, special ones.</p>
      <p>A respectable council of the city of Zurich, at our gracious request and undoubtedly also through your willing help and support (for which we thank you graciously), has granted and sent Master Erasmus Fabricius last winter to instruct and edify our subjects in the lordship of Horburg in Riquewihr in the true religion and service of God, and to employ him alone until the upcoming (next) St. John's Day. However, such an important undertaking cannot be carried out and completed in such a short time as necessity requires, which would then, along with what has been begun in a godly and well manner during this short time, as we hope in the Lord, fall into oblivion and not be completed. What offense would follow from this, you, as the highly understanding and experienced in these matters, can easily and well assess for yourselves. We have not found you otherwise before and still consider (hold) that you are entirely inclined to not hinder but to promote and spread the honor of Christ and His holy word as much as possible, as you know you are obliged to do. Therefore, it is our gracious request to you that you diligently intercede with a respectable council in Zurich, our dear and good friends, so that the aforementioned Master Erasmus may be granted to continue what he has begun for another three or four years for the more thorough instruction and edification of our subjects, with the confidence that the aforementioned council will not find it burdensome to agree to this for the reasons stated, and that your subjects in your lands are better provided for than ours, and will not refuse or deny us the man - as they did with Master Simon Grynaeus (who could have achieved not insignificant benefit among many people) when he was to remain in Tübingen for a while, our friendly, dear lord and brother - for this time. In this, the aforementioned council and you will undoubtedly render and prove not a small service to Almighty God. We will also be inclined to consider this graciously towards you.</p>
      <p>Given in Riquewihr, the 6th of June in the year etc. 36.</p>
      <p>G[eorg], C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned and honorable, our dear, special preachers in Zurich, together and individually.</p>
