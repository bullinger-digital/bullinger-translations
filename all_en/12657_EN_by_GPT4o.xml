    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer wished he had a messenger available more often so that he could always report to Bullinger immediately.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He inquired with [Konrad] Hofherr about the six guilders. Hofherr said he would send them [to Zurich] as soon as his brother-in-law [Fridle...] from Bischofszell reimbursed him this amount and sent it to Konstanz, and that he wanted to write to [Hans] Meefuss about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The people of Memmingen are well informed about the capture of the messenger [Konrad Schweri]. Thus, Blarer was able to learn everything from the Memmingen city clerk [Georg Maurer], who was currently in Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer sends a current letter from [Georg] Frölich with a request for return. They are waiting hourly for further news [about the course of the war].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Regarding the reasons why the matter [of the Schmalkaldic League] is not progressing, Blarer completely agrees with Bullinger. He is equally anxious about both the victory and defeat [of the Schmalkaldic League]! Bullinger knows why [Publius Cornelius Scipio] Nasica [Corculum] did not want to destroy Carthage and what good consequences his hesitation had. Similarly, Blarer hardly dares to think about the effects of a success of the [Protestants]...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Several weeks ago, he was also informed about the fate of Thomas Naogeorgus and has also read the articles of faith that were charged against him by the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony]. There are other similar cases to report, but he did not want to trouble Bullinger with them. It would also be good if the public learned about it as late as possible. If the situation among the Protestants is already [so tense] now, how might it be when there is no longer an enemy!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blarer thinks like Bullinger about the mathematicians and their predictions, but approves of Jakob Ruf's attitude in this regard, who recently shared [his thoughts] on the constellation of the heavens with him. In any case, the Lord of Heaven will direct everything for our salvation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Blarer has heard about the [Bernese's plan to invade Burgundy], but knew nothing of the [protective] alliance between Burgundy and the Confederation. Such an undertaking would certainly cause offense and would also be dangerous. Therefore, it should definitely be prevented!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] A Konstanz resident [Konrad Zwick?] well-disposed towards the Confederates writes from the [Schmalkaldic camp near Füssen] to a friend [Thomas Blarer?] about the indecent behavior of the nine Confederate companies stationed there, each barely comprising 200 men. They fight among themselves, do not fulfill their obligations, but take everything they can. [The captain] Hans Blum from St. Gallen and another [Ottmar Fridbolt] were even granted leave because of their behavior. It is uncertain whether the others will stay. They insist on having their own colonel, which the commissioners [of Philip of Hesse] do not want to approve.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The Bernese request [for the dispatch of Pastor Jodocus Kilchmeyer] is commendable, so that unity in faith can finally be achieved. If only Bullinger could go to Bern for a while until the dispute is settled!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] [Lukas] Schrotteisen, the [legal advisor] of Duke Christoph of Württemberg, was in Konstanz and reported that the Duke is with [King Francis I.], the latter being well-disposed towards the [Schmalkaldic League], wanting to send them 2000 horsemen and also money (as Bullinger can gather from Frölich's letter).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] May God cause Emperor Charles [V.] to meet the fate that Bullinger wishes for him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Bullinger has read a copy of the imperial letter to the [Nine] places. It is a disgrace how the magistrate of these places lies to be able to influence [politics]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Blarer must stop, as the messenger [...] arrives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Konrad Zwick has not yet returned [from Füssen].</p>

      <p>Especially trusted, dear lord and brother, I wish I had a messenger available more often so that I could always send you whatever I had immediately!</p>

      <p>I inquired with Curioni about the six guilders. He said that his brother-in-law would pay them and send them today or tomorrow, and that he would also write to Meefuss about it. If it doesn't happen, let me know. I will make sure that he pays. He lent the money to his brother-in-law in Bischofszell.</p>

      <p>Regarding the detained messenger, the people of Memmingen are well aware of the situation. The city clerk of Memmingen is currently here and has informed me of everything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I am sending you the latest letter from Leti, from which you will be informed of the situation at that time. We are waiting hourly to hear what has happened since. Please send the letter back to me, as I am keeping everything together for reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Regarding the reasons why our matter is not progressing, I completely agree with you, and I am equally anxious about both the victory and the defeat, although there is a great difference. You know why Nasica did not want Carthage to be conquered and what negligence security brings. What our own people will incite among themselves, I see before my eyes in temporal and religious matters, and I do not like to trouble myself with the thought, as I cannot change it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I was informed about Thomas Naogeorgus a few weeks ago and received the articles that the Elector accused him of teaching. I did not want to write to you about it or trouble you with it, as I know much more about these things and learn daily more than I would like, and I would very much prefer that many other people did not know either. May God, in His grace, prevent it from being known too soon! Oh God, if we were to become lords in the land and have no more resistance, how badly it would go for us! We do not want to direct ourselves in such a troubled time against God's will! How would it be if we no longer had to fear anyone? God help us! There is fear and distress on the right and left sides.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Regarding the mathematicians and their judgments, I feel the same as you. However, I approve of the diligent and very devoted spirit of our Jakob Ruf, who recently wrote to me about the appearance of the sky. But we will worship the Lord of Heaven and attribute everything to Him alone, who will direct everything for our salvation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I have heard about Burgundy, that it is present, but truly did not know that it is in alliance with you. It would certainly be a matter that should not be, and would cause a bad outcry, to which no luck would be attached. Whoever can, should prevent it and do their best; it should not happen! One quickly oversteps in these matters, so that God becomes angry.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Regarding your Confederates, I cannot hide from you that a good citizen from here, who is a good Confederate and is now with them, writes to a trusted friend as follows: "The Confederates have become so unruly. They kill each other and cut off hands. They have completely lost their good reputation. They not only do not pay what they owe, but also take much that comes to them. They have a very bad government among themselves. There are nine companies, but under one barely 200, etc. Yesterday they were mustered. The Plum from St. Gallen and another have behaved so uselessly beyond measure that the commissioners have given them leave. I do not know if the others will stay or not. They do not want to be under our command, but want to have their own colonel. But our Hessian and Landgrave commissioners do not want to do that," etc. This he wrote. Please take it in good part. I know well that you will not take offense at this.</p>

      <p>The request from Bern for your people is excellently good, and you should not spare anything in this regard, no matter how burdensome it may be for you, so that you may reconcile and unite in teaching. It is unbelievable what disadvantages will arise over time. I wish you could be in Bern for a while until everything settles!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Doctor Schrotysen from Mympelgart, who is with Duke Christoph of Württemberg, has been here. I have talked with him about various things. He says that Duke Christoph is now with the Frenchman, who has shown much goodwill towards ours and would like to send 2000 horsemen, if desired, as you will also learn from Leti's letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>May God grant that it is not in vain in prayers that Emperor Charles's fate is found as you write, and your prophecy comes true! The Lord God will make it good. If only we were good too, all matters would soon be helped.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>I have read a copy of the emperor's letter to the V ort. One would become wild that these lords, because they are powerful, want to make seeing eyes blind and hearing ears deaf with force, daring to present the lie so shamelessly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I must stop. Now this messenger comes unexpectedly. Given on Wednesday at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
