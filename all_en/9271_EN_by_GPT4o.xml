      <p>Greetings. I certainly have not sent you any letters, dear brother, for no other reason than that Lucius consistently assured me, whenever I would have sent him, that no one from the Rhaetians had come to the fair to whom the letters could be safely entrusted. And when Thomannus, the city treasurer, was heading to Rapperswil for the assembly, I entrusted him with the news I am now sending; for I thought he would travel all the way to you; but he soon returned and handed back what he had received. The assembly was indeed called by our people, but at the request of the people of Glarus, from where a delegate, Mr. Hessius, was sent to you in the name of all the other cantons. However, the news I am now sending, please return to us with the next messenger.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, you will share it with the lords and brothers Mr. Willi, Mr. Campell, Mr. Gregor the captain, and other faithful ones.</p>
      <p>I received letters from England from three bishops and a senator and a merchant from London.</p>
      <p>They wrote theirs in February: in England and Scotland, everything is very peaceful; they do not recall any war undertaken against the French. Conflicts are thriving among them, partly from the papists, partly from the Anabaptists; the queen is strongly restraining the papists, the Anabaptists are being confounded by the doctors. The great assembly of the English kingdom will be celebrated on April 1st. Several others are brought to me from various places, but they contain nothing noteworthy, except these very things, which are confirmed in those news. It is added that on April 14th, a king will be elected in Poland; the election will be dangerous. The electors of the empire have sent delegates for the emperor's son, who is seeking that kingdom. Rumor is now beginning to spread here that in La Rochelle, the Duke of Aumale, along with some leading figures and principal warriors, has been killed by the king's side, to whom the Huguenots are causing much damage and mixing everything with their very strong eruptions. Let us see whether God will always watch over the Confederates and bear their unheard-of greed, arrogance, and defiance, commanded by God and the world. The most just judge will neither err nor deceive. Today is the 8th day since our Mr. Haller shared yours with me. It is the same whether you write to him or to me. You truly will be entirely in this dangerous action, so that the matter is settled by law and justice, not by force or armed hand.</p>
      <p>The Lord says, "You shall execute justice justly." I pray to the Lord to grant peace and to be present with justice and the just.</p>
      <p>I also pray to Him to comfort and strengthen you. Pray in turn to the Lord for me. I wonder whether my book "On the Persecutions of the Church" has been delivered to you and what you and other good men think of it. Be always strong and steadfast in the Lord. The Lord will give strength.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your family, lords, brothers, and friends, whom you will greet in order. Mine greet you. April 3, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at Chur at St. Martin.</p>
