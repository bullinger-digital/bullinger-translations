      <p>My friendly greetings and willing service with the offering of all honor, love, and good things are ready to be sent to you, etc., well-learned, dear sir.</p>
      <p>I want to let you know that in Neunforn, the situation is bad because of the Anabaptists, who are misleading the poor devout people, so that I do not know what I should do. Since St. John's Day in the year '32, I have had five of them executed, and many others imprisoned and fined. But they do not care at all and do not want to listen to their pastor or shepherd, do not attend the word of God, because they say he taught them that infant baptism is not right. They also say he preached that tithes are not made into a debt, so they are not obliged to give them according to the New Testament. However, whoever has sold the tenth part of his produce on the ground is obliged to give the tithe. They hold such and other things against him and do not want to hear him anymore, saying he is a false prophet, etc. And therefore, it would be my best opinion if you could make an exchange and remove him from there and put another in his place, as he is quite old and has many children and is daily afflicted, so he is not diligent in studying the scriptures, and he has disputes with the peasants under him, who perhaps only suck out the poison. For truly, this one does no good anymore. I did not want to hide my best opinion from you, so that the matter may be addressed. For I am concerned that when my term is over, he will not remain long in Neunforn, as he is the first to have preached the true word of God, also consecrated and otherwise, so that the five places are not very fond of him, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding our pastor in Frauenfeld, I am now dealing as I have discussed with you, etc. With this, may the peace of God be with us all and grant you and us all a devout good end. Amen, etc.</p>
      <p>Done on the 19th of May in the year '33.</p>
      <p>Your always willing Hans Edlibach, bailiff in Frauenfeld.</p>
      <p>The provost of Embrach would be good to deal with Mr. Niklaus.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned devout Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, my dear shepherd and lord and friend.</p>
