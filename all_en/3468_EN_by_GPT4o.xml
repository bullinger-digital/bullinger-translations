      <p>Greetings. As soon as I received your letter, I spoke privately with GÃ¶ldia to understand her state of mind, and since I found her not unwilling to comply, I did not involve anyone else. She hopes that you, along with others, will somewhat soften the harshness of her master, so that she may live more comfortably with him. She is somewhat weak and suffers from a bit of melancholy.</p>
      <p>Therefore, her husband should be more cautious with his wisdom, to avoid increasing disturbances and contentions, and out of marital piety, he should bear the weakness of the more fragile instrument and, as much as he can, heal it.</p>
      <p>She promises to come, as she should, and with part of her belongings. As far as I can see, Italy is going to have a long war, evidently because the Frenchman is aiming at Milan, for which he is said to be attempting the utmost. In the Netherlands, it is said that he has suffered a defeat, but the Swiss were not involved.</p>
      <p>The plague, however, is spreading in the army, as evidenced by the many who come here half-dead or pass through here. Others complain that the wages are being paid stingily, and they predict that the war will be most unfortunate.</p>
      <p>I wish the magistrates would think more diligently about avoiding the guilt of bloodshed and ensuring the safety and well-being of the country. Rumor, lest you be unaware, has already reached me and my brothers several times that Ferdinand has decided something more moderate regarding religion in Alsace and Sundgau, allowing communion under both kinds and the marriage of priests; however, he wants to keep at least one mass in each parish; yet he makes the attendance free and not at all forced for the subjects. If this is true, we may soon hope for a not regrettable progress of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Countless people are expecting the promulgation of this decree at any moment. A new chancellor will be sent to Ensisheim, the son of Zasius, a man not alien to the purity of religion, to succeed Stumpf, the most hostile enemy of the gospel of Christ. I am deeply saddened that there is neither an end nor a limit to the discord among the Saxons.</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly, the most pious Philipp is greatly disturbed by this, not only for his own sake, as he is bitterly attacked, but more for the public's sake, and there is a danger that because of them, the plan for a general assembly may not proceed.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord, as the only thing I can do, that He may have mercy on the church and grant peace. Farewell in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 10, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
