    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter yesterday and led the messenger to him after returning from [Peter] Fuchs; [in Biel] they are all doing well, but everything is expensive. The rumors about a growing following of Emperor [Charles V] among the Evangelicals may perhaps aim to counteract the influence of the [French] King [Francis I]; new tensions have arisen between Bern and Geneva. [Rudolf] Gwalther wrote to Frey that Luther had previously scorned the writings of the Zurichers; Frey's uncle heard how Fleuriatus Glareanus in Baden mockingly commented on the mutual denunciation of Luther and Zwingli; the uncle does not entrust his son to him for education due to differing beliefs, but Frey himself remains true to the recognized truth. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, your letter was delivered to me, most kind father. I led the messenger you sent to [Peter] Fuchs as soon as he returned home. We are all doing well; my affairs are in a happy state as always, thanks to God. However, everything is expensive here.</p>
      <p>Regarding the news that is spreading everywhere today, these are the rumors among us: Our dear ones are said to be living a carefree and idle Epicurean life, the Emperor [Charles V] is most hostile to us, and the people of Nuremberg, along with the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, have defected to him; thus, day by day, the people of our religion are inclined to fall because of Charles. Whether these things are true or false, it is a great temptation; for some are trying to hand over the minds of our people, conquered by these intrigues, to the king. The people of Bern are again at odds with the Genevans; some threaten them with destruction because of new injuries.</p>
      <p>Recently, Mr. [Rudolf] Gwalther wrote to me about Mr. Luther: "I would have been deceived if the monk had written amicably, for I once extorted from those who most defend the man with his errors, that they admitted he does not even deign to read the books or letters of the Zurichers, but immediately, upon knowing the titles, rejects whatever it is." Yet there are those whose hearts seem to rejoice in his praises, if I remember correctly what my uncle told me about Fleuriatus Glareanus, namely that when he was bathing in Baden, he was asked by a certain Zurcher what he thought of our religion's teachers, Luther and Zwingli, and he replied: "What else, but what those great men have taught me to feel through their books? For Luther accuses Zwingli of heresy, and he in turn condemns him of apostasy. Which, unless I wish to refute both as liars, I will indeed admit to be true." But what could be more suitable to keep the blind in their blindness, especially with the Zurcher remaining silent on this?</p>
      <p>Shortly after, my uncle added: "If you were of our religion, I would now send my son to be educated by you." But everywhere, those who have similar lips have lettuce. Let them follow those they admire. May they not find those they flee from; for he who despises the merchant is not worthy of his goods. I, for my part, now carry out with great enthusiasm what I have begun, as I learn and see daily that the world is vain, but God is truly the only truth, and that, as He threatened through Moses, He strikes the despisers of His word with such blindness and madness. Yet may He, who has given all things, grant everyone a better mind.</p>
      <p>My most obedient greetings. My brothers, my most esteemed lords, also send their greetings. You will also greet yours and mine in my name, to whom I could not write due to the messenger's quick departure. Farewell. October 22, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my most esteemed lord and father. Zurich.</p>
