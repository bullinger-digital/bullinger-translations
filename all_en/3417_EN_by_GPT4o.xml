      <p>Praise be to God, the year 1557, on the 27th of November in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God, our Savior and Father, I wish to you and yours, along with the offering of my most willing service, honorable and highly learned sir. Mr. Bullinger, know that your honorable and friendly letter was delivered to me on the 26th of this month by your dear son Christoph, and I have understood its contents. Indeed, gracious sir, I have not shown your dear son any particular honor or friendship, but I am still willing to do so. If he needs my service, he should not hesitate to ask.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to say about him other than that he is full of discipline and decency. May God the Lord keep him and all of us in His divine grace with steadfastness. Amen. And if I were to learn of any small or great impropriety from him, I would not allow it; for it is the duty of every Christian to admonish one another from evil and to call each other to all good. At this time, I have nothing special to write to you, except that if I can prove my honorable love and service to you, I am always inclined and willing. And your letter, which is meant for Vienna, shall be sent there at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God Almighty in His divine grace. Gracious Mr. Bullinger, I have a request to make of your honor, that you would have this enclosed letter delivered to my stepsister, who lives in Zurich, with a silk worker. The address is to Anna Barber√ºsin in Zurich, and she can be inquired about at the mint master. This is my friendly request to your honor, that you would find out in Zurich how she is doing, in the hope that she will conduct herself well and honorably; for she has always been prudent and honorable from her youth.</p>
      <p>In the hope that God the Lord will continue to keep her so, and if she conducts herself well, she shall benefit from it; if not, she should not consider me a brother. I will owe all this to your honor in return.</p>
      <p>Your honor's humble and willing Wilhelm Barberos, cloth cutter.</p>
