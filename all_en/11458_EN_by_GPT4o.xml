In Strasbourg, Ruprecht von Mosham has proven to be a stubborn opponent; he not only teaches justification by faith and works but also believes that God's law is fulfillable. [Emperor] Charles is still in the Netherlands and is being incited against the Protestants. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If you are recovering more and more each day, I am glad.</p>
      <p>Behold, I am sending Otto back to you (for I have recalled him from France at the request of his parents). He is a pious and learned young man, the likes of whom (pardon the expression) Zurich has not yet nurtured. This testimony is given not only by me but also by learned men. Therefore, if you use him rightly, not only your school but the entire city will rejoice in the future. You have an excellent school that seems to lack nothing, but if you add dialectics and mathematics, which Otto will rightly oversee, it will lack even less. He will prove to be an expert here; for he knows not only how to teach those arts but also how to practice them. In this matter, if anything can benefit youth more, especially in these times, I do not see it (I speak of human disciplines). Therefore, welcome Otto and support him as he deserves, and you will never regret it.</p>
      <p>The people of Strasbourg have dealt with Ruprecht von Mosham and found him to be a very stubborn man in his counsel; he is confident in what has been objected to him. I recently wrote about his doctrine, namely that works together with faith justify. Now he adds that a person can reach the highest perfection in this life and therefore that God's law is possible to fulfill.</p>
      <p>Charles is still in the Lower Germany; what he is planning is unknown. It is certain that the papal scales incite him against us more than enough. However, there is hope that the Lord will be with us, provided we do not falter.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your children and wives; I also always wish well to Pellican and the others.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, August 20, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned gentlemen Heinrich Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander, in the Lord, yours.</p>
