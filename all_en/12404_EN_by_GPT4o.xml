    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger was very pleased with Keller's letter [No. 2323], because Keller revealed his much-praised, pleasant disposition in it and accepted Bullinger as a friend.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Now that [Johannes] Haller has returned to [Zürich], Bullinger appreciates Keller even more, as Haller praised him highly. Keller should continue to serve God well and take care of Haller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Keller rightly urges a prompt return [of Haller] to [Augsburg]. Bullinger has initiated corresponding actions. However, Haller could not come earlier due to matters he needed to settle. Haller left the [Zürich] church only with sorrow, but he submits to the Augsburg church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- One should fear neither [Luther] nor [Johannes Frosch], [Wolfgang Rehlinger], [Wolfgang Musculus], or [Bucer], but God alone. Life is to be subordinated to the word of God. The church ministers should sincerely interpret and proclaim the word of truth. - The rest will be told by Haller. All the kindnesses Keller shows to Haller will be shown not only to Bullinger but also to Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings from [Konrad] Pellikan, [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Gessner, [Heinrich] Buchter, and the other pastors and teachers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings, especially to [Bernardino] Ochino.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. Your letter greatly delighted me, most esteemed Keller, both because it exuded that sweet and constant spirit which all the best people praise in you, and because it testified that I have been received into your friendship, which I have long desired. Believe me, I will ensure that you will never regret having accepted me as a friend.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>And although I have loved and esteemed you greatly before, after our Haller returned to us, I began to love and venerate you even more. For he sincerely extolled your gifts here, the purity of your doctrine, the constancy of your faith, your faithful ministry, the integrity of your life, your hatred of crimes and criminals, and finally, your excellent benevolence and humanity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Continue thus, my most esteemed brother, to present yourself as a proven minister and worker to God. Continue to embrace Haller, the son entrusted and commended to your faith. Continue to educate him and strengthen him with constant and excellent counsel in good. For now, we are much more at ease after reading your letters than we were before, when we did not yet fully understand by whose counsel and support he was to be assisted. May the Lord Jesus, the head of his church, king and priest, confirm what he has worked in us. You rightly advise that he should return to you promptly. Therefore, I have been the author with a benevolent mind elsewhere, so that, as soon as it could be done through his affairs, he would again prepare for the journey. And indeed, he could not come sooner, being detained by his own matters.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Indeed, he left his church with great longing and sorrow. He would have preferred to retain him, but he rightly yielded to the holy and most celebrated church of Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Nor is there truly any just cause why we should fear Luther, Frosch, Rehlinger, Musculus, or Bucer. The Lord will be our fear, the rule of life, and the living and eternal word of God, the compendium of rightly establishing things. In this, it is both sweet and most glorious to even fall. He lives, who has conquered the world. He lives and will judge, who demands nothing else from the ministers of his church than that they be faithful, rightly divide the word of truth, and be clear and bright, who proclaim the light and sun of righteousness. You will understand the rest from Haller, my beloved son; whatever benefit you bestow or show to him, I will consider it done to me, not to mention that it is also shown to Christ. He will conduct himself well in all things and will revere you as a parent, teacher, and venerable advisor.</p>

      <p>Farewell with all good things. [Konrad] Pellikan, [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Gessner, [Heinrich] Buchter, and all the other brothers and teachers greet you sincerely. Zürich, 18th of February, 1546.</p>

      <p>Greet all the brothers, especially [Bernardino] Ochino. Your Bullinger.</p>
