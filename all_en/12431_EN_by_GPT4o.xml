    <p xml:id="regest1">The main interest of the negotiations at the [Schmalkaldic] Bundestag in Frankfurt was to protect Archbishop [Hermann von Wied], as he is being pressured by both Pope [Paul III] and Emperor [Charles V]. Since his [Reformation] plans are in danger, he sought protection from the [Schmalkaldic] allies and all supporters of the Augsburg Confession. In the event of an attack, support and resources were promised to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Currently, a delegation is trying to persuade the Emperor not to subject Hermann von Wied to the imperial ban and to bring the contentious [religious] matter to a German national council. If the [Emperor] does not respond to these requests, the delegation will show him the document in which the [Schmalkaldic] allies have declared their support for the [Archbishop]. The same delegation was also sent to the citizens of Cologne to urge them not to expose themselves to the danger of banishment, as the canons want, who neither have heirs nor fear expulsion. Furthermore, the delegation is also supposed to meet with the [Coadjutor Adolf von Schaumburg] and the pseudo-canons in Cologne. What the delegation has achieved is not yet known.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Contrary to the portrayal by [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle, a larger number of cavalry and troop leaders are gathering in northern Germany than would be necessary for a peaceful visit to the Reichstag in Regensburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Elector [Frederick II] of the Palatinate, his brother Wolfgang [of Palatinate-Neumarkt], and their [nephews], [the Counts] Ottheinrich and Philipp [of Palatinate-Neuburg], have long been waiting for the Emperor to address the often-promised resolution of the religious controversy, especially since he also instructed the estates to deliberate on it. Now that [Count Palatine Frederick II] has been urged by his subjects to introduce [the Reformation], which [the Counts Palatine] Ottheinrich and Philipp also pressed for, [Frederick II] and [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse met towards the end of the Bundestag in Frankfurt. No one doubts anymore that [the Palatines] and [Hermann von Wied] will fully join the [Evangelicals].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Upon departure from Frankfurt, Philip [of Hesse] and the [Arch]bishop of Mainz [Sebastian von Heusenstamm] met in Höchst [near Frankfurt] for a one-day discussion, which gave rise to hope for a change of mind [of Heusenstamm].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Duke Maurice of Saxony has sent Christoph von Carlowitz to Frankfurt to secure the release of Duke [Henry of] Brunswick. However, no response has been given to him yet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Kings [Francis I] and [Henry VIII] have both thanked the [Schmalkaldic] allies for their peace mediations, which, however, were unsuccessful. The monarchs blame each other. The envoys were Christoph von Venningen, who died during the mission, as well as Johann [von Niedbruck], Johannes Sturm, and [Johannes] Sleidanus, who returned after three months with gifts from the kings. The reason for the failure is allegedly a new alliance between the Emperor and [Henry VIII], but certainly also [the situation in] Scotland, as [Francis I] does not want to abandon the heiress [Mary Stuart].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Scotland is also in turmoil and divided by the bitter dispute between the queen dowager [Marie de Guise] and the regent [James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran]. It has long been claimed that [Henry VIII] wants to send an army to Scotland to impose on the Scots the treaty [of Greenwich] that the Scottish estates have repudiated, which had established the betrothal of Henry's son [Edward] to [Mary]. [James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran], the regent's son, also claims [Mary]; likewise [Francis I for his son Francis].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The devastating war between [Francis I] and [Henry VIII] continues. Immediately after the departure of the [Schmalkaldic] envoys, quite a few Englishmen were killed by the French near Boulogne. The region is completely devastated and littered with corpses. A famine is imminent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- [Francis I] assured the [Schmalkaldic] envoys that he would not act against his Protestant subjects and that the Waldensians were executed not for their religion but for their disobedience.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Immediately after his return from Frankfurt [on February 16], Thomas Blarer wanted to convey the present matters to Bullinger at the request of his brother [Ambrosius], but he was repeatedly prevented from doing so. Bullinger and Theodor [Bibliander] should excuse the late writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Thomas Blarer includes a letter written during the Bundestag to a long-time friend, the Frankfurt pastor [Mathias Limberger]. However, the letter should not be circulated under his name.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- He also wanted to write something about Luther's death, but there is no opportunity for that now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- [P.S.:] Greetings also to [Rudolf] Gwalther, whose verses on the victory over [Duke Henry of] Brunswick Blarer read in Frankfurt in a letter from Gwalther to [Justin] Gobler, the envoy of the Bishop of Münster [Franz von Waldeck].</p>

      <p>S. The main reasons for the Frankfurt Diet were primarily about preserving the Archbishop of Cologne. The Archbishop of Cologne and Elector of the Empire, having been summoned twice in one day (once by the Pope, once by the Emperor), was in danger of having his Christian proposal extorted from him by threats, legal pretexts, or open force. He sought protection not only from the Evangelical allies in name but also from those who are called adherents of the Augsburg Confession. There was a unanimous agreement among all to preserve him, should it happen that force must be repelled by force.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Ample and convenient resources were also provided for this matter, in which, however, it was agreed that the majesty of the imperial authority should not be disregarded, and a delegation was sent to Charles to obtain a cessation and to refer the matter to a general or national Christian and German council. If he does not grant this, an instrument of adherence will be presented to him, in which the Evangelical states are united in form and in the business of the Archbishop of Cologne, whom they will not fail in counsel and aid. The same delegation was sent to the city of Cologne, to remind them that they are citizens of a founded city, whose homeland and freedom should not be exposed to danger (as the canons think, who are without heirs and secure from exile), as they have no certain and native soil. But the delegation also reaches out to the subdean and pseudo-canons, who have opposed the sound institution of the bishop; what they have achieved and whether they have been heard by the Emperor, we have not yet learned.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It is nevertheless known that in the name of the Emperor (although Granvelle assures our people to be secure), leaders of cavalry and infantry are being gathered in greater numbers in Lower Germany than would be appropriate if he were coming peacefully to the Diet in Regensburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Elector Palatine, with his brother Wolfgang and relatives, Ottheinrich and Philipp, have long been waiting to see with what counsel or will the Emperor will fulfill what he has so often and so greatly promised about resolving the religious controversy (and he has ordered the estates of the empire to have this matter considered and deliberated), waiting in vain, I say, when they saw the Emperor doing nothing seriously to build a concord worthy of Christians, and the elder was already being urged by his subjects to hasten the evangelical sincerity and rites worthy of it, he gave himself entirely to embracing the business of the gospel. In this opinion, the elder Ottheinrich and Philipp have urged the elder's proposal. How amicably the Palatine and Hessian received each other when they met in Frankfurt at the end of the Diet, and how they both gave themselves to the envoys of the evangelical princes and cities there, it was pleasant to hear and see. No one now doubts about the Palatines, that they will join the most intimate and allied of our parties, just as no good person who knows him judges the proposal of the Archbishop of Cologne otherwise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Departing from Frankfurt, Prince Philip of Hesse had asked the Archbishop of Mainz, Höchst, to come to him, and there he conversed with him familiarly for a long day in the presence of the counselors of both. Hence, some hope has arisen that he might be brought to repentance, especially since he did not take this ambition of the prince unkindly; but what the Lord has decided about him, time will declare.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>To secure the release of Duke Henry of Brunswick, Duke Maurice of Saxony sent Christoph von Carlowitz, an old comrade of mine, to Frankfurt; but the response was suspended.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The French and English have given great thanks to our allies for their efforts, as each tried through the delegation to pacify their enmities, which were not removed. They accuse each other of fault. The envoys were Christoph von Venningen, who ended his life in this business, not returning, Johann von Niedbruck, Johannes Sturm of Strasbourg, and Sleidanus, who, after three months, achieved nothing and were rewarded with royal gifts. The cause of the failed concord is thought to be a new alliance, which they affirm the Emperor has made with the English. But the kingdom of Scotland was also an impediment, and the fact that the French did not want to abandon the royal heiress.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Thus, Scotland is now very agitated, torn apart by the hatred that has arisen between the queen dowager and the governor of the kingdom. Noticing this, the English have long been rumored to be sending an army to Scotland, so that they can obtain the betrothed infant of the previous year for their son through the agreement, which the Scottish nobles and commoners later rescinded. For the same girl is also claimed by the governor's son and the French.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The most disastrous war between the French and English was still proceeding, and as soon as our envoys had left France, the French slaughtered quite a number of English before the city. The devastation and slaughter of pagans in the borders of Boulogne is miserable to relate; those who did not fall by the sword lie dead from starvation at the crossroads with unburied corpses. And if the war continues, many thousands more are predicted to perish from hunger. But I mention these things in vain, as there are more certain reports of these matters with you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The French opened to the envoys, among other things, the hope that they would not be cruel to their subjects in the name of the gospel. And they tried, albeit in vain, to persuade them that the Waldensians were punished not for religion, but for sedition.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>These things I wanted to write to you, most illustrious Bullinger, long demanded by my brother Ambrosius; and I would have done so as soon as I returned from Frankfurt as an envoy, but I was partly hindered by health, partly by other succeeding cares. Therefore, I beseech you and my Theodor not to blame the desired work, because it is late, or because it is more provided than composed and perfected.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I will add what I noted at the Diet itself to the Frankfurt evangelist, an old companion of my brother and mine; and I ask that such things not be published in my name, for although I do not disclose anything but what is manifest, there are nevertheless those everywhere who interpret the just commerce of the learned sinisterly, who delight in the writing of events, if they are good, with officious custom.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>I wanted to write something about the death of the most holy Luther, but now is not the place.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Farewell in our Christ, to whom I commend myself and our republic of Constance. Constance, March 18, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blaurer.</p>

      <p>Greet Gwalther in my words, whose verses I read in Frankfurt inserted in a letter he had given to Gobler, the envoy of the Bishop of Münster, about the victory over Brunswick.</p>
      <p>To the highest ornament of the Church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and esteemed friend. Zurich. To Mr. Mathias Limberger, his T. B.</p>
      <p>S. I do not have at hand what you ask, to take from the matters and counsels of the envoys, and as far as it is enough to declare our departure, no one yet has certain opinions. The immature business of the causes is proceeding at a slow pace and is suspended for the meeting of the Palatine and the Hessian prince on the 29th of January, which we envoys are waiting for. Rumors about the years of the defensive alliance being extended, or who are to renew the alliance, are vain, as even those whose interest it is do not have it. But the progress of the causes does not seem to me to be very inauspicious. Most of the orders of the whole religion have sent envoys here, pious, learned, and prudent men, as you see, so that the prophecy seems to me to be approaching, which my host Sorgelochus observed from the sayings of the ancients, who predicted that something good would come out of Frankfurt for the ill-affected Germany, and that hope builds for me not the life of our men, which is indeed irrelevant to the name of their profession, but rather the commendation of genuine piety itself, which is very intact in most of our people. And the cruelty and savagery of the princes opposed to us and other virtues demand some divine counsel, lest the whole world collapse before the time of our redemption, with malice and despair having removed those who preserve the remnants of the Lord, the magistrates.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to reveal about Brunswick; but Luther's salutary and suitable admonition to the leaders of our alliance will avoid mockery, as I hope. The business of Cologne and likewise of the Palatine is being conducted so far that I desire nothing at all in terms of spirit or diligence. For in it, whenever it is touched, the splendor of paternal goodness shines forth, which has set itself to adorn and preserve this honor for us. As for the expectation of the Council of Trent, there is none or not of great distinction, if we wish to be wise in what we know. However, our people are working to refuse it in a legitimate and just manner, or if its execution takes place, by what force and arms it should be repelled, lest those giants, burdens of the earth, cast down the judge from heaven.</p>
      <p>Greet Bucer, Brentius, Schnepf, Pistor, and Frecht in my words, our supports at Regensburg.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, January 25, 1546.</p>
