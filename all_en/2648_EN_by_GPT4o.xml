      <p>Greetings, most distinguished and kind Mr. Bullinger. Indeed, I would very gladly write more to you, but there is nothing to write. We are daily expecting what the Diet of Augsburg will bring, as well as what will happen between the French and Charles regarding peace, which we do not even hope for, although we are very much desirous of peace otherwise. As for the collection contributed by the people of Bern for the brothers from Locarno, we had thought our senate would follow the footsteps of others more quickly than give occasion for doing good to other poor exiles of Christ; for my fellow ministers reported to me, while I was ill, that they had greeted our senate on behalf of the people of Locarno and had urged with many arguments that (since they also profess the gospel) they should wish to imitate both your example and that of the people of Bern towards these exiles of Christ, of whom the former receive them with hospitality, and the latter confer not insignificant gifts. What will come of this, I do not know; I have rarely left the house yet. If only they would allow us the power to collect; I do not doubt that we would have accomplished something. But if they are unwilling of their own accord, they do not seem to me to be compelled, since the Lord loves a cheerful giver, etc. Moreover, I am sending here the epitaphs of Julius III, the pontiff, which Vergerius sent some time ago, but I retained them until I recovered and could transcribe them, which now (praise be to God) I have managed to do. For I thought you might perhaps receive them from elsewhere in the meantime, or, if they were finally delivered to you, that nothing in this matter would be neglected. But I do not wish to be further troublesome to you, most excellent man; I ask that you always hold me commended to your kindness and greet on my behalf those who inquire about me, whether fellow ministers or professors, etc. Schaffhausen, June 8, 1555.</p>
      <p>Always most devoted to your kindness, Jakob Rüeger. To the most distinguished man, endowed with excellent learning, singular virtue, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, and his much esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
