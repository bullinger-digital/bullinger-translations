      <p>To the most distinguished and esteemed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my greatly respected mentor, Hotman sends greetings. I write this at first light and at the time when your printers are about to depart; this will be my excuse for brevity with you, reverend father. I wish the young man, whom you so highly recommend to me, could be in a better place than he can be with me; but if no better opportunity is given, you know I can deny you nothing you command. There might be some doubt about the annual pension; for here, due to the incredible cost of everything, what do I say cost, indeed the utmost scarcity, it tends to be rather burdensome.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the baron and the others who are with me pay one crown each week. This is the baron whose book (when it is brought) I will send to you, about Roman families, which he wrote in these two years he has been with me with some others, although he could hardly speak Latin when he first came to me. This was achieved by my daily morning lecture on Cicero's antiquities.</p>
      <p>Excuse this familiarity in writing; for you wanted me to express these things openly, and it was entirely necessary. Many often, especially Poles, have offered themselves, whom I accept; but your recommendation has had great weight with me. Farewell, reverend father, and please convey my most respectful greetings to the most esteemed Mr. Martyr and other distinguished men in my words. Strasbourg, 3rd day before the calends of April 1559.</p>
