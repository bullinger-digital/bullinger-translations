      <p>To the illustrious man, Mr. Stanislaus Cikowski, a Pole, his lord from Wieislawice. What remains, I urge your piety to always persevere in the simplicity of faith. We hear here of marvelous disputes arising in Poland about the worship of the Trinity and the Son of God, in which matter, however, we have been abundantly instructed by the creed on what to believe. The unanimous testimony of antiquity should not be disregarded here either. It teaches that God is one in essence, distinct in persons, not divided into three. In this confession, we believe we must absolutely persevere and not dispute more curiously about these mysteries. A very fierce crowd arose among the ancients on these matters, and brilliant minds contended most vehemently. But this fight was finally settled by the Nicene and Athanasian creeds. Although much was disputed back and forth by idle and contentious minds, they will not find more. Would that they were content with these and did not disturb the churches. Curious disputation by men on these matters has always been harmful. Throughout all of Gaul, a most bloody war is raging, stirred up by the papists. The faithful have been forced to take up just defense. Wherever the enemies of the name of Christ conquer and capture cities, as they have begun to do with many, they exercise more than barbaric cruelty, sparing neither sex nor age. Recently, on December 19th, not far from Orléans at Chartres, a battle was fought with the most hostile spirits and much bloodshed from both armies. Guise led the French, Swiss, Spanish, and Germans into battle, and indeed the most well-equipped; Condé, however, had under his banners noble Frenchmen, German cavalry and infantry, unequal to the enemy. The battle was fought almost the entire day from 10 a.m. until late into the night. There the valor of the German cavalry and the noble Frenchmen of Condé shone forth; for they broke through all the ranks of Guise's cavalry and infantry. The Swiss infantry (they are indeed our confederates, but papists; from our side, none from Bern, Claron, Basel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, Biel, Mulhouse, and the common bailiwicks were present except a few papists from the bailiwicks) was almost half and more destroyed; many Swiss captains and brave men were slaughtered, Spaniards were killed, French were scattered. The marshal of the kingdom, Mr. de Saint-André, fell; many illustrious men from Guise's side fell. The constable was captured with his elder son and other distinguished men. While the larger artillery, wagons, captives, and other things were being led and carried to Orléans by the admiral and Andelot, and the Condé soldiers and cavalry were intent on the spoils and plundering the battlefield covered with corpses, and the Condé prince himself had few cavalry with him, for his men were wandering far and wide, partly pursuing the enemy, partly, as I said, plundering, partly heading to Orléans with captives and wounded, behold, suddenly Guise recollected his cavalry and infantry, with whom he attacked again under the cover of night, oppressing the stragglers and plunderers, capturing the prince himself, Condé, disturbing and intercepting the victory won by Condé, and leading the captured prince to Paris. These things are reported in Switzerland, but obscurely because of the received defeat. We are continually expecting more copious and certain reports; what we have received so far, I have briefly described for your favor. It is added that the admiral with Andelot and Rochefoucauld hold Orléans, are restoring the army, and are expecting the English, of whom 8000 are said to ascend and to have recaptured Rouen, to bring aid to Condé's side, to crush the tyrant Guise, and to free the prince Condé. Nor are there lacking those who think that now serious action will be taken to make peace. What will happen, the Lord knows, who must be diligently prayed to, that He may have mercy on the most afflicted Gaul and save us all from evil. May the Lord keep you, most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Greetings to you and yours from my wife and all my household.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 15, 1563.</p>
      <p>May the faithful who are with you, ministers of Christ and the church, be safe.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich. To the pious, well-learned, and faithful master Ambrosius Blaurer, now in Winterthur, his kind, dear lord.</p>
