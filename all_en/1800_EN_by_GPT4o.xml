      <p>S. I. D. The reason you have not received any letters from me for such a long time, most honorable man, is not due to my laziness or negligence, but rather the scarcity of messengers. For I know that within the span of one month, I have written at least three letters to your piety, which our Peter Mechlin has kept enclosed in a bundle for longer than was appropriate due to the rarity of couriers. However, you will soon receive them all from a courier, who at this very hour received a bundle of books from our Peter intended for Theodor Bibliander and Pellicanus. The King of France is said to be in Paris, while the Emperor is in the Villa of Theonis. We are also expecting the arrival of the French dukes, Schertlin and Rollwag, the latter of whom sent his wife ahead in recent days. The Abbot of Murbach, who nearly a year ago intercepted and treated some French nobles heading to the king rather unkindly, fears the soldiers' attacks, who have long contemplated revenge for his actions, which has caused great fear to spread throughout Alsace and Sundgau. I did not want to leave you unaware of these current events, so that I might relieve you of any anxiety regarding your letters to Montium; for you will soon understand how diligently our Oporinus has taken care of everything. Farewell most happily with your entire family. Basel, January 30, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church and most esteemed friend. Zürich.</p>
