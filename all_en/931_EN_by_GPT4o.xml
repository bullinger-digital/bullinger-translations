      <p>Greetings. I have understood enough about Hyler and Bumann and therefore I send the autographs of the creditors, so that you may act on what you have so promptly received. Believe me, I would not have dared to impose so much burden on you, knowing your affairs, with which you are otherwise burdened.</p>
      <p>The sexton almost owes what they consumed in eating and drinking; it would be serious if he were forced to lose anything. They bought knives from the cutler, which they distributed among friends or female friends there. R[...] Berchtold asked one of mine, who wrote for him, because he himself does not know how to write. They owe two florins and four Basel shillings; however, he willingly donates these, so that he may bear the rest. If they owe anything else, it is not my concern, nor could I inquire if I wanted to. Please do as much as you can; I add nothing more.</p>
      <p>Today someone from Strasbourg reported a rumor that the Emperor had canceled the Diet of Augsburg; but whether it is true or not, I do not know. The people of Strasbourg have been sending messages vigorously since Pentecost, although no more than three or four canons are yet present; the priests are very afraid for themselves. What if it were verified about them, what Solomon says: What the wicked fears will come upon him?</p>
      <p>A certain canon from Lausanne writes from Rome that it has been indicated to him that whatever this Gumpenberg does is lies, and he could not sufficiently exaggerate the vanity of the man. However, he was installed along with his horses recently, while he was here for sealing. We know nothing about another installation. He wrote so threateningly and falsely after the ejection, as if he wanted to attack us in war; many nobles had subscribed themselves; I believe, plainly in jest.</p>
      <p>The provincial of the Carthusians was here these days; it was said that he wanted our Charterhouse to be filled with monks again. The next day, while he wanted to go to the senate, someone whispered something to him, and he left at five in the morning.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be present with His church.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ the Lord with yours; you will greet Gwalther and Otto in my name. Basel, June 6, 1550.</p>
      <p>I know nothing about the castle of WÃ¤denswil. The dispute with Schwyz is not pleasing.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished theologian, Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
