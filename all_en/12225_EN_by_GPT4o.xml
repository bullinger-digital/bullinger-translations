    <p xml:id="regest1">Recently in Basel, Cousin handed over a letter to [Johannes] Gast along with a gift, a shirt made of a mixed fabric with silk, for delivery to Bullinger. Since he has not yet received a reply from Bullinger, the letter probably did not arrive. It contained nothing of significance; only that the long-held wish to visit Bullinger at least with a letter would have been fulfilled if he had come closer to Bullinger through his letter. Therefore, he does not want to bother him with various topics now, but only to send him a token of his devotion. - He hears that the response of the [Zurichers] to Luther's biased [“Short Confession”] has appeared and is available in Basel. He has instructed some people to buy it for him. - Bullinger should take care of his health in order to continue pursuing Christian studies. Cousin, who studies Bullinger's commentaries on Matthew and John, the Acts of the Apostles, and all the apostolic letters day and night, is completely devoted to Bullinger. - Greetings to [Theodor] Bibliander.</p>

      <p>Greetings. When we were recently in Basel, we gave a letter to you through Gast, who, as he assured, would diligently ensure its delivery, along with a small gift, as he called it, a light silk garment for the chest. Since we have not yet received any response, I suspect it was not delivered to you; for I know your kindness. However, there was nothing else in that letter that would be of great interest to you or me, except that, having come closer to you, I thought it necessary to satisfy my long-held desire to visit you, at least through letters. This is why I now refrain from bothering you with any writing topics, so as not to disturb your occupations and serious studies. To make this as brief and light as possible, I considered this letter to be sufficient - as it should be among good people - which you may use as a token of a person devoted to you.</p>
      <p>I hear that your responses to Luther's biased book have been published and are available in Basel. I have sent someone to purchase them for me.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, my dearest and most learned Bullinger, if you care for us, make sure to take care of your health and sustain your age with those Christian studies and the conscience of righteous counsel, as you are accustomed. We, who love you greatly and are day and night engaged in studying your works on Matthew, John, the Acts, and all the apostolic letters, will never fail in any place to support your fame, praise, and even your will.</p>
      <p>Farewell, then, and convey my greetings to Master Bibliander. From Nozeroy, on the Ides of June, in the Christian year 1545.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and loving Gilbert Cousin of Nozeroy.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and excellent theologian, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and teacher. Zurich.</p>
