    <p xml:id="regest1">The hesitation [of the Schmalkaldic League] continues, even though they are allegedly hurrying now, knowing that the 80,000 expected Italians will soon be at the disposal of Emperor Charles V. Pope [Paul III] has given everything and can now count on the support of the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Martin Peyer from Schaffhausen reported today about a letter from a member of the Secret Council from Ulm [Georg Besserer?]: The kings [Francis I] of France and [Henry VIII] of England are said to have refused their help to the Emperor. He also asked the Sultan [Suleiman I] for 1,800 cavalrymen. However, the corresponding answer is still unknown, as the imperial envoy [Gerhard Veltwyck] has not yet returned [from Turkey].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- It is said that the Swiss Confederates, upon the arrival of the Italians in the Empire's territory, asked the commanders [of the Schmalkaldic League] for 8,500 men to be allowed to direct the first attack against the Emperor with them. Their proposal is said to have been accepted, and they were additionally offered 2,000 horsemen. The Swiss Confederates now want to wait for the right moment to launch their attack.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- As a result of the agreement with [Suleiman], the Emperor has ordered the cannons from Vienna and the 1,200 Spaniards stationed there with their arquebuses to join him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bucer wrote about a new army from Belgium, whose intentions are unclear: Either it is to raid Hesse from Mainz, or to keep [Frederick II] of the Palatinate and the evangelical Rhine counts in check, or also to attack [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse from behind. However, Myconius thought that the Landgrave had well-prepared his land; therefore, no attack on it was to be feared...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The Strasbourg envoy [Heinrich von Müllenheim] just reported that in Donauwörth the [Schmalkaldic troops] have gathered. There are 7,000 horsemen and 60,000 foot soldiers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Veit Dietrich has promised the Strasbourg support from the [Nurembergers]. May the [upcoming Swiss] Diet bring good results! Should the [Swiss Confederates] not respond to the wishes of the [Schmalkaldic] envoys [Heinrich von Müllenheim, Ulrich Hochrütiner, and Hans Herter von Hertneck], they would indeed be foolish! May God open the eyes of the Five Places!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [P.S.:] Everyone to whom Myconius gives the poem [by Rudolf Gwalthers] about the decline of the monastery [Einsiedeln] to read is shocked and cannot believe it. The author should report more details about it.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The hesitation continues, although now finally (if the rumor is true) a hasty attempt is being made in vain, after Charles has obtained what he wished for. For they say that the Italian army is approaching, up to eighty thousand selected men, not willingly rushing. The Pope is trying everything; Charles is present to assist him. But listen to what Mr. Martin Bayer from Schaffhausen told me today.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>A senator from Ulm, a good man and one of those in charge of military affairs, wrote to Schaffhausen that it is certain that Charles has sent to the French and English kings and the Turk for assistance. What he asked from the kings is not known; from the Turk, he asked for 1800 cavalry. They refused to give anything; the envoy from the Turk has not yet returned. Therefore, it is not known what he will do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The rumor flies that, after the Italians have come into the imperial land, the Swiss Confederates asked the commanders for eight thousand five hundred men to be allowed to make an attack on the primary ones; it was granted and two thousand horsemen were added. Our people are seeking an opportunity to fulfill their wish.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>From Vienna, Austria, Charles has ordered all the cannons to be brought to him and 1200 Spaniards carrying arquebuses; thus, he agrees with the Turk.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>A new army has come from Belgium. Who it is and where it intends to go is unknown. This is from Bucer. They speculate either from Mainz to ambush the territory of Hesse, or to restrain the Palatinate, other princes, and counts of our religion on the Rhine, or to follow Hesse to attack from behind. Indeed, what is written, I do not understand, for I have heard consistently that Hesse has left everything so fortified behind him that he is free from fear.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Strasbourg envoy told me today that our people have already gathered at Donauwörth on the Danube, to consult on what should be done next. There are seven thousand horsemen, sixty thousand foot soldiers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Veit Dietrich has promised the Strasbourg people some good hope from their own. May the Lord indeed grant that our Diet may produce something good! The same Lord must be invoked from a faithful, constant, and persevering heart until he hears us. The Protestant envoys have what they are going to propose; whoever does not agree with them is utterly insane. May the Lord open the hearts of the Five Places, so that they may understand and accept what is equally beneficial to them as to us.</p>

      <p>To whomever I allow the poem "On the Fall of the Hermitage" to be read, they doubt whether it is true: So much so that no one does not shudder! The author should write something to make the matter clearer. Greet the same. I will write shortly.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
