      <p>Johannes Blasius to his esteemed Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>We have received all your latest letters (addressed both to us and to Mr. Alterius, along with the enclosed ones), most revered man in the Lord. We have forwarded Mr. Alterius's letters to him and are returning the enclosed ones to you, as you instructed. Furthermore, we are entirely at a loss as to what we should write to you in response, since you already know all too well about the matters recently conducted among our people through deceit and fraud, namely that nothing here is to be attributed to us.</p>
      <p>We protested in a timely and strong manner, but in vain. For when gold glitters, speech is powerless: "Accursed hunger for gold, what do you not compel mortal hearts to do!" As Cato said, "How difficult it is to speak to a stomach that has no ears." We have, alas, experienced these words to be true to our detriment. Meanwhile, the Lord is to be praised, who in His kindness is accustomed to confirm His word with the clearest signs; although these, as we judge, are the beginnings of sorrows. Finally, it has been decided by the synod recently held here that aid should be given to the Church of Clavenna. We (to whom this task has been assigned) are awaiting a just call to proceed; but I fear the imminent war on that side may hinder this, concerning which in these days Mr. Ascanius Marsus of Milan, a truly pious man who recently served as the Emperor's envoy to the Rhaetians, secretly gave me this enclosed note, promising no hope.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve the church, which is troubled on all sides, amen, etc.</p>
      <p>In haste, Chur, August 25, 1549.</p>
      <p>All the pious, and especially Mr. Comander, send you many greetings and ask for any news from you.</p>
      <p>Your same, however humble, Blasius. Concerning avoiding the superstitions of Johannes Calvin, make sure I have it; I will send the price.</p>
      <p>Concerning avoiding the superstitions of Johannes Calvin, make sure I have it; I will send the price.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
