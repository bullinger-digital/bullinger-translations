      <p>Honorable, dear sir, and friend, my willing service is always at your honor's disposal. Although I had resolved several years ago to make myself known to your honor through a letter, this did not happen due to the distance of the journey and the uncertainty of the messengers. However, as it has now come to pass, praise be to God the Lord, the reason for my writing is this: Twenty-eight years ago, I joined the highly renowned and dear heroes of the true Christian church, discussing with them at that time, with my young understanding, the contentious article concerning the sacrament of the altar, as the Lutheran opinion was at that time entirely doubtful to me, indeed quite suspicious.</p>
      <p>At that time, the godly man Zwingli instructed me kindly and faithfully regarding all my concerns. At that time, he had the little book "De peccato originali" in the works, which he sent to me through Urbanus Rhegius in Augsburg, which I faithfully completed. Now, as a simple man, I have been quite troubled by the departure of the godly friend in the Lord, Zwingli, due to the unmixed doctrine of your church, which the godless among us interpret in the worst way (as it happens). This has been a hidden mystery of the foreseeing eternal God to me, through which those who do not wish to know the open truth are even more blinded. Now, through my good friend Michl Mair, your fellow citizen, I have wanted to inquire with this letter in haste regarding future acquaintance, especially requesting whether your honor could order for me the books of Oecolampadius on Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and the minor prophets, as well as your book "De origine erroris," and the others on the New Testament. I have all of Zwingli's works, praise be to God, through which your honor and the entire Zurich church are well known to me according to the inner man. Nothing more, but commending you to God the Lord in haste. I send you a printed mandate issued by the Pope on the priests in [...] awaiting your letter.</p>
      <p>Greet all good-hearted friends for me, especially Zwingli's son-in-law, as an unknown.</p>
      <p>Given in haste on the 8th of October in the year 1549, Landshut. Anton Simburger, court procurator and citizen there.</p>
