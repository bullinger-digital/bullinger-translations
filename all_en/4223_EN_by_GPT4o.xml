      <p>I am sending back the bishop's mandate.</p>
      <p>Persuaded by others, I once thought this bishop was not a bad man; but now I understand what kind of person he is. Such an honest cause, supported by so many scriptures, and also by canons, can only be criticized by someone notably wicked, indeed even covered with insults. I had decided to send him a copy of my books against the Anabaptists, once it was completed; now I think it unworthy to send an evangelical book to someone whom I see as an open enemy of the gospel. I pray to the Lord to enlighten his mind, which is enveloped in darkness.</p>
      <p>Am I a burden to you or are you to me? Why then do you say you do not want to be a burden to me anymore? I rather cause you inconvenience. My sons, with their voluntarily undertaken travels, cause inconvenience to people, so that even if the father rests, they do not cease to disturb people. If my Christophorus had stayed in Germany, he would be in better health now and would not have imposed or left you with a weak horse, useful neither to himself nor to others. But I must endure with them like other people.</p>
      <p>I ask you to continue to do what is right as you have done so far and not to think that you are doing me a favor with the horse; I trouble you much more; but I will always show myself grateful to you. They say that the cavalry and infantry conscripted in Saxony are to be led to Denmark against the Swedes, who are said to have declared war on the Danes. Perhaps (it is true) they must subdue the Dithmarschen.</p>
      <p>I have nothing worth mentioning.</p>
      <p>Rumor spreads among us that the pope has dismissed the Swiss, wanting to give the guard of his body to his nephew and the mercenaries; if only it were true.</p>
      <p>My son Johannes Rodolphus returned long ago in the past month of November; for I called him at the autumn fair. My sons greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>We are expecting letters from England soon; we hear that the marriage between Charles of Austria and the Queen of England will not proceed. What do you have from Italy about the council and the pope's decrees, I ask? In France, persecution rages. May the Lord either convert or overthrow the tyrants.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours, whom you should greet, also Tscharneros, Philipp, Pontisella, etc. On the first of March 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful pastor of the Church of Chur, his most esteemed and dear brother and compatriot. To Mr. Hansen Schmid, preacher in Chur.</p>
