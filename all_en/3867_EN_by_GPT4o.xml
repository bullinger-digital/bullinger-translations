      <p>Greetings. The person who comes here to your kindness is a man of Hebrew nationality, highly distinguished in the learning that indeed Hebrews excel in during our time, as far as my modesty can grasp, and who should be quite commendable by name to the more learned. Furthermore, what is most important, he has become a Christian from an infidel, for which the water of holy baptism is also a clear testimony. How highly he was regarded in Italy is shown by the letters he has, even from the very head of impiety, I mean the Roman pontiff, and his princes, among whom he could have been very great, if he had wished.</p>
      <p>I certainly, mindful of the words of the Apostle Paul: "We are debtors to them" etc. Romans 15, judge that he ought to be commended to all Christians, especially to those devoted to languages, even if he knows no language well besides Hebrew and Italian. But indeed, I am foolish, who says so much to you, who will be able to hear and judge him yourself.</p>
      <p>Moreover, when I find a messenger, I will take the book of our son from you; for our dear Fabricius tells me it is now ready.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most learned man by far, and continue to love your Philippus. From Chur, on the 20th day of February in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours in integrity, entirely Philipp Gallicius. To the truly great man, dear Heinrich Bullinger, a lord to himself and to all good men, most worthy of reverence. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
