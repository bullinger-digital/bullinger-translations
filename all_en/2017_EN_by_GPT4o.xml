      <p>S. Although I have little to write to you now, most esteemed lord and godfather, since a messenger has presented himself here through whom you can reply if you have anything, I did not want to send him to you completely empty-handed. Our affairs remain as before. It was rumored that the younger Duke of Savoy had drowned, but no one has come to confirm this rumor, so we fear it may not be true. From Saxony, it is also reported that Margrave Albert was defeated again by Augustus, the brother of Duke Maurice; but I still doubt how true this is. We have no certain news from Augsburg. From England, Dr. Matthaeus Gribaldus, a jurist from Padua, reported to me that the prince who aspired to the kingdom for his son, about whom you also wrote to me recently, has been beheaded, and this is certain. Furthermore, another daughter of King Henry VIII, the Emperor's niece, has been declared queen, and all the pious are in great danger because she seems inclined to papist suspicions and appears to be bringing back old idolatry. This is certainly to be greatly lamented; but since the matter is not human but of the Lord himself, I hope He will bring it about that the world recognizes that the power of His kingdom does not rest in the life and person of one man, and I hope that the truth will emerge all the more gloriously, the more it now seems to be submerged by severe storms of calamity.</p>
      <p>The same reports that Corsica, the richest island of the Genoese with three very fortified cities, has been occupied by the Turk, and the Genoese are in great danger. A truce has been established between the armies in Piedmont; many think these are preludes to a future peace between the Emperor and the French, for which some cardinals are working hard, who would like these monarchs united so that they could suppress the truth of Christ all the more easily. We have nothing from our people in Picardy.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, the sedition still grows. The state of that city is completely overrun. The more powerful almost conspire against Calvin.</p>
      <p>He opposes them with all his might and is prepared to die to retain the institutions of his church, and as far as I understand, the primary cause of this entire controversy is the strictness of the ecclesiastical discipline established there, under which almost all are subjected to the feet of the ministers. This is grievous and intolerable to the more powerful, and hence our people are also not very favorable to Calvin because they think he arrogates too much to himself. As I hear, he has now withdrawn from the city to a certain nobleman not far from the city. However, he has not renounced his ministry. Farel is going there to settle the dispute, which I hope he does not inflame more with his vehemence. Our French think there will be no form of church unless the same discipline is introduced, as you will easily see from the writing I recently sent to you. But this discipline would be much more intolerable for our people than for the Genevans.</p>
      <p>Regarding Servetus, they say they will write to the Swiss churches, and the Geneva questor has already passed through here, whom they said was heading to Zurich for this cause. However, we have not agreed on this matter. Therefore, let me know if he has been with you. Then write what you think about that writing from Lausanne that I sent to you, and what we should follow here.</p>
      <p>Musculus sends his greetings to you and all yours. The same does my wife, who, I think, will soon come to you for some private business. Today I had a vein opened and we have an examination, so I cannot write more. Therefore, take these things kindly. I have not yet learned for certain what happened in Baden. Greet Dr. Gwalther, Pellican, Theodor, and all your sons-in-law from me. Bern, September 18, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his lord and godfather, to be piously honored.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
