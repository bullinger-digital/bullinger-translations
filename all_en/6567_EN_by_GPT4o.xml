      <p>Greetings. They say that on the 20th of this month, a meeting is to be held by the princes in Worms because of religious dissensions. I fear that all efforts will be directed by the Wittenbergers against the Elector Palatine, whom they wish to oppress. But the Palatine is quite steadfast. There are those who whisper that some from France are writing to the Germans, saying they are ready to subscribe to the Augsburg Confession. If this is true, what labors will be required of us [or you]? They also say that an imperial diet is to be held in Augsburg in January. What if soon a diet is also convened in Baden, Switzerland? It seems fitting to prepare for new disturbances and unrest in the new year.</p>
      <p>The Pope is working hard to convene a council. Farewell, etc.</p>
