      <p>Grace and peace from God, especially beloved godfather, your letter by the messenger from Bern has reached me. I thank you once again for your Christian zeal, diligence, and work. My gracious lords are pleased that the day is set, hoping it will lead to unity and good service, only that everyone shows themselves friendly and brotherly, so that no new displeasure arises. I hope to God that all resentment will easily subside. My lords, as far as I can understand them, are all of the opinion that it is useful for us to send messengers from all places to the lands for the assemblies, to explain everything clearly and to present it with all seriousness, friendliness, and discretion; instructing me, therefore, to act as much as possible with you and other lords of Zurich, so that the same may be achieved with you. You may and should inform my gracious lords, the mayors, and other well-wishers according to your judgment. Regarding the article about the council, they have also instructed us to present a consideration; therefore, I would gladly have you share your advice with us, so that we may conduct ourselves uniformly in all respects.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Lord has so blessed our efforts that in this one week I have achieved and obtained many things that I would not have hoped for, both with the brothers and with the senate: 1. that they have agreed to the celebration of a universal synod, both German and French. Therefore, they have instructed us to consider only the form and manner of the celebration and, once we have decided on this, to report back to the senate. If you have any advice here, I beg you to provide it to me; otherwise, I have with me the form printed by the Zurich synod, to which we will adapt ours as much as possible. 2. I have obtained that through this present public messenger, D. Ambrosius Blaurer is called to the ministry of our church. He has been chosen by the smaller senate and will be confirmed by the deacons once they have seen and heard him. I had previously solicited his mind; he responded to me in such a way that he now seems not to refuse the legitimate and holy nomination, which will undoubtedly be most beneficial and useful to our church. 3. But I have also obtained that D. Xystus Betuleius is called to the scholastic function, yet not to send a public messenger to him; but it has been entrusted to me by the senate to write to him and fully explore his mind. If he consents to the call, then they will want to call him with public authority. I have sent letters to Vadianus in St. Gallen; I hope he can conveniently transmit them to Xystus. And indeed, these obtained matters so cheer my mind that I seem to myself to be almost living now and to foresee the Lord's kind affection towards this church; provided that the enemy Satan does not disturb these efforts. But may the Lord grant that we see the happy outcome of these labors. The matter of Musculus was also discussed and proposed along with Blaurer's; but I do not know by what fate that good and excellent man has fallen into such an opinion among our people that they have again refused and did not want any mention of him at this time; nor do his commentaries on Matthew stand in the way as much as that journey to Luther, in which they knew he was together with Gervasius; they always fear, therefore, that if he joined us, he could be slandered by the opposing side and accused as a deserter of his religion, or if he seemed to agree with others even a little, that a fire of contention might arise again and the latter things become worse than the first.</p>
      <p>And hence they more easily called Blaurer, because there is less suspicion about him. Meanwhile, however, not a few and primary men have again given me hope that he can be called again when Blaurer arrives and assists me in advocating for his call.</p>
      <p>If, however, I achieve anything in the meantime, before I come to Zurich, I will explain it to you in person. I certainly, as God is my witness, am as concerned about this good man, who has deserved so well of me, as about my own life, and I will certainly support him with my means, if his fail, as long as mine suffice. Yet at present, I could achieve nothing here, which not only greatly pains me but also shames me to write to him, as I can only write adverse things, while he eagerly expects to hear something good from me. What should I do, what should I attempt again? I will regret no expenses, spare no labors, if only I can do something for him. I will also try this, if it seems good to you, that Hochholtzer is called here to the diaconate, and he himself succeeds him, or if you still advise that he is promoted to the Hebrew reading in Lausanne; for Viretus also spoke with me about this, who was here these days, or he should wait until he comes here and Blaurer assists my efforts, or he should return to Bern with me now, supported by your and others' recommendations. Or you should speak with the envoys who will come soon, together with the consuls, so that they may advocate for his cause here.</p>
      <p>Indeed, whatever seems best, I will vigorously pursue; for I love him not sparingly nor moderately. Meanwhile, you will also deliberate further on this matter. I wanted to inform you now that I could not obtain his call again.</p>
      <p>It is said here about Bucer that he has gone to Basel; we have known for some time that Brentius was there. If only those men would finally learn to think more rightly.</p>
      <p>Regarding Calvin's propositions, I did not know that you did not want the other brothers to know. I skillfully concealed it from Viretus, who had already received everything from Calvin, as I well sensed. I will keep such things to myself in the future. Furthermore, as I wrote recently, I had agreed with Curio that I would want to call him if any position were vacant; there is now a certain vacancy, and I would like him to be present; I would undoubtedly introduce him, although many brothers malignly predict that I am called here only to call and help the Swabians and benefit them alone. But I do not care about these slanders, as long as I can enjoy a good and joyful conscience before my God; I seek only His glory and the salvation of the church, so that they may have pious and learned pastors, whether they are Swabians or Swiss. Therefore, wherever you know Curio to be, remind him in my name to come, or suggest to D. Bibliander that he calls him; for I think he is at Episcopicella. I am also sending letters to him through this messenger. If he does not find him, he should leave them with Blaurer to send to him. But if these letters, as often happens, remain hidden with someone else, you will inform him in the meantime, since I would like him to come as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The vocabulary is still with the thrice miserable Apiarius; I do not know when he will finish it; he is already lacking paper, so he cannot continue. I can hardly believe the book will be finished before the calends of January; I would take it from him, if he had not already printed several gatherings.</p>
      <p>As for my vocation, you know that the term of half a year has now lapsed. I have spoken privately with some senators about this matter, especially with Consul NÃ¤gelin. They seem to want to keep me entirely; I testify that I leave all discretion to the Zurichers, that I will do whatever they command. Yet I did not indicate to them what the Zurich senate had previously decided, namely, that if they request me again after the lapse of half a year, they would still grant another half year, but then I should return to my church. This, I say, I did not reveal to them. Therefore, when they request me again from the Zurich lords, you will remind the consuls of their promise; for they gave me sealed letters of their decision, even about the granting of another half year. They will not write in letters, but will commend and commit it to the next envoys, as the consul told me. Then perhaps I will also come with them (for the consul advised so).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, perhaps Andreas Rappenstein, our common friend and brother, will come to you. He will undoubtedly discuss many things with you about my stay; but do not reveal to him the pre-judgment of the Zurich senate; for this pre-judgment was made for my sake, so that I alone would know and thus be more certain of my affairs. It will suffice for the Bernese if they finally learn from the Zurich senate that I am granted for another part of the year. Besides what I now write, I have nothing else. I will bring Blaurer's letters and those you sent recently with me. Meanwhile, fare well. My brothers and fellow ministers all greet you, as do my wife and children greet you and yours. I also bid greetings to D. Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, Hopper, and especially our dearest Musculus with all his family, to whom I do not write because I have nothing good to write; you share with him whatever seems appropriate to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 10, 1548.</p>
      <p>Always most devoted to you, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and godfather. To M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
