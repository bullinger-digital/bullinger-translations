      <p>G[reetings] I [say]. I received your letter, esteemed man and dearest brother in the Lord, through my nephew from my brother, and I thank your kindness firstly for the benefits shown to my nephew (may the Lord be your reward!), and secondly for the letters in which you diligently describe what is happening in Worms. I pray, continue to be such to me and mine. I have nothing to write at present.</p>
      <p>I ask this, that you ensure this package is faithfully delivered to Mr. Georg Frölich, our friend and brother.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you, your wife, and all your family. Zurich, 20th of June, in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
