    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's long silence prompts Schuler to write. Bullinger's commentary on the Acts of the Apostles and his letter to the people of Basel have somewhat compensated him for the absence of a direct letter from Bullinger. Schuler is often unwell, but the conditions for his studies in Basel are favorable. A new appointment is in prospect for him, but it is not yet certain. Inquiry about Christ's descent into hell according to 1 Peter 3:19f. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Gervasius Schuler, your brother.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Your silence speaks to me and, as I believe, encourages me to write. For I do not think you are so estranged from leisure hours that you would not take the time to write to me, although in the meantime your pious and learned commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles have somewhat compensated for the old familiarity between us, and the letters you wrote to our people have partly been made known to us, so that perhaps it is beyond your intention, which refreshes me daily. This is also the reason why I have not yet interrupted you with my letters, so that in the meantime I may respond to the future objection through occupation. However, when I consider the nature of a believer, I easily see that these trifles can be forgotten, which makes me willingly yield.</p>
      <p>But let us speak seriously. If you wish to know anything about my affairs, you will learn a few things from the bearer of this letter. In the meantime, I wish you to know that, as far as my body is concerned, I suffer from a perpetual infirmity, namely of the stone, which certainly delays me so much that I cannot pursue good studies with the eagerness of my desire. Rarely is the infirmity exchanged for good health, although God, according to His promise, does not fail, who, although He does not remove the burden, takes away the bitterness of the flesh beyond measure and resistance. Furthermore, as far as the course of my studies is concerned, there is no lack of fervor, spirit, and leisure, nor are there any lack of excellent books. These happy efforts are certainly aided by a house most suitable for the muses. Moreover, there is something at hand for my sake, but not yet knowing the outcome of the matter - although the success itself promises a happy arrival - there is nothing I can safely inform you of. But if it is indeed proposed at my discretion, you will be the first to know.</p>
      <p>Finally, we have come in the course of our function to that place of Peter's first epistle, chapter 3 [19f]: "In which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison, who were once disobedient" etc., and when I examine that place according to the analogy of faith, until he adds: "who were once disobedient" etc., it is not yet known to what this disobedience refers, what the apostle means by this passage. I know that the energy of Christ's passion was made manifest to the holy fathers who had died long before, according to what we all openly profess in general confession: "He descended into hell" etc. I also know that the holy fathers were elected from eternity only through Jesus Christ, who was to suffer, so that what was promised before the ages was to be manifested to them as already fulfilled on the cross. For in this the gospel was preached to the dead as well. But since I know that no one will attain eternal life unless he has first been taught in this life the benevolence of the Father bestowed in Christ Jesus, it becomes more intricate than the Gordian knot, what the apostle adds: "who were once disobedient" etc. [1 Peter 3, 20]. I know that Cornelius was pleasing to God before he recognized the matter of Christ, as the voice of God testifies in Acts 10 [1ff]. I also know that it was ordained from eternity that the sum of salvation through Christ was to be manifested to him by the work of the apostle Peter before he died, although I am not ignorant of the higher things that the Spirit of God reveals elsewhere through Johannes Oecolampadius in his commentaries on Zechariah. If only he had expounded more extensively. Therefore, dearest brother, allow your opinion on this matter to reach me and let me know in writing what the Spirit has given you. I know the importunity of my request, but my spirit, wholly devoted to you, overcomes it, as does my long-standing love for you. I know your readiness in these holy matters. All these things, I believe, make my Christian boldness more prudent.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most learned man and incomparable friend, and do not allow me to depart impotent of this wish. Greet your wife, Leo Jud, and Erasmus Fabricius in my name. We all wish you well with equal prayers.</p>
      <p>Given on the 21st day of September in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the church in Zurich, to be especially revered and an incomparable friend.</p>
