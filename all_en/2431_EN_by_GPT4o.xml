      <p>Greetings. Dearest brother. I recently saw your Heinrich, who is in very good health. I encouraged him towards piety and studies, and he listened willingly. I will stay here for almost a month and will often meet with him.</p>
      <p>From my homeland, I hear that the plague has become so strong that it claims 30 lives daily; God is exacting punishment for the neglected gospel. I beg you, send these enclosed letters to the host at the Stork; just give them to the boy to deliver; I will not trouble you further, as I have urged enough before. Farewell and be well with all the brothers. Help me with your prayers to our Lord God, which I earnestly request. Strasbourg, 15th October 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
