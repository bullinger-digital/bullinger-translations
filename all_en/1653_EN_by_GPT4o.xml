      <p>Greetings. There are not many things that I can write about at the moment; for if there are any new things, you usually know them before we do.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, which concern our churches, I cannot burden you with them. Today we had the synod of our classis. All the brothers complain about the corruption reigning everywhere among us. Everything is getting worse, and we are not corrected even under the hand of the Lord striking us. All plagues converge, the dearness of things is terrible, the plague is also raging among us again, and wars are also at our doors; but little repentance is apparent. Therefore, I greatly fear that we may see the greatest plagues, and I hope it is not the ultimate destruction of our people.</p>
      <p>The atrocious crimes I have heard being committed have greatly depressed me, and therefore I cannot write more until I have somewhat recovered my mind and spirit. There are also other daily matters that afflict me; but I spare you, lest by recounting my troubles I make yours greater.</p>
      <p>Farewell. There are many letters here, which you will ensure are delivered to each individual. All of mine, by God's grace, are well and they all send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 8, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger. In Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
