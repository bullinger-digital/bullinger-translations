      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote to you extensively. In the meantime, I received your letters along with copies of the Turkish history. I gave them to those to whom they were intended; they all thank you. I recognize your style in that history; therefore, I wonder why you added Erb's name. Meanwhile, the people of Strasbourg wrote friendly letters to us and in these, the following news, the most important of which I have copied here for you. I cannot add anything else now. It is said that in about two months, we will hear new wonders from France. May God send it all for the best. Amen.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 21, 1567.</p>
      <p>Lord Steiger himself writes to you. All the others greet you; I also wish health to all of yours.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To D. Bullinger.</p>
