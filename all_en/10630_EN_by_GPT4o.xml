    <p xml:id="regest1">Takes a position on Bullinger's treatise on predestination, as he was asked to do during his visit to Zurich. Agrees with the content; however, if Bullinger speaks of "moderation" and "restriction," he might be suspected, like certain other [theologians], of diluting the clear testimony of Scripture through attempts at mediation. It must also be avoided to give the impression that the Word of God required confirmation by teachers like Augustine. Recommends postponing the publication and, for example, re-examining the translation of [Gen 1:26] to avoid causing offense. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although it was neither my duty nor within my ability, honorable Bullinger, yet having been invited by you, when I was recently in Zurich, to express my opinion on your treatise on predestination, I decided to share with you whatever came to mind, more in passing than from a firm conviction.</p>
      <p>For what I disagreed with seemed to me very solid, as it was supported by the oracles of the divine word. However, the manner of treatment (since the times are troublesome) is not very much approved by us, not because the matter itself cannot bear it, but, as I said, because of the conditions of the times. For you see, dearest Bullinger, that some today, in every argument they handle, pretend I don't know what kind of moderation and soften the strongest questions with I don't know what kind of pretense. Since this is very displeasing to you in Zurich as well as to our people, I fear that you may incur suspicion among some who will imagine that you wanted to do something similar in the evident testimonies of Scripture about fate, like those who want to limit something everywhere, whatever has been said so far with such judgment, such grave censures, and finally with such success against papal errors. Therefore, in this question of divine providence, I would like today to be as far away as possible from the words of moderation and limitation. For what, because the clear sentences of the Scriptures are perverted by the abuse of evil, should the sentences therefore be moderated? If there are excesses on either side, let the excesses be described very graphically and also refuted very strongly, but with the majesty of true and intact authority unscathed, which stands by itself as in the middle, meanwhile surrounded as if by guards with the defenses of Scripture against the excessors. Therefore, I doubt whether the name of moderation is suitable here even in an uncorrupted age. But enough about this fear. You judge what is solid.</p>
      <p>That the sayings of Augustine and others are added to your arguments is not displeasing. Only let it be avoided that, as some of our people scarcely concede anything further unless such testimonies of learned men are present, you too seem to have sought the same. What is clear from the word of the Lord does not need such testimonies, which nevertheless confirmed ours and rejected the impudence of the following age, unless even in this place our age is offended by these reckonings. For soon, having obtained the sound judgment of some teacher in some statement, it is sought in others as well.</p>
      <p>There is no leisure to write about other things. However, I think the publication of the booklet can be postponed and also considered in certain other places. As for that in Genesis וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים נַעֲשֶׂה which you translate as: "Let us make, say the gods" [Gen 1:26], I do not know whether you do this by example. Whatever it is, it seems that offense could arise among the common people from such expressions. Spare me, I beg you, my Bullinger, for expressing my thoughts so freely or perhaps rather ineptly.</p>
      <p>My sister Margaretha and my dear wife send their greetings to you. Farewell in the Lord with all yours.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, on the 16th day of June, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his singularly esteemed friend.</p>
