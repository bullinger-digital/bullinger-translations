    <p xml:id="regest1">Will comply with the request to return, if possible, before Easter; he will report verbally on the damage his recall has caused him and how much it displeases the mayor and the university. He can hardly write due to distress.</p>

      <p>I received your letter, my dear Bullinger. I will comply with it as soon as possible, as is right. However, you will hear from me in detail about the loss to my studies that I am compelled to endure, as soon as I arrive. I will come, I believe, before the Easter festival; it will not be possible any sooner. Finally, I will explain to you in person what loss and inconvenience this return to my homeland brings me. This departure will harm me no less than when I had to leave France. You will also hear from me how this matter was received by the council and the university authorities.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest patron of all. I could hardly write this due to the excessive care and anxiety I am afflicted with. Therefore, I earnestly beg you to consider it with fairness and kindness, according to your humanity. Farewell again. In my name, please diligently greet your entire family and others whom you know are dear to me.</p>
      <p>Written hastily, in Basel, on the day before the Ides of March 1537.</p>
      <p>Once my affairs are settled before Easter, as I said, with God's favor, I will begin my journey.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Fries, as much as he is, entirely.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the divine word, his most revered father. In Zurich.</p>
