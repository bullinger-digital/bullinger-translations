      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. What you have written back to me, most learned and uniquely esteemed brother in Christ, Bullinger, I have not yet seen; you see to whom you have entrusted it. But our Heinius, coming to us on the first of March, brought almost a cartload of letters, namely from the people of Aarau, Bern, and Mulhouse. I did not see yours. Lord Sulzer was also with me on the day my dearest wife shed her mortal coil, whom he comforted with the word of grace before she passed away, and afterwards Lord Johannes, the deacon of Bern, our Hospinianus' son-in-law, with the schoolmaster, but no one gave me anything. Therefore, they are either stuck in Aarau or Basel or have been lost, etc.</p>
      <p>As for the concord of the Eucharist, I believe I have indicated in some previous letter, namely this: "The mountains will be in labor," etc.</p>
      <p>For Jacob Andreae has published a booklet, prefaced by Brentius, etc. The good man has attempted with utmost diligence, with admirable and new theology, to pacify both parties and to reconcile all writings published on both sides. And however you may have the taste of the seraphic doctor, he writes thus: "When you are asked, what do you eat in the supper, say: I eat the body of Christ physically and spiritually," etc. If you have it, you may have read it. Therefore, it seems to me that this response is quite absurd, indeed much less clear, and the more he wishes to make the minds of the simple certain, the more he confuses them with this response. It is certain that, although not all, yet the quiet Saxons abhor this doctrine, spitting at spiritual eating, etc. Likewise, those who are rightly instructed among us and unaccustomed to the terms "physically and essentially," also: "Christ is in the bread, beside the bread, etc. with the bread," what will they think? If we can unite with this diversity of words, we might rightly say a camel can dance, etc. However, I fear the good man will receive bad grace from both parties, indeed perhaps worse than Brentius, who wished to neutrally compose the doctrine of justification between Osiander and the Königsberg academy, etc. I wish I could discuss these matters with you in person, which the constraints of a letter do not allow me to write. You will hear one day of the many superstitions with which the churches of the Margraviate, our neighbors, are overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>The assembly of princes will soon be dissolved, so that money may be extracted from the citizens for the Turkish expedition. The matter of religion will be dealt with in a new colloquy, if it succeeds, either in Strasbourg or Regensburg or Augsburg. The interlocutors will be Philipp Melanchthon, Brentius, and others, also Vicelius, a certain Jesuit, and some others I do not know. They affirm that Philipp Melanchthon will come to Strasbourg and that a house is prepared for him there as an old man. The people of Ulm and Augsburg have promised the Roman king that they will not change the doctrine in the meantime. In sum: Christ is becoming worthless to the princes and almost all of Germany; for we are indeed full, yes, even weary. O good God, look upon us, etc. Farewell, my brother in Christ, and keep your church and ours, as you do, in your prayers, so that we may not be tempted beyond what we can bear.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers with their households. Ours greet you. Riquewihr, March 13, 1557, by the lamp. More another time.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb, an old man at the end of his life.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, both in piety and learning, the most esteemed Lord Heinrich Bullinger, theologian and antistes of the churches of Zürich, his esteemed lord.</p>
