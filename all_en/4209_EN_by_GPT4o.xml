      <p>I recently received your letter of courtesy written on January 22nd, along with the booklet by Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, for which I thank your courtesy; he is quite successful in explaining the sacred writings and gives hope in the commentaries he has published on the letters of St. John, that he will someday provide the same in all sacred books, which may the Lord grant him to accomplish successfully. I eagerly await your book against the Anabaptists, because I wish to understand the reason that has driven you to address this subject at this time.</p>
      <p>I have long had and read Calvin's Institutes not without benefit, as it seems to me, although there have been things that sometimes provided cause for reflection; if you were to send the new and enriched editions when they are published, it would not be unwelcome; however, it is troublesome that you send so many books for free, I would prefer to pay the price, as otherwise I have no opportunity to reciprocate. I sometimes send gifts more out of affection, to declare my goodwill in whatever way I can, since I cannot otherwise, however prudently, so little; you, in your courtesy, interpret more favorably whatever mistakes I often make. I am saddened by what you write has happened to Mr. Calvin, both because I would wish him to remain safe for the Christian republic for a longer time, and because the adversaries will seize the opportunity to slander and invent the most absurd things. What you have done with Conrad Singer in my name pleases me and I approve; I could not now reply to him myself, being constrained by such a narrowness that I could scarcely write these. What you write about the French movement is also reported here among us.</p>
      <p>The monster that the Papists are bringing forth is more and more coming to light every day, almost ready to be born; the Evangelical princes are also not idle; however, nothing is yet done openly. Recently, 25 French ships filled with soldiers set sail from the port of Boulogne, crossing over to Scotland; six of them arrived there, the rest scattered by the storm, how they fared is not yet known. The Bavarian has forbidden the eating of meat (which was free for one or two years past) for his people in the upcoming Lent under penalty of death. The Emperor hopes to have his son as King of Poland; but, as it seems to me, he will not more achieve this hope than the marriage with the Queen of England. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your letters, in which you mentioned the Duke of Württemberg, have been duly delivered to me. Farewell again and greet Singer in my name.</p>
      <p>Given at Augsburg on February 6th, 1560. Your most devoted Georg von Stetten the Younger.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and learned man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
