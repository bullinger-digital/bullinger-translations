    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the "Orthodoxa... epistola" from Vadianus with the five books of Vigilius, but cannot yet give a judgment on it; has already read the "Aphorisms" of Vadianus, whose theological writings he appreciates, with interest. Has sent back through Zwick what he once received from Bullinger to read. Is glad that Bullinger and his family are doing well. Rejoices over the measures of Count George of Württemberg and hopes for further spread of the Reformation. The Abbot of Kempten [Wolfgang von Grünenstein] rages like no other against the Evangelicals. Simprecht [Schenck] leaves [Kempten]; [Paul] Rasdorfer is not entirely innocent. Since he is still missing parts of Zwingli's "In evangelicam historiam... Annotationes", which he received from Bullinger in Zurich, he asks for the rest; he wants to adorn his library with the works of the revered man, and he also needs the book for his sermons on the Epistle to the Romans. Wishes for the booklet on the old faith. Has delivered Benedikt [Euander] Bullinger's dispatch. Greetings. [Kaspar von] Schwenckfeld, who is no longer in Ulm, has circulated two booklets. The Frankfurt Standstill is soon to expire; then we are back at the beginning. Friedrich [Wagner] sends his regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I received, venerable brother, with the utmost gratitude, the orthodox letter of Doctor Vadianus along with the five highly learned books of the martyr Vigilius, and you ask for my judgment on these, which I cannot provide at this time as I am occupied with many church matters. Meanwhile, the messenger is hastening his departure. But when I find a courier in the future, I will not hesitate to respond to your charity according to the capacity of my intellect. For now, I thank you, not as much as I owe, but as much as I can, for this gift which is certainly most pleasing to me. I have read it once by lamplight, and I will read it again. I am especially delighted by Vadianus's writings, particularly when he acts as a theologian; he writes solidly, openly, and clearly. I have read the books of Aphorisms for the third time with great zeal, and the more I engage with them, the clearer the writings become, and I never leave without gaining something.</p>
      <p>What you once sent me to read in good faith, I have returned with the same faith through Zwick, our mutual friend; it seems to me that I am quite swift; you have not wasted anything on me.</p>
      <p>I am very glad about your well-being and that of your family. I hear with pleasure about the actions of Count George of Württemberg. May the Lord expand the borders of His kingdom more and more. Meanwhile, let the Pope's intestines burst. Alas, the Abbot of Kempten rages against the confessors of the truth beyond measure, more than any other of the empire's nobles.</p>
      <p>Simprecht is preparing to leave for another place, but I do not know where; Rasdorfer is not entirely candid.</p>
      <p>Finally, you know what treasure you gave me when I was with you in Zurich, namely the annotations of the most holy martyr and bishop of the Zurich church, Huldrych Zwingli, on the four Gospels and on the Epistle to the Romans and on the first Epistle to the Corinthians up to almost the middle of the fourth chapter of the same epistle; no more annotations were printed, and I am missing the letter Q in the large alphabet and so on to the end, along with the first sheet with the preface, as I think. Therefore, if the work is completed by the printer, send the rest, which I desire, my Bullinger. I am very eager to adorn my library with the writings of that most holy man. For my public sermon among my people, I am dealing with the Epistle to the Romans; the reading of Zwinglian thoughts, which I use diligently, contributes not a little to this. This is what I want, my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>They speak of a German booklet about the ancient faith; you are said to have written it, and it is supposed to have been printed in Basel. I would also very much like to see or have it. Pettlens will not be poor, but remarkably unworthy. You will understand the rest yourself with your prudence.</p>
      <p>I have sent what you sent to Benedikt, whom I also love as a brother.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife, who is dear to me for many reasons, in my name and in the name of my wife, along with your parent and children. I hope for more offspring in the future. Greet in my name Dr. Leo, Pellican, Megander - a recently born friend - and Theodor and the other brothers, and consider me commended to you as an old friend.</p>
      <p>The Schwenckfeldian spirit has sown two booklets against the creature of Christ; but I cannot obtain any. I wonder if you have any. He is no longer in Ulm, but secretly meditates (I do not doubt) not unpleasing to Satan.</p>
      <p>The Frankfurt Standstill is almost over; after that, we are back where we were before.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Memmingen, 8th of October, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gervasius Scholasticus.</p>
      <p>My Friedrich greets you along with your whole family, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the Zurich church, lord and brother in Christ, to be especially revered.</p>
