      <p>Hermann Pincier to Heinrich Bullinger, greetings through Christ.</p>
      <p>Zacharias Ursinus from Breslau came to us in Worms, and because he is one of Philipp Melanchthon's close associates, he was able to tell us much about the whole cause of this colloquy and about Philipp's judgment. When he promised that he would set out for Zürich out of zeal and love for you, and feared that, upon coming there, he might be excluded from your acquaintance out of modesty and shyness, I assured him with my letters that I would provide him with a more honorable reason to approach you. Therefore, since you are accustomed to show yourself easy and very benevolent to all, especially to foreigners, I thought I would be doing the right thing by recommending him to you. I was induced to do this all the more quickly because I realized how much the Saxons, both from conversation and from the life of the Zwinglians (whom they, blinded by a certain foolish prejudice, scarcely consider to be human), need to know what your religion and faith are. Therefore, I hope that this young man, who otherwise does not think unfavorably of our opinion, will be wonderfully confirmed in his view after hearing you. He should also be more commendable to you, as there are so few of his kind who are affected by your name, let alone by friendship. I ask you to receive him and treat him according to your custom.</p>
      <p>It is pleasant to be praised by enemies and among adversaries sometimes. Farewell in Christ and keep me, as you are accustomed, commended to you.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 9, 1557.</p>
      <p>To the best and most learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church in Zürich, his very dear lord and friend.</p>
