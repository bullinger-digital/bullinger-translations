    <p xml:id="regest1">Today, many servants of the Gospel believe that they should not engage with any other science besides the Holy Scripture. The Anabaptists also reject linguistic knowledge and rhetoric. They seem to be justified by the misuse of philosophy in recent centuries, but it is more tolerable to occasionally misuse science than to banish it from the church. Just as there have always been heretics, so too has there been such misuse; for the father of lies, who even dared to tempt Christ and the apostles, persuaded wisdom to despise the foolishness of the cross. He achieved arrogance among those who despise Christ and among Christians, which is why Tertullian blamed the emergence of Gnostics on philosophy. The teachings of the Arians, which brought war between the churches during the time of Emperor Constantine I, and those of Eunomius and Pelagius, can be traced back to the misuse of Greek philosophy. The Pelagians place humans on a divine level, even though they are merely sinners. Later, the power claims of the bishops led to the schism. Finally, the merit of the saints was acknowledged for what only Christ can give, service was transformed into dominion, grace into commerce, and worldly and subtle matters were mixed with spiritual ones. From Aristotle, only what was suitable for debates was known. A Christian should not condemn what is good because it can be misused. Even the Bible can be twisted. It contains everything necessary for life and salvation. Jerome and Augustine did not reject the proper use of the sciences. Therefore, theology, as the mistress of all other sciences, should not be deprived of interaction with these, its servants. Even the exploration of nature can lead to the worship of the Creator. Without the Holy Spirit, there is no true knowledge, but with it, one is endowed - similar to the bee - to select only the honey from the natural sciences, that which points to God's glory. Paul condemns philosophy that makes one arrogant but counts wisdom, knowledge, healing, and linguistic skills among the spiritual gifts of the church. The pagans knew much of value. Just as only someone knowledgeable in architecture can properly judge a building, we will admire God's creative power more with knowledge in astronomy and natural science. Cicero, Chrysippus, Virgil, and Aristotle concluded from the observation of nature the existence of a divine spirit. Paul therefore reproaches the pagans because they still created many images of God. It is useful and in accordance with faith to also devote oneself to the liberal sciences, even though the human mind never reaches the unfathomable. This makes our efforts humble. Bullinger dedicates the epitome as an appendix to his commentary on the Acts of the Apostles. He wants to refute those who condemn what they do not understand and thus fight true piety. Knowledge of places and history is indispensable for the study of the Bible. Maps provide good illustration.</p>

      <p>To the truly pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most ample church of Zurich, Joachim Vadianus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>This age of ours, most learned man, has several ministers of the Gospel, indeed pious and diligent men, who, led by an excessive, as it seems to me, veneration of the Scriptures, are in the heresy of thinking that it is not permissible for presbyters called to feed the Lord's flock to read or treat any part of philosophy beyond the truly sacred Scripture. For they believe there is nothing in it that pertains to our salvation, nor does it fit that things invented by human ingenuity should be applied to that heavenly and God-revealed philosophy. They believe that a pastor, who presides over the church, should not be a contemplator, nor should he aim at anything more than the salvation of many through that doctrine which the apostle calls sound. They believe it does not consist in human opinions nor is it provided by any part of nature, but must be drawn from that unique and inexhaustible "fountain of living water springing up into eternal life" [John 4:14], which indeed is contained in the Scriptures of the prophets and apostles as in some ample basin. This opinion, persuaded by the Anabaptists about the sufficiency of internal calling, they defended not once in our public meetings with clamor and noise in their usual manner, so that they entirely derided and ridiculed both the knowledge of languages and the study of eloquence.</p>
      <p>However, although their opinion seems not much alien from the truth in appearance because of the abuse of studies and arts, which in the last few centuries a certain stupor and, so to speak, a public lethargy of men has brought into the world, yet upon closer inspection, I think it will be evident that it is an error no less pernicious than that of those who denied that sacred letters could ever be rightly taught or understood without the help of philosophy. And indeed, if I had to choose between the two opinions, it would seem more tolerable to err on the side that admits the abuse of doctrines, provided there are those who use them well, than to approve the opinion that the studies of honest arts should be entirely removed from the churches.</p>
      <p>It would be worthy of admiration how it came to be that just as from the very cradle of the church to our times there have never been lacking heretics who dared to move apostolic doctrine from its place and insert their own, so indeed the church has never been free from that kind of men who vehemently abused the study of philosophy and the knowledge of other good arts in Christian matters. It would be, I say, worthy of admiration, unless it were clear that not every spirit is from God, but that to the Holy Author of all truth there is opposed in the world another author of error and "father of lies," who "did not stand in the truth from the beginning" [John 8:44], whose greatest endeavor is to impose by a certain appearance of right through the abuse of the best things and thus cunningly precipitate incautious minds into error. He began his own web by tempting Christ and soon, as he once contended with Moses, attempted to subvert the faith of miracles with his magical tricks, first indeed in Simon the Samaritan, then in Elymas the Cypriot, both of whom are mentioned in Scripture. Soon after, when he had made little progress on this side, he easily persuaded philosophy not to submit to the fame of humble doctrine, but with raised crests to hold the foolishness of the cross in contempt. This he achieved not only among those by whom the apostles were mocked, as Paul also suffered from the Athenians, but also persuaded those who, having given their name to Christ, were already received into the fellowship of the church. However, being puffed up by the knowledge of the flesh, when the things the apostles had delivered seemed too humble and simple to them to be rested upon, they invented some great things, as it seemed to them, but in reality idle, superfluous, and impious, and were involved in the greatest errors, so that not unjustly Septimius Tertullian, an ancient author, in his book On the Prescription of Heretics attributes to philosophy the fact that heresies have arisen everywhere in the church. For Valentinus was a Platonist and Marcion a Stoic, and Ptolemy, a disciple of Valentinus, and Apelles, a disciple of Marcion, though they varied nothing from their masters, are believed to have drawn their fables from the same sources.</p>
      <p>There are also those who say that Arius was deceived by the abuse of philosophical doctrines, so that he did not avoid the error about the inequality of the substance of the Father and the Son, and preferred, even when admonished by reasoning, to please himself rather than to hold the truth from the simple tradition of the Scriptures, so that from that spark - so pestilent is obstinacy - a conflagration arose under the reign of Constantine the Great, which afflicted the churches of both the East and the West with the gravest hatreds and, as it happens, with a kind of internal and truly civil war alternating with the favor of princes for more than one century. Nor was this the end of discord: After Eunomius, who denied that the Holy Spirit had anything in common with the Father and the Son, that Briton Pelagius, who gave so much trouble to Augustine in his old age, also emerging from his hiding place, asserted that a man could, if he wished, be without sin and attain salvation from his own merits without grace. Saint Jerome, writing against the Pelagians, testifies that this error originated from Pythagoras and the Stoic philosopher Zeno. For they so extol the condition of man with praises and arrogate so much ability and dignity to him that they almost deem him worthy of a certain divine degree of perfection, while on the contrary, Scripture allows nothing to man deprived of grace except sin, death, and damnation.</p>
      <p>But to continue the subject: A little under the time of Gregory the First, when peace flourished in the churches and a certain respite from the troubles of heretics seemed to be given to the weary, and there were none who would besmirch that secret of the Trinity, comprehended by adoration alone, with such foul stains of errors, behold suddenly, lest there be no heresies, another discord was sown by that enemy of truth, and it began to be thought of by the bishops about monarchy, namely the deadly plague of humility. This ambition indeed involved those most illustrious churches of the East and the nurses of the primitive religion with the Roman church in miserable calamity, and since there was no end to the contention, after quarrels exercised back and forth without any, I would say, moderation of all, they were separated by a perpetual schism. But nonetheless, in the meantime, there was labor about the kingdom, about possessing fields and cities, not without arts, which it is not appropriate to mention here.</p>
      <p>Finally, I do not know by what philosophy it came to such audacity that things which belong to God alone were openly arrogated to man, and what was Christ's, both as savior and avenger of salvation, was attributed to the works of the anointed and the merits of the saints, drawn again from the storehouse of Pelagius. All these things, when they had not been promoted unsuccessfully and had been asserted and defended by some great patrons, as they then seemed, for more or less three centuries past, and it seemed permissible in such security to do what one pleased, it happened that what was of ministry turned into dominion and tyranny, and what had been of grace and was once given freely to believers was almost entirely turned into gain or - as Peter calls it - merchandise. And, to speak briefly, that face of the church arose, which we see.</p>
      <p>And indeed, at this point, I do not intend to pursue the errors of those times or to criticize the morals. I only intended to warn that in no age have honest arts been so open to abuse and, as it were, a confederate ally to heresies, as the study of philosophy has been to us Christians in the last four hundred years. For some have so mixed foreign and profane, not to say impious, things with the sacred words of the Scriptures, and so mingled thorny and curious things with the most holy, that with simple and common consciences overwhelmed by the evil, there was no other reason why human things were received as divine, and again, divine things were not much more esteemed than those dreams which men with such authority had thrust upon mortals as divine. But it was neither pious nor theological to consider anything that did not savor of Aristotle. And would that we had received more fruitful lucubrations of that man, whom Pliny praises as supreme in all knowledge, and not only those things which we have abused for perplexing disputes, contentions, and battles. But far be it that a Christian man should think that anything good or useful should be condemned because there are or have been those who preferred to abuse rather than use it. For what things under heaven, or things or arts, are there that the human mind, as it is naturally prone to error, cannot abuse? The Scripture itself, sacred by so many names, is still either shamelessly despised by heretics or certainly twisted as the occasion demands, lest it seem not to support the doctrine that is defended.</p>
      <p>Therefore, those seem to me to think rightly and piously who indeed hold the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures in such a place that they establish in them once for all the tradition of all things that pertain to our life and salvation so perfect and complete that they say it is confessed blasphemy to wish to take away or add anything, and again, whatever is asserted beyond them in such a way that the reason for salvation is established in it, that very thing ought neither to be believed nor received, because it is imposture, not piety, to say that it is from the will of God and pleases God through Christ, which neither God through the prophets nor the Son of God Christ through the apostles taught, but is most impudently thrust upon the simplicity of believers, which openly fights with the Scriptures.</p>
      <p>In this opinion, unless I am mistaken, the writers of all churches are commended with praises, especially Jerome and Augustine, who wish their lucubrations to be received and approved by no other law than if what they teach by interpreting never disagrees with those canonical oracles. But those same authors, whom I have now mentioned, when we see them adorned with so many excellent arts and equipped with such great skill and knowledge of all things, approaching that secret of heavenly mysteries as if with well-washed hands, indeed admonished all good and pious people by their example alone that nothing of those arts should be rejected, whose use can be honest.</p>
      <p>For this reason, it has happened that I cannot agree with those who strive to defraud that most sacred profession, as if it were a certain queen placed on her throne, of its usual ornaments and at the same time to strip it of all supplies, while they do not permit or receive liberal studies and that part of philosophy which, over the course of many centuries, with such great ingenuity of minds, explores and proposes the force, reason, and nature of things remarkable in heaven and earth, to perform its function, that is, to serve and be obedient to that mistress to whom all things owe. We say that in learning and handling them, a certain measure pleases us, and it is enough if they devote some part of their life to them, so that even in passing, as they hasten to better things, they may taste, as it is said, like a dog from the Nile, who are to be future bishops.</p>
      <p>However, I confess that I do not see in what matter religion can be helped by our effort and counsel alone, and some path can be opened to piety, if there should be no place for these doctrines, by which, as if by attendants of truth, from a deeper investigation of created things, we ascend to the highest admiration of the Creator himself. "But no one," they say, "comes to me unless my Father draws him" [John 6:44]. We confess and deny that even the Scriptures themselves will be well used by anyone who is not imbued with the Spirit of the Lord. For "the things of God," as Paul testifies, "no one knows except the Spirit of God" [1 Cor 2:11]. But this Spirit, they say, leads us into all truth. Rightly so. Therefore, they will grant us, whether they wish it or not, that no one will walk through the studies and arts, as through meadows full of flowers, with greater fruit than he himself, who, endowed with the right Spirit of the Lord, like a bee, rejects the harmful things and picks only those that are honeyed, and chooses nothing else than those whose majesty, power, and glory of him, by whom they are created, can be exhibited to the world with the greatest proclamation.</p>
      <p>But this very thing, they say, the apostles did not do with philosophy. But they did not prohibit it either. Paul condemns philosophy, but only that which indeed attributes to itself, detracts from piety, whose arrogant confidence we said above imposed on the heretics, so that they abused many things not badly handed down. The same apostle, in the first letter to the Corinthians, chapter 12, among the gifts distributed to the churches by the Spirit of the Lord, mentions wisdom and knowledge, besides healing and the skill of languages and other things of that kind, by which names indeed a great part of the things pertaining to philosophy is comprehended. What prevents him who is of sincere faith in Christ from investigating these things even from the monuments of the Gentiles? Or do we think Paul mocked us when he asserts that "to those who love God, all things work together for good" [Rom 8:28]? So that I do not even mention how much effort was made by the ancients to show that there are many things in the books of the pagans that openly confirm our religion. In this matter, Lactantius Firmianus and his imitator, Saint Augustine, are very much involved.</p>
      <p>Now, to indicate the fruit of this kind of studies more closely, I think they will not deny that no one can judge more certainly and better about the skill of an architect than he who knows the craftsmanship of the building he has architected, nor can anyone praise or admire him more truly than he who has made a trial of the art. Thus, I think they will allow us to invite good minds without controversy to the investigation of remarkable things in the whole of nature, so that they may more hold, admire, and love the power, wisdom, and majesty of the Creator of all things, the more they have closely followed those traces of inexhaustible fullness. There are arts that show us the circuits of heavenly bodies, their intervals, their magnitude, their risings and settings, the succession and vicissitude of days and nights, and moreover, the parts of the year and seasons. There are arts that explain the natures of almost all living things, as infinite experience has discovered them. There are arts that expose the causes of things appearing in the sky and, in general, all those things that happen in the air. Finally, on land and sea - in which parts especially that opulence of things born for the use of mortals is visible - nothing seemed so minute or insignificant to antiquity that it did not please them to note and commit to writing, provided some fruit of knowledge or admiration appeared from it. From the knowledge of all these things, as I said, we derive this fruit, that the pious mind is captivated by the vehement admiration of the artist and soon seeks and fears the source of such great things, and moreover, easily thinks with itself that there was not always a work in which so much artistry shines, nor is it from itself or by chance that it is distinguished by such a beautiful and admirable order. For even Marcus Cicero, a very serious author, has recorded that the ancient philosophers, led by the contemplation of nature, finally reached the point of acknowledging that there is a mind to which all things obey as it governs. "As if someone," he says, "came into a house or gymnasium or forum, when he sees the reason, method, and discipline of all things, he cannot judge that they happen without cause, but understands that there is someone who presides and to whom obedience is given, much more in such great movements and such vicissitudes, in the orders of so many and such great things, he must necessarily conclude that these great movements of nature are governed by some mind." These are the words of Cicero. But Chrysippus, according to the same author, confessed that he learned from nature itself that there is a god who accomplishes all things. From which also that verse of Virgil seems to be derived:</p>
      <p>"In the beginning, the sky and the lands and the flowing fields</p>
      <p>And the shining globe of the moon and the Titanian stars</p>
      <p>A spirit within nourishes, and a mind infused through the limbs</p>
      <p>Moves the whole mass and mingles with the great body."</p>
      <p>Aristotle, however, judged that "if there were those who had always lived under the earth, then at some time, with the jaws of the earth opened, they could escape from those hidden seats into these places which we inhabit, and could go out, when they suddenly saw the earth and seas and sky, knew the magnitude of the clouds and the force of the winds, and saw the sun, and knew both its magnitude and beauty, and also its efficiency, because it makes the day with light diffused through the whole sky, and when the earth was occupied by night, then they saw the whole sky adorned and decorated with stars and the variety of the moon's lights, both waxing and waning, and the risings and settings of all these things and their innumerable courses in all eternity - when they saw these things, they would certainly think that there are gods and that these great works are the works of the gods." For this reason, the apostle at the beginning of the letter to the Romans makes the wise among the Gentiles guilty of both wrath and damnation for this very reason, that God opened to them the path of knowing himself, but they did not glorify him as God when they apprehended and knew him, but changed the glory for one God into many gods, made in the likeness of images not only of mortal man but also of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles, etc. How this happened is most clearly understood from those books which Marcus Cicero left written on the nature of the gods. But since Paul in this very place openly teaches that the invisible things of God are clearly seen from the creation of the world, being understood by the things that are made, and by this way his eternal power and divinity are evident, there will be no further cause for the adversaries to complain that it is not permissible, as it always was, indeed it is both conducive and most fitting for religion, for those who are to be professors of the Scriptures and leaders of the churches to devote themselves to honest disciplines and liberal studies, since we see that it is so arranged by nature that, as far as it is in our industry, we are led by a natural order from these things which are obvious to our senses to know the more sublime and remote things.</p>
      <p>Nor are we offended by what some object, that in the opinions of the ancients and moderns about the natures of things, there seem to be many things that are partly handed down with doubtful and uncertain causes, partly not sufficiently clearly investigated, and that there are more things that escape human understanding than have come to our knowledge, and moreover, that the Peripatetics frequently admit that our mind is mistaken in the investigation of many things, which are nevertheless most manifest to one who thoroughly knows the causes of nature. But this very thing pertains most to the praise of that architect and creator, to whom we not only attribute what we know, but also, surrounded by such a variety, multitude, and excellence of truly wonderful things, we confess that there are far more excellent and sublime things which our mortal mind does not comprehend than those which the ingenuity and diligence of our ancestors have brought to light. This is indeed the way that leads us to the adoration of that incomprehensible majesty. This is the great glory of our God, which humbles our efforts. Paul himself, caught up to the third heaven, tells us that we see heavenly things as through a mirror and a riddle, and that we will not see them face to face unless we are changed and clothed with better things.</p>
      <p>But in a matter almost manifest, I am longer than either reason or I intended. However, I was pleased, Bullinger, to preface this matter against the insolence of some, so that since you, by your singular learning with which you are endowed by the Lord, after having expounded with great skill several of the apostolic epistles, were adorning a commentary on the second book of the Gospels of Luke, which is entitled the Acts of the Apostles, and at the same time, in your most delightful letters, you requested that what I had recently dictated to my brothers, ministers of the word, for illustrating the history of Luke, when we had reviewed it together, with the addition of general maps of the world, should be sent to you in an epitome, so that they might conveniently be connected with your work and come to light, I might first of all counter the calumnies of those who condemn what they do not understand and under the pretext of piety fight against true piety, and do not see that they are seeking nothing more nor achieving anything else, if their wishes succeed, than to recall that inertia which for so many centuries has most miserably afflicted the Christian world as if it were captive to barbarians, and to utterly overthrow and destroy solid piety accompanied by so many illustrious disciplines by the example of the ancients.</p>
      <p>The usefulness of geography or cosmography has been discussed by us elsewhere, and it is well known that this part of philosophy, when explained a little more diligently, is so akin to the entire investigation of the nature of things that almost everything illustrious and memorable in the world is drawn along with it. But the frequent consensus of the learned attributes so much to this faculty that they admit that students can neither rightly receive the knowledge of places nor the series of events in the Scriptures if they are entirely ignorant of it.</p>
      <p>For me, certainly, when I dictated these things, two things were especially considered. The first was that since I saw Luke making so much mention of places, from this our rudimentary instruction they might understand that even those cannot be held in certain order or with great fruit in memory unless first the form of the whole earth, as it is divided into parts and as it is washed by the sea both outside and inside the shores, is thoroughly learned. For just as members are cut off from the body, so you cannot have the knowledge of any part of the lands separately unless first the position, appearance, and condition of the whole body is established. Secondly, to encourage the knowledge of the deeds of nations and peoples and thus to all kinds of history, because by reading this not only are the things that are reported worthy of being known, but also the very frequent mention of places continually exercises the memory and recalls it to the faith of the maps, as each is inserted and noted in its parts.</p>
      <p>Above all, however, I was warning that there is nothing in this kind of doctrine that in such a perplexing variety and multitude of names and places more faithfully aids the memory than the use of ancient maps, especially general ones, which so place cities, rivers, mountains, and regions before our eyes that we seem to see and contemplate the things themselves in person.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 7th day before the Kalends of August, in the year 1534.</p>
