    <p xml:id="regest1">[We] have received Schwenckfeld's letter [No. 1597] and have taken note of the concerns presented by Jakob Held; they have so far avoided as much as possible to judge in such theological disputes, and have instead adhered to the simple, apostolic teaching of the grace of God through Jesus Christ, who was crucified, resurrected, and ascended into heaven as true man and true God, where he sits at the right hand of God and from where he will come to judge the living and the dead; this teaching is supported by the infallible Word of God, to which they want to hold fast, even if an angel were to proclaim something different. If Schwenckfeld is of the same opinion, they thank God; but if he deviates from it, they pray to God to lead him back to the right path. They have so far been unaware of Schwenckfeld's condemnation by the Schmalkaldic League, but cannot interfere in foreign affairs; they are familiar with Vadian's writing ["Antilogia"] and hope that Vadian has handled the matter in such a way that it will ultimately turn out for the good. Due to many obligations, they have not yet read Schwenckfeld's book and will not review it, leaving that to Vadian. Blessing wish.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ, with the offering of our friendly greetings and willing services beforehand.</p>
      <p>Honorable, dear sir and friend, your letter to us along with the book, concerning the Schmalkaldic condemnation and the "Antilogia" of our dear lord and brother Vadian, presented by you, we have received from the pious, honorable Jakob Held von Dieffenow, citizen of Strasbourg, who also willingly listened to your concerns on your behalf.</p>
      <p>And we thank you for all your friendly offers, efforts, and goodwill towards us, etc. We inform you hereby, with good and friendly intention, that we have so far refrained as much as possible from engaging in sharp disputes on such high matters and with highly learned, excellent people, and instead have taught the church of Christ, entrusted to us, as faithfully and to the best of our ability, primarily according to evangelical, apostolic simplicity, so that God, the heavenly Father, may be gracious to all His believers and grant eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ, who in undivided person, yet with unmixed natures, is true God and man, crucified, died, and buried for us, who also with His true human body rose again from the dead on the third day, ascended into heaven, and there still, as true God and man, sits at the right hand of God and will come again with true body to judge the living and the dead, etc. For such is our teaching and faith, we have a good, clear foundation in the infallible Word of God; to this we will, with God's help, adhere firmly and remain, so that even if an angel from heaven were to come and reveal something different to us, we would not accept it at all.</p>
      <p>If you are now of the same faith and similar apostolic simplicity and conduct, we thank God and pray to Him that He may increase His grace in you and all believers. But if you are of a different opinion, we pray to the Lord that He may be gracious to you and direct your understanding back to the simple, sound teaching.</p>
      <p>Of the dispute you have had with the Schmalkaldic League so far, and of your actions or their condemnation, we have known nothing until this moment. Therefore, we cannot burden ourselves with a foreign and unknown matter. However, we have been well aware of the writing of our beloved lord and brother Vadian, hoping that the honorable Jakob Held in your name has been with Vadian, has also handed over and dealt with your writing and book, and that our dear lord Vadian, who is always of extraordinary friendliness towards everyone, especially faithful to the Lord Christ, and also of great modesty and wonderful skill and experience, has handled and conducted himself in such a way that it will all turn out for the good.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we have received your book, not that we will read it immediately and eagerly, as we are burdened with many tasks and have no leisure at this time. We have also not received and kept it to judge it or expect our judgment, as we consider ourselves too insignificant for such things, but when our general and individual circumstances allow, we will then review it. However, we hope that our dear lord and brother Vadian will always handle this matter appropriately, so that it will not require our special effort.</p>
      <p>May God Almighty truly and richly impart His Spirit to you through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, the first day of February 1542. Pastor, preacher, reader, servant of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, our dear, special Caspar Schwenckfeld, in Justingen in Swabia.</p>
