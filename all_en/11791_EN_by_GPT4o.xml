    <p xml:id="regest1">Hopes for Bullinger's well-being. Would have much to tell about the visit of the Pope [Paul III] in Ferrara, but will be brief: The Duke [Ercole II d'Este] had the Pope picked up from a luxurious ship in Piacenza, and on April 22, he arrived in Ferrara with great pomp, accompanied by many cardinals and bishops, the Duke and his sons [Luigi and Alfonso (II) d'Este]. The Pope has now traveled on to Bologna for a meeting with the Emperor [Charles V], after which he supposedly wants to return to Ferrara for three months. During his long life in the service of many princes, Ratgeb has not seen as much pomp as the clerics have recently displayed. During Lent, three men were imprisoned in Ferrara for their faith, but were released again, probably with the help of the Duchess [Renée of France]; in Bologna, about a hundred were imprisoned, all but three were released. He himself was also in danger, but as a bodyguard, the Dominicans, the Pope's henchmen, had to leave him alone; if it becomes too dangerous, he hopes to find a good reception in Zurich. Many are accused of Lutheranism at the slightest suspicion, yet there are many secret supporters of the Reformation in Bologna, Venice, and all of Lombardy; many books were also banned, such as [Celio Secondo Curione's] "Pasquino in estasi" and Bernardino [Ochino's] "Prediche," almost all of which he possesses. Greetings to Heinrich Göldli; he forgot to mention the splendid decoration of the streets and the erection of triumphal arches for the Pope's entry. Last autumn there was a locust plague, which is now looming again; high taxes in Ferrara; may God help us! Please write again; blessings.</p>

      <p>† Jesus Christ. Given on the holy day of Pentecost 1543 in Ferrara. Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ; to Him be praise, honor, and thanks forever.</p>
      <p>My friendly and most humble service is always ready for you. My most gracious Lord Heinrich, I let you know of my health, thanks be to God, and so I hope in God, this present letter will find you likewise.</p>
      <p>I had so much news to write to you about the Pope, who was here in Ferrara, that I cannot write so much about the great splendor, honor, pride, and triumph that the Duke showed to the Pope. However, I will outline a little for you: The Duke sent a ship from Ferrara to Piacenza to meet him, called El Puzzenttoro, which can comfortably hold 200 people, made like a house, inside all covered with golden pieces and outside with silk and velvet, green and white, his colors. And on April 22, he rode in with 18 cardinals and 44 bishops, and the Duke rode before him in three colors. The Duke's younger son rode ahead with a hundred young men, dressed in white silk and silver; after him rode the older son with a hundred counts and knights, dressed in red crimson velvet and embroidered with gold; then rode the Duke with a hundred noble people and his retinue, all dressed in brown velvet and damask, and then the cardinals and then the Pope. Without counting the horses and mules, there were about 200. The Duke had all his artillery placed in front of the gates and fired, a hundred and 48 pieces on wheels not counting the small handguns and mortars and hand cannons. There were drums, field drums, fifes, trumpets, shawms, cymbals, trombones, and all the string instruments one can think of. There were prostitutes and ruffians, cards, dice, feasting, drinking, banqueting, and comedy and tragedy, and the Duke held a tournament for him. And so one sees how the world holds sway. He has gone back to Bologna, and it is said here for sure that after he has spoken with the Emperor, he wants to return to Ferrara and stay there for 3 months in the Duke's quarters; he likes it well. I am 48 years old and have served princes, lords, kings, and emperors; but the pride and arrogance and pomp and haughtiness I have never seen in my life with clothes and all the wickedness one can think of, as the priests do now in the last times.</p>
      <p>I write you news that here in Ferrara during Lent, 3 pious men were imprisoned for the sake of God's word; yet they have come out again with God's help. The Duchess always does her best. And in Bologna, there were about a hundred imprisoned; yet they have all been let go except for three, who still lie there.</p>
      <p>And so, my dearest Lord Heinrich and brother in Christ Jesus, I was also almost caught in the clutches, but because I am a soldier and the Duke's bodyguard, they had to let me go in peace, the rogue monks of San Domenico, who are the Pope's henchmen. But if I can no longer be here for the sake of God's word, I will flee to my lords and will do as the prodigal son. I hope in God, He will not forsake me, and I want to ask you, if it comes to that, you will be helpful to me. They do not think that anyone talks about it; as soon as someone speaks of Christ or Paul or the Holy Scripture, they say he is a Lutheran. Yet there are many here and in Bologna and Venice and all of Lombardy, but secretly for fear of the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>Recently, several Italian booklets have come out; the Pope has had them banned under penalty of corporal punishment; there are many books that are banned, but among others is "Pasquino in estasi" and the sermons of Brother Bernardino of Siena, who is in Geneva, and I have almost all the books.</p>
      <p>I want to ask you to greet Heinrich Göldli for me and show him the news, how his heathen or holy father, the Pope, acts. Moreover, which I forgot, they covered the street with fine cloths above, where he had to ride, more than 2 Italian miles long, and the Duke had five triumphal gates made; through them, he had to ride.</p>
      <p>My Lord Heinrich, I let you know how last autumn here in the land there was such an innumerable number of locusts that no one believes who does not see, and they laid their eggs in the ground, and now they are starting to grow again, so numerous that it is uncountable. The Duke has had it announced: Whoever wants to catch them will receive a bolino for each pound, which makes 9 heller. So God plagues us, and we do not become aware until the barrel breaks. May Almighty God grant us a blessed end. I ask you to write back to me about your well-being and health, and remember me in your prayers; so I will also do, that God may protect us from all evil. Your most humble servant and brother in Jesus Christ, Hans Ratgeb from Zurich, bodyguard in Ferrara.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned and well-regarded lord, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord, to his hands. In Zurich.</p>
