      <p>To his most esteemed Lord Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>If you are well, my most excellent and esteemed Lord Bullinger, it is good; indeed, I am well with all my household by the grace of God. However, I have received two letters from you, to which I have not yet responded, and the reason is that I was abroad. But upon returning, as soon as I found a messenger, I did not want to delay writing. It was therefore most pleasing to learn from your letters that you and your entire family are safe, and may the most good and great God ensure that this remains so perpetually. It was also pleasant to hear that my son bathed at Baden; I hope that this bathing will be beneficial to him, and may the same most good and great God grant it to be so. I am eager to know when he will return and what benefit he perceives from the baths, although I think I will come there shortly, as I wrote to you before, and if I had not been hindered by pressing business (as I am now most of all), I would have hastened my visit to Zürich. But since it was not possible sooner, at least after the fair, God willing, I will visit you all. I truly wish to find you safe with all your family.</p>
      <p>For keeping me informed of new matters, I rightly thank you, especially since I see that this cannot be done without detracting from your most holy studies, from which you take the time to write to me, and I acknowledge that you do this to gratify me, as indeed you do, and I will repay the favor. It was astonishing to hear that King Philip has crossed from England with a hostile army into Belgium, and if this is so (for you do not entirely assert it to be true), I certainly fear that this war will be dangerous for France. And to fear this, I am moved by what I have sometimes read in chronicles about the bloody wars waged by the English against France in ancient times. Nor is it surprising if such expeditions are pernicious, since, due to the proximity of the places, such wars are like civil wars. Moreover, the French are in greater danger because they have stirred up wars on all sides, so that they must face not just one imminent danger, but many at once. May the Lord God lay His holy hand upon them. To be honest, I am very much in favor of the French side, and I am mostly moved to do so because the French are friends to our regions and favor our liberty. Regarding the colloquy to be held at Worms and the assembly announced at Frankfurt, if the pious men hope for any good, may they not be disappointed in their hope. As for what I hope in this matter, I do not know; I indeed fear that the world will perpetually care for worldly things with little or no regard for heavenly matters. May the Lord turn all things to good and to the promotion of His glory.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Italian war, I have nothing certain to write, and therefore, lest I perhaps convey falsehoods, I pass over it in silence, although it is affirmed as true among us (though I doubt it) that the French army has descended into the territory of the Bruttii and, having occupied many fortified places here and there, is gaining a great victory, and that the Duke of Alba has been driven into certain regions difficult of access, where he, to ensure the safety of himself and his men, is hiding, not daring to come into the sight of the enemy. If I receive any more certain news hereafter, I will not hesitate to inform you diligently. It has been reported here today that an assembly is soon to be held among us because the French envoy is requesting soldiers to be led to the Belgian regions.</p>
      <p>If this is true, I would indeed believe that what you wrote about King Philip's crossing into France as uncertain is very true.</p>
      <p>As for what you hint at, my Lord Bullinger, that the Saxon preachers are attacking you with published pamphlets, I ask that you take it well and wish that you persuade yourself that this is happening by God's arrangement, so that your virtue and piety and that of your like may be stirred up by this argument being proposed again. Therefore, in my judgment, prepare yourself anew for a war that will never die, and with your holy works finally published, suppress the insolent audacity of the Saxons, and the greater the battle between you, the greater will be your victory and that of your like, from which indeed the glory of Christ the Lord will be more and more promoted day by day. For He does not wish the talent entrusted to you to remain without interest, and He will finally pay you a worthy reward of immortality for such vigils and labors endured for Him. But how far have I progressed, my Lord Bullinger, to exhort you? Forgive me, I pray, if I act beyond decorum, and indeed I confess my error, yet relying on the hope that for your humanity you will not be angry with me.</p>
      <p>I have not yet met the royal envoy you write about, but I will soon see him, God willing, and I will very officiously mention your regard for him; I ask, however, that you in turn remember me kindly to him if you ever write to him. I might have written more, my most esteemed and delightful Lord Bullinger, if the swift departure of the messenger, who is Mr. Wilhelm Gratarolus, an old friend of mine, whom I commend to you, had not forced me to sound the retreat. Therefore, I conclude, commending and offering myself to you and all yours, especially to your most honorable wife and your excellent sons-in-law, and also to the whole choir of pious and learned men. I pray to the Lord Jesus that He may continually keep you safe. Greet my son, who is also yours, since you cherish him so fatherly.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever and be mindful of me, your friend.</p>
      <p>Given hastily at Samaden on Pentecost morning, 1557.</p>
      <p>Mr. Johannes Fabricius will also be most commendable to me in your name and for his outstanding learning, as far as I can promote his honor and advantage. Again, farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>The same as above, most devoted to you, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
