    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Myconius had the enclosed letter with him for a few days because he couldn't find a messenger to Zurich. Bullinger should forward it to the addressee [...]. After receiving Bullinger's letter [No. 2954], Myconius inquired with Johannes Gast about the money [for the wool]. Gast confirmed that he had received it from the Englishman [John Burcher]. Myconius had thought that Gast would have long since written to Bullinger about this! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] He has not learned anything about the negotiations of the French envoy [Sébastien de L'Aubespine, abbé de Bassefontaine, at the Baden Diet]. Currently, he is troubled by the bad reputation that the Swiss have [in France]. This is due to their insatiable greed. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] The [supposed] harmony among the Swiss causes Myconius great concern. If only this harmony were genuine, especially since such is more necessary than ever in the face of the cunning and malevolent Spaniard [Emperor Charles V]! But the Bible verse "God abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man" [Ps 5, 7] does not bode well for this harmony. What success can allies who are not united in the Lord hope for [from this]? It pains Myconius deeply to hear repeatedly from the inhabitants of the Five Places that, should the Emperor attack, they would disregard the religious differences [among the Swiss]! Bullinger can well imagine what consequences this would have! The [four Protestant cities] have no choice but to trust the Lord with all their hearts. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] Hopefully, the graves found in Königsfelden were intended for emperors and kings and not for the common people! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Bullinger's message about Johann von Weeze, the Archbishop of Lund, was amusing, but not the one about the people of Basel! Myconius heard about it for the first time. The parish colleagues also knew nothing more about it. As Thomas Gyrfalk learned from a councilman [...], the Emperor is said to have written to some or even all of the Swiss places these days, stating that he would regard the Eight Old Places as eternal friends and would not infringe on their freedom as long as they stayed out of it if he had to take action against a subject of the House of Austria. How cunning, not to say, how foolish! Unless he is trying to provoke the dog in this way! It may have been [the aforementioned summons of the people of Basel by the Emperor] that prompted the Swiss to write to the Emperor [on July 9] again about the three cities [Basel, Mulhouse, and Rottweil]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] There is no news about the Hanseatic cities. Heinrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel was reinstated as Duke. He has already tried to harass Bremen. But then Johann von Heideck came and killed more than 500 of his men. When the same Heideck wanted to supply the city of Bremen with provisions, the enemies learned of it and stationed some soldiers in the valley and others on a hill. The supply train was supposed to pass between the two troops. However, Heideck learned of this, left the supply train behind to attack and defeat the troop in the valley with a surprise attack with some men. The enemies had previously agreed on a signal: at a cannon shot, the troop stationed on the hill was to rush down into the valley. However, since the signal failed, a mounted scout [...] was sent from this troop. He saw that the lower troop had been defeated and reported this to his people, whereupon they also fled. A few days ago, a Basel patrician [...], who was in Bad Liebenzell, learned this from Count Wilhelm [of Fürstenberg] on his way home. Bullinger should not disclose the name. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> [7] In Venice, the situation of the [Protestants] has become terrible. A reward of 50 ducats has been offered for the denunciation of Lutherans. One can imagine what follows from this! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest8"> [8] Bullinger should write again. Greetings. </p>

      <p>S. Please send the enclosed letters to the person whose name they bear. I had them with me for a few days because I couldn't find anyone heading to Zurich. Therefore, send them as soon as possible. Gast has received the money from the Englishman; he confirmed this to me when I asked, right after I received your letter. I had thought he would have written back to you long ago.</p>

      <p>I am completely unaware of what the French envoy has done, even after diligent inquiry. Those I approached also claimed not to know, and they swore to it. I have been more concerned about this matter than almost anything else lately, because it still hasn't escaped me: the Swiss have been poorly regarded so far due to the insatiable greed of our people, which has long plagued France. I still wish to know what has been done.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am very concerned about the harmony among our people. If only it could be complete! Now is the time, if ever there was one, when it is especially needed to counter the cunning and malevolent Spanish character. And if it does not help us: "The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man," I do not know how we can deal successfully with him unless we are better united in the Lord. It pains me greatly to hear repeatedly from the Five Places: "If it comes to that, we will set aside our faith," etc. For you can weigh what kind of word that is! But what shall we do, except to depend on the Lord and trust in Him with all our heart, etc.!</p>

      <p>May the Lord Jesus ensure that the graves you wrote about in Königsfelden are intended for emperors and kings, not constructed for commoners.</p>

      <p>Regarding Lund, what you mentioned is pleasing; regarding my people of Basel, not in the slightest! You are the first to inform me, and my brothers know no more than I do. My Gyrfalconius said these days, from a certain senator, that the Emperor wrote, I don't know whether to all the Cantons or just some. He would regard the Eight Old Places as perpetual friends and would not harm their freedom, provided they do not interfere if he takes action against those belonging to the House of Austria. This is significant and deceitful, yet foolish unless he wishes to reveal his deceit and seek a stick to strike the dog. Perhaps this is why the Cantons wrote back to the Emperor about the three cities you mentioned.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I hear nothing about the maritime cities. The Duke of Brunswick has been reinstated. He attempted to harass Bremen. Heideck came and defeated over 500 of his men. The same Heideck wanted to bring provisions to Bremen. The enemies learned of this and divided their forces, placing one part in the valley and the other on the hill. The provisions had to pass between them. Heideck, realizing this, left the provisions and silently attacked those in the valley, defeating them. It was agreed that upon a signal, those on the hill would rush down. However, the signal was delayed, and a scout was sent to investigate. He saw the defeat and returned to his people, causing them to flee. A noble citizen of ours learned this from Count Wilhelm on his way home from Bad Liebenzell a few days ago. I tell you the name, but not others.</p>

      <p>The Venetians are acting terribly against the Lord: they have promised 50 ducats to the accuser of a Lutheran. From this, you can measure the rest!</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Write back. Farewell in the Lord with all the brothers. Basel, July 25, 1547. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man, the most faithful minister of Christ, his venerable brother and lord in Christ. Zurich.</p>
