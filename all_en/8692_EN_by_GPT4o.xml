      <p>May the grace of God be with you through our Lord Jesus Christ. Since you, my most reverend and beloved lord and godfather, promised your assistance to me, among many others, as I was setting out for Glarus, I recently dared to write to you so boldly. However, the present scarcity, which I share with many others, compelled me. I trust, therefore, that you will more easily forgive this importunity of mine for your kindness towards me, when you rightly consider the urgent necessity, and I earnestly ask you to be willing to act in this matter as a diligent father would towards a son whom he has always loved most tenderly. For you, in your wisdom, know with whom my affairs should be attempted. After our consul of blessed memory in Cham passed away, I know of no one whose help I can implore. We have read here the new things, which I return to you, and we all give you immense thanks for informing us about them, and we ask that you do not cease to do the same always. The sons of the late Mr. Beldius commend themselves to you and wish to renew and faithfully maintain the friendship you had with their father, as (I believe) their own letters will testify. You, my father, consider these things favorably, and live happily in the Lord, who blesses you and yours forever.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Glarus, 24th of October, in the year [15]71.</p>
      <p>Mr. Avienus, Fridolin Schuler, and many other men send you their greetings, as does my wife, who wishes you well with the whole family. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Your most loving Johannes Hug in Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zürich, his dearly beloved, friendly, dear lord and godfather, to his hands.</p>
