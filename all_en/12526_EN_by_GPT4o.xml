    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller should remain steadfast as before, encourage the [Augsburgers] to pray, and prepare them for death, which would be preferable to a disgraceful, treacherous peace treaty.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Emperor [Charles V] has sent [the Swiss Confederates] a flattering but deceptive letter. The Zurich council has, in turn, ordered public prayers for the [German Protestants]. Even if he should achieve something for their cause with the other Swiss Confederates, one should not rely on the Swiss, but solely on God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Haller and the Augsburgers should report on the situation frequently. This is indeed dangerous, but Augsburg has reliable messengers. However, Haller should be cautious in his communications to Jakob Ruf. He should withhold anything alarming from him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Trust in God will give courage!</p>

      <p>My Haller, I ask two things of you. First, that you continue to be as you have been by the grace of God until now, and that you overcome and conquer yourself in dangers. Be strong in the Lord. Console your people. Urge them to pray. Urge them not to trust in the flesh, but in God the Spirit. Prepare them to prefer death over accepting disgraceful conditions, not of peace, but of betrayal.</p>

      <p>The Emperor writes sweetly, but he is a scorpion. We have instituted public prayers for you in the city and countryside. Our magistrate diligently pursues our cause with the other Swiss Confederates, and I hope for the best. However, you should not place your trust in the Swiss Confederates. Whether they come or not, let God be your fear and your salvation. Oh, you righteous people! Pray to God earnestly! Look to God! I hear nothing but good about you in truth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>First, write frequently so that we may know how things stand. I know it is dangerous to write in these troubles, but the city has reliable messengers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Second, when writing to our citizens, especially to Jakob Ruf, consider carefully what you write. If anything is alarming, do not write it, trust me. Whatever I can do, I offer myself completely.</p>
      <p>Live! Farewell! May the Lord Jesus keep you. Comforting and undaunted. God's strength be our comfort!</p>
