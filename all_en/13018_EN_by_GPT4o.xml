    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger writes again with sorrow. Neither his admonitions nor Haller's letter [not received] and Thoman Ruman's report [before the Zurich council] have been able to effect Haller's recall from Augsburg! Yet even now, there is no ill will behind it. Rather, part of the exalted council hopes that Haller can still achieve much and counts on his loyalty and especially on God's protection. Additionally, the Zurich council places great value on the promises given in the letter from the Augsburg council [dated May 24]. Consequently, they have reminded the Augsburgers [with a letter dated July 28] of their assurance not to abandon Haller.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger repeats his admonition from his last letter [No. 2958], which Haller hopefully received from St. Gallen through Vadian. Perhaps God wants Haller to bear witness for Christ and the truth before Emperor Charles V and the other secular rulers. However, Haller should not challenge God and, if necessary, flee like Christ and Paul, but not in a hasty manner or for frivolous reasons. He should be brave and steadfast! He knows where to seek salvation. The enemies are eloquent, cunning, and favored by fortune. But Christ, the victor, says: No one will be able to contradict you when the Spirit of my Father speaks through you. Haller should pray and be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves! Surely, the other sayings of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew also come to Haller's mind.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] This in brief, as Bullinger must preach tomorrow. The council meeting only ended at five o'clock [in the afternoon], and the messenger [Andreas MÃ¼ller] said after dinner that he wanted to set off at daybreak. Haller should continue to report conscientiously by letter and faithfully warn his homeland if he should learn of any machinations against it. Bullinger is entirely his!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings. Michael Keller and Wolfgang Musculus should know that Bullinger's house is open to them. He could not write to them. Prayers will be said for the people of Augsburg. Written around nine o'clock in the evening.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Again, I write to your piety not without sorrow. For once more, your writings have achieved nothing. My admonition has accomplished nothing! The report of Thoman Ruman has achieved nothing! Yet even now, I will not attribute this to ill will. For part of the most exalted council hopes that you can still achieve much. They trust in your integrity, and above all, in the grace of the Lord. Furthermore, the writings of the most illustrious council of Augsburg and their promises hold great value. Hence, they are now reminded of the promise given or more truly made, not to neglect or lose you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I repeat what I advised in my last letter, which I hope you have received (for I sent it to St. Gallen to Vadianus): Perhaps it is the Lord's will that, despite our protests and all efforts to recall you, you bear witness to Christ and the truth before the emperor, kings, and princes of the world. Meanwhile, I do not want you to test the Lord. You know that the Lord Jesus, and even Paul, often sought refuge in flight. However, I would not want it to be hasty, unconsidered, or frivolous. See that you are strong and steadfast! You know where the help to will and to do comes from. Lift your heart and soul to the heavens! You know the cause is the best. Although the adversaries are well-equipped with eloquence, sophistry, and good fortune, the one who said: "No one will be able to resist you who contradicts you" has prevailed. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of my Father speaks through you. Pray to the Lord. Be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves. Surely, the other sayings of the Lord in Matthew come to mind.</p>

      <p>I am compelled to be brief. For the council only rose at the fifth hour. The messenger says he will leave with the day after dinner. I am compelled to preach tomorrow. I pray that you write back diligently and do not neglect your homeland if anything is planned against it. I am entirely yours! You may use me as your own!</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell. Tell Michael Keller and Wolfgang Musculus that my house is open to them and I offer them all that is mine. Greet both of them most amicably. I could not write to them. We will pray to the Lord for you. Around the ninth hour of the night. Entirely yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
