      <p>[...] you did not add the price; you will receive it if you add it. But how is it that you have not written back about the one who is spreading Pelagianism?</p>
      <p>Perhaps a lie has been spread among you regarding this matter. I gave you Agricola's work on weights as a gift long ago and I will not take back my word nor do I regret that matter, and I ask nothing else from you than to indicate what you think of that man's labors. A new war is brewing in the Netherlands, and I heard this from a coachman who has citizenship with us. I agree with you about that fortress, which you think the French have. Here, things change easily with the Emperor's departure.</p>
      <p>It is also true that the incendiary leader fled disgracefully, to the disappointment of many.</p>
      <p>Joachim of Brandenburg does not know where to turn. The school in Frankfurt is still standing firm and does not want to accept the Interim, nor does the prince impose it any longer.</p>
      <p>Islebius is hiding at home and rarely preaches; he feigns illness and undoubtedly has a wounded conscience, so he needs the best doctor to heal his troubled soul. Thus, the Lord usually sends a gnawing worm to those who deny the word of God for the hope of gain. Furthermore, know that on the day I received your letters, I arranged for letters to be sent to Strasbourg by boat through an excellent and faithful man. If the letters had not been sealed, I could have conveniently sent them to Leipzig through a certain merchant; but I did not dare to open them. The booklets you requested are not available with us, otherwise, I would have bought and sent them.</p>
      <p>I fear that Gumpenberg, who wants to forcefully intrude into the provostship of the main church, may cause us some harm; for we had a citizen from Augsburg in those days, whom he encountered before his house and said to him: "Are you from Basel?" "I am," he replied. To which Gumpenberg, with an angry face, said: "Tell your consul, the deceitful man; he never expected what they are doing; for they hold him against all right and equity; they shall soon see what will happen to them." And he uttered some other threatening words. To which the citizen replied: "I do not want to say such things to our people; you yourself should send someone to them and wish to babble such things."</p>
      <p>Consider what this courtier is plotting. No princes are yet in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>But we will hear what will happen at this assembly. What if the Emperor tries to wage war against the Swiss? Farewell. August 1, 1550. Basel. Greet Gwalther and the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
