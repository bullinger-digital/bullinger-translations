      <p>Most illustrious man, I received your letter yesterday, in which you informed me, among other things, about the marriage of Josias and Elisabeth, which I hope the Lord God will bless through Jesus Christ; I congratulate you all. I understood what Mr. Haler wrote. At the moment, I do not have the leisure to write to him; but I ask you to write back that I will soon return to you and that I am now engaged in matters that pertain entirely to the whole Christian republic; for it is certainly so. I sent a man to Italy to friends who wrote that they did not know where I was staying, and therefore they sent few letters to me; I sent another to the masked fathers. Therefore, expect lengthy letters from me soon. Now I only affirm this: it is true, as you say, that war has been declared between the Emperor and the King; so everyone affirms. In Cremona, a horrid persecution had arisen against the members of Christ; but Mr. Fernandus Gonzaga completely removed it by the grace of God, so that those poor brothers can now breathe again.</p>
      <p>Three times a week I began to preach, but good God, with what rage from the impious; for they entirely hoped I would never return again. But it troubles them that I am one who cannot preach calmly and spare the Antichrist. And who among those who feel Christ can spare him? I affirm that I am here in some danger, but I trust in the Lord. I commend to you from my heart my nephews, that is, that you often urge them to be diligent, and the teacher to be strict; in this matter, you can do nothing more pleasing for me. Whatever happens, I will return to you as soon as possible and bring translations and some other things. Farewell and be well, most excellent man. Greet all the brothers for me.</p>
      <p>Add a word to Mr. Haler, that he should write to Mr. Viret to send you the booklets and images that were brought to him from Geneva. Vicosoprano, 8th October 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
