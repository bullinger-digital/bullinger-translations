    <p xml:id="regest1">Regret and consolation on the death of Margaretha Blarer, a faithful servant of God. Sends a poem by [Rudolf] Gwalther on her passing with a request for its return, so that he can have it printed by [Christoph] Froschauer. Increase of the plague during the full moon phase; in Strasbourg, Jakob Bedrot succumbed to the plague; in Zurich itself, all church servants are still healthy, but two pastors in the countryside died. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I deeply grieve, most esteemed Ambrosius, that your noble sister Margaretha, the principal hope of so many needy on earth and a noble gem of all integrity, has been taken away by fate. May the Lord, who does everything with just judgment, console both you and those who truly placed great reliance on her.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it pleased the wondrous God, the rewarder of all good, to free His most faithful servant from the prison of this flesh, or rather to rescue her from impending evils, so that she would not be forced to see, with great sorrow, those things which the Lord will soon bring upon us due to our ingratitude and other great and innumerable sins. She now rejoices ineffably and praises the Blessed One forever and ever. Therefore, rejoice in the Lord with her, and having set aside mourning, pray: "Thy kingdom come" [Mt 6, 10; Lk 11, 2].</p>
      <p>I asked my Gwalther, a young man of much learning, the son-in-law of our Zwingli, to write an epitaph for the most holy virgin. He wrote it, which I present to you, but with the condition that you return it; for I will ensure it is printed by Froschauer for the grace of us all. The young man loves your family and wishes to serve you.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write, except that during this full moon, the plague has flared up again among us; not that I attribute anything to the stars regarding life or death, but because God, who works all things, uses time, stars, and any matters according to His will, which is always just and good. We hear that in Strasbourg, Jakob Bedrot, a truly excellent and pious man, has passed away. May the Lord have mercy on us. Otherwise, we are all healthy today, those of us who serve the church, except that two pastors from the countryside, learned and good men, have recently succumbed to the plague and gone to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greet your brother, my most esteemed lord, diligently, and also the dearest Zwickers, whom may the Lord console and keep safe along with you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 10, 1541.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, yours entirely.</p>
