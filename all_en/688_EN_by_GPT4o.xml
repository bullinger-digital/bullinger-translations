      <p>Strasbourg, 25th September 1549.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Your most kind letter was given to me in Frankfurt, dearest Bullinger, where I was unable to reply due to business matters. I consider your friendly service in promoting my relative to be a great favor, and I will repay you and yours whenever the opportunity arises. The young man is of a very gentle nature, but somewhat slow, as is often the case with people endowed with this trait. For the sharper one's mind, the more severe their manners tend to be; on the other hand, a gentle person sometimes lacks sharpness of mind. However, this can be aided by diligence, which I have also experienced with this relative of mine. For in the past, when I was with you, the spur I applied benefited him more than the more lenient diligence of a teacher without an added spur.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you wish him to become learned, he must be provided with a sharp teacher who will stimulate and spur him on; this is what I wanted to advise in a timely manner, so that a later admonition does not disappoint your expectations, which you have conceived about the young man.</p>
      <p>News has been written to me from England, certainly that all tumult has been settled; and the leaders of the crime are daily being punished, especially the impure priests who incited the people. The French have obtained two embankments between Boulogne and Calais through treachery. There is a rumor that the Emperor will soon come to Speyer, but I judge it to be false. In your last letters to me, you wrote about a torn cloth that you received; but I do not know what you want with the same cloth: for I, as far as I know, did not send a cloth to you. Farewell with your dear wife. Master Richard greets you, whose wife he wrote was very ill in his penultimate letters; he wishes to be commended to you, master, in prayers.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. Greet Mr. Butler, to whom you may say that I have received the letters he sent to England long ago; I have received none from England to you.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, John Burcher, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my greatest and dear friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
