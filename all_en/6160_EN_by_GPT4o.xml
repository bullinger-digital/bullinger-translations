      <p>Greetings. The sea is so vast, reverend father in Christ, of the things I wish you to know, that I cannot find where to begin; thus, the abundance itself makes me poor. Add to this, that not everything can be safely entrusted to letters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, regarding what you have repeatedly recommended to me about Mr. Vogler, I have poured out many things in secret into his bosom, from which you will know everything in detail. We seem to you to be managing the matter foolishly; it is not so surprising that it seems so to you, who could not sufficiently understand the serious reasons for our counsel; I have also explained these to Mr. Vogler.</p>
      <p>Nothing here has been done rashly, but everything has been done hastily, because the envoy of Philipp suddenly pressed upon us. As for the one to whom you have most recently written, although he is involved in our counsels, yet, because he now sits at the helm, it is to be feared that he may wish to offend the other openly, not because he is not ours, but because money is believed to intervene on both sides.</p>
      <p>What I have done, what I am doing, Vogler will tell you. - Our synod lasted for three whole days.</p>
      <p>No laws, no order, meanwhile so many times preaching in the assembly of so many and such great men. I am utterly broken, and unless better times follow, salvation must be said to be entirely in studies.</p>
      <p>But these things do not move me much.</p>
      <p>That thrice-great scoundrel, about whom I spoke to you in person, who is accustomed to change masters with money day by day and hour by hour, was especially against me (you know what he attempted in the Ilanz assembly). But I hope he will be attacked by my own modesty; now his wickedness has become known to not a few.</p>
      <p>He opposed me vehemently in the synod (but in my opinion, I prevailed among all good men). He concluded his speech thus: one should not reject Philipp nor promise anything to the Frenchman; the scoundrel desires to lead the business so that he may milk both in the meantime. - You wish to know what was done.</p>
      <p>Listen briefly.</p>
      <p>An answer was given to the Frenchman; if he pays off the old claims, they will willingly hear him and let his matter come before the communities; to the Philippian now, if they do not lack him, they will also let his request come before the communities. Thereupon a diet was set for him (this was done by the counsel of our people) in mid-August.</p>
      <p>He thought he could push through the matter right now, but in vain; whereupon he replied that he would let the matters reach his king.</p>
      <p>Thus, one cannot know what is happening. This is the summary.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, what he attempted, how many he won over, what gifts, what extravagance, you will hear from Vogler. This is the summary.</p>
      <p>The envoy had promised to send me his response this evening; but I think he could not, being hindered by so many affairs. I hope to send the complete acts with Vogler.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father, and continue to instruct us about those things which can be conducive to our business.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 5, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
