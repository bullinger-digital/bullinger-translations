      <p>Greetings. Your two letters, most illustrious and highly esteemed man, have indeed brought much consolation, so that now I am completely assured about all of you, my most beloved brothers in Christ. Therefore, I am quite certain that the person, whoever he may have been, who spread the rumor, fabricated it himself. To you, who wished to act so diligently on this matter with your fellow ministers and the people of Locarno, I give my greatest thanks, and even more so because you have also deigned to handle this same matter with the absent brothers through letters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, because of your candor, I feel greatly indebted to you, and since I cannot repay you, I pray to God, our common Father, that He may repay you, which I do not doubt He will do, given His goodness. I was very pleased to see Lysmaninus, the reverend man and sincere brother in Christ, whom you recommended to me in your letters. I spent a week with him in the closest familiarity and took care to ensure that my encouragement was not lacking, nor was I burdened to send a letter to the brothers and those Polish churches, in which I advised them, as much as the Lord allowed, on matters useful for restoration, and I had a rather lengthy and clear discourse with them on the sacramental issue, urging them with all my might not to allow themselves to be deceived.</p>
      <p>May the heavenly Father deign to add His effective spirit to the words, so that the truth of such a pious cause may not be left to lie in darkness. I have seen what our excellent brother in Christ, Calvin, wrote against Westphal, and I was greatly pleased, and he seemed to have conducted himself most appropriately both in the matter and in dealing with the man according to his merits. I do not doubt that you, too, will respond most excellently and firmly both to the matter and to the man. I also trust that our Bernardinus, though aged, will not be lacking in knowledge of the fight. As for me, I am so overwhelmed with the constant study of teaching that I can promise nothing at present, and I have some other matters in hand that I cannot postpone. Farewell, live in Christ, and love me as you do, for I also love you most sincerely in the Lord, and convey my greetings in my name to the beloved fellow ministers, brothers in Christ. Our Zanchus greets you.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, February 17, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours, as much as I am, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, both most learned and... Mr. Heinrich Bullinger,... most faithful minister and my most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
