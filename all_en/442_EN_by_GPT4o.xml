      <p>Greetings. If you receive this man as a friend, know that I am pleased. He is learned, pious, great, and could be greater, if only Christ pleased him too much, although he still keeps this to himself. He lives here today with his wife Dana and children. He has gone there to see Zürich and you. Therefore, you will show yourself friendly to him.</p>
      <p>Whatever news I can tell, he will tell; I know no more. There is silence about the Emperor, although it is written to the Bernese that he will at least oppress part of Switzerland unexpectedly, if he cannot do otherwise, which is why much diligence is needed. But the Bernese will undoubtedly report this at the next assembly to the Swiss.</p>
      <p>The unfortunate people of Strasbourg are anxious, as they have again sent a delegation to Charles; for the bishop does not want even a letter to fall from the Interim and from his jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>In Leipzig, there is Doctor Alexander Alesius, who recently wrote to Mr. Münster with these words: "The maritime and Saxon cities, Magdeburg, Brunswick, Hamburg, Lübeck, Bremen, and others, by the grace of God, are still more steadfast than Constance and united," etc.</p>
      <p>You have undoubtedly heard from Gastius about the tribute to be given to the Emperor and Ferdinand, which amounts to fifty-three tons of gold. Farewell in the Lord. You will greet Mr. Theodor and Gualther.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 22, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius could not write more.</p>
      <p>The brothers in Strasbourg stand firm in the Lord, thanks to the Lord, except for two, whose names you will hear later.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
