      <p> Greetings. Peter Datheen is coming to you, whose piety and learning I believe are known to you. He will discuss difficult matters with you. I strongly ask that you listen to him kindly and handle the matter prudently and maturely. I fear that the adversaries might suspect something has been arranged, so it is necessary to ensure that opportunities for slander are avoided and that the communication of plans does not leak. The Prince sends his regards to you and Wolfgang, and would have sent gifts if Datheen could have conveniently delivered them. However, I will ensure that they are sent at the next autumn Frankfurt market through your/our Froschauer. Sad news is being written to us from Poland that Arianism is spreading far and wide. Many suspect that a great calamity is threatening the kingdom, as the king lacks a legitimate successor and neighboring kings, now equipped with forces, are coveting the kingdom. May the Lord kindly look upon and preserve His church in these troubles. Farewell, my Bullinger, and greet Wolfgang, Simler, Gwalther, Lavater, and our other friends in my name. July 3rd, in the year 66. </p>
      <p> Yours sincerely, Stephan Zirler, secretary. To the Reverend Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, a highly esteemed friend. </p>
