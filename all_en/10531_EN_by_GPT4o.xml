    <p xml:id="regest1">Learned in Winterthur that the pastor of Rüti [Konrad Lüthard] has been dismissed. It will be necessary to send a pious and brave man there who is agreeable to the monks. Lavater suggests Morandus Schmid from Frauenfeld, whom he has come to know as a knowledgeable and faithful person. He has compassion for him having to work among the wicked Thurgauers. Hopes Bullinger will receive the letter favorably and wishes a happy new year. [Postscript:] After finishing the letter, he learns that people from the area of the Five Places, from Rapperswil, etc., together with the people of Grüningen, are planning to expel their pastor from office. He has the matter investigated.</p>

      <p>My friendly willing service and whatever I can do to honor, love, and good beforehand, well-learned and honorable sir, etc.</p>
      <p>As I was in Winterthur today, it came to my attention that the preacher in Rüti has been dismissed, etc. Now, I am truly sorry that the preachers are not more cautious, and, as I fear, this will cause much offense, although I am constantly concerned about secret plots and practices, that perhaps with time, the wicked crowd might undertake something further, etc. Now it will be necessary to send a pious, brave man to that place, who is fundamentally righteous, and if one does not send such a person there, or someone whom the monks oppose, the matter will not be successful; for there will be no peace or fruit. And since I always want to promote God's cause as much as I have grace, I would be inclined and very willing to serve, it seems to me, if one could bring Mr. Morandus Schmid from Frauenfeld there, it would be a great fortune, for he is certainly a truly pious and honest man, well-grounded in God's word and very faithful; for I have examined him thoroughly. Moreover, I know well that he would be very agreeable and pleasant to the monks, and if it would not be wrong and against my lord's regulations, I would make a strong plea to you on his behalf; for I have compassion for him having to be among the wicked Thurgauers. Furthermore, if he were to come there, I hope the pastor in Frauenfeld might also return and take his place.</p>
      <p>Some may perceive my writing as entirely of good will; for if I did not have special high trust in you, I would have left it alone. And hereby I commend you to the one Lord God, who may grant you and all your household a good, prosperous year, with a request that my writing may reach you.</p>
      <p>Given in the same place, on Thomas's day, in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant</p>
      <p>Hans R. Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned and honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich, my especially trusted, gracious, and dear lord.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, as I was writing this letter, it came to my attention at this hour, that there is supposed to be a plot by some from the Five Places, Rapperswil, or other places, with those from Grüningen, to expel the preachers from the office in Grüningen. Now I cannot know whether there is anything to it or not. However, it has been secretly indicated to me. You may, therefore, if it seems good to you, stand up for the matter, and let no one be so dear to you that you let it be known where it comes from, for it would be badly rewarded by me if I did not show it to a mayor, for it comes to me from someone who told me himself. It was conveyed to him by a citizen from Rapperswil. I have ordered the matter to be further thoroughly investigated. Some in Zurich are also supposed to be involved in the plot. If you find anything further necessary, let me know through this messenger.</p>
      <p>Given on Thomas's day, the 5th hour of the night.</p>
