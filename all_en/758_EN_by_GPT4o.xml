      <p> Greetings. The outstanding virtue of yours, most illustrious man, which that distinguished man and my singular friend Mr. Gervasius praises in you, has made me love your dignity from the heart and consider how I might declare my goodwill towards you. Now, an opportunity presents itself for me to do well by you; for I understand that plans are being discussed back and forth by the leaders of our republic about calling a certain doctor of medicine, who excels in practice; nor do I doubt that he, to whom this task is assigned, will be provided with a liberal stipend, not to mention that he will bind a good part of Switzerland to himself, provided he is successful in medicine. There is no distinguished physician either in Lucerne or Zug, let alone in the neighboring Cantons of Schwyz, Uri, and Glarus; there is no celebrated doctor either in the whole of Thurgau or in the entire Aargau. However, whenever an excellent physician has practiced in Zurich, everyone has flocked to Zurich. But the most illustrious Mr. Conrad Gessner professes more and is more vigilant in publishing his writings than in listening to the complaints of the sick, Mr. Christoph Clauser is consumed by illness day by day, nor is there anyone who further seeks his advice, and even if there is a successful and skilled physician in our city, one alone in such a large crowd of people will achieve nothing. Now indeed, since not only my Gervasius but other good and prudent men celebrate your learning and practice with praises, and since you are stuck there in your homeland in uncertainty and are waiting for the day when you are compelled to sacrifice to the god Maazin, nor can you, with your singular prudence, expect anything other than a horrible change of religion in those cities of yours; for Caesar is known to you all, the proud manners of the priests and monks are known, finally, since such a great opportunity, as if divinely presented to you, does not seem to be despised without grave regret, I would like to earnestly request your kindness in every way, that through this messenger you clearly express your opinion, if indeed I should commend your excellence to our most illustrious senate and could, together with your other friends, ensure that you are called by the most honorable magistrate of this republic with a liberal stipend established, to be the physician of this city. What you will do and whether you will accept that condition, please consider, I ask, what great advantages you will miss if you disregard this my admonition. Indeed, I sincerely wish for your dignity and through you for our republic to be consulted in every way, and now I expect a response to this from you through this messenger, and it is worthy of you? I very amicably request and expect what is useful for you and us. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most illustrious man, and kindly accept all these things from me as your most devoted. </p>
      <p> Zurich, December 11, in the year of our Lord 1549. </p>
      <p> Heinrich Bullinger, Minister of the Church of Zurich, yours. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious Mr. Ulrich Wolfhard, physician and citizen of Memmingen, his most esteemed lord. </p>
      <p> Memmingen. </p>
      <p> "But if by no means can you be moved from the place where you now are, please indicate to us the most excellent physicians in practice, whom we may recommend to the most illustrious senate along with others; you will find us not ungrateful." </p>
