    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian did not receive Bullinger's letter and was particularly pleased with its last section. There, Bullinger wrote that the Helvetians do not in any way question the vague treaties [that have existed since ancient times] [which bind them to each other], etc., and that the remaining hope of still being able to protect their homeland [from an imperial attack] can be strengthened and stimulated by nothing better than by trust in their unity. For without this unifying confidence, their reputation for having withstood enemy attacks unharmed for three centuries with almost incredible luck is of no use to them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Vadian also learned of the other news shared by Bullinger from a council envoy [...]. The people of St. Gallen receive much information from abroad by letter. Vadian now wants to report some of it, even if Bullinger will have already learned some things from the letters of his friends.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The people of Constance are said to have reconciled with Emperor Charles V and decided to submit to him, even though they did not receive the requested safe-conducts from him. Their restraint towards the Confederates is probably due to their belief that the Confederates would be attacked, and thus it would not be beneficial for them to join them. It is indeed annoying that they think so little of the Confederates, as if they already knew that they would not withstand an attack by the Emperor!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In Ulm, experienced soldiers are said to have stated that the subjugation of the Swiss will cause the Emperor much more trouble than that of the imperial estates, but that he will not refrain from it and will prepare his attack better than the previous ones.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The people of Lindau are said to have received an unknown [imperial] order through an important embassy. King Ferdinand is said to have urged the people of Bregenz and Feldkirch to arm themselves and stock up on supplies. Some companies are also said to have been led there, several high-ranking individuals appointed as their captains, and various tasks assigned to the latter. Where and for what purpose is unknown.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Emperor is said to be suffering severely from gout and has not shown himself for several days. The estates are said to have committed themselves to him through a two-year alliance, which is very regrettable! But it was to be expected that he would enforce his will despite the resistance shown to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The Bishop of Trent, Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo, has arrived in Rome and was poorly received by Pope Paul III. [Between the Emperor and the Pope] there is agreement only that the council must serve to eradicate the truth. However, due to the [Emperor-instigated] murder of the pedophile Duke of Piacenza, Pier Luigi Farnese, the Pope is very angry with the Emperor, so that a fatal confrontation between the two is likely to occur. However, it is believed that during the Emperor's lifetime, the Pope will not regain Piacenza, and indeed, he is more likely to be in danger of losing all his territories in Italy if he does not join the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Magdeburg is said to have attacked Elector Maurice of Saxony. This is said to have prompted him to leave Augsburg on November 29 at six in the morning. Others claim, however, that the Emperor commissioned him to recruit several thousand horsemen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The Imperial Chamber Court is said to have resumed its business. It will certainly have to align itself with the will of the Emperor, especially in religious matters, which will be decided as binding at the council. Anyone who continues to oppose the monks, nuns, and priests will be outlawed. Everything aims to satisfy the godless horde of the Antichrist with the restitution of its goods. It is feared that the protest of the imperial cities will not deter the Emperor from his intentions. Although he claims he does not want to force anyone to abandon their religion, the judgments of the Imperial Chamber Court will be relentless. May God intervene!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] [The Regent of the Netherlands], Queen Maria of Hungary, has gone to her brothers [Emperor Charles V and King Ferdinand] in Augsburg. She came together with two widows, namely the Duchess of Lorraine, [Christina of Denmark], and the Princess [Anna] of Orange. King Ferdinand often organizes banquets for them. Cardinal Otto Truchsess of Waldburg, Bishop of Augsburg, rode out to meet Maria and organized a lavish feast for her in one of his residences (in "Rüßmershausen"), attended by many spiritual and secular personalities from the nobility. In short: Everyone wants to appear more exalted than they are!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Many hope that Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony will be released from captivity during the current Reichstag, but no one expects this to also apply to Landgrave Philip of Hesse. It is believed that the latter is not doing so badly, but that strange machinations are underway, playing out behind dazzling deceptions. Few people have a good opinion of Duke Maurice of Saxony. This also applies to some castrated roosters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] It is said to be certain that the Scots were about to surrender themselves along with their kingdom and the young, orphaned Queen [Mary Stuart] to King Edward VI of England, to make only one kingdom out of the two, which was to be called neither England nor Scotland, but Britain. However, they did not want to give up their land and their young queen until she and the King of England came of age, which the English do not want to accept, as they want to settle everything now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] [P.S.:] Vadian particularly asks Bullinger to forward the enclosed letter to Francisco de Enzinas in Basel. He was in Constance with the Blarers a few days ago. Why he did not return to St. Gallen as planned to travel from there through Zurich to Basel, Vadian does not know. Presumably, something unexpected happened. Hieronymus Sailer provided him with a rider [...] as a travel companion. But before that, Enzinas had written very kindly from Memmingen to Vadian and sent him a greeting to Bullinger. He is truly a charming person!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Bullinger is greeted again!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Vadian has not yet received a letter from the Zurich Consistory, otherwise, he would have forwarded it. He will keep Bullinger informed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] If Bullinger intends to go to the council, he should inform Vadian. Would he take him along as a companion? Certainly, there is no reason to hurry yet, for if the Pope had been serious with his invitation to the Confederates to attend the council, he would have already sent them safe-conducts. But by then, the Protestant places will teach him better and explain to him in detail under what circumstances (of which he has neither heard nor wants to hear) it would really be necessary to organize Christian and valid councils. May God enable us to love the truth!</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most learned man, in which the last clause delighted me immensely. You indicated that our Helvetians are in excellent agreement in these very slippery matters, etc., for there is nothing that can strengthen our remaining hope more firmly in preserving and thus defending our altars and hearths, and can bring more comfort than the trust in unity, which, unless it binds us with the tightest bond, our forces, however renowned, will be of no use, even though they have defended themselves for three centuries with almost incredible fortune against all assaults of tyrants.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the rest of what you wrote, our council's envoy also informed me. Various things are written to our people from abroad, which, although I do not doubt are also written to you by friends, I will not hesitate to report to you from various compiled examples of letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Constance is said to have reconciled and submitted to the Emperor, even though they wanted to refuse the safe-conduct that was requested from them. Their lukewarm attitude towards us is thought to be due to some foreknowledge that a Confederation will certainly not come without military intervention. If they were to join the Confederates and enter into any understanding, they would not only not be helped, but they would also have to expect greater danger, and it would be better to suffer a single death than to go to ruin with double torment. Therefore, it is very repugnant to me that they make so little hope for themselves in the Confederation, as if they partly do not doubt that the Confederates' matters will not hold any ground.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In Ulm, the prominent soldiers are publicly saying that the Emperor will have to regain the obedience of the Swiss with more sweat and labor than he has endured with some of the imperial estates so far. However, they will set about it and handle it with more seriousness than has been done so far, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The people of Lindau also received a serious message from Augsburg last week with some attached command. However, what it contains is not yet known. Bregenz and Feldkirch have been ordered by the King to arm themselves and secure provisions. Some companies are also said to have been led there, and some powerful individuals have been appointed as captains and assigned to their places. Where or for what reason, it is not known.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Emperor is severely afflicted with gout. He has not been seen for several days. The bond between the estates and the Emperor is said to have been granted for two years. It has been regrettably agreed upon. However, it was necessary to be concerned that if they had not allowed themselves to be found willing, it would have resulted in "thus I will, thus I command." It has now come to this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Cardinal of Trent has arrived in Rome and was received with poor favor by the Pope, as credible reports suggest, only that they were of one mind regarding the council, to establish the truth in the ground. However, the death of Duke Pier Luigi Farnese in Piacenza has thrown a dog into the Pope's heart. He only wants to bark at the Emperor. And it is said (if God grants grace) that a deadly and destructive war will arise between the Emperor and the Pope. It is said that the Pope should not think that he will regain Piacenza during the Emperor's lifetime. And if the Pope does not join or make himself a party to some of the Emperor's plans, he will be at the door of losing all his territories in Italy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Magdeburg is said to have inflicted some damage on the new Elector Maurice, which is why this Elector rode away from Augsburg on November 29 at six in the morning. Some say the Emperor sent him away to raise several thousand horses for a commission. Whatever the truth is, time will reveal it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Imperial Chamber Court is said to be reestablished. It is thought that it will take orders from the Emperor to judge according to the decrees, especially in religious matters, which will be adopted as binding at the council. Anyone who wants to oppose the monks, nuns, and priests will have the ban and double ban upon them. All practices are being played out so that the godless rabble of the Antichrist may be maintained in its restitution. It is feared that the Emperor will not let the protest of the imperial cities deter him. He says he does not want to drive anyone away from his religion with the sword, but the processes of the Imperial Chamber Court will be very sharp and cutting. May God look into this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Queen Maria has come to her brothers in Augsburg with her two widows, namely a Duchess of Lorraine and the Princess of Orange. King Ferdinand holds many banquets for them. The Cardinal of Augsburg rode out to meet her and honored her with a splendid meal in one of his houses (called Rüßmershausen) in the presence of many noble spiritual and secular persons. In short: No one walks on their feet anymore, but only on their toes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>It is hoped that the old Elector of Saxony will be released during this Reichstag, but no one dares to hope that the same will happen for the Landgrave of Hesse, although it is believed that he is not in much pain, and strange machinations are at play in these matters, covered with wonderful mirror colors. Few people speak well of Duke Maurice, as with some capons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>The Scots are said to have certainly agreed to hand over their kingdom, along with the young abandoned queen, to King Edward, and to make one kingdom out of both, which will be called neither England nor Scotland, but Britain. However, they intend not to let go of the young princess and the land until they both come of age, which the English do not want to accept, but intend to complete everything without delay.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, December 7, 1547.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>I especially ask you to forward these enclosed letters to Francisco de Enzinas in Basel, who was in Constance with the Blarers a few days ago. Why he did not return to us or come to you, I do not know. I suspect, however, that some suddenly arisen business compelled him to go elsewhere, not without reason. Lord Hieronymus Sailer added a knightly companion to him, so he would not go alone. He wrote to me very kindly from Memmingen and ordered me to greet you in his name. He is a person worthy of being loved by all the pious.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>No letter has come to me from the Zurich Consistory, otherwise, I would have certainly forwarded it. I would not withhold your honor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Let me know if you are prepared to ride to the council and if you would accept me as a companion. I think we will come early enough. The matters might lead to a delay, for he is certainly not serious in his invitation. Otherwise, he would have sent the safe-conducts. Before we come, we will blow the dust from his ears so that he may properly perceive what reasons there are for holding Christian and properly ordered councils, which he has never touched upon and does not intend to touch. May God confirm us in the love of truth. Amen.</p>
