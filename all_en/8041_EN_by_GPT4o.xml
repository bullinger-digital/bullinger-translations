      <p>Greetings. Our Lucius diligently delivered your letters, dear brother, along with letters addressed to the most honorable magistrate of our city, Bern and Spenlium citizen. I thank you for your diligence in obtaining letters to the Bernese; I will ensure that they are procured as soon as possible. I also ask that, when you know something certain about the cause of the brothers from Pyro, you inform me. I have heard nothing so far about the inquisitor being killed with his men by the Lucerne people; I wish it were true. Some report the Moors in Spain as victors, others as defeated. If you have any information, let me know and give my warmest regards to Mr. Ruinella. The day before, Mr. Bellivreus wrote here that the admiral, wounded, had fallen into the power and captivity of Guise, his entire army was defeated, and all the baggage and cannons were captured. This news was brought to the king on the morning of October 4th. However, he adds that he does not have this from royal letters, but from Mr. Mandelot, the governor of Lyon, who himself did not receive it from the king, but from trustworthy men. Few believe it; we all await more certain news, especially since so many falsehoods have been presented in the king's name. Some think these are almost preparations for the upcoming Baden assembly, which will be held on the 23rd of this month. If in these the king responds that he no longer needs Swiss soldiers, it will seem likely that he is the victor and that no danger threatens him from the Huguenots.</p>
      <p>Truth is the daughter of time.</p>
      <p>Farewell and diligently greet the consuls, Mr. Karl, Mr. Bonett, my dearest brother, Mr. Ganthner, Mr. Pontisella, and your entire family.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 14, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Chur church, my lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
