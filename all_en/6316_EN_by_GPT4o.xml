      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, yesterday I wrote to you about the affairs of the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>This evening I was invited to dinner by the lord's legate.</p>
      <p>Letters arrived, brought by the courier of the city of Zurich.</p>
      <p>What was in them, I do not know, except that the lord seemed somewhat sad after reading them. What he mentioned at the table were these:</p>
      <p>The lord of Angusola is lingering in Urania and spreading his poison there. It is certain that the efforts of the Spaniards are not insignificant.</p>
      <p>Those who were sent to us have not yet proposed anything; what they seek is not unclear.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow or the day after, there will be a smaller assembly (bytag) here in the name of the French. For he had summoned our people before he was aware of the arrival of the Spaniards. - I am sending my writing on the plague, which you will read either alone or with a few others, so that he has nothing to complain about. You will return it sometime, but only through trusted people; I do not want it to spread, as he takes it so badly.</p>
      <p>You will say it is quite sharp; but you must consider that the pain I conceived from your illness forced this out.</p>
      <p>I can present much more absurd things, and those good men defend all of this. They say they do not approve of the cruelty; but they approve of the cause.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I can affirm that I was greatly offended by the speech of the one who debated with me; everything was so pagan, not a word about divine providence. But, as I wrote yesterday, let everything be silenced and buried by me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I want you to read this with a few others, for whom it was written. I am also sending the royal edict, which I wish to be returned to Mr. Gesner.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I wrote to the same, now at least I return this writing with thanks. I am not sure about the departure of the courier; therefore, I wrote this at night.</p>
      <p>It may happen that he stays here tomorrow and in the meantime, if there is anything new worthy of your knowledge, I will learn more. Farewell, reverend Father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, 28th of November, in the year 1564.</p>
      <p>Yours respectfully, Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>If it seems appropriate to you, also let my father-in-law read it, but in such a way that only one reads it.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and much-revered father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
