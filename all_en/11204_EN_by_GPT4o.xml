    <p xml:id="regest1">[Hans Varnier] delivers with the letter a copy of the dialogue printed in Ulm, which [Johannes] Sinapius sent to Frecht. Shares the concerns expressed by Bullinger; at the Diet in Eisenach, the Schmalkaldic League is said to have discussed a peace treaty with the Emperor - mediated by Elector Palatine [Ludwig V.] and Margrave [Joachim II.]. It is said that the Turks will conquer Hungary. King [Francis I.] of France is reportedly hunting in Brussels. The Ulm council has ordered the school officials to submit their complaints against [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld, who wants to defend the doctrine of the uncreated nature of the glorified Christ, and [Sebastian] Franck in writing; received from Bucer a pernicious booklet by Schwenckfeld on the sacraments, and in Frankfurt, Franck's "Germaniae Chronicon" is said to have already been printed. Would like to know if Jud is ready for a call to Ulm. Greetings; could not yet respond to [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Beyond expectation, as our printer is departing so suddenly from here to you, I wanted to entrust this brief letter to him to deliver to you. He will also return the dialogue recently sent to me by Sinapius, although it was printed here rather carelessly, a bronze for a gold; for I will never forget that truly golden gift of yours recently sent to me, for which I now again express my utmost thanks, to be returned when the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>Moreover, regarding what you write about the adversaries nurturing a monster, you are not entirely mistaken; for what else would these monster-bearers do? However, I would have thought that whatever this monster is, the recent Diet in Eisenach would have exposed it; but I have not yet been able to learn anything certain. Justus Menius, who is bishop in Eisenach, wrote to me with our envoys that everything was conducted among the nobles with such silence that no one was allowed to hear even a whisper. This alone is whispered by many that it was accomplished there, that the Emperor confirms a certain and firm peace to the evangelical orders.</p>
      <p>The mediators and poets of this peace are said to be those two electors, the Elector Palatine and the Margrave.</p>
      <p>Now a constant rumor spreads that the Turk is in arms and will harass both Pannonias; others interpret this differently.</p>
      <p>Now I hear that it has been written from Lower Germany to Augsburg that the King of France is hunting carefree in Brussels. Let us pray to the Lord that in these rumors of wars, He preserves peace for His church.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote to you about Schwenckfeld, the guest of Ulm, and Franck, the citizen. The council has ordered the school officials to submit in writing whatever we desire against these sectarians; we are now striving to accomplish this. You could also do something for this matter. Schwenckfeld is thinking of defending this insolent doctrine vigorously: Christ in glory as a man is not a creature. Our Bucer sent from Strasbourg a rather pestilent booklet composed by Schwenckfeld on the sacraments. In Frankfurt, I hear that Franck's "Chronicle of the Germans," especially of the Swabians and the people of Ulm, has already been printed; that miserable rhapsodist sells himself like Aesop's jackdaw with borrowed plumes.</p>
      <p>I beg you to write back, especially about Leo, whether it can be obtained from him to be called here once; our people have wonderful plans in changing the ministers of the church, calling and sending them away.</p>
      <p>I wish all fellow ministers well, especially the venerable Pellikan, to whose pious and learned letters I could not respond now; for this, I wish to be excused to him. Farewell well, esteemed Bullinger, and love me, your most affectionate, as you are accustomed.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Ulm, August 27, 1538.</p>
      <p>Martin Frecht.</p>
      <p>To the exceptionally pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, esteemed lord and brother.</p>
