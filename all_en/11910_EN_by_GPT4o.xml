    <p xml:id="regest1">The bundle sent by Bullinger for Celio [Secondo Curione] has been given to a man from Lausanne. The Viscount [François von Luxemburg], who holds the second highest position in the Duchy of Savoy and is related to Duke [Charles III], has demanded in Bern the return of Vevey and Ternier while recognizing Bernese sovereignty; he has been asked to wait, as they are still at war with the Duke, but there is agreement that they want to exclude such powerful vassals of foreign princes who are opposed to our religion and freedom. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The bundle, which you sent wrapped in cords, I entrusted to a man from Lausanne to deliver to Celio; I trust he will carry this out faithfully, etc.</p>
      <p>The Viscount, whom we commonly call the viscount, who is second to the Duke of Savoy and related to him by blood, appeared and demanded the restoration of his rights and revenues in Vevey and Ternier, claiming that he bore no blame for the recent war and had never acted hostilely against the Bernese; he thus desires to be in our good graces and promises to provide everything to the Bernese in the name of those places, which he previously owed to the Duke as his superior. And although this request did not seem entirely unjust, as it did not detract from the Bernese's dominion over people or military expeditions, nor from the religion established there, since it only concerned revenues and lower dominions, the matter was nevertheless suspended, and he was given this response: we are still in open war with the Duke of Savoy and not reconciled with him; therefore, we will return nothing to anyone, and if we are reconciled with the Duke, we will then do what seems appropriate. Thus he departed.</p>
      <p>It is agreed among us that those who are so powerful in the courts of princes should be excluded, as harmful contagion spreads from there to the subjects, who neither favor our religion nor our freedom.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the learned men, whom I wish to be greeted in my name, and you again with your wife, children, and entire family, fare very well and hold me in your esteem.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, March 11, in the year 44.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed, distinguished, and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor in Zurich, my ever-respected patron.</p>
