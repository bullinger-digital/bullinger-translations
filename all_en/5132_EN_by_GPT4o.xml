      <p>Greetings. The day before yesterday I received your letters, honorable lord and godfather, for which I thank you greatly; for I have been very concerned about that man, whom some of our people are trying to impose on us, and they would indeed do so, if they had not yet obtained our consent. I have not yet been able to meet with Diesbach because of both my business and his; therefore, I do not know whether he will reply himself. However, I have sent this messenger to him.</p>
      <p>I hope that as the synod progresses, we will have you here, although I see many doubting whether it will be beneficial for this synod to be held.</p>
      <p>For as it usually happens, as ecclesiastical histories also testify, hardly ever have such synods been held that have not been occasions for greater disturbances. I wish the same does not happen to us! For I see that not everything is done with a sincere heart by everyone. Where our people are stuck, you have understood from their letters to you; I truly wish to hear your judgment on our deliberation, which I recently sent to you. Does it not seem that enough has been granted to them? But I know well that these will not suffice unless they are also confirmed by your authority, and I wish they would be satisfied even so! On the fourth of February, a synod will also be held in Neuch√¢tel, in which, as I hear, Mr. Calvin will participate.</p>
      <p>The French make much of the fact that their princes also subject themselves to discipline, and they boast greatly about it and condemn our people, from whom such a necessary work and true mark of the church is so difficult to obtain. As for the new developments, various things are being reported.</p>
      <p>It is written to our people that 20,000 Spaniards have landed in Genoa; but this is not considered certain.</p>
      <p>Also, that the Spanish army will invade the territory of Navarre. It is also reported that Guise is gathering troops in Nancy in Lorraine and the Duke of Nemours in Piedmont. It is also written from Lower Germany that Duke Alba (who was supposed to hinder the business of the lord in France) is being sent by Philip to Flanders and Brabant to establish the Spanish Inquisition there; however, he has sent ahead Count von Horn to test their spirits, who proposed this to the States; he received the response that in these parts of Lower Germany there are about 100,000 men enlisted, who would all rather perish in battle and be defeated than admit that cruelty; thus he is uncertain in mind about what to do. May the Lord strengthen his own! Our people have written to your senate about holding a meeting of the Four Cities, so that in such great necessities it may be decided together what should be done; our people are very upset that this was denied by yours. I am reluctantly forced to hear many things; our people seem to wish for a different consultation with the people of Glarus and others, and that one should once raise the mouth against those people; but it will not go. Truly, good people are behaving badly.</p>
      <p>Where it falls, I do not know; it seems to me that necessity requires it. We see the adversaries convene whenever they want.</p>
      <p>If they do not hinder us.</p>
      <p>We do not have so much courage as to dare to convene and deliberate on our matters. What more could we dare? These things trouble me not a little.</p>
      <p>Please write if you have any news about the war of the Nurembergers against the Bishop of Bamberg; for we have heard something about it; but nothing certain is known. Otherwise, I have nothing to write now.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you and yours safe forever. All friends and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to our Gwalther, to your wife, finally, to your sons and sons-in-law. Bern, January 15, 1562.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and sweetest godfather.</p>
