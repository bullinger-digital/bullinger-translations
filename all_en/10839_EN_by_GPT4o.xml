    <p xml:id="regest1">Is glad to have urged Bullinger to write his new epistle commentary, in which the abominations of the Roman idol are excellently described and which will certainly have a great impact far and wide, because Luther wrote too harshly and Zwingli apparently not explicitly against the Pope; Bullinger has convincingly demonstrated that Paul's warning about the Antichrist refers to the Pope. Since Pope Paul III has allegedly sided with the King of France, many Protestants could now assume that the Emperor would be more favorable to the evangelical doctrine in the future.</p>

      <p>Greetings. How well I have done, most learned Bullinger, if I have achieved with my letters to you that you have devoted more effort to expounding the epistles of the Apostle to the Thessalonians, Timothy, and Philemon, as I have more ardently encouraged you, so that you would not handle that Roman idol lightly, but depict it to the world in its true colors. For you have depicted that entire abomination with such faith, grace, freedom, judgment, and confidence that I do not doubt that the downfall, which the Spirit of the Lord has been working on for twenty years now, will soon and certainly be at the door throughout all of Germany, with you as the first to apply the finishing touch, which will not only shake but also swallow up that entire pretense of piety. Indeed, the Pope has been attacked by Luther, but more bitterly than many learned men thought should be followed by his judgment, and I do not know whether our Zwingli ever wrote against him deliberately; for it was enough for him to overthrow the doctrines that made him such and to disarm the man raised by evil arts, if perhaps he could be driven to repentance when naked and stripped. But your diligence (far be it from flattery) has made it so that all the best and most pious will easily and without controversy feel that the Apostle warned posterity more certainly about no Antichrist or son of perdition than about the Roman Pope; for whatever Paul predicted about the man of sin fits this one to the letter. Therefore, I sincerely congratulate the students on your work, and I am no less glad that by my advice, I have spurred you on, already girded and prepared to write, and that this mill of labor has broken you less, even for my sake.</p>
      <p>I hear that Paul III has become an enemy of Emperor Charles and has given himself entirely to the French. If these things are true, how easy it would be for Charles to turn with full force to those who no longer wish to bear the Pope, and I already sense that this opportunity is being observed by some Christian magistrates, so that, since there is hope of greater discord, the Emperor will be more inclined to the Gospel, the more he feels deceived and scorned by him, whose dignity he has previously defended so religiously. But the plans of princes are uncertain, for which I pray nothing more than that by the grace of the Lord, even with you as a teacher, they will finally come to know the arts of the Antichrist clearly, and that what has not been discovered from the Scriptures so far, they may at least learn with recent history leading the way.</p>
      <p>Farewell and allow me to be yours.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 18th day of April, in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the holy church of Zurich, my esteemed lord.</p>
