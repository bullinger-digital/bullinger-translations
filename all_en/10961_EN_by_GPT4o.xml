    <p xml:id="regest1">The response drafted at the Basel meeting [from November 12-14] to Luther is found to be consistent with the [Bern] Disputation and the agreements reached so far, but it should not be addressed directly to Luther; instead, it should be conveyed to him through Capito and Bucer. If Luther does not approve of the [First Helvetic] Confession, they intend to publish their own doctrine of the sacraments in Latin and German.</p>

      <p>Our friendly greetings and whatever we can do for your honor and benefit beforehand.</p>
      <p>Reverend, well-learned, esteemed, wise, especially dear and valued friend, we have reviewed the response that was drafted by the appointed representatives in the city of Basel at the recent meeting concerning the sacraments, intended to be sent to Luther in the name of the assembled churches of our confederation. We have examined it with our preachers and found it to be entirely consistent with our commendable disputation and the prior agreements reached among us on this matter, and we have accepted it, with the condition that this response from us, the cities, should not be sent directly to Luther (who has not yet dealt with us, nor we with him), but rather be sent and delivered to Doctor Capito and Bucer, who should then hand it over to Luther (if it pleases them) and await his final decision on it. Meanwhile, all matters should remain at rest until the aforementioned response and decision are obtained from Doctor Luther through Capito and Bucer, which we will then learn. And if he cannot reconcile himself with our confession, which is divine, well-founded, firm, and clear, we would be compelled to make our understanding, teaching, and practice concerning the sacraments known to the princes and lords of the world in Latin and German, and thereby defend the truth and our innocence against all fabricated accusations, suspicions, and doubts before all people. We did not want to leave you uninformed about this, praying to the Almighty to graciously grant us all true understanding of His will and adherence to it.</p>
      <p>Dated the penultimate day of November in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>The mayor, council, and citizens of Bern.</p>
      <p>To the reverend, well-learned, esteemed, wise, our beloved and good friends, the common leaders of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
