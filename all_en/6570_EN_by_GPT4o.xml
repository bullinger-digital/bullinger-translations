      <p>While sitting at the table, this bundle was delivered to me.</p>
      <p>However, since I have to leave immediately after lunch and a messenger from Constance happened to be present, I handed it over to him.</p>
      <p>I cannot add more due to the lack of time. A diet has been proclaimed here; I think it will not take place.</p>
      <p>Farewell, etc.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, November 4, 1565.</p>
      <p>Georg von Stetten, your most observant. To the venerable and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Belonging to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
