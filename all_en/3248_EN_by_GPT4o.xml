      <p>Greetings. At the same hour I received your most delightful letter, I also heard that the envoys of the cities had returned from France, and I was glad that the opportunity to write back to you through your envoys was presented to me. First of all, I thank you for not forgetting me amidst the many serious matters that occupy you. For I would not have dared to impose my letters on you again without being prompted. Now, therefore, do not believe that I am giving you or your relative empty words; but be assured that I am leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the pious man is well provided for. He has already twice confided all his fortune to me, and I am pleased with the man's spirit, integrity of life, and the skill in his duties, so that from that time I have judged that I am not so much doing a favor to you and to him by recommending him to the leading men, as I am doing a service to him who will make use of his ministry. Therefore, in these days, I have again recommended him to Habsperg, who is returning from Frankfurt, speaking better and more liberally of him than before, and he has promised to commend him to his prince in such a way that he does not doubt that what we ask will soon come to pass; the prince is already tolerating some intolerable ones until better and more upright officials are available. The prince is expected to arrive at any moment to ascend to our vicinity of Hochberg and Rötelen, and the opportunity to discuss these matters presents itself. Once this is done, do not doubt that I will urge Habsperg in writing, so that the matter is not neglected. The number of Englishmen among us has increased, despite the decree of the senate, about which I wrote earlier, as the Lord has so disposed. Would that we not only endure them but also benefit them more generously. You recently advised me to urge the care of Christian foreigners from the pulpit; for that, I thank you.</p>
      <p>But I know that you have spurred on one who is already running. For I was cutting through this ice to the point of weariness, and then a booklet by the pastor of Geppingen on the way to open the path of concord in the controversy of the Lord's Supper was published, about which I wish to know what you think; for I hear different judgments about it even among our own people. Dr. Borrhaus, my godfather, is also writing something on the same matter, which I have not yet been able to read. Let us pray to the Lord to free us from these scandals, which have so far greatly hindered the course of the gospel. But more on these matters another time. For the new writings, I thank you; I have nothing to write in return. Farewell. July 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, his venerable and most dear brother.</p>
