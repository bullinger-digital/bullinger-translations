    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius could not learn anything about the alleged conflict between Pope [Paul III] and the French [King Francis I], as [Antoine] Morelet [du Museau] has departed and Bernhard Meyer [zum Pfeil] is currently in Strasbourg. However, he will continue to pursue the matter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is annoying that everyone laments the lack of funds of the [Schmalkaldic League] and explains their inactivity with it. Why do the princes and cities not levy taxes? Some would gladly stake their wealth on it if it would end the war or at least achieve some peace. Never was the opportunity better than now, when Emperor [Charles V] sets up his winter camp within reach of the [Schmalkaldic League]. If only it weren't so cold! It is painful that some [Protestant] princes are loyal to the emperor. Could this perhaps explain why so many opportunities were missed? The sincerity of [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse, however, is hardly to be doubted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] A student [...] from Wittenberg told much about the incursion of the Bohemians [into Electoral Saxony]. However, he believed that there was no reason to fear for this land, as the Danish King [Christian III] supports several Saxon cities. The situation will therefore be better than claimed, even though it was said in Basel that 25,000 Saxons had fallen. Apparently, such rumors are spread by the enemies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [Francisco de] Enzinas apologizes for his silence. The printing work takes up all his time. However, he intends to write to Bullinger with the next messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger has reported in summary [in No. 2653] about the resolutions of the Zurich Council and the guilds. However, Myconius has received nothing about the community assemblies in the Zurich countryside! Therefore, the city leaders have inquired in vain with him about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings, also to Rudolf Gwalther.</p>

      <p>S. Regarding the causes of the disagreement, which is said to exist between the Pope and the French King, nothing can be known at this time because Mr. Maurus, the legate, has departed and Bernhard Meyer is in Strasbourg. However, I will not cease to inquire if I can find anything.</p>

      <p>It troubles me that everyone complains about the lack of money, which our people suffer from. It seems to be the reason why nothing is being done. I say nothing about the great works of the lords. Why do the princes and cities not impose a tax? Indeed, I hear that some would gladly spend what they have if it would bring an end or at least a semblance of peace. How could we reach the end better than now, if the Emperor sets up his winter camp before our eyes, provided the cold were not so severe? I do not like to say that some princes, who stand with us, are loyal to the Emperor. Yet I wonder why nothing is done, even though the opportunity to act successfully has been offered so many times. Come, the Lord knows, and Hesse, whose integrity I cannot doubt.</p>

      <p>A certain student came here from Wittenberg these days, who, after saying much about the Bohemians' efforts, finally added that he does not greatly fear for Saxony, for the Dane has fortified several cities of that province with strong garrisons. I began to hope somewhat that things are better than rumor would have it. For it was spread here that up to 25,000 Saxons had fallen; however, it was spread by our enemies and God's.</p>

      <p>Dryander asks that you do not take it badly that he writes nothing. He is so immersed in the literary mill that he cannot emerge. However, he promises to write as soon as possible. Consider him excused.</p>

      <p>You have reported in summary what was done in the senate and by the guilds with you. But I have received nothing about what happened in the countryside. The senate, indeed the leaders, asked me about the former. They inquired about the latter, but I could provide nothing.</p>

      <p>Farewell in Christ with your people and Gwalther. Basel, November 24, 1546. Yours, O. Myc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most learned lord, venerable in Christ. Zurich.</p>
