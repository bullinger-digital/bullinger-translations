    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer received the letter from the former mayor of Augsburg, Jakob Herbrot [No. 2392], the day before and is forwarding it herewith. He cannot write more, so as not to miss [the people from Zurich], whose presence he has just been informed about. He will address Bullinger's letters [No. 2387 and No. 2396] another time.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received yesterday these letters from Herbrot, the former mayor of Augsburg, which I am sending to you without adding anything further, as I fear that your people, whose presence I have now been informed of, might slip away from me. I will respond to your other letters another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell. April 2, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
