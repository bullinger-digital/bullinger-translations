    <p xml:id="regest1">It is reported from Milan that the French reinforcements had to surrender to the Marquis [Alfonso d'Avalos, Marchese del Vasto (Guasto)] at [Serravalle Scrivia] with few losses and many captures, including some from the families [Orsini, Trivulzio, Gonzaga, and Bentivoglio]; the fate of Piero Strozzi is uncertain. It is thought that [Francis I] will now request the help of the Swiss. There is a question of whether Bullinger has received his letter and surprise at Bullinger's and Zurich's silence. Sends the Brunswick matter [“The Electors, Princes, Counts... truthful and consistent report...”] with a request for return as well as a letter from the Augsburg envoy Jakob Herbrot from the Imperial Diet [at Speyer]. Request for divine assistance and greetings. [Martin] Frecht has forwarded Bullinger's writing [“Response to Johannes Cochlaeus' pamphlet on the authority of canonical scripture and the Catholic Church...”] and also sent a Schwenckfeldian letter, which Bullinger should forward to Vadian.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, our merchants received news from Milan about how the Italians are miserably marching through Milan with staves, how the Landsknechts came from Piedmont, and how the Marquis has violently hindered the group that wanted to join the French in Piedmont, so that they all had to surrender; not more than 2000 were killed, very few escaped, but all were captured, the most beloved and excellent people that the French had and who were most opposed to the Emperor. It is said that this happened at Serravalle Scrivia. Two Orsini, also Trivulzio, one of the Gonzaga, as well as some Bentivoglio and other excellent people, were all either captured or killed; there is still doubt about Strozzi, whether he was killed or escaped. It is written that the Marquis has conquered over 50 banners.</p>
      <p>I did not want to delay informing you; for it is thought that the French will need the help of the Swiss after this heavy misfortune. Thus, the outcome of war is uncertain. May the Lord Christ rebuke this most savage storm with His mighty word!</p>
      <p>I wrote to you through our people on May 30th and am very eager to know whether you received those letters. We hear absolutely nothing from you, so we are very surprised by this silence, especially yours. I am sending the Brunswick matter, which you will return after reading it through a convenient messenger, although I assume you have already read it before.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, here you receive the letter from Herbrot, the envoy of the Augsburgers, who writes briefly and clearly about the Imperial Diet, exactly as it is.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us as soon as possible, to whom we commend ourselves most diligently, and greet the brothers and fellow ministers lovingly and dutifully. To your excellent man Rösti, all the best from me. June 16, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>I am now receiving letters from Frecht, who wishes to commend himself to you most diligently, asking me to inform you that he has sent your apologetic work against Cochlaeus to L. Adam Bartolomeo, the ducal ecclesiastic in Neuburg, who undoubtedly sent it to Cochlaeus. He also sent this letter, which you see here, from Schwenckfeld; I am sending it even though I have not read it, so that you may ensure it is delivered to our Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the man of exceptional piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the best Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed and dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
