      <p>[...] who could still conveniently care for and govern that church.</p>
      <p>Our messenger Mr. Dumysen rode to Bern last Monday; other places of the Confederates are also coming there, to ask Bern, if the Savoyard desires the right with Geneva, that they do not reject it. The Lord of Cr√ºtz, the king's legate in Solothurn, sent a note to the innkeeper at the Stork, written in French: the king was camped with over 40,000 strong at Havel de Gras, offered the English 4 tons of gold, that they refused; therefore the French seriously engaged with shooting and laid down the 2 best towers and prepared eagerly for the main assault.</p>
      <p>There they did not trust the situation and surrendered, as their lives were spared and they were let go, and the king had the port back in.</p>
      <p>Many thousands of the English fell out, and about 2400 honest people perished and were stabbed.</p>
      <p>13th of August, 1563.</p>
