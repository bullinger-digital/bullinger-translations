    <p xml:id="regest1">Is glad that there is nothing to write about. Joachim [Maler], who is coming to Zurich, has brought a letter from Capito from Strasbourg, in which he expresses his conviction that the reservations [of the Swiss churches] towards Bucer can be resolved, and writes of his concern that the authority of the evangelical office is not taken seriously enough; according to Zwick's fear, however, similar dangers lurk here as with the efforts of the Anabaptists. Hopes for the recovery of Leo [Juda]. Will soon send the index to [Jakob] Ziegler's ["Terrae sanctae... descriptio"]; asks for a list of Zwingli's writings and for a review of a work list of Oecolampadius. Also wants to send the Ziegler index to Pellikan, but cannot write him a separate letter each time.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>There is nothing more to write to you, dearest Bucer of all, and indeed I am grateful both for us and for the church, as there are no longer such contentious topics for letters, which have troubled us for a long time not without great annoyance. Now, you have our sincere Joachim as a substitute for a letter, with whom you can safely discuss everything. He recently returned from Strasbourg bringing letters from Capito, in which the excellent man does not mention you or your churches, except that he believes Bucer can satisfy you if he is heard, and that he would give his life into the hands of the judges if they found the accusations in the letters to be true. Furthermore, he always and everywhere laments the neglect of the churches, and that we do not watch over them diligently enough to establish them well and pass them on purely to posterity. He thinks it is neglected that the power of the evangelical ministry and the parts of the pastoral office are not handled more vividly. I do not understand this opinion. For if, after such success of the kingdom of Christ, the authority of his word or ministry is now first to be learned, I do not know on which finger the most powerful demons have been cast out so far. What else did the Anabaptists want with this one reformation of the churches? Let us see, therefore, that we do not stumble into the same shoals. But discuss this with Joachim, if you please. I add nothing more now, but I call upon you, Jesus Christ in heaven, not to lead us into temptation. Oh, how I fear the return of the demon once cast out with seven companions worse than itself, and that in eradicating the weeds from the field, we may do so with great loss of wheat. However, may all this fear be utterly vain!</p>
      <p>I heard recently that Leo is bedridden. May the Lord restore him to us!</p>
      <p>You will soon have the index of Ziegler from me. You make sure that I have the index of Zwingli's books. I have Oecolampadius's from Basel, which I am sending to you here for review, in case you find anything neglected; but send it back through Joachim.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellikan, who will also receive Ziegler from me. You can also give him these letters to read. For it is not always possible to write the same topic to both.</p>
      <p>I wish your families well in Christ. Farewell, my heart.</p>
      <p>The last of June 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, as much as I am, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant minister of the church of Zurich, his esteemed brother and lord.</p>
