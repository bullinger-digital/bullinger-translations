      <p>God with us. Since you(?) and Susana have gone away, I receive a letter from St. Gallen, but nothing else, except that the king of St. John of England has withdrawn, having lost 3 storms and many people. The admiral is lying with all his people around Toulouse, so that no one can come to or from them, and they are very hot for those in the city. What will come of it, time will tell. God be with you all. Greet all your people for me, and to my young lord in Tiefen, his honorable wife, and all the people, I wish from God many thousands of good years.</p>
      <p>Wednesday evening after Christmas 1570. Mr. Hans Rümbeli has become our caretaker at the foundation in place of Oggenfuß.</p>
      <p>Ludwig Blaß has become the chief at the Augustinians and Mr. Heinrich Meyer, who was with us in Gyrenbad, has become the steward at Oetenbach. May God give them luck, etc.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg am Irchel.</p>
