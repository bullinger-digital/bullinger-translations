    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius never doubted that Bullinger was still alive [in reference to a lost letter from Bullinger to Myconius]. He has taken note of the information sent by Bullinger regarding the peace [of Crépy, which is hardly sustainable]; he has heard nothing about the upcoming [Diet of Worms], but fears for the [Reformation], as the violence exercised by the Emperor against the Anabaptists may now also be directed against the internally divided and God-forsaken [Protestants]. He has not yet seen Cochläus’ [“Replica brevis”], only Bullinger’s first refutation sent to him [“Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio”]; from Gast he learned how Cochläus, similar to [Thomas] Murner, dedicated his [“Replica brevis”] to the people of Lucerne: a very delicate situation; may Bullinger not have provoked the people of Lucerne with his response! He has not yet seen Luther’s [“Kurtz bekentnis”] against Zwingli and Oekolampad; Gast was sent a copy; Myconius has heard how the writing (especially in view of the upcoming Diet) has caused great displeasure among the scholars and pious; it is to be feared that these disputes will ruin the true church; no pious person can be pleased with this excommunication imitating the Pope; and those who welcome such should ask themselves how they come to do so. [Johann Jakob Wecker or Philipp Bächi] wrote that through the mediation of scholars, Philipp [Melanchthon] [now] agrees with Luther; however, Myconius has meanwhile learned more pleasing news for scholars: Melanchthon remains silent only because of the Diet, until he is forced to express himself; Myconius was very pleased that Melanchthon sent his greetings through Gast’s nephew [Philipp Bächi]. Myconius is surprised that Theodor [Bibliander] is lecturing on Genesis, as his interpretation of the Apocalypse can hardly be finished yet. He sends letters from Calvin and [Guillaume] Farel [above No. 2023?] as well as a writing by Calvin [the attachment], a kind of reply about the quarrelsome [Jean Chaponneau]; Myconius was evidently able to achieve little with this through a letter written to Farel a few months ago. Alexander Rischacher is extremely grateful to [Bullinger] for the already very great kindness shown, but asks whether it would be possible for him to leave his son [Martin?] in Zurich until Shrovetide [1545], as otherwise he would not find a position in Basel, which is plagued by under-supply; the boy can probably be convinced of this, as it is not a long period. He forwarded Bullinger’s letter to Bucer [No. 2037]. [Attachment:] Letter from Calvin dated November 7, 1544, on behalf of the pastors of Geneva to the pastors of Neuchâtel. [P. S.:] At the request of the people of Neuchâtel, Myconius arranged for a copy of Calvin’s letter for the [Zurichers] and forwarded the original to Strasbourg.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I think much about Bullinger. I have not thought him dead until now, since he proves more and more every day that he is alive by so many signs. May he live long for the Lord and piety!</p>
      <p>You send back the chapters of peace, about which they say the emperor cannot fulfill what he promised. He blames the commissioners. I hear nothing certain about the future Diet. I truly fear for religion, since the imperial sword is so drunk with the blood of the Anabaptists. For it will become accustomed, so that it cannot stop. After this is exhausted, it will surely come to the Christians, especially as the dissensions and anathemas among us increase. The God of peace is not with us, whichever side is at fault or to blame.</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen Cochläus' work. I saw your first response, which you sent. From Gast, I learned that Cochläus dedicated a reply to the people of Lucerne; and I said: "A bad plan is worst for the planner." Thoughts immediately came to my mind, which I did not think well of: and in Cochläus, I found the spirit of Murner. I hope you responded in such a way that you not only do not disturb the spirits of the people of Lucerne, but perhaps even recall and claim for yourself those captured by the anti-Christian writing. If ever there was a need for prudence, it was needed in this response, as far as it pertains to the people of Lucerne.</p>
      <p>Nor have I seen Luther's recently published booklet against Zwingli and Oecolampadius. Therefore, I can say nothing good or bad about this. One was sent to Gast, about which he told me, but did not show me. I am waiting until I can see it from somewhere. I hear that it greatly displeases the learned and pious, especially because of the Diet. For when these dissensions are heard to be so sharp, what can be judged but that all will be destroyed? For in the Catholic Church, nothing but dissensions are sown. That papal-like anathema can please no pious person, unless perhaps there are reasons by which it can be justified; but I have not yet found such. Let those who approve them see, or they take from where they should not, or they maliciously invent. Indeed, in this whole conflict, I can do nothing but grieve and pray: "Lead us not into temptation, O heavenly Father, but deliver us from evil" [Mt 6, 13].</p>
      <p>Someone wrote about Philipp of Wittenberg agreeing with Luther, especially with the authority of the learned who are there, interposed.</p>
      <p>However, while I write this, the learned men respond with more joyful news than I had received: Philipp will remain silent because of the Diet, until he is compelled to speak. I am grateful that this man greeted me very kindly through Gast's nephew.</p>
      <p>I am very glad that you are all well, as you write. However, I am surprised that you say Theodor is lecturing on Genesis. Where then is the Apocalypse? For I do not think a book of such obscurity is already finished. But if it is finished, we eagerly await the explained revelations.</p>
      <p>I send letters of Calvin and Farel, commended to me in this, also Calvin's writing, indeed a judgment about the overly contentious brother among the Neuchâtel people. You will learn what they seek from the letters. Indeed, in the name of the brothers, I wrote about the same matter to Farel a few months ago, but I see I have achieved little, while he, whoever he is, persists in his conceived hardness. Thus Satan tempts us everywhere; it is miserable that we do not resist, though we have weapons ready.</p>
      <p>Alexander of Rischach gives you great thanks through me, promising nothing less than what pertains to showing a grateful mind, as far as his strength allows. Although he greatly values the benefits provided so far, he asks, however, that you be willing for his son to remain there until Shrovetide. For if he returns now, he will not find a place due to the scarcity of resources in the whole city. It is difficult to live in Basel today for the said reason, so much so that everything is, I hardly say expensive, but rare. Through dissimulation, he will easily be retained for such a short time.</p>
      <p>I immediately sent your letters to Bucer. Farewell always, and as you commend me to the grace of God, so I commend you to Christ the Lord. Basel, December 5, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned D. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful Antistes of the people of Zurich, his lord in Christ to be respected.</p>
      <p>I have described to you, for thus the brothers of Neuchâtel wished. I sent the autograph to Strasbourg. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
