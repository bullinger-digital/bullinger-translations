      <p> Greetings. The court is not to be filled with words at this time. The messengers sent by our people to you as intermediaries are indeed good men, but one is more Christian than the other. Johannes Guler, Landammann of Davos, among those who are Christians with us, yields to none in the profession of faith, but is considered the foremost and in all other respects the wisest man. Dietrich Jäcklin, in the name of the House of God, is the bishop's bailiff in Domleschg at Fürstenau; I still fear him not at all, even if he does not present himself as evangelical. He is a very intelligent man. The one in the name of the Upper League is the bailiff at Tschlin, he is a broken man, but strongly opposed to our faith. We hope that all three will conduct themselves prudently in the matter. May the merciful God be present. </p>
      <p> Our consul Ambrosius received both the letters and the book from you with a cheerful face and thanked me, promising that he would write to you. It all turned out well. The adversaries are in turmoil and rage; the number of enemies is growing. They will find a way, and our Christ, that Apollo, will be present when called. </p>
      <p> Babylon mocks, so that the holy city of Zion may rejoice. Yours, Gallicius. </p>
