      <p>God be with us, dear lord and brother, after I have written my letter to you, sealed it, and am about to send it away, your letter dated November 24th comes to me through Mr. Jacob Geßner, and I am surprised that you are again assigning me work with the restless man Ganthner. I have previously informed you how he has been with me and has made many requests, but I have not wanted to engage with him for much or little, as he himself knows well, but have given him the final decision: his matter is handled and settled, as I know well and thoroughly, before the honorable and wise lords, the mayor and council of the city of Chur, whom I consider to have done neither too little nor too much for him, especially since all his matters have been sufficiently heard and endured there. I let the matter rest there and will not engage in any way on his behalf (which would not be appropriate for me), nor will I give him any writing or prescription (which he requests from me). If he is indeed so committed to our confession, as he says, and knows all things uprightly and without deceit, he could well inform the brothers and not say one thing and do another, etc. That is the summary of what I have dealt with him, and he will not be able to say otherwise about me truthfully. I let it remain at that.</p>
      <p>The good, pious Joannes Müller has never spoken a word, neither good nor bad, with me; he has left from here. May God grant him a fortunate journey. I write this in haste, partly with reluctance; for I am tired of writing, and besides, I am not strong otherwise...</p>
      <p>Given as in the letters.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, preacher in Chur, my dear lord and brother.</p>
