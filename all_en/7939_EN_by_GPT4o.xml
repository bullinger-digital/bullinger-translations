      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The conflict over excommunication is flaring up again in the Palatinate at Heidelberg, and good people fear that the prince and the entire Palatinate may suffer harm by accepting a yoke that is strongly opposed by nobles, commoners, and the general populace. They fear worse things. The Lord's Supper, which was instituted for the sake of communion, is being turned into excommunication. The wretched supper is being miserably torn apart. May the Lord grant better things. I hear, but neither believe nor affirm, that Mr. Beza is adding fuel to the fire. Certainly, a church has been established in the city of Heidelberg, which is now said to have judges and ecclesiastical censors. May the Lord turn it to good. We (which we want you alone to know) are again writing to the prince, dissuading him from what seems to be leading to serious conflicts and dangerous disturbances, etc. Elsewhere, too, disturbances are arising in the churches. This is all because ministers, given to their own desires, do not edify but seek their own interests and destroy. May the Lord have mercy on us and preserve our churches in peace.</p>
      <p>Farewell, etc.</p>
