      <p>May the newly born child, Christ Jesus, grant us a peaceful, fruitful, and blessed year, in which we may be found devout, righteous, and faithful, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear Lord and Brother. Regarding the recent agreement concerning my lord, Herr Konrad Lüthard, his wife and child have been placed under the guardianship of the witness of this letter, whom you may discreetly consult about all matters concerning the Rüti Monastery and also on behalf of Herr Konrad. He is a good and devout man, named Thomas Bucher, and is the bailiff of my gracious lords of Zurich in the small courts belonging to the house of Rum, etc.</p>
      <p>Since the people cannot be sustained for long due to poverty and lack, nor driven to great expenses, I earnestly request you, as much as you are able and as it seems appropriate to you, to advise them so that they may be granted a favorable date. I have instructed Gebhart K[rüttli] to speak to the people, and have also sent an instruction to the best of my ability, subject to his improvement, in which you may also advise and help.</p>
      <p>Regarding the meeting, about which you prompted me to write at my departure, my advice, for the sake of greater consideration, would be that you not only write to me but also to all those who were with you in May of the year 1534, on the Tuesday after the Feast of the Holy Innocents; we will commonly discuss all matters in colloquium, where we will remain, and also how we wish to present ourselves to our gracious lord regarding the acceptance of the acquaintance, etc.</p>
      <p>Let us know some news, and may God keep you, for the comfort of His church and all of us, graciously according to His will for a long time.</p>
      <p>Given at Bubikon, in haste, on Monday, the 28th of December, in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Your brother</p>
      <p>H. Stumpf.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the city of Zurich, his most beloved father in Christ.</p>
