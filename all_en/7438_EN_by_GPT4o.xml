      <p>We earnestly pray for grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, commending your diligence and respect to your paternity.</p>
      <p>Reverend Father and Lord, our dear colleague and brother, Christophorus Thretius, delivered to us your esteemed letters, which could not have been more desired or pleasing to us. For they declared your singular fraternal, or rather paternal, affection towards us, as you informed us about the matters we had inquired about, and they indicated your sympathy, as you diligently encouraged us not to be broken in spirit by these persecutions and disturbances of the churches, but to trust in divine mercy, who wishes His church to be subject to the cross in these lands. We will briefly inform you how long these persecutions still endure. Our heretics are now in three different groups. The first group, after those delusions and having overcome the most terrible blasphemies with which they previously attacked the most holy doctrine and confession of the Trinity, inflamed with a great frenzy, embraces the Samosatenian heresy with the most pernicious Anabaptism, denying the eternity of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and shamelessly affirming that He began His existence from conception in Mary's womb, claiming that He first obtained the title of God and Son by the Father's gift when He was baptized by John, and they twist all passages pertaining to the office of Christ to the whole person, using proofs collected from the Old Testament for the promise and from the New for the exhibition. Furthermore, they condemn us of heresy because we attribute to the deified man (for they call Christ by this name) the honor due and owed only to God the Father, and we worship Him with the adoration due to God the Father, and therefore we are also called idolaters by these scoundrels. They also add that there is no mention in the sacred scriptures, especially in the Old Testament, of the eternal generation of the Son or before the conception of Christ in Mary's womb, nor did the prophets use the title of the Son of God, but the scriptures speak only of the coming, not the future seed. With these and many other most shameful insults and horrendous blasphemies, of which a great quantity is described and sent to you by Thretius, the first sect, which is the largest part, attacks us and our orthodox confession.</p>
      <p>The second sect begins to neglect this Samosatenism and Anabaptism in part, and many return to us. They confess that the Son of God is coeternal with the Father, they invoke and worship Him.</p>
      <p>But they differ from us in that they do not want to believe that these three, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are one God, but only that these three are one, which indeed seems to us that they cannot escape by this reasoning, without making three coeternal spirits. Furthermore, they despise the accepted phrases in the church and the terms essence, person, Trinity, ομοούσιος (homoousios) and similar, nor do they think they should be used, because they do not literally exist in the scriptures. And many from this sect would like to be included in the number of our congregations, but we do not receive any of such people unless they first make a clear confession of the unity and Trinity of God and at the same time approve those phrases and expressions by which the corruptions and deceptions of heretics, which they often try to cover with the words of scripture, are more easily uncovered and avoided. Although we add and explain that the church does not have a dispute about words with these sects, but about this doctrine, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one God, yet the reason for interpretation requires that the words of scripture be explained to the simpler ones with others of the same meaning and taken from common usage. For they also pave the way for understanding the language of scripture.</p>
      <p>The last sect is of the followers of Valentino Gentilis, who dominate greatly in Lithuania and have not taken deep roots among us. They say that the Son of God is of the essence and by some propagation God, but the Holy Spirit is the gifts created by God in men, namely, the knowledge and movements of wills and hearts agreeing with the norm of divine justice.</p>
      <p>We resist all these sects with all our might, as much as divine kindness allows, and by refuting the arguments they present to us with a deceptive appearance, we show them the right way and the true causes of certainty. We urge them to cease from such heresies and blasphemies against God and His Son and to meditate on and learn what is founded in the holy scriptures, and to read and hear the accepted and customary explanations of the sacred writers and to follow them, not the doctrines of those heretics, who falsely devise and invent them for the sake of gain and ambition, to lead the simple people away from the true worship of God. And among some, we feel that we have not labored in vain, for the congregations are increasing, brothers are being gathered, the interrupted order is being restored, and many are abandoning their false religion and embracing ours. To which end it is a great help to us that we clearly demonstrate to them that we not only approve your confession but are also included in the number of churches professing this confession, as the names of our provinces Oswiecim and Zator are clearly expressed with your churches' names by your peace and kindness, for which matter we express our immense gratitude to your excellence and the other brothers, and we profess to owe you much with our churches, both for the many benefits previously bestowed upon us and because you allowed our petition, which we had instituted with you through Thretius, to have weight. Certainly, by this means, all impending evils and some new confessions, which some of our idle men were forging according to their own brains, have been met, and especially the Augsburg Confession, by which some often tried us in these controversies and in these afflictions of our churches, has been met. Therefore, we again and again most approve and affirm this subscription to your confession in these letters, and we declare that nothing could be more pleasing or more gratifying to us than to be most closely united with you in the same religion, to live life with you, or, if it so happens, to face death for that religion and confession. Nor are there lacking those who envy us for this deed, especially those who should least do so, known to you at least by name, who alone, with everyone opposing, because they want to be seen as rabbis in the churches, and do not think it permissible for free churches loving purity with obedience to the gospel to consult for edification without consulting them or rather with them sleeping, namely, truly these, most kind Father, that if they continue to criticize this our purpose and try to attack this deed with their restlessness, that you, when they themselves provide you with that occasion, may freely restrain them and kindly admonish them to rather study edification, we earnestly ask you.</p>
      <p>The Stancarians, except for the slanderous Stancaro himself, are a little more peaceful, thus by God's granting kindness, and the chief followers and patrons and defenders of that sect, along with some ministers, wish to join our congregation and have offered us the manner of their repentance in writing, which we have attached to these our letters, praying that your excellence may wish to communicate with Lord Simler and the other brothers and deign to impart to us fraternal counsel on what should be followed in this part. For we do not wish to undertake or respond to this article, which this heretic has long attacked, without your authority and counsel, until we have been instructed by your excellence about your opinion. That your piety may wish to examine and consider this and instruct us copiously about everything, we ask again and again in the name of Jesus Christ, for whose glory it is done.</p>
      <p>Given on the 16th day before the calends of May 1568 in Oswiecim.</p>
      <p>[...] to the most illustrious man and... to the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, most revered lord and father.</p>
      <p>Heretics in Poland in threefold... Stancarian reconciliation.</p>
