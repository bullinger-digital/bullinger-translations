    <p xml:id="regest1">Preface dedicated to the mayors Johannes Haab and Diethelm Röist for the commentary on Matthew about the few measures that are truly necessary for the church. It belongs to the signs of the end times described by Paul [in 2Tim 3, 1-7] that believers are obstructed from accessing the truth by complicated and confusing demands of church law and tradition; Bullinger wants to demonstrate that Christ did not burden his church with numerous difficult-to-understand regulations and wants to explain the few points that truly matter. In Mt [11, 27-30], Christ testifies that his yoke is easy, and Isaiah [55, 1-4] also calls believers not to useless efforts but to heavenly abundance in following Christ. Christ did not speak complicatedly about salvation but outlined his teachings several times in a few words: With Nicodemus, he was content with explaining rebirth [John 3, 1-21], he instructed the Samaritan woman even more briefly, in Capernaum he demanded nothing but faith [John 6, 29], he summarized the law in [the golden rule, Mt 7, 12] - which corresponds to the commandment of neighborly love in John [15, 12] and Paul [Rom 13, 8] -, the Apostle Thomas received a short answer to the question about the way to heaven [John 14, 6], and John also briefly points to the Son [1John 5, 12]; in him, the Father has given us everything, as Paul teaches in Eph [1, 3-14], and Christ alone is necessary for salvation according to Mt [24, 23-26]; even almsgiving, praying, and fasting - as shown in Mt 6 [1-18] - are not burdensome when viewed correctly. Furthermore, the Lord entrusted his followers with two simple sacraments, baptism and the Lord's Supper, without associating them with intricate questions as posed today; instead, he spoke about faith, brotherly love, forgiveness, patience in suffering, and hope for eternal life. After his resurrection, he gave the apostles instructions for founding the church and commanded them to pass on what he had already taught them; with the promise of the Holy Spirit, he did not present them with new teachings but a helper for their proclamation. This is evident, for example, in that Peter demanded nothing more from the centurion Cornelius than to believe in Christ [Acts 10, 42]; he also strongly advocated at the Apostolic Council [Acts 15, 7-11] that only the grace of God and faith in Christ are necessary for salvation, even though [the Gentile Christians] were temporarily given obligations out of consideration for the Jews. Paul also demands nothing in his letters that goes beyond this. From all this, it is clear that Christ did not impose a burden on his church; nothing more is needed than faith, neighborly love, justice, patience, sanctification of life, charity, prayer, and the proper use of the sacraments; that this is sufficient is also evident from Luke's description of the first community [Acts 2, 38-42]. Extra-biblical testimonies can also be cited for this, such as Lactantius's definition of the true church or a passage from Augustine's response to Januarius. The apostles John, Peter, and Paul have repeatedly stated that they considered the simple teaching they delivered to be completely sufficient. Some of this will be explained in more detail below. The most important point is the preaching of the Gospel, for it contains the perfect teaching. For this, the church needs preachers, but also schools for their training, as they have existed since apostolic times; elders and the authorities with their laws are also necessary to discipline the rebellious and shameless wrongdoers, whereas nothing can be said about church singing based on apostolic teaching; it is sufficient if the church offers prayers to God. The sacraments instituted by the Lord serve in their simple simplicity to illustrate and practice faith; they are unnecessarily embittered by useless disputes. In these few, profound yet simple points, [the evangelical churches] have everything that makes a perfect church; we should keep away from people who want to burden us with all sorts of other things. These considerations were prefaced to the commentary because they are meant to summarize it, as well as the Gospel of Matthew itself, and to show that the latter does not require supplementation by church decrees. Bullinger wrote the commentary at the request of many, using the annotations and paraphrases of Erasmus, the lectures of Theodor Bibliander, and the commentary of Konrad Pellikan; he did not attempt to harmonize the Gospels - for this, the works of Ammonius, Augustine, Jean Gerson, Andreas Osiander, and Martin Bucer may be consulted - but tried to explain Matthew clearly on its own, referring to Jerome, Chrysostom, and others for difficult passages; he explains his method of commentary, in which he particularly relied on the testimonies of Augustine alongside the Holy Scripture, apologizes for the less elaborate style, and leaves the judgment to the readers with Paul [1Thess 5, 21]. He dedicates the work to two faithful supporters of the Gospel; with the recent election of the already proven [Johannes] Haab as mayor, great hopes are associated. Also, [Diethelm Röist], who has held this office - like his ancestors Heinrich and Markus Röist - for 18 years alongside the deserving, recently deceased [Heinrich] Walder and supported the church renewal, will once earn grateful remembrance from posterity and glory before God.</p>

      <p>The Lord Jesus Christ did not burden his church, and what are those numbered heads of true piety, by which the church of Christ is completed, to the most illustrious men, Mr. Johannes Haab and Mr. Diethelm Röist, the most worthy mayors of the city of Zurich, the preface of Heinrich Bullinger in the commentary books on the Gospel according to Matthew.</p>
      <p>The chosen vessel Paul, writing to Timothy, prophesies that in the last times men will be lovers of themselves, covetous, boastful, and proud, who have a form of godliness but deny its power, and therefore they are always learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
      <p>And we read this prophecy, many of us, but not all understand that it has long been fulfilled and is still being fulfilled today. For laws concerning church governance are made and remade, discussed and rediscussed; there is debate about reforming the church and the direct and indirect, tolerable and absolutely just way of reformation; and so it is debated that there is no end, no limit, no certain reason for laws, prescriptions, opinions, and judgments. In the past, vast books of Decrees, Decretals, and those wandering beyond the olive groves, Clementines, and Additions were written. But who can recount the opinions of the fathers and the statutes of councils? By all these, the people of God were so entangled and perplexed that they learned diligently and always, but never truly came to the knowledge of the truth. Indeed, you will find even among those who disdain those previous sanctions as rancid, that in the doctrine of the gospel they have nothing certain, and they too learn diligently, but never come to the end and completion of doctrine, so that their mind may rest and have the numbered heads of true religion. Therefore, to show even to those of moderate understanding that the Lord Jesus did not burden his church with any constitutions either heavy or numerous or obscure or inexplicable, and that the heads of true piety are numbered and few, by which the saints are perfected, we will explain what the Lord Jesus has handed down to us and what those numbered heads are, by which the church is completed. Let no one think that this argument is broader than can be completed in a few words. For the business of truth and piety, content with very few, does not require the curious and laborious loquacity of men. I will certainly try sincerely to handle this useful and necessary business so that it may be heard not without some fruit.</p>
      <p>That the Lord Jesus did not burden his church, but subjected it to a light yoke of servitude, he himself testifies in Matthew and says: "All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and to whom the Son wills to reveal him. Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" [Mt 11, 27-30]. At the beginning, he says he is the source of all good and that inexhaustible horn of plenty, who fully satisfies his own. Then he adds that he is the heavenly and faithful teacher, who alone can truly teach heavenly philosophy. Hence he exhorts all to come to him, as many as are entangled, afflicted, and burdened. For he promises solace, remedy, and satisfaction to all, finally true instruction in truth and just tranquility of souls. He also exhorts them to shake off the yoke of the world and submit their necks to the divine.</p>
      <p>For he declares this to be both convenient and light. Not so much because nothing is difficult for the one who loves and wills, but because the kind of doctrine is most simple, and the word, as the prophet said, is shortened. Hence the same prophet, prophesying about the kingdom of Christ under the persona of God, cries out and says: "Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. Why do you spend money for what is not bread, and your wages for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in abundance.</p>
      <p>Incline your ear, and come to me. Hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the sure mercies of David.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I have given him as a witness to the people, a leader and commander for the people" [Isa 55, 1-4]. With these words, the kind and truthful God freely calls the entire human race, excluding no one; he calls them not to bear certain burdens, but to heavenly riches and pleasures and to partake in eternal life. He also rebukes our foolishness, who are carried about and vexed by various and most difficult kinds of doctrines, from which we receive no benefit, but rather considerable loss to our domestic affairs. "But come to me," he says, "listen to me, and your soul shall live." For those who obey, he offers a covenant and promises Christ himself, in whom alone he promises to give us all things. Let us see, therefore, how God has provided this and what the Father has given us in Christ or through Christ himself as a witness.</p>
      <p>When the only-begotten Son of God, who is in the bosom of the Father, descended from heaven to us and as true God and man, Jesus Christ, declared heavenly wisdom to the world and established his church in true religion, he did not entangle the minds of his own with various and manifold traditions, nor did he dispute prolixly or obscurely or thornily about true salvation, nor did he involve piety in difficult questions, but in a single, very brief sermon, he handed down whatever pertains to true salvation. This we will illustrate with some examples. In John chapter 3 [1-21], taking Nicodemus to be fully instructed, the Lord in all that instruction does nothing else but make him understand that anyone aspiring to eternal life must be born again from above. This means that those powers inherent from that first birth have nothing suitable for obtaining righteousness and salvation; but from above, through divine and free grace, the Holy Spirit is given, who transforms and enlightens the hearts of men, so that they now see the depravity and corruption of human nature, and therefore, despairing of their own strength, they flee to divine mercy, which delivered the Son to death, so that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life, and that, rescued from the darkness of errors and sins, he may walk further in the light of truth and purity. What could be said more briefly in such a great matter? But what, in the meantime, could be plainer and fuller?</p>
      <p>I think no one will require more, whoever has been thus taught in this heavenly philosophy. Nor did he instruct the sinful Samaritan woman in any other way or by any other method, except that he seems to have used a somewhat more concise brevity. In the Capernaum school, when asked by some what they should do to work the works of God, he answered in one word: "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he sent" [John 6, 29]. Although he immediately adds a somewhat more extended exposition of how he came into the world as the bread of life, how he is going to prepare his flesh and blood as food and drink for the soul, and again how he wants to be eaten and drunk, namely spiritually through faith. However, even that exposition is so concise that it can seem burdensome to no one. Just as the exposition of the law in Matthew is indeed spread out a little more extensively, but soon it is gathered into that single sentence: "Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the law and the prophets" [Mt 7, 12]. This corresponds to what the Lord says in John: "This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you" [John 15, 12]. And what is read in Paul: "Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law" [Rom 13, 8]. Who will say these are either lengthy or complicated or obscure?</p>
      <p>In that last supper, when he was already revealing the greatest mysteries of faith to his own and pouring out his divine heart entirely to them, to the question of the divine Thomas: "Lord, we do not know where you are going, and how can we know the way?" [John 14, 5] he explains in a single sentence where he is going, that is, why he is dying and what is the safest and surest way to heaven, saying: "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" [John 14, 6]. With these words, he explained the cause of his death and its fruit and pointed out the way to heaven, and indeed pointed it out most clearly; moreover, he overthrew, scattered, and trampled all other ways established outside this one. Hence, the apostle John, inspired, said in his canonical letter: "God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son does not have life" [1John 5, 12]. This corresponds in all respects to what Saint Paul proposed with marvelous clarity to the Ephesians, that God has summed up all things in Christ and, as it were, reduced them to a compendium, so that now from this one, as from a heap of all goods, what was previously sought as if in parts from many is sought. Indeed, the Lord Jesus himself in Matthew condemns and teaches that those who divide the minds of the faithful and apply them to many and various things as if necessary or useful for obtaining salvation are to be avoided. For "If anyone," he says, "tells you, 'Look, here is Christ,' or 'There,' do not believe it! For false Christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</p>
      <p>See, I have told you beforehand. Therefore, if they say to you, 'Look, he is in the desert,' do not go out; 'look, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it" [Mt 24, 23-26]. What, then, will the faithful soul do? It will depend on the word and grace of Christ alone, who commanded his own to beware of such foul impostures of men who divide the hearts of the faithful with impious schism and proposed himself alone as the teacher of truth, finally as the expiation for sins and the throne of grace to be approached in any necessity. For he is the one who was given as a teacher to the world, who also died, indeed who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us, having a perpetual priesthood and perfecting forever those who are sanctified with a single sacrifice. I think everyone understands that the Father has given us everything in Christ. Everyone understands what the doctrine of the Lord was about the salvation, justification, and life of the faithful; brief indeed, but clear, open, full, and in every part complete. This also pertains to his tradition of beneficence to be shown, of the prayer of the saints, and of fasting or the chastisement of the body, which is also brief and clear, as can be seen in Matthew chapter six [1-18], having nothing of difficulty or burden; which, however, will seem intolerable and inexplicable if you estimate it from the disputations of sophists.</p>
      <p>Now the Lord also commended a few sacraments to his own, baptism and the symbol of his body and blood. For he did not disdain the baptism of John, but was sanctified by it. Then, sending his disciples into the world to announce the preaching of the gospel to all nations, he said: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" [Mt 28, 19]. In this institution, you will find nothing that you can say is inexplicable or burdensome. Indeed, while he lived on earth and announced the saving preaching of the gospel, he baptized no one, but ordered his disciples to baptize. For the word of God is more excellent than the sacraments, and faith itself is more noble, without which it is impossible to please God and without which the sacraments indeed are present, but cannot benefit. Furthermore, the Lord's Supper was first instituted and celebrated by the Lord himself with no pomp, no splendor, and no expenses burdensome or difficult for anyone, but easy and frugal in all respects. For with a sober supper and the symbol of bread and wine, he attested to us the mystery and benefit of our redemption and commended the memory of his death and mutual concord and friendship to his people. Nor did he bring up thorny, subtle, and masterly things about this sacred symbol, which are today disputed in schools and temples: Whether there is the true and substantial body of Christ, what is converted into what, what substance remains, what ceases, and whether the ceasing is annihilated, whether he is whole in the whole sacrament and whole in any part, how he can be whole and entire in such a small piece of bread, whether there is a glorious body there. But he discoursed about solid faith in God, brotherly love, forgiveness of sins, patience and constancy in adversities, and certain hope of blessed life. For these are salutary, and these he requires from his own. This doctrine of piety and this discipline of the sacraments, when he had handed it down privately to his own and publicly to all dispersed throughout Galilee and Judea, after he had also expiated the sins of the whole world with his innocent death on the cross and had been buried, on the third day he rose from the dead, appeared to his own for forty days, so that they might not doubt the resurrection, and with many proofs demonstrated that he had truly risen from the dead, meanwhile also giving instructions to the apostles about gathering and establishing the church throughout the whole world; and when all these things were completed, he ascended into heaven and sat in glory at the right hand of the Father. The instructions he had given to his own were of this kind: They should go out into the whole world, preach the gospel, that is, repentance and forgiveness of sins in the name of Christ, also baptize believers and teach them to observe all things that he had commanded them. By this, he signified that the most perfect kind of teaching had been handed down to them. For what he adds, that they should wait for the coming of the Holy Spirit, does not pertain to what many interpret, as if he had to deliver a new and much more extensive philosophy. For the Lord himself said openly in the gospel: "He will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak" [John 16, 13]. And again: "He will take of what is mine and declare it to you" [John 16, 14]. Again: "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you" [John 14, 26]. Behold: "He will teach you all things," he says, and lest they understand or think this of a new doctrine, or that Christ perhaps had not taught all things, he adds for explanation: "and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you." Therefore, the Lord had taught all things, but they had slipped from the apostles due to weakness, so they had to be recalled to their memory by the Spirit and fixed more deeply and each thing explained more fully.</p>
      <p>However, lest anyone doubt these things, it is also worth recalling what the apostles handed down to the churches to be observed after receiving the Holy Spirit. And to begin this demonstration with Saint Peter, he was once called to Cornelius, a centurion of the Italian legion. For an angel of the Lord had said to him: "Send men to Joppa and call for Simon Peter; he will tell you what you must do" [Acts 10, 5f]. But when he came, having been called, and was already saying what must be done, he prescribes nothing else to him than to believe in Jesus Christ. For he preaches nothing else to him than Christ and indeed him crucified for us, buried, and raised from the dead on the third day.</p>
      <p>Indeed, in that same preaching, he attests that he received nothing else from the Lord to preach, saying: "The Lord commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that through his name, whoever believes in him will receive remission of sins" [Acts 10, 42f]. Who, I ask, does not understand from this that the apostles handed down nothing else to the people dispersed throughout the world than what they had received from the Lord? Who does not understand that this tradition is sufficient for obtaining salvation and for complete piety? For the angel explicitly said: "Peter will tell you what you must do." And Luke immediately added what he indicated and prescribed, nothing else than what is explained in these few words. Soon he also baptized him and his household. But he did not impose on him anything about auricular confession, nothing about private absolution, nothing about reserved cases, nothing about satisfaction and indulgences, nothing about the celebration of masses or fulfilling vows, nothing about the invocation of saints and the worship of idols, nothing about going to Rome or the city of Jerusalem, but simply preached Christ and showed everything in this one.</p>
      <p>The same Peter, the most constant and ardent defender of the simplicity of faith and doctrine, in the Jerusalem council, where this question was being discussed, whether faith in Christ alone justifies, or whether legal things should be joined to faith for the perfection of a Christian man, rises and with great gravity pronounces these words: "Men and brethren, you know that a good while ago God chose among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.</p>
      <p>And God, who knows the hearts, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they" [Acts 15, 7-11]. So far, we have reported the words of Saint Peter. "There is one," he says here, "and a certain way to salvation, one most complete way of justification, namely through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Cornelius, together with his household and relatives, relied on this with all his heart and true faith and received the testimony of the sons of God. Meanwhile, I added nothing of burden from the law and imposed nothing on his shoulders, I only preached Christ, in whom he believed." Therefore, the grace of God and faith in Christ are sufficient for salvation, and it is not necessary to add anything from the law to complete justification. Furthermore, those few things that are soon added are said to have been added for the sake of the time and the customs of the people of that age, not to be perpetual, but to be observed out of charity in the cities where Moses was read in the synagogues.</p>
      <p>Now from the thirteenth chapter of Acts and the same fifteenth chapter, it is clear that not even the apostle Paul taught the churches of the Gentiles anything else or more or not the same. But in his letters, he diligently demonstrates that the faithful in Christ have and find all things necessary for true salvation and the perfection of piety, and that no other means are needed after Christ for living blessedly. Indeed, in the letter to the Philippians: "But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ" [Phil 3, 7-9]. Therefore, everywhere he exhorts all to faith in the Lord Jesus, with which he also commends innocence of life, charity, and fervent prayers to the Lord. The same apostle baptized, as the Lord had commanded, although he admits in the meantime that very few were baptized by him. He did not celebrate the Lord's Supper differently nor did he order the Corinthians to celebrate it differently than the Lord himself had instituted. "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you" [1Cor 11, 23] and the rest. For the place is well known in the first epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 11. These, I say, are what Saint Paul handed down to the churches by the command of the Lord, namely the complete example of absolute doctrine and a just church. Now indeed, nothing is more certain than that all the other apostles followed the same method, since they all gathered the church of God with one institution and one spirit.</p>
      <p>From all these things, I think it is clear that the Lord Jesus did not burden his church and what are those numbered heads by which the church is fully completed, namely the doctrine of the gospel or divine truth, which commends to us faith in God, love of neighbor, public justice, patience in the cross, holiness of life, and that holy prodigal beneficence, also pure and faithful prayer and the religious use of the sacraments. With these few and least burdensome things, the church is completed, so that it is whole and not diminished in any part, the church, I say, which Paul truly called the house of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. But if anyone still hesitates and thinks that much more is required for its perfection, let him hear Luke in the Acts of the Apostles describing the first, that is, the most perfect church of Christ gathered by the apostles themselves, meanwhile not mentioning more than these, and from there let him gather that even today the most complete church can be gathered and preserved with those few things. For in the second chapter of Acts, after indicating how the Holy Spirit was given to the apostles, he immediately reports how Peter preached Christ to the people of Israel and that they, being pricked in their heart, asked: "What shall we do, men and brethren?" [Acts 2, 37], and Peter answered in these words: "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" [Acts 2, 38]. And after a few words, Saint Luke adds: "And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, 'Be saved and keep yourselves from this perverse generation!'" [Acts 2, 40]. In this response of Peter and the historical exposition of Luke, we first have the primary heads of evangelical doctrine, faith, and repentance through the name of Christ, then exhortation and admonition, and finally the sacrament of baptism. To these, Luke soon adds: "And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers" [Acts 2, 42]. In these words, the apostolic doctrine is again gathered, but also constancy or perseverance in the apostolic doctrine, which is especially necessary, also communication or beneficence, the breaking of bread, that is, the Lord's Supper, and faithful prayer. With these numbered and few heads, the apostolic writer completes that first and apostolic church, which no one ever, unless exceedingly impious, said was not a full and just church. Certainly, Luke at the end of the same chapter clearly called it a church, saying: "And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved" [Acts 2, 47], at the same time confessing that salvation is in such a church and that whoever comes into participation of such a church is saved. Therefore, with those few things, the church can be gathered, completed, and preserved, and it is a just church, which, equipped with those things, relies on Christ the rock.</p>
      <p>Moreover, we are not lacking human testimonies here either. Lactantius, in the fifth book of the Institutions, chapter thirty, says: "The Catholic Church alone retains the true worship. This is the fountain of truth, this is the dwelling of faith, this is the temple of God; whoever does not enter it, or whoever leaves it, will be alienated from the hope of eternal life and salvation. But because even heretics think their church is Catholic, it must be known that it is the true one in which there is religion, confession, and repentance, which healthily cures the sins and wounds to which the weakness of the flesh is subject." These are the words Lactantius wrote, who, disputing about true worship in the sixth book of the Institutions, chapter one, says: "The holy and singular majesty desires nothing else from man than innocence alone, which if anyone offers to God, he has worshiped piously and religiously enough." I wanted to add this so that you might understand more correctly what he said, that the Catholic Church is the one that retains the true worship of God. Now, Aurelius Augustine, the orthodox doctor of the church, responding to the inquiries of Januarius in epistle 118, explicitly writes in these words: "At the beginning, I want you to hold, which is the head of this dispute, that our Lord Jesus Christ, as he himself speaks in the gospel, has subjected us to his gentle yoke and light burden. Hence, with sacraments few in number, easy in observance, and most excellent in signification, he has gathered the society of the new people, such as baptism consecrated in the name of the Trinity, the communion of his body and blood, and if anything else is commended in the canonical scriptures, except those things which burdened the servitude of the old people according to the congruence of their heart and the prophetic time, which are also read in the five books of Moses" and what follows.</p>
      <p>But leaving and neglecting human testimonies, we return to the divine and again add the greater testimonies of the greatest apostles Peter, John, and Paul, so that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, that invincible truth, namely that the church is completed with those few numbered heads, may be more strongly asserted and confirmed. Therefore, Peter, after he had laid down a few precepts of faith, charity, patience, and beneficence and had exhorted the pious to express them in holy work, immediately adds: "If you do these things, you will never stumble. For in this way, an abundant entrance will be supplied to you into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ" [2Pet 1, 10f]. However, unless he had believed that this kind of doctrine, which we have just reviewed, was sufficient for obtaining life and for perfecting the people of God, he would never have said: "In this way, an abundant" (observe the emphasis of the word "abundant") "entrance will be supplied to you into the kingdom of God." At that time, there were certainly no orders of monks, no rules or monks themselves, no masses, no questions or traditions such as those that bishops and idle theologians introduced into the church after many centuries. And yet, without these, Saint Peter says that an abundant entrance into eternal life is opened to all who desire it through apostolic doctrine. Saint John in his canonical letter says: "What you heard from the beginning, let it remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you will also remain in the Son and in the Father" [1John 2, 24]. Here he promises the full fellowship and union of the Father and the Son with the faithful to those who persevere in that kind of doctrine which the apostles handed down from the beginning. But from the beginning, they handed down nothing else than what we have heard. Therefore, that tradition is sufficient for perfection. Saint Paul not only binds the evangelical preacher to that brief and simple kind of doctrine but also prophesies that there will be some who, as we see happening today, will not want to hear that truth handed down and confessed and will turn themselves to fables and most vain trifles. For he writes to Timothy: "I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom: Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables" [2Tim 4, 1-4]. Surely, that divine heart would not have pronounced these things with such ardor and affection unless it was well aware that the doctrine he had handed down together with the other apostles was just and complete, and that the churches almost innumerable throughout the world already established were true and perfect churches. Therefore, those few things are sufficient for the churches, with which the Lord wanted to instruct his own to necessity, not to burden them so that today we must always be learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. For these things are certain, numbered, and therefore all are easy through Christ, provided we also do not fail in our duty and calling.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, lest anyone can complain that these things of ours are sufficiently concise, it seems worthwhile to explain some of them more copiously, so that it may be clear to all that in those few heads we have all things that pertain to the perfection of the church.</p>
      <p>The first place in those enumerated heads is held by the doctrine of the apostles, the preaching of the truth, the word of the Lord, the sacred scripture, or the gospel of Jesus Christ. This indeed prescribes the most absolute laws of life, teaches, rebukes, casts down, and raises up again the minds, exhorts, consoles, threatens, intends punishments, and establishes, decrees rewards, divine and human, ecclesiastical and political, finally informs and most absolutely institutes all parts of life, all ages, and all offices and therefore completes them. This is testified by the most learned in the law, Paul, writing to Timothy and saying: "But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work" [2Tim 3, 14-17].</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the word of the Lord is in a certain way, as far as we are concerned, inert and lacks its power, fruit, and operation unless there are those who exercise it, apply it to places, times, and people, teach, urge, assert, and defend it. And here the ministers of the churches have their place, especially the teachers of truth, the leaders of the churches, the interpreters of the scriptures, the preachers, the masters of life and morals. Since no one is born an absolute craftsman suddenly, the church needs schools. Schools, I say, in which languages, liberal arts, and disciplines are religiously taught to sobriety, especially the sacred catechism, to disciples destined for the ministries of the church and for learning or wisdom. For schools existed in the times of the apostles and flourished after the times of the apostles, as Luke is the author in Acts chapter thirteen and Paul in the first epistle to the Corinthians chapter fourteen, as well as Eusebius in the Ecclesiastical History and other ecclesiastical writers. From such schools, the most faithful, most exercised, most pious, most eloquent, and most skilled in matters have always been called to ecclesiastical ministries. Furthermore, since in the church, where doctrine flourishes, unhappy tares also grow, and many contumacious and rebellious ones sprout, who, as they excellently simulate faith, do nothing worthy of faith and do not care a bit if they are taught a hundred times and severely rebuked, nevertheless, they persist in their crimes, therefore the church needs not only ministers and teachers but also elders or seniors and therefore also magistrates, who moderate and restrain the contumacious and impudently sinning with laws and discipline. And such must be, above all, good men, holy, pious, just, temperate, strong, and religious, who both want and can do what they ought. And here pertains the election and office of the magistrate, here pertain sumptuary laws against gluttony, drunkenness, luxury, lasciviousness, and obscenity. Laws also against fornicators, adulterers, about marriages to be rightly contracted, legitimately maintained, and justly dissolved, about the education of children, about public justice, about contracts against fraud, against usurers and corrupters, about judgments, defending widows, orphans, and wards, about public tranquility and peace, against mercenary wars and corrupt gifts, about beneficence and support of the poor and the legitimate use of ecclesiastical resources. These things I wanted to indicate briefly and touch upon in passing about apostolic doctrine or truth and its ministers, that is, about learners, teachers, professors, preachers, and the holy senate of the church. About singers and church singing, I can say nothing from apostolic institution. Paul commands his own to sing with spirit and mind.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is sufficient for a just church if it offers pure prayers to the Lord through Christ.</p>
      <p>As for the sacraments, Saint Augustine piously and learnedly said that they are very few, baptism and the Eucharist, very easy in observance, but most august in sense and signification, instituted by the Lord. For they have no expense, no difficulty (I speak of apostolic, not papal ones), no worldly splendor. For all their power exists from institution and signification. Indeed, the saints in the church are justified and absolved by faith alone, not by sacraments, the sacraments exercise faith and in a certain way excite it. For they are visible actions instituted by the Lord, so that he himself may represent his mysteries and gifts to us, also testify his benevolence towards us, exercise faith, gather us into one, and remind us of our duty, as can be seen in baptism. For this represents to us that he alone is the one who washes away filth; he testifies by it that he favors us and therefore that he wants to be our God. Therefore, whenever baptism is conferred in the church, the faith of the saints is exercised. Furthermore, it gathers and aggregates us externally into his people and admonishes us of mortification, so that we may die daily with the Lord and rise with him in newness of life. Again, in the Lord's Supper, it is signified that the body and blood of the Lord were expended for us on the cross to satisfy and vivify believers. Therefore, when the bread is offered to us, which the Lord symbolically and according to the manner proper to sacraments called his body, a clear indication is given that the Lord offers himself entirely to us to be enjoyed by faith. Therefore, our faith is exercised by the mystical action. And just as from many grains one bread is made and from many grapes the wine is produced, so we are admonished in the reception of the symbols of mutual charity, and that we may become one body with Christ and among ourselves and give thanks to the liberator Christ. This, indeed, is the reason for the sacraments, having nothing that is not proposed so far in the doctrine of the gospel, except that it pleased the Lord, for our weakness, to deal with us by these sacramental signs as by visible words according to our capacity and to present the greatest things, so that they might be more commendable, in a certain way to the eyes, and by one to initiate the saints, from whose fellowship not even the infants of the faithful are excluded, and by the other to retain the memory of the death of the Son of God for the more mature. And thus it is also most manifest that the reason for the sacraments is most plain, most salutary, and full of the sweetest fruits, which some make more than ungrateful with their thorny disputes, questions, and contentious tergiversations. From what we have brought forward so far, I think no one does not understand that we, who glory in the name and gospel of Christ, have in those few heads all things that pertain to the absolute perfection of the church, and therefore the Lord did not burden his church with those few things. For although they are divine and immense in their nature, they are nevertheless most easy and delightful in faithful observance. Therefore, what expenses, what burdens does the church bear today, with what laws, decrees, and disputations is it entangled, which it neither received from the Lord nor from the apostles nor from apostolic men, but from idle, superstitious, and avaricious men, who, as they always learned and never came to the knowledge of the truth, so they plainly considered piety a gain. About whom the apostle said to Timothy to separate from those who are of such a kind.</p>
      <p>About these things, I wanted to preface our commentaries because this is, as it were, their summary and a kind of compendium, which are more copiously treated in the evangelical book of Matthew and in our commentaries, moreover, lest anyone, having composed the brief evangelical book, should think that not all things pertaining to absolute piety are fully handed down in the vast books of decrees.</p>
      <p>However, I published these commentaries of mine on Matthew after so many old and new expositors with no ambition or contempt for others, but because the brothers and pious and learned men wanted it so, to whom I could not plainly deny this my service. I sought the kind of exposition from the advice of the sacred author, from the discussion of circumstances, from the collation of other places, from the nature of faith and charity, to which those who expound the sacred scriptures everywhere command to look. I was also not moderately helped in this work of mine by the interpretations of those who wrote before me, especially the Annotations and Paraphrase of the blessed memory of Mr. Erasmus of Rotterdam, which I never concealed in the work. He was a man of great judgment in expounding the sacred things, most equipped with languages and the reading of the ancients, also with no ordinary piety towards God, and, if anyone else, most well-deserved of good letters, of the study of theology, and of true piety. In expounding the testimonies of the Old Testament, the incredible faith and most faithful diligence, as well as the rare and exquisite erudition of the most illustrious man Mr. Theodor Bibliander, our most revered teacher, who professes the Old Testament in the school of the church of Zurich, greatly benefited me. The public labor of our venerable teacher Mr. Conrad Pellikan, most pious and learned, also benefited. For what is scattered among the best and various interpreters of the scriptures, he reduced to a compendium and communicated to the churches. I did not labor in this work of mine in reconciling the evangelical history. For it seems that the minds of readers are distracted by too subtle reconciliation and that certain scruples are introduced to them. It also seems that each of the evangelists arranged the history in his own order and wanted to teach the church by that very order. Hence it happened that they proceed now with natural, now with artificial disposition. But whoever delights in that not useless reconciliation has both the ancients and the moderns from whom he may learn it. For there are the Canons of Ammonius, there are the copious books of Saint Augustine On the Harmony of the Gospels. There is also the Monotessaron of Jean Gerson and the concise Harmony of the Gospels by Andreas Osiander. Martin Bucer also published learned and pious Expositions of the Evangelists eleven years ago, in which he composes the most differing places with marvelous felicity. In these commentaries of mine, I especially took care not so much to compose others with Matthew as to compose him with himself, that is, by a certain continuous kind of exposition, not so much to explain the sense of the historian as also to connect the history itself and to refer each thing, as much as possible, to a certain goal. Therefore, I divided the whole work into 12 books. I prefixed arguments to the books, indicating the structure and cohesion of the future work or the adumbration of cohesion, the members and parts, and how these are connected with the head. I also took care to open the genuine and simple sense and mind of Saint Matthew as simply as possible. In ambiguous and more difficult places, I frequently bring the expositions of Saint Jerome and the most eloquent Saint John Chrysostom and other saints, whose faith and diligence in expounding the sacred things we all rightly admire and kiss, although they do not use equal felicity everywhere. Moreover, I indicated almost everywhere the use of the evangelical history, adapting it almost to our age and our morals. For unless we apply the histories, especially the sacred ones, to ourselves, we will read them with little benefit. In some places, I treat commonplaces, especially when the treatment of these seems to illustrate our author somewhat. I often refute wrong opinions, corrupt interpretations, and harmful errors, meanwhile defending and confirming true and just doctrines. In this matter, after the testimonies of the scriptures, I gladly use the writings of Saint Augustine, because he is considered the most catholic and orthodox among ecclesiastical writers. For this reason, I was more prolix in commenting here than when I was expounding the epistles of Paul. As for the thread of the speech, I used extemporaneous and unpolished diction. For, being entangled in ecclesiastical and many other affairs, I am accustomed to pour out almost everything, to write or compose nothing. However, I am sufficiently secure about my faith and the truth of the doctrines before the Lord. My readers, who value simple piety more than painted language, will consider the diction, which is not very polished, in a good light. If anyone indeed gives better and more polished things to the church, I will not envy, but I will gladly learn from him. I propose all my things in such a way that I most desire that rule of the apostle of Christ to prevail: "Test all things; hold fast what is good" [1Thess 5, 21]. Therefore, if I have hit the mark anywhere, give glory to God and receive the truth with grateful minds. But if I seem not to have hit it, consider that I am a fallible man and that canonical truth is to be followed everywhere and in all things, not any man in the world. Nor did I write these things with any other intention than to benefit all, to harm no pious person.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would rather the whole book perish than that any good person be offended and fall by it.</p>
      <p>Whatever this labor of ours is, I dedicate and inscribe it all to you, most revered lords, whose faith, probity, and humanity certainly deserved more than ours. I wanted to testify my prompt and grateful mind towards you with this inscription, nor did I think any other thing would be more pleasing to you, not so much because it is inscribed to you by me, a minister of Christ, but because the whole book is written about Christ Jesus our Savior and his saving gospel. For you have hitherto favored all ministers of Christ, whom you have supported, you have loved the Lord Christ, you have helped sacred studies, and you have most faithfully promoted the most holy gospel of Christ, which you received with most obedient minds from the very beginning of its preaching and ecclesiastical reformation. Indeed, that public favor, which was born to you, most revered Haab, from that your zeal for piety and probity, and the great hope conceived by all good people about you, that you will govern the highest offices entrusted to you with the utmost integrity and holiness, recently raised you to that highest dignity of the consulship. And indeed, you have hitherto given no ordinary proofs of your piety and probity, who have not without moderate praise performed the tribunitian power. You also presided over Rheguscis, eminent in proconsular dignity, so that departing from them, you left the greatest desire for you among all good people. From there, we are indeed raised in hope that through that your sound faith in Christ, through religious prudence and pious diligence, you will take care of the sincerity of religion, good and holy studies, the safety of the laws, and the welfare of the republic with the utmost faith and diligence. May Jesus Christ grant this to you and to us.</p>
      <p>To you, indeed, Röist, most revered lord and most faithful godfather, all good people congratulate, give thanks to the Lord, admire, and look up to you for what divine grace has hitherto provided to the republic through you, which they hope and expect to be exhibited by the same through that your colleague Mr. Haab.</p>
      <p>You have already held the consulship for 18 years, chosen for this office with the highest consensus of the citizens and the greatest hope and expectation of the greatest things. You were added as a colleague to the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Walder, who himself obtained no small praise from his virtues, especially from his zeal for piety, from his favor for the gospel, from his faith and diligence in administering the office, and in the past April happily migrated to heaven to King Christ, whom he served, to receive the reward of his faith and live and reign eternally with Christ. Those illustrious ancestors of yours, Mr. Heinrich Röist, your grandfather, and Mr. Markus Röist, your father, men most observant of religion, justice, equity, and peace, held the consulship before you, whose administration did not go badly for the city. And indeed, your administration, which in the meantime was full of disturbances and dangers, has hitherto gone happily. For under you and the blessed memory of Mr. Walder, religion was restored, superstition was expelled, and almost the entire face of the republic was changed. Nor do I know if you will find more turbulent times since the founding of the city. Therefore, you have endured the most severe labors and burdens, which have not once thrown you into the most severe illnesses. But from all these, the Lord has delivered you everywhere and always shining favorably upon you. All the citizens know that I attribute nothing here to anyone out of favor, but that I say these things truly and modestly. For your faith and your labor deserve great praise; they will deserve greater praise before God and men if you continue in this way to the end to preserve the republic of Christ, the doctrine of truth, good laws, and holy studies, if you faithfully take care of the affairs of widows, orphans, and the poor. You will undoubtedly be saluted by all our posterity as the father of the fatherland, and you will also be crowned by King Christ, whom you serve, with the crown of glory, which he promised to all who serve him in humility, faith, and love to the end and are not puffed up by the glory of things successfully accomplished, but are rather incited to greater things to be designed by the grace of God. May the Lord Jesus keep you for the glory of his name and the safety of his church. Amen.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in the month of August, in the year 1542.</p>
