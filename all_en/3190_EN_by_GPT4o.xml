      <p>Greetings. I hope you have received my recent letters sent to you, Friedrich, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. In them, I explained many things that I had and which you requested to know in your last letter to me dated May 10th from Samaden. Our son Johannes Travers von Salis is in Baden and is taking the baths.</p>
      <p>In recent days, I sent to him to know how he was doing and his well-being, and by the grace of God, everything was safe. We expect him to come to us again shortly; for I understand that he is held by a desire for us, however liberally he is cared for.</p>
      <p>We rejoice that you will come to us after the fair and encourage you not to let any delay hinder your journey. There is also a rumor here that Ferrante Gonzaga will descend from Italy into Belgium.</p>
      <p>Today, an English doctor coming directly from Frankfurt reported to me that letters have been brought from England indicating that on May 10th, Philip crossed into Belgium from England and prepared English soldiers and obtained a considerable amount of money against the French. However, I would not assert this as verified truth; I fear, however, that the king will soon have more enemies than he wishes. The Pope, the most wicked Antichrist, has driven him to this. The four evangelical cities in Switzerland will send a delegation to the king to plead for the Waldensians in Piedmont; for the king had decided through the Turin parliament to persecute them. They are of our religion. I commend to you again Mr. Johannes Fabricius, acting in Chur, as if he were myself; I also commend the most honorable royal envoy Mr. Matth√§us Cognatus, who was recently sent by the king to Rhaetia; he is commended to me by the brothers, as he is most sincere in the true faith, most dear to the king, and has done much for the advancement of religion. Greet him most diligently in my name.</p>
      <p>A colloquium will be held on August 24th in Worms, instituted by the evangelical and papal estates of the empire; a president has been appointed, assessors, speakers, notaries, adjuncts, and supernumeraries have been designated, about all of which it would be long and tedious to write. However, persecution has been renewed in Belgium against the faithful. There will be a diet of the princes in Frankfurt on June 18th concerning various matters. The German evangelical princes will also send envoys with the Swiss to the king. Some Saxon preachers have again published malicious, bitter, and most foolish pamphlets against us. All those whom you ordered to be greeted send their greetings, especially Mr. Martyr, my sons-in-law, and the rest of the choir. Live and farewell together with your most honorable wife, your whole household, and Mr. Travers. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 21, 1557. Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished by piety and nobility, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, residing in Samaden, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
