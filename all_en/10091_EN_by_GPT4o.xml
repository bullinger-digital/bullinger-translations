<letter xml:id="file10091"><summary><p xml:id="regest1">In the peace negotiations following the Kappel War, the leaders of Zurich deceived the people. The peace, desired by all, now turns out to be deceptive. Zurich has neither drafted nor disseminated a letter of apology. The accusation that Zurich's preachers had unchristianly called upon the authorities to take violent action is unfounded, as the preaching of the prophets teaches. Not only Zwingli, but also Isaiah, Zechariah, Stephen, and James died a violent death. A more detailed explanation of the theologians' stance can be found in the biography of Zwingli sent to Jakob Ziegler.</p></summary><body><div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1"><p>You lament my situation, most learned Bucer, that I am living in exile among the people of Zürich. From this, I appreciate your feelings towards me, so that I may love you even more ardently in return, whom I have loved before even without knowing you.</p><p>With no less affection of charity, we all, who preside over the word in Zürich, read your lamentation of our betrayal, by which we have betrayed faith and alliances, God and allies. And indeed, we have betrayed, but by another's fault, although it is also ours, for not opposing such a great crime. However, at the beginning of the convention, the terms were outlined by the emperors and magnates, both ours and foreigners, so that soon an oath of silence intervened and the sealing of seals, and the whole army was never solidly informed of what the terms of peace were. For those returning said peace was made, but what kind of peace it was, no one or certainly very few explained. The reason was that our leaders and magnates, who were conducting the peace, all except two or three were either enemies or dissemblers of the evangelical cause. Therefore, they were secretly and impiously arranging everything. But to others, who suspected their cunning and to whom piety was dear, all authority was taken away, and that because of the recent defeat at Kappel. For continually, if anything more sensible was suggested, they heard whether not enough blood of citizens and Christians had been shed, that war was sought against the will of Mars and Minerva, that victors were defeated not without the greatest loss, meanwhile the land was perishing, buildings were being devastated, and both private and public resources were being exhausted, and that after the greatest famine now endured for three years, a greater plague would follow, nor indeed could the mountain people be conquered and extinguished, but we could be consumed by a long war not by the misfortune of the enemy, but by our own misfortune. The people stood astonished, already twice defeated and routed, altogether stupefied, abandoned by experienced, pious, and just leaders, weary of war matters, and finally very desirous of any kind of peace. Relying on these opportunities, the schemers accomplished what they were preparing without any difficulty. Hence emerged for us that excellent peace, by which we betrayed both God and men. Which now for the first time the greatest part of the people begins to perceive and to grieve in vain. Yet it is something to confess and detest the crime committed. You will pray to the Lord to have mercy on us. Now indeed He has humbled us, so that we who have hitherto been a mirror of strength and constancy for the churches, may now be the refuse and offscouring of all nations. Yet we cry out with the divine prophet: "It is good for me, Lord, that you have humbled me" etc. [Ps 118,71].</p><p>Then, as you write that the Zürich excuse is flying through all of Germany in letters and documents quite shamelessly, as it pretends necessity and the will of the people, we are amazed. For believe that it was fabricated and published by others than the people of Zürich. For we certainly know that the people of Zürich have published nothing of those matters, unless they have sent an apology to your people, which they may communicate to all of Germany. Which, however, we do not know nor believe. "But we foresaw this disaster, these betrayals, and civil dissensions," you say, "hence we wanted to arrange peace through our people. Why did you not listen to the holy admonitions?" We would indeed have listened, if we could ever have hoped that wild men could be softened by any long-suffering, as they are not softened even now by our blood and long-suffering after so many losses received, indeed even then, when our people were seeking peace, they had entirely resolved to proceed by force and arms. But why many words? You will see sometime the just causes, you will see the long-suffering patience of our people, when we send the life of our Zwingli to Ziegler. For in this matter nothing was done wrong on our part. The evil came from the Lord, that we might be tested, not that we might be utterly destroyed. But the will of the Lord is holy and just. Hence, when you write that you do not know what civil and human reason seems to savor of ecclesiastical doctrine among us, which has also turned out badly for us, we not only wonder, dearest brothers, but are also astonished. For if any matter is to be judged from the outcome and misfortune, who then would not regret the Christian prophecy, as it does not reward with a rough gift after many labors endured, but deprives of life the best men in the Lord, Isaiah, Zechariah, Stephen, James, and countless other heroes; to all of whom true religion turned out very badly? But if our doctrine savors of the human and civil because we have exhorted the Christian magistrate to liberate the oppressed, to maintain equity, and to cultivate justice, to punish crimes and criminals, what, I pray, did the prophets preach that was divine? For neither does it condemn etc. Or shall we indeed answer that their function was different, and ours is different, when not even common sense allows it? For no one is ignorant that those things which are of justice and judgment have never been abolished, nor has the magistrate been abolished in the church of Christ. But it is the magistrate's duty to punish the guilty, which Paul also reminded in Romans, indeed also Peter, who - - -</p></div></body>.</letter>
