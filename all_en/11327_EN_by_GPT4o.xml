      <p>Greetings. Adam Frey is with me. We are consulting on what more should be done. There is a doctor, Sebastian Sinckeler, who is a very good friend of mine. Although he promises nothing due to the length of time and the nature of the illness, he will try something that will not harm.</p>
      <p>If it progresses, Adam may perhaps go to the spa. I ask you, by your authority, to assist him. He seems to me a good man and knowledgeable of God, and therefore worthy of the help of all good people, so that he may be supported. I ask you to commend the man diligently to the lords in your usual manner.</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther has gone to Lausanne, for reasons unknown to me. Our cause (unless it changes) will soon require intervention from you, Kunz, and the people of Strasbourg shortly after this. The living devil has started something; it is in full swing.</p>
      <p>Farewell always with yours, and give my most dutiful greetings to Pellicanus and Theodor.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 2, 1539. Yours, Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his esteemed brother in Christ.</p>
