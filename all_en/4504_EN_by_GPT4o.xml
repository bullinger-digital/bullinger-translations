      <p>Several times now I have received letters from you, most excellent man, full of humanity and piety, to which I have more just reasons for responding later than I would like, unless it seemed so to divine providence. For hardly any time is free for me from adverse health: for I am afflicted by illnesses for a large part of the time, and even when the illness is somewhat settled, weakness and debility remain, which either completely prohibit or repress all study and exertion of the mind; even this summer I was bedridden for several weeks with gout, which, however, everyone judges to act unjustly with me, that is, with this thin, fasting, and dry body, which by its own right usually attacks only the fat and well-fed, from which foot pain I am not yet entirely free. Moreover, when it is somewhat possible through illness, I am accustomed to change location in the summer, and now I stay in Duisburg in Cleves, now in Bonn above Cologne for the sake of my mind, which means that in the summer I am more rarely in Cologne. Therefore, these earlier letters of yours were delivered to me in Bonn at the time of the Frankfurt fair by Julius the Spaniard, a most upright man and very familiar to us, who recounted many things to us about your singular humanity, from which place I immediately sent your letters to that nobleman from Fiesole. I received others of almost the same subject through Johann Birkmann in the same place.</p>
      <p>However, having returned to Cologne at the end of the grape harvest, I conveniently found that man from Fiesole here, who communicated with me both your letters and that matrimonial matter known to you, and he is now writing letters to your excellency concerning that matter, in which I also beseech your piety to apply all diligence in handling it: For it is indeed arduous and perplexing, not so much perhaps in itself, as because of the dispositions of those to whom it pertains. If you can compose and complete it through your prudence, you can hardly believe what a splendid thing you will have accomplished. For these three persons, who are acting out this drama, have been miserably tormented until now, since both their age and their parents, ignorant of this matter, demand marriage entirely, and no one has dared to enter into marriage because of conscience with the considerable offense of some: Therefore, with this cause happily composed, the matter will be rendered from uncertain and disturbed to tranquil and peaceful with the greatest joy of many. As for me, I am involved in this most bitter and odious conflict of parties, according to the smallness of my talent and the inconvenience of my health, and I inquire with an impartial mind on both sides after divine letters and also the opinion of the ancients, who can neither be rightly rejected as suspect judges nor accused by right of corrupt and depraved religion: For I see today that the freedom of judgment is not a little hindered by excessive party zeal. What you write that you have heard about some Greek books that are with us, there is nothing of the sort: indeed, there are very many old and manuscript books with us, sought out with great zeal by Mr. Cornelius, my patron, most of which contain either histories or ecclesiastical offices that were in use in the middle ages: But in Greek, nothing except the liturgy of James, which is now printed in Paris, and undoubtedly seen by you.</p>
      <p>I wish that you and your colleagues there may be given long in safety in diligently and faithfully carrying out the business of the church of Christ. From Cologne, 13th of the Kalends of November, in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>Most observant of your humanity, G. Cassander. To the man of distinguished learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God in Zürich, his lord to be observed.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
