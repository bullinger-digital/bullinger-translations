      <p>Whenever the opportunity arises to write to you, I will by no means let it pass. On the 12th of this month, I wrote; now I will add to those letters what has followed since. A speech was to be given by Cardinal of Lorraine four days ago, in which he would refute Beza's preface, and since our brothers and colleagues were to go there, namely to Poissy, where the assembly of the clergy is held, it was long debated in the royal court whether I should be brought there, and it was almost decided that I should not go, because the cardinals and bishops did not want to tolerate me there.</p>
      <p>But the queen summoned me at the hour when I was to depart and ordered me to attend. Prince of Condé arranged for my escort.</p>
      <p>Upon entering that hall, I saw a great crowd of bishops seated within the enclosure, behind whom sat a large number of Sorbonne scholars and monks. When I saw this and noticed that neither the queen nor the king and other nobles were present, I withdrew to a corner of the lower hall to await the arrival of the brothers. Cardinal Castiglione approached me with two bishops and asked if I was Peter Martyr? When I affirmed, he greeted me most kindly, offered all services, and testified that my coming was most welcome to him and other good men.</p>
      <p>The bishops earnestly asked me to strive for peace and concord to be established and for the disturbances to be quelled. I thanked them and replied that I would not fail to support peace and concord, as far as the word of God and evangelical truth would allow. That cardinal is the brother of the Admiral and, as almost everyone says, he has very correct views on religion.</p>
      <p>Later, the Cardinal of Lorraine entered, followed by the king and the queen mother with the King of Navarre and other nobles. Finally, the colleagues arrived, to whom I immediately joined myself.</p>
      <p>The cardinals and bishops sat, but we stood outside their enclosure. Lorraine spoke in French for an hour and a half.</p>
      <p>First, he flattered the royal majesties greatly, then he began to refute Beza's speech. He said much about his church, claiming it had an unbroken succession.</p>
      <p>He then tried to show that the church consists not only of the elect and saints but also of the wicked and criminal. He asserted that general councils could not err in doctrines or morals, but sometimes changed certain things according to the times. He distinguished the word of God into unwritten and written, and wanted the church to preside over this and to seek its interpretation from it. Then he descended to the matter of the sacraments, where he said nothing about transubstantiation or the mass, but he persuaded the presence of the body of Christ no differently than Luther and Brentius.</p>
      <p>He refrained from insults and acted quite calmly. When he had finished, we asked to be allowed to respond to his speech extemporaneously. The response was that we should not act then, but a day would be given when we could respond.</p>
      <p>When we returned to Saint-Germain, Beza and I were immediately summoned by Prince of Condé and the Admiral. They asked what we thought of the sermon? They praised its calmness and moderation, and many valued it highly because he had not mentioned transubstantiation or the mass. They said this to prevent us from speaking harshly or sharply about that speech, and thus breaking off the hope of a future colloquy. And they indirectly advised me that, when I was to be summoned to the queen mother the next day, I should speak more mildly. I promised to act calmly regarding the cardinal's speech, about which I would not judge otherwise than the word of God allowed. The next day, I was summoned to the queen along with Beza, and that in the evening.</p>
      <p>She took me aside and asked me to explain certain things more clearly. Then she asked what I thought of the sermon? I replied that there were some true and good things in it, which were also common to us, and what he had said about obedience to magistrates, and that the wicked were present in the church with the good [...] but that the church could not be placed above the word of God. Regarding the Eucharist, I said the cardinal was completely opposed to the truth and to us, but that he might perhaps concede something in the conference.</p>
      <p>I said this not because I hoped so, but so that the hope of the colloquy would not be cut off. I added that if agreement could not be reached in the colloquy about the presence of the body, that article should be left free and the churches should be allowed to retain the doctrine they judged to be consistent with the word of God. She strongly approved of this advice.</p>
      <p>Having said this, she went to the fire, where Beza was with the King of Navarre, Condé, and the Admiral, and asked him along with me to use all our efforts to reach a consensus.</p>
      <p>We promised to do as much as the word of God would allow. 19th September 1561 in Saint-Germain.</p>
