      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings beforehand, well-learned, dear friend. The letter you sent us some days ago along with some reports and newspapers, we have received. We do not give much credence to the claim that the general assembly called for a common Reichstag (as it should be one) in the description, especially since it should have been changed, unless there are princes or counts of the empire who are still in disgrace and not yet summoned. No secular princes have been there in person for eight days, except for Lord Albrecht in Bavaria. The news that the prince, the emperor's son Philip in Spain, is traveling is unbelievable to us, so soon, there must be other practices and purposes arranged and accomplished beforehand. The indications and works give what you write to us, that Charles's intention is nothing other than to bring about a monarchy. So far, the examples have given good testimony. With Dirck, Soffia, and Prosia, what has been handled in matters of war is too long for us to write. So we had to send them back immediately, you may receive their report with the next message.</p>
      <p>We have little time for writing and reading on our journey to Baden. With Nuremberg, it is as you may see from the enclosed, and if it comes to pass, they will undoubtedly have to worry about the ridicule. In summary: where there is money, it is sought after and not stopped (unless God prevents it), until everything is exhausted. Only then is a true monarchy to be established. You will still experience, if God grants you a little time, a great separation and discord between blood-related potentates, which one would not have expected or believed soon. Which we refrain from further detailing at this time. Be entrusted to God and do not let the newspapers come further than to the annoyed; we rely on that. Done by our hand in Oberbaden with ill, on the 21st of August in the afternoon at 2 o'clock in the year 50.</p>
      <p>[To] the well-learned our [dear] friend Heinrich [Bullinger], preacher in Zurich, to hand.</p>
