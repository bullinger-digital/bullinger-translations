    <p xml:id="regest1">For his relief, he learned from Konrad Wüst that the colleagues in Zürich are well, contrary to other rumors. He fears the suspicion of the people of Strasbourg regarding his appointment [to Riquewihr]; his greetings conveyed through Wolfgang Seitz were only answered by [Kaspar] Hedio with a letter, while both he and Bucer secretly write to Count [Georg]. He quotes statements from Hedio's letter that have increased his mistrust and urges the people of Zürich to support him according to their previous promises. Specifically, he wishes for them to draft an "oeconomia ecclesiastica," a handbook for the organization of church affairs, which should be dedicated to Ulrich, Georg, and Christoph of Württemberg. It should address the grievances that need to be combated, as well as the proper practice of religion; furthermore, how education should be promoted and how church properties should be rightfully used. The shepherds who feed themselves will fare like the unfaithful steward in Christ's parable; the warning against the misuse of church properties is of particular urgency today. The handbook should also inform about the proper relationship between the authorities and the clergy. Even the apostles insisted on being freed for prayer and preaching. If preachers are forced into unworthy activities, great harm threatens. Today, some lords take pleasure in treating their pastors disgracefully, but their ingratitude will avenge itself. Schmid wants to ensure that the office of preaching is held in honor. According to Hedio's letter, the Bundestag in Schmalkalden is expected to convene a [Communion] convention; Schmid wants to know more details. He recommends a German edition for the mentioned handbook. He asks for a quick response.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord God through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>If you and all your loved ones are well, most esteemed teachers, venerable fathers, and dearest brothers in Christ Jesus, then I have reason to rejoice. For I know that none of you would easily believe how anxious I have been for the well-being of you all, unless it were to happen that you too would have to move elsewhere and hear such dreadful things about you, which I have been hearing for a month and a half now, not without great anguish of mind. But thanks be to God, I have realized that all these fears are unfounded. For when recently Conrad Wüst, your fellow citizen, visited us in passing, he assured us of the well-being of you all, so that we have since laid aside all fear. I want you, fathers, teachers, and most beloved brothers in the Lord, to be fully convinced that if I ever loved, honored, and respected you when I was at home, I do so today even more ardently and fervently in my absence - unaware of what hidden force and energy drives me, except perhaps that it happens to all of us that we love those who are absent almost more than those who are present. This is something we can see daily in spouses, siblings, companions, and other friends and comrades, so that there is hardly anyone who lacks an example, unless perhaps someone lives among mushrooms, stumps, and utterly heartless beings.</p>
      <p>Now, what I am asking from you, dearest fathers, for the common good, you will immediately understand when I explain the reasoning behind my plan, which is as follows: I have so far refrained from writing to the brothers in Strasbourg, silently and as if through tunnels investigating how they would react to being called from Zurich, feeling neglected by the one who should be in charge of proclaiming the word in Riquewihr. Immediately, some - uncertain whether they were prompted - came forward asking if I had anything that should be written to the Strasbourg brothers as neighbors. I have often replied that I have nothing that urges me so much, especially since the prince is absent and I do not yet know what he wants to change or abolish first. Meanwhile, Wolfgang Seitz approached me, intending to go to Strasbourg. He requested letters to be delivered to him there. I excused myself with many things, saying that I was too busy, only asking him to greet the brothers from me by name. When he returned, he brought with him a letter from Hedio to me, whom I believe wrote out of genuine modesty. For a long time ago, when I was studying in Freiburg im Breisgau, he was my servant. However, none of the others deemed me worthy of even the smallest greeting. Thus, we miserable people please ourselves. From this, it is easy to infer what ulcer oppresses them, unless someone is utterly insensitive. You can also gather from this what those Aristarchs and censors of all churches are still attempting and striving for, neglecting their own more than enough. For Bucer and Hedio often write secretly to our prince, as they think, without our knowledge. But what those things are, we cannot find out due to the prince's absence. We even suspect that the chancellor of the court is unaware of them. However, there are those among us who deliberately think that the prince, being wise, conceals these things and keeps everything until its due time.</p>
      <p>From Hedio's letter to me, we can certainly suspect, unless I am completely mistaken in any conjecture, however plausible, what particularly troubles them. Among other things, he writes to me: "Now that everything is strengthened by mutual assistance, I offer myself to you, if I can be of any service, which I will gladly do. And indeed, I owe it, for I remember how kindly you treated me, a servant, when we were in Freiburg. Now that the common profession of the gospel has made us brothers and one in Christ, the efforts are more ready" etc. And again: "The most illustrious Count Georg has embraced me with singular grace for several years now, for which reason I have dedicated some of Augustine's works to him. When he returns to you in Riquewihr and I can be of comfort or use to you, my host, in these regions, I will hasten to you. And I will conduct myself in such a way that you will recognize more and more each day that I seek the glory of God, public utility, and honesty" etc. To completely neglect and ignore such things, dearest brothers, with a deaf ear would not only be uncivil but also arrogant and disdainful - in my opinion - to reject or not be grateful for the help offered in such a difficult matter, which requires more than one Theseus. But I fear that one hand will offer me bread, the other a stone. Therefore, most sincere fathers and brothers in the Lord, since you understand that I am constrained by such difficulties, I demand support and advice from you, and that by a certain right of mine. For when I left you, if necessity required it, I promised to do so. You also pledged your faith to me, as someone less suitable for such a difficult province. You will therefore fulfill that promise if you satisfy my request and agree, which you owe not so much to me as to the entire church of Christ. For whose sake I ask you to expend a little effort. By this one act, you can do nothing more useful or more pleasing for its sheep and shepherds. I know it is very easy for you, provided you conspire with mutual assistance in such a pious, honest, necessary, and most worthy matter of your profession. But now finally accept the matter itself.</p>
      <p>I would like you to jointly write an ecclesiastical economy and dedicate it, not without urgent reasons, to Ulrich, Georg, and Christoph, the brothers and dukes of Württemberg and Teck, etc. I beseech you, most esteemed teachers and most beloved brothers, to bear with equanimity the crow cawing at you swans for a while. Indeed, to speak with Paul: Bear with my foolishness, as I attempt to bring water to the sea, wood to the forest. But you are not unaware of that old adage: Even a fool has sometimes spoken appropriately. Hence, made more confident, I hope you will listen to my childishness with fair ears and also take my audacity in good part, by which I have not hesitated to command you, though far inferior.</p>
      <p>In that economy, you will be able to briefly but effectively and powerfully indicate various errors, superstitions, and idolatries that are certainly more manifest than can be denied, which must be entirely removed. Also, the abuses of many things in the church, which need to be corrected. Afterward, where true religion lies, which ceremonies can be tolerated, which must be removed, which sacraments should be restored to their rightful possession as if by postliminium. And here, it will be possible to give an account of almost the entire accepted and changed religion. Nor do I think it should be omitted to show how pastors, teachers, readers, deacons, and moderators of public schools, as well as students, should be trained and nurtured. Again, into what uses the ecclesiastical goods should primarily and chiefly be converted, how the resources of colleges and monasteries should be used. And so that everything is shaved, at least the bishoprics, which they call parishes, are not entirely stripped. In sum: that the wealth of the churches is not spent on profane uses, but if anything can remain beyond the honest sustenance of bishops, deacons, and schoolmasters, it should be spent on libraries in suitable places or, which should have been mentioned first, on widows, orphans, wards, the sick, the elderly, and other unfortunate and poverty-stricken people - not, as is still done today among the most evangelical, to the great scandal and joy of the enemies of the gospel, to those who were once prodigal of themselves, today more rapacious than any harpies and such ill-fated and insatiable creatures and birds.</p>
      <p>O shepherds, shepherds feeding yourselves, devouring the fat with monastic bellies, neglecting the flock, weaving a pillow for every elbow, not sparing the flock so uniquely entrusted to you, indeed more than other wolves assaulting and dispersing, running with thieves and robbers, where it was least appropriate, louder than any Stentor, where it was appropriate, more mute than even the fish and enchanted dogs - where will you appear when the judge of the living and the dead comes to demand an account of your ministry and pastoral office?</p>
      <p>Surely then will be fulfilled what Christ predicted about the unfaithful steward: "Who, when he thought in his heart: 'My master delays his return' and began to beat the servants and maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the unfaithful or with the perfidious" etc.</p>
      <p>I would consider these things, dearest brothers in the Lord, to be far more necessary to be imposed on princes and certain cities, whether they like it or not, than what many of us are doing today - especially to those who have not yet defiled their hands with ecclesiastical goods more than any pitch, taught to be content with their own and therefore needing less those who are accustomed to plundering what is not theirs and always live in poverty, as the prophet says.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in that economy, it will be possible to indicate in passing what honor magistrates should have from clerics and vice versa clerics from magistrates, something which, in my judgment, has hitherto been neglected to the great detriment of the word, the inconvenience of the churches, finally to the scandal of all men and the almost irreparable loss of ecclesiastical, indeed even civil offices. Then magistrates and clerics should be reminded to remember their respective duties. What things they are appointed over should be set before their eyes, and finally, the common people should be taught what is proper for them to do.</p>
      <p>Indeed, whenever I read or otherwise recall in my mind those golden words of the apostles in Acts, which should be inscribed in golden letters on golden hearts: "It is not right for us to neglect the word of God to serve tables. Therefore, look for men to whom we will delegate this task. We will devote ourselves to prayer and the ministry of the word," I cannot but disapprove of the custom of those - I do not know whether more foolish or envious - people who today compel ministers of the word to any base and servile tasks. It is, by Hercules, the work of tyrants and enemies of evangelical truth to oppress letters, well-born talents, along with the word of God itself in this way; it is, I say, their work to banish ministers of the word to mines, military service, and other such heavy, indecorous, and dishonorable tasks.</p>
      <p>If the apostles considered the preaching of the word to be of such necessity and dignity that the care and diaconia of needy brothers, otherwise a most holy and supremely necessary ministry in the church of God, should yield to it, with what face does someone who wants to be considered a Christian magistrate attempt to drive men of such a holy profession to far more indecent, monstrous, and unworthy tasks? They should at least have considered their own experiences of war events and daily domestic affairs, the prosperous outcomes of all things, and such rich harvests, which have certainly made them more impoverished today than when they once lacked them, these, I say, they should have considered, if they wanted to neglect the outcomes and fortunes of Valens and Julian, the Roman Caesars, and even so, warned by their example, to repent of their wicked folly and implacable hatred of good letters and the servants of God. But where am I being carried away, most beloved brothers, or why do I burden you with so many words? The indignation of the matter and the fact that I hardly see anyone today who wants to oppose those new tyrants surpassing all Dionysius and Antiochus have certainly made me longer. Hence so many scandals, losses, and almost irreparable disasters everywhere, among all peoples and at all times. Unless we immediately counteract these, we must fear that much more atrocious and calamitous things threaten us, we who are devoted to the gospel, more than other men - and rightly so, because the servant who knows his master's will and does not do it will be beaten with many blows. As far as I can see, I can promise us nothing more certain than that if things continue this way, everything will eventually break, and by God's just judgment, everything will fall on our heads. May the Lord's will be done. Amen, amen.</p>
      <p>However, since I have once begun to be foolish with you, I am pleased to indulge my stomach. But I testify before God, the searcher of hearts, that I am uttering these things to you with no other mind than that which you have always known me to have, certainly seeking only that the glory of God may be promoted as widely as possible without our stumbling blocks and that people may understand that we seek not their wealth but the salvation of their souls. But I must return to the path.</p>
      <p>Are we not more miserable than all men, who are not only attacked with unheard-of insults for the preaching of the word by outsiders, which would be much more tolerable, but also by our own, whom we endure so many dangers to save, whom we wish well, whom we finally rescue at our own great loss from the hands of tyrants, from the jaws of wolves; this, indeed, is our reward. And it would not be enough if we were not also daily called to account in unjust places. But what am I saying, we are no longer called to account, except where the executioner holds the highest place of debate. How often are we condemned today without a hearing, so that it is enough just to accuse, there is no one to defend our cause. Indeed, on the contrary, there is no one who does not strive to become famous, illustrious by persecuting us, slandering us, and flaying us in a thousand ways. This is the only thing today, which, if managed excellently, can make one noble. Most have persuaded themselves that they have suffered an excessive loss of their lineage if they have not expelled and overthrown the word of God with its preachers and lovers from their borders. But these things are done among them for the most part, who have never heard anything about the kingdom of God; it is more to be lamented that they are somewhat more hostile to those who both hear and hate no less than a dog and a snake. And although they may dissemble for a long time, they nevertheless reveal themselves when the matter inclines to a military confrontation. For then it is possible to see and hear things we least expected from some. We alone are accused of being the authors of seditions and wars, we alone are called the contrivers of all calamities, we alone are attacked by all, and we alone are assailed, even when it was already time to join hands with the enemies - I speak from experience -, so that you would think that war was declared on us, not on them. I speak from experience. Finally, if it comes to the point where we must fight with the enemy, we are the first to be thrown to the enemies, where, for the sake of truth, we are mourned by our own as if they were singing a victory song rather than a lament, as if the enemies had done them a favor by cutting us into pieces in cruel and exceeding all beastly ferocity ways or making a spectacle of our corpses.</p>
      <p>O times, o morals, o ingratitude more than beastly, which will one day avenge itself! In my opinion, these things should have been corrected long ago. But the story was told to the deaf. For even among those who should not have done so, there were immediately those who interpreted true and Christ-worthy words as fear or flight or something of the sort. But oh, if only they, at least taught by their own many dangers and having experienced more than enough what calamities this foolish and inconsiderate rashness brings with it, to avoid saying anything harsher for the time being, would finally become wise and in the future prevent those perverse morals and rash minds from causing some greater evil one day!</p>
      <p>I, excellent fathers and brothers, will devote all my strength and my whole body to this, unless someone persuades me otherwise with sound reasons and arguments, that ministers of the word should be ministers, not cobblers, butchers, tailors, weavers, bird-catchers, peddlers, and if anything is viler than these, much less should they be tolerated to be executioners, soldiers, or in any way interested in military affairs. But I have already wearied you with too many words. Therefore, I will end my speech, lest I seem to be teaching Minerva or abusing your tolerance more than is fair. But I do not doubt that you will grant me pardon when you consider with what mind I have done this, certainly inclined and striving for this, that each one may finally be restored to his honor, and that everything in the church of God may be done in a just and decent order. May the best and greatest God grant it. Amen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is something else to be communicated to you, transcribed to me by Hedio. Whether it can affect or remind you, I certainly did not think it should be overlooked. It is as follows: "The diet is now being held in Schmalkalden, where, if I am not mistaken, the day of the convention will be named, in which Luther, Philipp, and the heroes of the scriptures of Upper Germany will meet, so that whatever dissensions there are may fall into oblivion, and this may be spread more diligently for the sake of piety to other nations" etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding these matters, most esteemed fathers and brothers in the Lord, if you have any information, make sure that I also learn about it, so that I may not be ignorant of how I should conduct myself.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily with your wives, children, and families.</p>
      <p>In Riquewihr, the day after Epiphany 1536.</p>
      <p>It will be beneficial for this ecclesiastical economy to be published not only in Latin but also in the German language.</p>
      <p>Write back, I beg you, with this messenger, so that I may know with the brothers what you have decided to do. Do not let us fall from our hope. For we are entirely dependent on you. All the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted little man</p>
      <p>Erasmus Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men in learning and piety, Heinrich Engelhart, Leo Jud, Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Batto N., Rudolf Dumysen, and [Nikolaus] Zeender, pastors and teachers of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed teachers and dearest brothers in Christ.</p>
