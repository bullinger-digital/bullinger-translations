    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter on May 22. In Biel, a ban on pensions, similar to that in Zurich, has finally been enacted; [Rudolf] Rebstock, one of the important [pension lords], will obey just like town clerk [Ludwig Sterner]. Received a report on the federal assembly in Schmalkalden; rejoices both over the piety of the Emperor (not over his support for the council location Mantua) and over the steadfastness of the princes. Bucer's negotiations with Luther lead to nothing; it is precisely the Swiss theologians who teach the simplicity demanded by them. Greetings; Johannes [Bullinger] should be spared from the bad peasants. May 30 marks the anniversary of the day he was released from captivity and, shaken by the loss of his parish office, came to Bullinger's house.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Dearest brother and most esteemed lord, I received with great joy the letter full of learning that you sent to me on the 22nd of May; having read it, I feel and see your sincere faith towards me, to which I will strive to respond as best as I can.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, dearest brother, rejoice and celebrate with us, the heavy and unbearable burden not only on our holy religion but also on our faithful homeland (the payment of private pensions) has been lifted from our shoulders, and on the 22nd of April, it was completely prohibited by oath not only in the city but also in the countryside, almost in the manner of the people of Zurich, etc. Among them, our [Rudolf] Rebstock was not the least; but that man was so moderate that he neither opposed nor responded to our initiatives (and God knows, it was a serious, severe matter), just as our town clerk [Ludwig Sterner] and his kind obey the magistrate's word and decree.</p>
      <p>Then, on the 29th of April, the matter from Schmalkalden reached us, presented to us by the magistrate as soon as possible. Having read and described the entire matter, I am indeed pleased with the Emperor's piety (though not with the designated location Mantua) and the steadfastness of the princes, not only towards the Emperor but also towards the Pope and their fellow bishops.</p>
      <p>I place Bucer with Luther separately; they consider us and our churches as nothing. For who has treated this matter so simply, not only in writing but also in teaching, as the leaders of our churches? But let it remain, etc. By simple: The announcement is made that one understands poorly and simply: right, truly, and without any embellishment, as the truth is and his will, etc. And so as not to detain you longer with Bucer (for you know my mind towards him; I wish I could believe otherwise), farewell!</p>
      <p>Greet your dearest wife and mother in my name, and my esteemed brothers. Greet your brother, equally my brother, Johannes in my name, whom may He, whose cause he serves, defend from the worst peasants; I say the worst, for the number of good ones is not large.</p>
      <p>On the 30th of May, a year will have passed since I was released from prison and stood at your door at the 10th hour, knocking, and found you dining, not without great pain and sorrow in my heart, not because of rejection from a benefit, which I had always wished for years before, but for a better condition. But thus it pleased the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, dearest brother. As I have always said, so I say now: I commend myself to your faith and charity.</p>
      <p>Given in Biel, on the 25th of May, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Peter.</p>
      <p>To my especially trusted, dear lord and brother, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, by hand.</p>
