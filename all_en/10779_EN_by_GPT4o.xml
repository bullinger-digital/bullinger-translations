    <p xml:id="regest1">According to [Peter] Im Haag and [Jakob] Vogt, the Bernese army has occupied [Morges] and taken three ships from [Gian Battista de' Medici], the brother of the Castellan of Musso; the latter is said to be recruiting mercenaries in Piedmont. The Bernese, whose report from the field camp arrived in Bern on February 1st, will probably now advance on Peney. He asks for news about the day [in Basel] and expresses his astonishment that the Zurichers, contrary to Bullinger's announcement, together with seven [Catholic] places, have asked Bern to wait another eight days; however, the letter arrived too late.</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings and willing service always ready beforehand.</p>
      <p>Especially gracious lord, it has been truthfully reported to me by [Peter] Im Haag and [Jakob] Vogt that our lord's army, which is on its way to Geneva, has forcibly conquered a small town; some have then surrendered willingly, and also in the conquered town, a number of people were killed, and the enemy retreated. The Castellan of Musso is also not yet out, but his brother is. Our people have captured three ships on the lake and driven them away: the large ship, which they call a galley, on which he had worked for so long and placed his trust, and then the two smaller ones, in which they found such a great amount of provisions that it is hard to believe. I suppose he might have intended to supply the town, which did not want to surrender, with food and defend himself there, but they quickly cut off his path, etc. The report is that the Musso man himself is still in Piedmont and is recruiting mercenaries. Their intention is, once they have conquered this, to move further to the castle of Peney, which is beyond Geneva, where the bandits are lying, who have so far caused the Genevans such great harm. The letter containing this news was written to our gracious lords from the camp and arrived in Bern on Tuesday around two o'clock. You may happily say that.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, gracious, dear lord, I ask you to let me know, through this messenger, what news you have, and likewise, what your messengers have brought from the day. I am also greatly surprised by your previous writing, which I understood to mean that your messengers, on the previous day, had received instructions not to agree to anything, but only to listen and bring it back. But now they, together with Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug, Fribourg, and the Solothurners, have written to my lords from the previous day and earnestly requested and urged them to stand by their intention and not to withdraw, and if they do not do so, to delay for only eight days, so they want to see if they can find something good in between. And if any delay occurs from my gracious lords, Geneva would have perished in those eight days. The letter was left behind when they wanted to leave the city of Bern on Saturday. The answer and the rest among the citizens: If God helps them home again, they will answer them, etc.</p>
      <p>Entrusted to God at all times.</p>
      <p>Given in Illnau, Friday after Candlemas in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Your always good friend and benefactor Sulpitius Haller, Vogt of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word and the church in the greater Zurich, his good friend and gracious lord.</p>
