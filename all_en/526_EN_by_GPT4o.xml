      <p>Grace and peace from God. The good, dear man came yesterday while I was not at home, but was in front of the city, and waited for me until night, when I finally came home. Today until 9 o'clock I am occupied with preaching, so I cannot deal with matters. After 9, I requested an answer from Mr. Mayor; he said that he and the other Mr. Mayor (as it is) only returned home the day before yesterday and therefore cannot deal with matters; but tomorrow or Saturday they will finally give a decision; then it must be presented to the council. Therefore, I am sending this messenger now on the way to eat, and as soon as the answer is given, I will send a special messenger and not delay at all; then I also want to respond properly to your and Mr. Mayor's letter.</p>
      <p>The messengers have returned home from the countryside; they bring a unanimous answer, having nothing to do with princes and lords, remaining with God and His word, etc.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, and your brother being here, I received a letter from you concerning a German lord, etc., as you know. I ask you not to be angry with me and to trust me, what I can do for you and yours, whom I know, I will do with loyalty, but I will not burden myself with strangers whom I do not know; for some penitents have been kindly received here, who behave in a way that harms other innocents; their conduct is contrary to good customs, gambling, swearing badly, wearing torn, extravagant clothes, rarely and as much as not going to church, etc., following the French and behaving not like exiled Christians, but like wanton people. Some of them have not been loyal to you either; it is indeed going very much like this. Therefore, do not be angry with me; I want to distance myself from these people.</p>
      <p>But what I can do for people who are honestly exiled and loyal, I will do. But I will first test the spirits, whether they are from God, and I will not believe just anyone.</p>
      <p>Consider this well and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 21st of May, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Greet your brother and the whole family.</p>
      <p>Yours as always.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and good friend Mr. Ambrosius Blarer or Mr. Thomas Blarer in Griesenberg.</p>
      <p>1549. 22nd of May by Arbogast.</p>
