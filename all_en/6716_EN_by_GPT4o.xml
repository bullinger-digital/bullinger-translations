      <p>Greetings in Christ. Although I have written to you at length in recent days, most reverend father, yet, as certain matters have arisen in which I greatly need your judgment, I thought it would not be inappropriate to write again. These are matters of such a nature that I do not doubt you can easily resolve them due to your extensive knowledge of all things. 1. First, I would like to know whether those Christians who today live scattered in Greece, Asia, Syria, Armenia, etc., use those private masses which are now universally accepted in papism, and what kind of masses, private or public, the Greeks today in Venice are accustomed to use. 2. Then, when a certain Camotensis is sometimes cited, who wrote more bitterly about the life and insolence of the popes, who was this Camotensis, of what order, and of what times and people was he. 3. Finally, what do you think about the German council, which they say was once held under Charlemagne against the Second Council of Nicaea concerning images; for there are those who confidently deny that any such council ever existed. I ask you by your piety, do not think me insolent for asking you these things, especially from so far away; for you alone now remain as almost the sole oracle of the churches. If you respond by the next fair, it will be sufficient; but I earnestly ask you to do so.</p>
      <p>Again and again, farewell, most reverend father and most esteemed lord in Christ. Salisbury, March 10, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, John Jewel, Englishman. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
