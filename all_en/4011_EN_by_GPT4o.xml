      <p>Greetings. What you wrote in your letter on June 26 about England and Scotland, I have also received from others, that the Catholics have suffered a defeat in Scotland and that great persecutions are being prepared in France. The Lord will turn everything to the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has given a response to the Protestants, stating that he wishes to uphold the article of religion concerning peace, as was established in the assembly of 1555; in other matters, he will not allow any changes in religion, in which he will persist, as he has been educated thus far. As for the council, he does not consider it his duty nor does he think it pertains to him to give conditions; however, he will strive to ensure that all are heard and that consideration is given to those things which are said justly and modestly. The Elector Palatine is in Augsburg to receive the investiture of the electorate.</p>
      <p>If the master sends me the letters he received concerning the sponsorship, about which he complained to you, I will ensure that it can be resolved shortly, and I will not forget what you previously wrote about his other business. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends and keep the son in your care. Solothurn, July 4.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church.</p>
