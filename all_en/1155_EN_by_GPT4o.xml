      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received two letters sent by you and I give immense thanks for the gift sent to my wife. If I continue to trade like this, I will soon have immense wealth; this is to have favorable Mercury and the fortune of the Fuggers. But I do not want to give you any more gifts if you wish to continue in this way. But this is a joke aside. They say a new army has been gathered in the northern region, in the Halberstadt area and Hildesheim.</p>
      <p>However, part of that army is ravaging Saxony. Furthermore, you know that Duke Georg of Mechelen was captured along with other nobles and taken to Magdeburg; what they intend to decide about them, I do not know. The impious enemies should be destroyed, not preserved, in the Swiss manner. It is strange what these good men think, that they have preserved the ravager and killer of peasants in their own land. I fear they may provoke God, just as Saul did, who was ordered to destroy the impious king but preserved the impious enemy.</p>
      <p>This new army has issued a certain document, which I have not yet seen. I took care of your letters, which were inscribed, through our courier. In the Württemberg region, they are trying to enlist an army, but they cannot find soldiers. The Emperor is surprised at how this can be; he wrote to Prince Christoph.</p>
      <p>The prince replied that it was not so easy for him to live in the region with soldiers leaving among the enemies; if he first transported foreign soldiers to another place, perhaps he could find soldiers, and indeed strong ones. Nor do the cities of Saxony provide soldiers to the captains, except for the cheap and ragged ones. We will see some wonders in the coming spring. Farewell. January 17, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor in the church of Zürich, his esteemed teacher.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
