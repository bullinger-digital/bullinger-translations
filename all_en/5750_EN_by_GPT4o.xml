      <p>Greetings. The living letters, my mother, Blasius, and my daughter, his wife, are coming to you; therefore, there is no need for me to trouble you with more words.</p>
      <p>Blasius is escorting my mother there so that, while he still has leisure, he may visit you, thank you for the benefits received, and confirm the friendship initiated through letters with his presence.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I commend him to you.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I received your letters written on May 24th. Attached to them were not only those for Mr. Steiger, but also others that pertained to Mr. von Mülinen.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I sent them back to Baden to him (for he is bathing there with his family).</p>
      <p>I took care of those that were being sent from Poland to Mr. Calvin.</p>
      <p>What you wrote to Steiger about Sultzer, you did well; he will diligently watch that nothing is attempted, even if he comes here, and I do not think he will try anything here, unless perhaps privately among his own, whom he knows.</p>
      <p>The Lord will eventually catch him in his schemes and confound him.</p>
      <p>I would gladly wish, for this reason, that you would also allow yourself to be persuaded to come to us; for thus his schemes would be greatly weakened.</p>
      <p>Blasius will report some things about the French.</p>
      <p>They now say it was false, what was recently affirmed as certain about the conflict at Orléans.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I do not know what to write or what to believe; however, as far as I can understand and judge, the affairs of the faithful are not well: our allies are dismissing their troops; the rest are retaining and even increasing theirs.</p>
      <p>I wrote recently about our affairs in Savoy. They greatly distress me, and I fear (I confide this to you) a serious dissension among the citizens: some will want to return something, others will not, and each party would like us to be on their side and would seem to have won if we supported them.</p>
      <p>But I do not involve myself, except as far as religion is concerned; there I diligently exhort that its primary consideration be maintained, lest we sin against God and make Him our enemy while we wish to make men our friends.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, I would not care if they restored everything they have to the prince, provided Christ would reign; but since I see both are connected, I cannot help but be concerned.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I know there are those who watch us, so that eventually, if any disturbances arise, they can blame us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the utmost caution is needed; pray with us, I beseech you, that the Lord may grant it to us with the moderation that is fitting.</p>
      <p>All friends and brothers greet you, especially Steiger, Diesbach, Musculus, etc., as well as my father-in-law and Haller the treasurer with Gravenried.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, most excellent one.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 2, 1563.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, forever yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
