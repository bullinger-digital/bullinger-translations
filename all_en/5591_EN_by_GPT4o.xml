      <p>Greetings. I received your letters today through Froschauer and along with them, those which your brother transcribed and sent to me in your name. I thank you for these. In return, I am sending to your brother some notes, in which the names and numbers of the slain and captured are partly contained. Otherwise, we have nothing at all now, except that a rumor has been brought, which disturbs me, if it were true, which I cannot believe, that Adrien has defected to the opposing side. I await what more you will write and send through our courier, who has set out to you these days. I sent through him what the surviving captains have written to the 7 Cantons. I am now sending the session of Trent, which was held long ago, but which I have not yet seen published; I do not know if you have seen it. I pray that you send back the copy; for it is not mine. Many wonder why you trouble yourself so much in responding to Brenz, when he hardly seems worthy of a response. But I pray to the Lord, that He may supply you with long-lasting strength for the defense and protection of the truth. I can neither say nor have more now. I will send yours to Geneva today or tomorrow; for there are those here through whom I can conveniently do this.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>All friends and brothers greet you, especially your father-in-law, mother, and the whole family.</p>
      <p>I know that Steiger and Diesbach have received your letters, although I have not yet been able to speak with them today.</p>
      <p>In Bern, January 18, which is my birthday, 1563. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
