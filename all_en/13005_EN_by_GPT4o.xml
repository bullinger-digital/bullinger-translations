    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Tscharner and Blasius hereby send the promised city view of Chur to the printer [Christoph Froschauer] and ask for his understanding regarding the delayed delivery, for which they are not to blame. Thanks to the support of the Chur council, which will cover any additional costs, the veduta has now been completed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Chur council has just received news from Feldkirch that Emperor Charles V is moving with his army to Bregenz and Feldkirch to attack Lindau, Constance, and then also Basel and Bern. In Italy, it is still quiet, except for reports of a military campaign by [Gian Giacomo de' Medici, Castellan of Musso] heading there. Time will tell what he intends to accomplish there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] [The Zurich] Mayor Johannes Haab is currently in Fideris, and Blasius suspects that the Chur councilors will visit him and invite him to Chur.</p>

However, it has now been completed with the knowledge, favor, and consent of our gracious lords; they have also promised to cover any additional costs that may arise, etc.</p>

      <p>Recently, my lords have received written news from Feldkirch that the Emperor is moving with his army to Bregenz and Feldkirch, intending to attack Lindau, Constance, and then Basel and Bern, etc. In Italy, it is still quiet, except that some say the Castellan of Musso is heading there with an army. What he intends to achieve there, time will reveal.</p>
