      <p>My friendly service to you beforehand.</p>
      <p>Honorable, well-learned, dear godfather. Although I had completely resolved not to burden myself with any dealings in these dangerous times, in such a way that I wanted to learn about the rumors currently circulating among the five places and report them to my lord, considering that in past times true warnings were not only ignored but also rebelliously scorned; now, however, the zeal for the fatherland compels me to report this matter, which seems to me nothing other than a rebellious trick (by which the wickedness is unchecked and the pious are oppressed). Namely, the matter: I went to Blyggenstorff today, to visit the vineyards and presses, where I happened to meet a trusted fellow from Baar, who told me they had unrest and a watch last night; the reason for this watch was told to him by a member of the council, saying that they had received a letter of warning from the lords of Zurich, advising them to be very careful, as they might no longer master their own people. And this same council member said to him: "Summer goat's suffering, we have now received enough warning, since an authority warns us, we have enough right to be on guard; if they do not want peace, it is better we attack them than be surprised by them." This fellow also told me they are drawing all sorts of conclusions from this warning. Some say: "Those in the city fear the community will fall upon them, and to have peace, they want to direct us against the countryside again."</p>
      <p>I did not want to withhold this from you as a true watchman, to act upon it according to your judgment and the course of events. I am not writing to anyone else; there are many people so corrupt or inclined to the corrupt that no one knows behind whom he is safe. Let me, if something should happen, be entrusted to you according to my trust. With that, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Dated Monday late after the Exaltation of the Cross 1532.</p>
      <p>Peter Simler.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and godfather.</p>
