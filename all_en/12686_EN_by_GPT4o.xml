    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frölich received Bullinger's letter from October 11 [not received] on the 22nd, but not through the announced Marx Wydler and his companion [...], but through Claudius [Pius] Peutinger. Frölich does not know why the people from Zurich did not show up. He would have welcomed them kindly, even if he could not have helped them [to any employment as mercenaries] during this winter time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He has a lot to do. Therefore, Bullinger does not need to thank him so much for the late and hasty replies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] God is helping the [Schmalkaldic League] quite well in this war imposed on them. The enemies could not deprive the Germans of their freedom. Although they barely got out of Bavaria (where they had instigated the war) and did not engage in any open battle, they suffered three times more losses during the skirmishes than the [Schmalkaldic League]. Their plan to move to the Rhine also failed. Now both armies are lying close to each other near Brenz, a day's journey from Augsburg. Daily, the [Schmalkaldic League] provokes Emperor [Charles V] to attack. However, he does not want to fight, remains entrenched, and intends to exhaust the [Schmalkaldic League] financially. However, his money will also run out eventually, especially since the revenues from the islands of Peru, among others, are declining. Frölich is therefore confident. At the latest, when one of the armies withdraws, there will be losses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The French King [Francis I] and the English [Henry VIII] are making promising offers to the [Schmalkaldic League], which, however, should not be trusted. Nevertheless, this intimidates the enemy...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It is also said that the [Protestant] Swiss Confederates will go to war against the clergy. And although it has not yet come to that, this also instills fear in the enemy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] On October 16, many notable Spaniards were killed, and an Italian named Hannibal Guerini was captured. He now provides good information, presumably because he would have defected voluntarily anyway. He reports that the Emperor wants to defeat the [Schmalkaldic League] by postponing the battle; that he is not ready for a battle; that Pope [Paul III] no longer wants to give him money, and that the Emperor greatly regrets his undertaking. He is also said to plan to winter in [Southern Germany].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] A few days ago, it was initially said that the Emperor had all the inhabitants of Donauwörth killed. Soon, however, it was learned that this was false, as the city was not taken by force but through the betrayal of the mayors [Paul Mair and Johann Bucher], and consequently, the population was spared.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] For tactical reasons, the [Schmalkaldic League] neither occupied nor defended the small towns of Dillingen, Lauingen, and Höchstädt. All of these surrendered voluntarily and will be just as easy to recapture as they were given up. They are of no strategic importance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The people of Augsburg and their military are in good spirits. Frölich also has nothing to reproach himself for in this dangerous war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] It is good that Bullinger is writing about the [“Difference between the Old and New Faith”]. However, the work should not be dedicated to Frölich, but to a more suitable person. Through the friendship already shown, Bullinger has bound himself to Frölich so much that he could never satisfy him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Meanwhile, the son [Hans] of Hans Vogler [the Elder] is working with Frölich. The boy can write beautifully and elegantly and is also quite good in Latin. Frölich will support him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Greetings to the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], to [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Konrad] Pellikan, [Konrad] Gessner, Vogler [the Elder], and to all who are well-disposed towards Frölich. May Bullinger's family fare well.</p>

      <p>S. If anything has ever been pleasant to me, it is the paper marked by your fingers, which you sent to me on October 11 and I received on the 22nd, not through Marx Wydler or his companions, as you mentioned, but through Doctor Claudius Peuttinger. However, I do not know why those good people from Zurich did not meet me. If they had approached me, I would have been kind to them, even if I could not have helped them, as the approaching winter would have certainly been a great hindrance.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>There is no need to thank me for my writing, as I write to you more slowly and carelessly than the law of friendship demands, and if the turbulent times did not excuse me, there would be no escape left. However, you, with your innate skill and love for me, are accustomed to bearing all my shortcomings with equanimity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The almighty and benevolent God, who cannot do wrong, is also managing our war, which we are forced into, quite well. Although we have not achieved more so far, the godless enemies have been thwarted in their plan to destroy the freedom of the German nation. They have not yet come more than five miles out of Bavaria, where they instigated this treacherous uprising, and have moved from one place and advantageous position to another, never engaging in open battle, much less have they ever committed to any battle, but they have skirmished and always suffered threefold losses, while we, thank God, have not suffered even a single one. It is also evident that the enemy would have gladly strayed, either through Franconia or Swabia, to the Rhine, which has always been denied to him. Now both armies are again lying very close together near Brenz (which is six miles from here, a day's journey). Our forces daily give cause for battle with shooting and cavalry and infantry raids. But he lies buried like a badger, unwilling to come out, and is finally intent on exhausting us financially. But that will also be a challenge for him, as the islands of Peru, etc., are no longer cash cows. I am of the comforting hope and confidence in God that the matter will soon come to a good end for us. For when one side must yield to the other in the field, there will be losses in the retreat.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The French and English are offering excellent terms. However, these are matters of nations in which we place no trust. Yet the enemy knows this and it brings him great fear.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It is said here that the Swiss Confederates will march out and attack the clergy. This also frightens the opposing side, even if it is not yet the case.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>On the 16th day of this month, our forces killed many notable Spaniards and captured an Italian named Hannibal Guerini alive. He provides good information about the enemy's plans. For I believe he defected to us of his own accord. Among other things, he indicates that the Emperor will not fight, but will want to wait us out. He is also not prepared for a battle against us. Also, the Pope no longer wants to give money. Also, the Emperor regrets having started this game. Also, the Emperor will want to winter in these lands, etc.</p>

      <p>A few days ago, it was reported that the Emperor had all the people, young and old, killed at Donauwörth, etc. This is not the case at all, for it was taken not by force, but through the betrayal of the mayors; therefore, everyone was spared.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Thus, Dillingen, Lauingen, and Höchstädt were not occupied or defended for good reasons, and therefore everything surrendered willingly. And these are small towns that can be recaptured just as easily as they were abandoned. The main thing is of no importance.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>We are here in this city and also our military forces are all (praise be to the Lord) upright and comforted. And my heart tells me, even though I am a sinner, that there is nothing very burdensome in this most dangerous, burdensome war.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I gladly and eagerly hear you describe the difference between the old and new faith. However, you will not choose anyone more worthy to dedicate this work to than me. For besides the fact that you love me too much, you have otherwise bound yourself to me so much that you hold me captive forever with the best right, as I can never repay you with either services or gratitude. Therefore, may the Lord of all things repay you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>The son of Johannes Vogler, a truly respectable man, is now working with me during the day; I diligently provide him with my instruction and see that the young man is not unfit for the use of writing. He knows how to write moderately in Latin. He also paints the most elegant characters. Therefore, he gives me great hope for a successful advancement. If I can help him in any way, I will not delay.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Farewell and convey my greetings to the mayors, the city clerk, Gwalther, Bibliander, Pellican, Gessner, Vogler, and all who are well-disposed towards Laetus. May your house especially be safe and sound.</p>
    </div>

      <p>You may share these writings with whomever you wish. October 23, 1546. Yours, Georgius Laetus, etc.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of Zurich, a friend like a brother.</p>
