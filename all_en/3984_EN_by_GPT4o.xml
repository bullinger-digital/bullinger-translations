      <p> Greetings. I am sending letters to the postmaster, which I believe are for the settlement of the debt, about which I had written, having been reminded by you, so that it may be released by surety. I told his son that I would ensure the post is safe for him, yet I will not neglect anything. I have received that the state of religion in England is, by the decree of the parliament and the queen, in the same condition as it was during the time of Edward. I hope to see you soon. </p>
      <p> In the meantime, farewell and greet our mutual friends. Solothurn, 6th of June. </p>
      <p> Yours. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
