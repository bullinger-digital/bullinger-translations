      <p>Greetings. I received your letter dated August 24th, to which I will respond briefly. First, regarding Musculus, we need not fear that he will go to England, no matter how much he is solicited; for as long as he can set foot among the Germans, he will not go to foreign nations, and wisely so, because he is burdened with a large family and sees that in England everything is still quite rough and unrefined, and not very suitable for good men. He has recovered again from his stomach ailment and is well with all his family. As for Vergerius, he returned to us the day before yesterday from Lausanne, where the plague is breaking out again; he is printing some things here against the council, about which he will tell you himself; for in the meantime, while these are being published, he plans to travel to you and then to Basel.</p>
      <p>I spoke to him about England; but he replied that if he were already in England, it would be more beneficial for the English and other churches for him to come to these parts near Trent than to remain there, so that he could more effectively resist the council. Therefore, I see that this plan does not yet please him. As far as I understand, he would like to have an annual stipend from the King of England, so that he would not be a burden to our people and could conduct his affairs, indeed Christ's, more freely. If you could do something about this, it would certainly seem to be in his and our interest. For I hardly think he will obtain any position in Lausanne; the French will not allow it. Furthermore, it will be troublesome for our lords to pay him an extraordinary stipend continuously; they are very burdened by the influx of foreigners and travelers. Try something, if you please. It is not worth the effort to recommend him to our senate from you; for they already resent that so many are sent by you, while you do not receive any foreigners, but impose them all on us.</p>
      <p>As for that Mauricius, I do not know him by face, as I think. Beza reported this to you. I think I also wrote about it.</p>
      <p>I will diligently inquire about everything and think about a remedy. We have many such cases, especially among the French, and it is not possible to bring everything into order, for if mention of this matter were made either among my fellow ministers or in the senate, that Mauricius would immediately be supported by everyone, so great is the hatred of Calvin: his name is so odious here. Therefore, it is better to take another approach. I have already written to the classis (church assembly) in Gex, in which he is, to admonish him to peace and that if he has anything against Calvin, he should not act on his own but inform us, and we will consider what and how to act, so that he does not stir up trouble with private authority, etc.</p>
      <p>I have not yet sent you the letters for the reason that today Jodocus is leaving here to go to Geneva and will take the son of Mr. Jacob Rordorff from Zurich there.</p>
      <p>If those brothers happen to meet him, (as that classis is not far from Geneva), I know they would arm themselves against Calvin. For he is so hostile to him that when I advised him three days ago to visit Calvin when he goes to Geneva and greet him on my behalf, he indignantly replied that he is not going to Geneva because of Calvin and has no business with Calvin, etc. And when I began to reason with him, he concluded the discussion: I will not see Calvin, he said, let him conduct his affairs, I conduct mine.</p>
      <p>And when I added: But he will take it badly, he said, Let him, what is it to me? Given these circumstances, how do you hope that either Mauricius can be reconciled with Calvin, or Zebedee with Viret? There is also a peculiar disposition of this people which makes the way of dealing with them very different from that with the Germans. They are very tenacious of their purposes, they do not want to forgive anything, everyone wants to pursue their own right, and they do not allow themselves to be reconciled with another unless the other prostrates himself on the ground and allows himself to be trampled underfoot and is willing to hear, as Friedrich from the pope over the asp and basilisk, etc. Viret is a good man, but so stubborn that he gives nothing of his own. Therefore, I do not see how these dissensions can be better removed than by delay and private admonitions, which I certainly do not spare on both sides. Viret sent me letters sent to him from England, which I also send to you on the condition that you return them quickly. I also send a copy of a letter from Claudius Monerius, who is imprisoned in Lyon for the gospel of Christ, which he himself sent to all our churches, so that prayers may be made for him. There are also two other young men, whom Viret's hatred expelled from Lausanne and deprived of our lords' stipend, captured in Lyon, Corbelius and Januarius, whom you will also commend to the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else new now, except that Schertlius is still acting at the king's court; I do not know what he is doing. You have probably already heard from Beza or will hear from Vergerius about the French protest against the council. Spare me, I beg you; I wrote hastily and amidst great occupations, and I do not have time to reread. Greet all the brothers and your whole household on my behalf; my wife greets you.</p>
      <p>Bern, the last day of August 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
