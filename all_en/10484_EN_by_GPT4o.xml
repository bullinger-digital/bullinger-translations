Has explained the otherwise inexpressible topic elsewhere as simply as possible, without delving into individual sophistries and blasphemies of the heretics. The best response to their arguments is a clear presentation of the simple truth. The essence of God is unfathomable. With Jesus Sirach, Bullinger urges to remain humble and not to be tempted by Satan into verbal disputes.</p>

      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to all ministers of the word preaching Christ throughout the region of Zürich.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Here you have, dear brothers and fellow ministers, our assertion printed, which I recited at our renowned assembly on the Feast of Saints Felix and Regula (in the Großmünsterstift) and which you so eagerly desired to be published in many copies for the benefit of the brothers and churches. I have complied with your requests. Meanwhile, see how well you have advised and how happily you enjoy the work of others. I have certainly explained this magnificent and otherwise inexpressible matter in a simple manner, leaving aside those subtleties and imaginary tricks. For I see that even in sacred matters, these are taught as simply as possible and received with unrefined faith. Therefore, I did not respond to every argument, objection, and blasphemy of the heretics. For to clearly propose or explain the simple truth is to have responded to the arguments of the heretics that support falsehood. And this discussion is about the essence of God, which no human can easily explain. For it is rightly said that a comprehensible God is not God. It is proper for God to be incomprehensible. It is also rightly said that those who wish to conceive and express the essence of God as it is, measure the abyss with the palm. How much more prudently did Ecclesiasticus advise, saying: "Do not seek what is too difficult for you, and do not search into what is beyond your strength. But think always of what God has commanded you, and do not be curious about his many works. For it is not necessary for you to see with your eyes what is hidden" [Sir 3, 21-23]. Let us, I say, consider these things, O brothers, and be engaged in them. It is our duty to instill the clemency, goodness, truth, omnipotence, wisdom, and justice of God, to commend the mystery of Christ, the merit of his redemption, and the power of faith, and also to urge the pursuit of charity and innocence. Satan intends to divert us from these to verbal battles, indeed, to the scrutiny of the most curious and hidden matters. Therefore, he provides ample material for contention, namely, that neglecting these necessary and useful things, we direct all our efforts, words, and deeds to verbal battles. Let us therefore be vigilant, sober, prudent, pious, faithful, constant in truth, and diligent, continually praying to the Lord, that with well-conducted affairs, we may one day see Him as He is, along with the entire church, over which He has appointed us.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, farewell and love the churches entrusted to you.</p>
      <p>Zürich, in the month of October, in the year 1534.</p>
