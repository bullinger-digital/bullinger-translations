    <p xml:id="regest1">That Bullinger does not despair of the conversion of the [Five Places] is proof of his Christian love - charitas -, which hopes for everything; however, the Roman Antichrist tries by all means to keep this people loyal to him on his side; this Babylonian whore possessed by unclean spirits will soon be punished; [Zurich] and Bern are meanwhile rightly trying to unite the minds of their comrades with themselves and the truth of Christ, or at least not to alienate them even more. Musculus shares Bullinger's opinion about the "Conjectures [on the Last Times]" by [Andreas] Osiander; through a doctor [Andreas Aurifaber], Musculus has heard that people even burst into laughter about it in Wittenberg; Osiander, a rather learned man, is mainly concerned with pleasing himself; he loves to engage with peculiar topics; yet we are also humans with their flaws; happy is the one who is hardly affected by it; [meanwhile] love - charitas -, which hopes for everything, also endures everything; a preacher from the area of Ulm, [Johannes] Piscatorius [alias Fischer], liked this work so much that he translated it into German and sent it to Augsburg for printing; Musculus has spoken out against the printing, as probably will the mayor [Georg Herwart]. Musculus received a letter from Joseph Macarius the day before, in which he reports with great relief the receipt of the letters from Bullinger and [Paul] Fagius [to Melanchthon] forwarded to him in Wittenberg; he had lost the letters on the way to [Johannes] Brenz between Augsburg and Schw채bisch Hall. Musculus thanks for the sent book ["Antiquissima fides et vera religio"]; he is pleased to read it and lend it to others; may Bullinger continue to carefully preserve God's gifts in him. Musculus will forward the shipment to Adam Bartholom채us. Greetings to family and colleagues. Bullinger's greetings were conveyed to Peutinger; he also sends his regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings. That you do not despair of the conversion and salvation of the confederates, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, is a sign of Christian love, which hopes for all things, even those that seem impossible to human reason. Nor do I despair that Christ will be glorified among them as well.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, however, I grieve over their blindness, and what I hope for, I earnestly wish for. I do not doubt, as you write, that the Roman Antichrist is striving with all his might to keep this people, who are particularly loyal to him, by any means possible. But it is written: "Cursed is the man who trusts in man" [Jeremiah 17:5]. Without a doubt, this cursed seat and unclean whore Babylon, the dwelling of demons and the prison of every unclean spirit - to which the Holy Spirit threatens certain ruin in more than one place - will soon experience its fate. Meanwhile, with your prudence, piety, and humanity, you and the people of Bern rightly and piously strive to attract the minds of dissenting and opposing allies to the truth of Christ and a fuller union, or at least not to alienate them further. May the Lord give increase to your and other pious people's labors and bring it about that soon this whole people may be united not only by external and secular bonds but also by the bonds of the same faith and piety, and may open its bosom as a refuge for the members of Christ fleeing in these most evil and dangerous times. Amen.</p>
      <p>I share your opinion about Osiander's conjectures. In Wittenberg, as I heard yesterday from a learned physician, they were even laughed at. This otherwise quite learned man is more pleased with himself than he is approved by good men. He is particularly delighted with rare and exquisite things, especially his own inventions; but we are also men and suffer from other vices; the best man is he who is burdened with the least. That love, which hopes for all things, also endures all things. Such minds are usually troubled by peculiar vices. A certain Piscatorius, a minister of Christ in the Ulm region, approved of these conjectures so much that he translated them into German and sent them here to be printed; I did not want to allow the printing in my judgment and therefore referred it to the mayor's decision, who is very difficult in admitting these editions. Yesterday I received letters from Joseph Macarius, in which he writes that he received your letters and those of Paul Fagius and presented them to Lord Philip; for he had lost them on the journey between Augsburg and Schw채bisch Hall, when he was going to Brenz; they were found and given to me to send to Wittenberg. He writes that he was extremely anxious and disturbed about these letters and again, when he received them enclosed in mine, he was as if raised from the dead.</p>
      <p>For the booklet you sent, I thank your kindness. I am very pleased with the subject, and I do not doubt that you have explained everything skillfully and with profit; I will read it diligently and give it to others to read. You continue diligently in defending the truth with the gifts given to you by the Lord.</p>
      <p>What is addressed to M. Adam Bartholom채us, I will faithfully send to him. Farewell with all your household and church, my dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Greet all your fellow ministers very affectionately in my name. Augsburg, 1544, September 19.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I conveyed your greetings to Mr. Peutinger in your name, who in turn sends his heartfelt greetings to you.</p>
      <p>To the most renowned theologian and most faithful minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, most esteemed lord and brother. In Zurich.</p>
