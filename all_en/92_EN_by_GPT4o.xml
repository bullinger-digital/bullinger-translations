    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer can hardly report anything. He thanks Bullinger for the Christian care he shows to the people of Konstanz. Although the people of Zurich face no lesser dangers than those of Konstanz, they are at least not as imminent. May God protect the people of Zurich!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">The delegation from Konstanz, summoned by Emperor Charles V to Augsburg but not yet departed, includes former mayor Thomas Blarer, guild master Peter Labhart, and Hieronymus Hürus. The latter, according to a letter from Bullinger [not preserved], got into trouble with some people [N.N.] during his visit to the Zurich [marksmen's festival] last summer but emerged unscathed. Despite his young age, he is proficient in Latin, Greek, Italian, and several other languages. The delegation will likely depart within eight days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Bullinger, along with the entire Zurich church, should fervently pray that the envoys, with God's help, gain the favor of the Emperor, especially since he wishes to appear particularly gracious. Only God can relieve the people of Konstanz from the impending, unbearable burden or make it more bearable. May His will be done, and may the people of Konstanz not miss out on eternal life! This earthly life is short and transient, but the difficult path to eternal life can only be overcome by trusting in God and with His help.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The Emperor's efforts [to subjugate the empire] are more than evident from his previous undertakings. It is [solely] up to God to reject the decisions of the princes and the plans of the peoples according to His discretion. Bullinger's assumptions [not preserved] about Charles V's intentions are likely correct.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">King Henry II of France will surely soon perish due to the cruel persecutions of Christians and the blasphemies of his presumptuous inquisitors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">The Swiss Confederates should therefore by no means agree to any defensive alliance with Henry II, unless they wish to perish with him... Without France's support, but solely with God's help, they have gained their freedom and will undoubtedly maintain it in the same way. One should only consider how much calamity is attributable to the ambition of the princes and their desire for a larger empire. The more alliances they have made with others, the more warlike they become! The Swiss Confederates should therefore wisely refrain from entering into a new treaty with Henry II and instead adhere to the old, honorable treaty [the "Eternal Peace"] and stay away from any new treaty! Due to his reputation, Bullinger will likely be able to achieve this effortlessly among his people. The people of Konstanz can only support him in this with their prayers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Blarer was very pleased with the news about Johannes a Lasco (may God preserve him for a long time!) and the situation of the East Frisian Church. [The Swiss Confederates and the people of Konstanz] should constantly pray that they can atone for Germany's sins against God through their faith in Christ. May He (as a warning to the other traitors of God) save the small remnant of His faithful in His mercy. Amen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Blarer and [his sister Barbara von Ulm, née Blarer] can hardly adequately thank Bullinger for his reliable support in arranging for the Konstanz students (Hans) Walter [and [N.N.] Kürnstaller] to be accommodated and taught by Johannes Wolf. They will only be able to repay him for his many acts of kindness to a small extent. Wolf should know that Blarer agrees with all the [conditions for accommodation] he has communicated. The boys will soon come to Zurich. (Hans) Walter von Ulm, however, should be accommodated in the neighborhood with [his relative] Jakob Röist until Wolf has a more spacious house, especially since Augustin [N.N.] [also still] lives with Wolf, and it would be appropriate for several reasons for the boys to sleep alone [in a room]. Wolf will soon receive the amount of money he requested [for the accommodation].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Warm greetings to Wolf, to Bullinger's family, and to his assistants, as well as to the other Zurich friends and pastoral colleagues.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>S.D. I truly have nothing worthy to write to you at the moment, my venerable and dearest Bullinger. We are most grateful for your Christian concern for us! Although your dangers are not much less than ours, they are not as immediate. May the Lord ensure that they remain far from you forever.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Our delegation has not yet been sent to the Emperor. The names of the envoys are: Thomas Blarer, the former mayor, Peter Labhart, the guild master, and Hieronymus Hürus, who was with you last summer and was troubled by some people, but as you wrote to me, they did not go unpunished. He is almost a young man, but he is quite learned in Latin and Greek. Moreover, he is well-versed in Italian and several other languages. I believe they will depart within the next eight days.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You should diligently intercede with the Lord, along with the church of Christ there, so that He may accompany them with His good angels and the spirit of His counsel, and grant them wisdom and eloquence, so they may find favor in the sight of this prince, who wishes to appear most gracious. Extremely heavy and unbearable burdens threaten our heads. But the mighty God of Hosts can either remove them or make them lighter than a feather. May He do what is good in His eyes, as long as our names are not erased from the book of life! Our life here is brief and shadowy, so we must bravely struggle through all the evils of this world to reach the happiness of true and eternal life! Meanwhile, we can do nothing without Him, who alone can do all things. May He, through Him to whom He has given all power in heaven and on earth, make us superior to all our adversaries on the right and left (for our trust is most firm).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Those who are a bit more prudent can easily infer the Emperor's intentions from what he has done so far. But it is the Lord who, wherever He wills, rejects the counsels of princes and the thoughts of peoples. What you write about them seems very plausible to me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The way the French king dissimulates this more than cruel tyranny against the members of Christ in his kingdom and turns a blind eye to these most impious blasphemies of the Savior Christ, which these inquisitors of heretical depravity spew out with such confidence, portends his certain destruction.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Therefore, you should not form any auxiliary alliances with him against anyone, unless you wish to perish with him! He who gave you your freedom without the benefit of the French will undoubtedly preserve it without him. We experience, alas, daily, how many evils this more than insane ambition of the princes to rule and their impious stubbornness to extend their borders as far as possible by any means, fair or foul, brings with it, and how much more they rage against others, the more they think they have gathered greater strength from the alliances with many. Therefore, if you are wise, you will be content with that old, honorable treaty and abstain most sacredly from these new ones! You will easily persuade them of this with your authority and eloquence. We will diligently support these efforts, worthy of a Christian bishop, with our pious prayers to the Lord, which is the only thing we can do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>What you write about the incomparable man, Johannes a Lasco, and the churches of East Frisia, has exceedingly gladdened me in the Lord. May He be gracious and favorable to His most learned and excellent minister with heavenly increase, so that he may have reason to rejoice repeatedly, seeing the Lord, who plants and waters, bring forth mature fruit with His abundant blessing. Let us pray diligently that Christ may open a great door for the word of His grace everywhere, so that the gratitude of others may compensate for what unfortunate Germany sins against this most precious treasure with disdain and ingratitude to its great ruin, and that He may kindly preserve those remnants, however small they are, and the truly little flock gathered under the wings of His mercy as a testimony against the other traitors for their just condemnation! Amen, amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>For the cause of our young men, which you have handled with such faith and diligence and such success with Wolf, I do not see how we can adequately thank you. We will strive, however, to the best of our ability, to repay you for this and your countless other benefits, if not as much as we owe and wish, yet as much as may suffice to testify to a grateful heart. I have already received letters from our Wolf, but I cannot reply. It will suffice now if he learns from you that I am very pleased with everything he wrote. The young men will soon arrive there. Since Augustin lives there and for more than one reason it is appropriate for the boys to sleep separately, my nephew Gwalther will sleep in Röist's house next to Wolf's house for the time being, until a more suitable house becomes available for Wolf. The money will be sent to him as he requested.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Greet the most learned and excellent man diligently and courteously on my behalf, especially your household with all your assistants in the Lord and the other friends and brothers.</p>
