      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, just before nightfall, I received your second letter dated the 24th of this month, along with a certain package belonging to Mr. Beza and letters from Mr. Gwalther to Jonvillay, delivered to me by the steward of KÃ¼ngsfelden. I will send these to Geneva as soon as I can. Regarding our business, which was mentioned in your previous letters, I spoke with some people yesterday and would like the matter to be expedited; however, Graverietus and Diesbachius have been sent away from the city, and I do not know when they will return. The others do not want to act without their presence. I am therefore quite anxious, especially since from your latest letters I understand that the assembly is proceeding and the emperor is already in Augsburg. It is a dire situation concerning what affects God and the church. Therefore, I am still of the mind that you should publish your Exposition in your name; you could state in the preface that this is the substance of the doctrine held in all the Swiss churches; however, different rites are observed by different people. This will satisfy everyone, and if you wish, you could specifically express these differences in observances, or if you prefer, only mention them in general, although I know of no differences except for the one concerning the vessels and that we approach while you sit, and then regarding the bread, which I wrote about recently, which is still kept round with us, but in Zofingen and in the Savoyard churches, it is broken as with you. We also still lack the laying on of hands in the ordination of ministers, which I would like us to observe as well; otherwise, presentations are made by deans and prefects as with you. Do what seems right to you; I wanted to remind you of these things so that there is no danger in delay and so that you understand my judgment. We also sing, which you do not do, and furthermore, we have a stone table, but not in the form of an altar, rather constructed in the manner of a table. The Savoyards lack baptisteries, which we have and for which they call us stonecutters. Baptism is also administered at certain hours, in many places only when the entire church congregation is present. These and other such things are enough to express generally, as they neither detract from nor add to the faith or doctrine, unless perhaps you want to mention that golden vessels are used somewhere, so that our people do not feel excluded. What the Genevans will do, I still do not know, but I think they will hurry and not wait for our citizenship, etc. I wanted to add this to the previous matters, as we could not send off your messenger yesterday due to the very dense snow. Farewell again. January 28th, in the morning. Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
