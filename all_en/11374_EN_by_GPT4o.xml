    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter, which has strengthened him in his view of the Lord's Supper; [Sebastian Meyer and Peter Kunz], who are unreasonably relying on the wording of the Scripture and on Chrysostom, have been misled by Bucer, but they will hardly dare to remove the word "means" [from the Bernese Lord's Supper liturgy], as they would not succeed with that. Will pass on Bullinger's letter [to Gwalther] to Morges or to Venner [Peter] Im Haag. Greetings; asks for indulgence, as he is not feeling well.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have received your letter, which was both very pleasant and very welcome to me, for many reasons, but especially because it briefly and completely addressed the matter of the Lord's Supper, leaving nothing to be desired. I am determined that not even a straw (as they say) will sway or distort me from the received and true understanding, no matter what those who would confuse heaven and earth might contrive. There is no danger among the common people either, who will adhere to what they are accustomed to. They use the pretext that we should use the language of the Scriptures and neither add nor subtract anything. But good God, what absurdities would occur in many cases if the Holy Spirit, the interpreter of Himself, and the force and consequences of the Scriptures were neglected? They also cite Chrysostom, who in Corinthians states that the Lord's body is presented to be chewed by our teeth. Now, if there is no figure of speech, how would Christ's body not suffer in this transaction? But I do not know what madness has disturbed them; I believe, however, that it is due to ambition, as they have been seduced and deluded by Bucer's flattery and praise. They sense the indignation of some over the removal of the word "means," so I think they will desist and not dare to stir up this scandal, which I would not want them to do, so that their cunning and deceit might be exposed; for without a doubt, their cause would fall and they would achieve nothing, etc.</p>
      <p>In good faith, I will send your letters to Morges and deliver them to Venner Im Haag as soon as he returns home.</p>
      <p>Please, greet the entire fellowship of scholars in my name. While I was writing this, I was somewhat afflicted with poor health; therefore, take it in good part.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, on the Friday before the feast of Andrew in the year 1539. Yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zürich, his esteemed friend and patron.</p>
