      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. Our Hospinianus, returning from Zürich, informed me of your well-being and good health, which, I pray, the gracious God may preserve for a very long time for the benefit of His name and all the churches, which you illuminate with your vigilance. Amen.</p>
      <p>A remarkable rumor is certainly spreading among us about the many and various deaths of princes, yet that furious Mars does not cease to arm and incite the survivors to greater calamities in Germany. Couriers and messengers of the princes and cities are swiftly carrying out their missions up and down.</p>
      <p>The people of Strasbourg have enlisted soldiers who will stand ready at the sound of the trumpet. The leaders of Stuttgart, whom they call regents, have been negotiating for two days with our prince in private, and there is no one who can even slightly perceive or predict the matters from afar. We all pray: Grant peace, O Lord, and Lord, scatter the plans of the princes and reject the thoughts of the peoples who gather against You and Your church. Amen. If you read the Osiandrian writings, send them back through reliable messengers, so they are not intercepted. Farewell and greet especially your family, my Pellicanus, Mr. Gwalther, and Bibliander, both sons-in-law, along with all the brothers. Pray to the Lord for us. Riquewihr, August 17, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my esteemed brother.</p>
