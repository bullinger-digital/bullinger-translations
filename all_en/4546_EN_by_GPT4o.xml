      <p>S. The bishop's matter is not yet concluded. It had a fortunate progress until the counsel of the old Ahithophel intervened. He has achieved so much in his community that they do not want to hear our envoys and had to be promised several hundred crowns. The papist communities have mostly stood firm, and as soon as it came to the evangelicals, the matter began to falter. Who could write this without tears? The old Ahithophel has brought a particularly great obstacle to the gospel; for he spoke for the bishop before the common assembly of the Three Leagues, and whenever he mentioned the pope (whom he mentioned many times), he always referred to the papal holiness. This is true; for many good men, who were in the council and were themselves envoys, heard this not without great sorrow, therefore you see a man so extremely lost in greed that your admonition had no place. He dallies with the priests and their servants and runs through the whole city.</p>
      <p>Our envoys in the Upper Engadine, where Traversius presides, were received most indignantly and are expected here in Chur this evening. Two remaining Leagues, especially the Upper League, strongly intercede for the bishop; our council opposes vigorously and conducts itself excellently and sharply. What outcome this matter will have, God knows. The bishop and his followers accuse one Gallitius and Fabricius, but not openly, only secretly among themselves. Traversius was admonished by Mr. Philipp; he only greeted me and promised (as he is very flattering) to meet me at home; but he never came. Thus we leave him to the bishop; but we do not yet regret our undertaking, because thus the thoughts from many hearts are revealed and now the seeds of discord are sown between us and the bishop, between whom there is now more than Vatinian hatred. This much about the bishop's cause.</p>
      <p>Our people have been out for 3 weeks now, supposed to come tonight. I cannot know what kind of reception they have found everywhere; yet the game has just begun, and if it is not concluded now, it will fester until the turmoil breaks out. The Jesuit affair has come up again. For the old knight himself has been here outside, he had much support; but, thank God, the better has become more. The officials should be written to, that they expel the monks from the land and seize the goods given to them by the knight (since it is church property and belongs to the lands), and at the next assembly of the League, further counsel should be taken on how to use it for good benefit. The matter of Mr. Beccaria has also been seen. However, since the people of Misox have promised much to the Three Leagues, it has been decided in a community in Misox that whatever becomes more with them shall be valid; thus the good man will not have a good position. Thus, there is work to be done everywhere. G[regorius] Carl[in] informed me today and also asked me to write confidentially, as he has now been written to for the second time by credible persons, that the Five Places have made a pact with the Savoyard with the agreement that the Savoyard should send them 3,000 men against the Glarus people when the war begins.</p>
      <p>There would be much to write; these are the last times. But we are the least afraid of all and, by God's grace, we present ourselves undaunted to everything. This much for now; I have not reread it. I expect some response from Mr. Lavater, your son-in-law; I also wish to hear something certain about the health of your son. May the Lord have mercy on us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Chur, 18th of November, in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. Mr. Philipp, Pontisella, and other good men wish you well.</p>
      <p>There are letters enclosed from Mr. Father-in-law; extract those that pertain to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his uniquely esteemed lord and patron.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster.</p>
