    <p xml:id="regest1">Lavater thanks Bullinger for his friendly letter [not received], in which, despite his many obligations, he conveyed news from home. However, he is most grateful for Bullinger's extraordinary goodwill!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">In his last letter, he wrote extensively about his stay in Paris [not received]. When he then heard about the imminent arrival of the [Swiss] delegation, he immediately wrote another letter to Bullinger [18338 from January 24, 1548] and one to his parents [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Anna, née Reuchli] about life and study in Paris, to be able to give it to the delegation in time before their departure. Now Lavater writes again, on the one hand to confirm the receipt of Bullinger's letter, on the other hand because he understood that a letter was expected. However, Lavater had no opportunity to meet the Zurich head of the Swiss delegation [Andreas Schmid] and discuss his matters with him, as contrary to his assumption, he did not travel to Paris. He himself could not travel to the delegates at the court [in Fontainebleau] due to the abundance of lectures. But that doesn't matter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Lavater has gone to the famous Parisian academy to receive a good education (entirely according to Bullinger's wish), instead of pursuing useless things. In philosophy, he wants to learn everything that seems useful for a superior theological education and what is indispensable for his [scientific] progress and for the proper understanding of relevant literature. Lavater has always intended this and has never pursued anything else until now. Hopefully, he can also meet his goal! What his talent denies him, he wants to make up for with tireless diligence.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Since the university flourishes in all areas of sciences and languages through the learned professors, Lavater is offered great study opportunities. If only one could do justice to them! [Omer Talon], who explains the "Dialecticae institutiones" of Pierre de La Ramée, already links his doctrine of syllogisms with the "Analytica priora" of Aristotle. After completing this lecture, he will turn to the books of Aristotelian politics and ethics. Apart from their content, these works serve as an exercise in dialectics. In a two-year curriculum, one can hear [lectures] on the entire work of Aristotle!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Lavater has adjusted his lifestyle for this and the following month due to the [upcoming] fasting period: For practical reasons, he has moved in with a compatriot [N.N.]. They share a room, but each takes care of his [own] livelihood. If it is sensible and affordable, Lavater would like to live for some time at the Collège [de France] because of the various courses. This way, he can also learn the things that are particularly important to him better. Currently, he needs 30 crowns for sustenance. [At the Collège] about 40 or 50 would be estimated for this. Given the high costs incurred, he will soon ensure to get by with even less money.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Bullinger should report this to Lavater's father [Hans Rudolf] on occasion. Lavater has promised him that he would write to him immediately if his living conditions changed. However, he did not manage to do this in the rush: [Ludwig?] Hoesch delivered the letters [from Bullinger and Lavater's father] today, on February 10, 1548, and will set off again early tomorrow morning. Moreover, his lodging is almost a French mile [approx. 4 km] away from Lavater's accommodation. Bullinger should forgive the lack of clarity in the present letter; the reason was the short time for drafting.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Lavater is pleased that his father's anger has subsided. Undoubtedly, he would never have become angry if he had considered Lavater's motives objectively. And if his father had wanted to prevent the journey more through factual reasoning than through assumptions, Lavater would certainly not have been disobedient to his parents.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Lavater has already reported about his teachers in his earlier letter [18338]. There is probably no need for longer explanations about Parisian customs and the organization of the university, firstly because Bullinger will already be informed about it, and secondly due to lack of time. However, if Bullinger wants to learn more about it, he can find it in Lavater's letter to Peter Simler. Because he feels obliged to the latter and noticed his great interest in a [previous] conversation with him, he wrote to him quite extensively about it on his own initiative.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Lavater would like to add only this: On February 4, the wealthy merchant [Octavien Blondel] was burned alive in the Parisian cemetery S. Ioannis [Saint-Jean]. It is said that he departed from life with great steadfastness and in contempt of the [old-believing] superstition. Another merchant [N.N.] is said to be imprisoned in Paris because of his faith. However, Lavater knows nothing certain about it. The rumor about an [imminent] execution could probably be true, as it is generally known that the death penalty is imposed. The more people are burned, the more hated the current tyranny becomes, and the more superstition is despised! [But the persecutors of the Evangelicals] will not succeed!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">There is a very ridiculous and inaccurate list of forbidden books, in which even the names of the [condemned] German authors are often misspelled. What the bloodthirsty theological faculty of Paris intends with it, Lavater cannot elaborate due to the short time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">On February 1, 1548, the famous physician Jean Desjardins died while eating.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">The Psalter and the Bible translation by François Vatable, printed by Robert Estienne, will no longer be sold until they have been revised according to the guidelines of the theologians of the Sorbonne. According to some, Lutheran views are said to be hidden in them...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">Also, an unpleasant news: At the Collège de Lisieux, a [evangelically minded] teacher [N.N.] is said to have taught his students what to think of image [worship] and the mass. Subsequently, the boys destroyed some holy image (probably one of Saint Sebastian). This will give rise to a tragedy! For about twelve boys are imprisoned without contact with their parents! They are said to be sons of wealthy families and councilors from Paris. It is unclear whether the boys will be acquitted due to their youthful immaturity and their teacher held responsible for this act: The so kind and understanding theologians loudly demand punishment, while the rest [of the Parisians] demand that the boys must be spared because of their age, especially since even animals spare their young. It remains to be seen how it will turn out. Lavater will continue to report to Bullinger about it. The teacher has fled, and a new regulation has been established for the Collège de Lisieux.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">It is certainly not surprising that France is still subject to papal tyranny. The crowd of [old-believing] priests is very large in Paris. They interfere in every matter and spread many tales, even terrible ones about the Germans.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">Recently, the highest [cleric] of Picardy [François III. de Pisseleu, Bishop of Amiens] declared that all pastors are damned who do not betray who is afflicted by the Lutheran misfortune. Many therefore believe they are particularly pleasing to God when they eliminate the Evangelicals among them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">Books that teach the true [evangelical] religion are being destroyed. Currently, one cannot safely have a New Testament in the translation of Erasmus or in Greek. People are out of their minds! Nevertheless, there is hope that the new king [Henry II of France] will act only in accordance with justice. However, many abbots, bishops, and monks, who even live at his court, are pushing themselves upon him. They will leave no stone unturned!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">Lavater has already reported about Pierre de La Ramée. He is rejected by the monks because he teaches to speak like Cicero, and by the other [scholars] because he criticizes Aristotle and Cicero. When La Ramée [was deprived of his teaching license], [Cardinal Charles de Lorraine (Guise)], Archbishop of Reims, who had served the deceased king [Francis I of France], defended him against the accusation that he corrupts the youth and demands the banishment of all respected authors from the schools.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">This about Lavater's living conditions and studies. Bullinger now has knowledge of the hopes placed in the new government, the situation in France, how much the king favors the monks (this pestilential rabble!), and how harshly good [evangelical] people are treated. It was important to Lavater to share all this, as it might be useful for Bullinger's considerations. As soon as Lavater has more time to write again and a better opportunity for letter delivery arises, he will report on all his matters as carefully as possible. He knows that this will greatly please Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">Lavater almost forgot: The deceased French king [Francis I] collected manuscripts from all parts of the world, which will hopefully all be printed. Robert Estienne recently printed the "Romanarum historiarum libri" of Cassius Dio in Greek, as well as the previously unpublished commentaries of a certain Eustathius on the writing "De situ orbis" of Dionysius [Periegetes] and a medical writing ["Alexandri Tralliani medici libri XII"]. Currently, the greatly expanded edition of his work "Commentarii linguae Graecae" by Guillaume Budé himself is being printed by Estienne.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">Bullinger should take care of his health, continue to support Lavater, and be convinced that he exercises the greatest care in his studies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">[P.S.:] Bullinger should not sign the next letter, so as not to be recognized as the author if the letter falls into foreign hands. Lavater knows Bullinger's handwriting very well!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">Renewed greetings.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I received your letter, reverend father, which was most delightful to me for many reasons: partly because it was written by you despite your many cares and important affairs, partly because it informs me of the state of affairs at home, but most of all because it abundantly testifies to your incredible goodwill towards me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I wrote in previous days about all my affairs and how things were going with me, in detail. And when it was commonly said that delegates were arriving, I wrote again to you and my parents about the manner of life and studies, lest I be hindered by the unexpected departure of the delegates. Now again, both to show that I have received your letters and because I understand mine are expected by you, I write again. However, I was not given the opportunity to meet and greet the Zurich delegate in person and discuss my affairs with him. I thought they would come to Paris. But I would have met them at the court if not for the abundance of lectures. But it does not matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You advise me to be cautious not to pursue vain things, but rather to prepare a solid education for myself. To do this more conveniently, I have come to this most illustrious and celebrated academy. For I only wish to taste from philosophy what seems to pertain to better forming theological studies, and without which we cannot progress to higher things nor engage well in reading good authors. I have always set this goal for myself, towards which I aim, and I have pursued nothing else until now. If only my talent would also respond to my wishes! However, what nature has denied me, I will compensate with industry and labor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have the greatest opportunity for study. For our gymnasium flourishes in every kind of study and language with the most learned professors. If only someone could be equal to so many things to be meditated upon! The one who interpreted the "Dialecticae institutiones" of Ramus has now added the "Analytica priora" of Aristotle to the doctrine of syllogisms. After I have completed these, I will turn to the books of Aristotle's politics and ethics. For if for no other reason, certainly for the exercise of the art of dialectics, they must be learned. In a two-year course, we can hear the entire Aristotle.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I have changed my way of life, for during this month and the next, due to the Lenten fast, it is better and more convenient to live with a fellow citizen. Otherwise, we provide for our necessities ourselves, and we have only rented a room. Afterwards, if it seems advisable and can be done under moderate conditions, I will live for some time in a college for various exercises, and so that I can better learn the things I need most. For the table, 30 crowns are counted, otherwise almost 40 and 50 are counted. But soon, because of the intolerable expenses, I will decide to live more frugally.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I wish, if it were possible during leisure, that you would briefly explain these things to my father, for I promised him that I would inform him as soon as I changed my way of life, which I could not do in such haste. For Hoesch delivered the letters on February 10th and was to leave early the next morning. Moreover, his lodging was almost a French mile away from my residence. Therefore, I ask you to forgive me for not having written this letter, but rather having poured it out. And consider that I did not have the opportunity to write diligently.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I am glad that my father's somewhat offended spirit is appeased. I do not doubt that if he had carefully examined what moved me to undertake this journey, he would never have been angry with me. For if he had wished to prevent the journey by judgment rather than by some opinion, I would certainly not have shown myself disobedient to my parents.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I wrote about my teachers in previous letters. I do not think it necessary to dwell longer on the customs of this city and how the school is organized, partly because these things cannot be unknown to you, partly because I am prevented by the brevity of time. To this, if you desire more, I wrote quite extensively to Mr. Peter Simler. Although I would have done this of my own accord, I did it more eagerly because I seemed to perceive his great desire for this matter from his conversations.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I will only add this: On February 3rd, a wealthy merchant was burned alive in the cemetery of St. John, who is said to have suffered with great constancy and to have departed from this life in contempt of superstition. They say another merchant is detained in prison for the sake of religion. But I do not have reliable witnesses of this matter. It seems probable to me. For the punishment is common. And the more they burn, the more they curse their tyranny and despise superstition, so that they seem to accomplish no more than if they wished to count sand.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>What the theological faculty, thirsty for Christian blood, is planning, you could have seen if the brevity of time had allowed. For there is a catalog of books they have proscribed, more than sufficiently ridiculous and unpolished. For in expressing the names of many Germans, they err.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>On February 1st, the most famous physician named De Hortis expired during dinner.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>The Psalter of Vatabli and the Bible from the same version, printed by Robert, will no longer be sold until they have been revised by the theologians of the Sorbonne. For some seemed to taste of Lutheranism.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Furthermore, hear a new story, but not pleasant to hear. In the Lexovian college, a certain teacher instructed his students on what should be thought about images and the mass. The boys destroyed the image of some saint (I think Sebastian). This matter has given or will give rise to a great tragedy. For about 12 are held in chains, as I have heard, sons of senators and almost all wealthy Parisians. Parents are not admitted to their sons. It is doubted whether they should be acquitted because of their tender and immature age and because these things seem to have been done at the instigation of the teacher. Theologians (as they are easy and humane) clamor that they should be punished, while the rest say that they should be spared because of their age, to which even wild beasts show mercy. We await the outcome. And whatever end this tragedy may have, I will write to you about it. The teacher has taken flight. A new way of living has been prescribed for the collegians.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>It is certainly not surprising that France is still subject to papal tyranny. For there is such a crowd of priests in Paris, who involve themselves in all affairs, mixing many tales, even horrible ones about the Germans!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Recently, the supreme preacher in Picardy said that those are damned who do not betray those infected with the Lutheran stain. Many therefore think they have shown obedience to God if they have removed people of our religion from the midst.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Books that teach the true religion are suppressed. At this time, it is not safe to carry around the testament in Erasmus's version or the Greek exemplar in sermons. For they rage more fiercely now. Although there is good hope that the new king will do nothing but what seems consistent with justice, yet so many abbots, bishops, and monks (what do they not dare?) thrust themselves in. They live at court!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>I wrote about Peter Ramus elsewhere. He endures great envy from the monks because he teaches to speak purely like Cicero, and from the rest because he attacks Aristotle and Cicero. Now a certain bishop, who dealt with the deceased king, has freed him again, saying he heard that he was a corrupter of youth and thought all good authors should be expelled from the schools.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>You have therefore the state of life, the course of studies, the hope of the new kingdom, the state of France, and how much the king has indulged the monks (the most pestilent kind of men!) and how severely they punish good men. I wanted you to know all these things, in case they might pertain to your thoughts and plans. When I have more leisure to write and a greater opportunity to send a letter, I will inform you as diligently as possible about all my affairs, since I have understood that this is greatly pleasing and delightful to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>But I almost passed over: The late king of France sought out many books in all parts of the earth, which we hope will all be printed. Robert Estienne recently printed the Histories of Dio in Greek. Moreover, in the book of Dionysius "On the Position of the World," the Greek commentaries of a certain Eustathius, not seen before, and some medical writings. Now under the press are the Commentaries of Budé, enriched by the author himself in many places.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>Take care to be well and love me, and be persuaded that I will apply the utmost diligence in fulfilling every literary duty. Paris, February 10, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know from my handwriting.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>I ask you not to insert your name in the letters, lest, if they fall into foreign hands, it can be gathered who writes. I know your handwriting very well!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed patron.</p>
