      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Nothing has yet been done about appointing someone else in the place of Kunz, as I have deliberately postponed the matter until the arrival of Mayor Nägeli and Ougspurger, who are currently in the province of Savoy. However, I cannot delay any longer, as Sulzer is pressing the matter urgently. Therefore, do not hesitate, if you have someone whom you would judge suitable for our church. Many have little hope for our Megander due to the old enmity of some; nevertheless, if it is possible, I will not yield in my diligence. Then there are those who have mentioned Jodocus Kilchmeyer, whom I do not know; but because he is from Zurich, he gives many great hope. I, my dear Bullinger, ask you to name one or two whom you would judge to be suitable for our church. Furthermore, regarding your intention to write to Sulzer, I cannot dissuade you; but write cautiously, as I do not doubt that either the letter or a copy will soon be in Strasbourg; he is so devoted to Luther and Bucer.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All good and pious men send their greetings to you and Megander. From Bern, March 11, 1544.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most distinguished Antistes of the Church of Zurich, etc.</p>
