      <p>Greetings and Peace. I received what you sent from Verg[erius] and I thank you; I replied to him hastily and I ask that you send it through a reliable person, so that the letters are not lost; for I will cover the expenses. You will see what I write to him; I did not want to seal the letters, so that if there is anything worthy and new for you, you may read it. I fear the English marriage, to which this Pope adheres against us with the Emperor. I greet your lords and you especially, and I wish you well. From Solothurn, December 29th.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bass[afontaneus].</p>
