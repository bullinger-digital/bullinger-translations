    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius rarely learns when someone is going to Zurich, otherwise he would have long since sent news about Regensburg. However, he only had news about the participants in the [religious] discussion, of whom at that time, apart from the [Protestants], only the Colmarer [Johannes Hoffmeister] had arrived in Regensburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Sultan Suleiman I.] occupied two or three castles despite the peace agreement and excused himself by saying he had merely prepared a passageway for his own people!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Duke [Wilhelm IV.] of Bavaria has forbidden his subjects living around Regensburg, under penalty of confiscation of goods and exile, to hear the word [of God] in Regensburg, or even to buy or sell anything in this city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The [Baselers] are sending a [letter] to the [Zurich] council with news about the Palatinate. Furthermore, Count Wilhelm [of] Fürstenberg, Count [Philipp IV.] of Hanau[-Lichtenberg], and Count [Johann] of Salm, together with Count [Jakob?] of Bitsch, are said to have gone to Frankfurt because of the Schmalkaldic League.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Today Myconius heard from a member of the [Basel] city leadership [Adelberg Meyer?] that Emperor [Charles V.] is preparing for a new war against [Francis I.]. How, Myconius will report later, if he does not forget.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger is to hand over the letter for [Simon] Sulzer to Thomas Grunder and have the other letter [to Vadian] delivered as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander] and [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I do not know why it happens that those who go to Zurich are so rarely known by me. I would have written long ago about what I knew from Regensburg, if there had been anyone to carry the letters. Now, the news is so outdated that it can no longer be pleasing; therefore, I think it should be omitted.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2">
      <p>Although, to mention this in passing, there was nothing except about the participants in the discussion, of whom none were present with our people at that time, except for the one from Colmar.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest2">
      <p>About the Turk and his contempt against us, as he occupied two or three castles during the truce and, when reproached for it, responded that he had not violated the truce, but had prepared a passage for his own people, should it be necessary in the future. Thus, the defeated are accustomed to be mocked by the victor!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest3">
      <p>About the Duke of Bavaria, who has forbidden, under penalty of confiscation of goods and exile, any of his subjects (who nevertheless surround the city of Regensburg) to enter to hear the word, or even to sell or buy anything. This tyranny, which I think will soon have an end, is. These were briefly in my letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Now our people have sent to your council what concerns the Palatinate. Additionally, Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg, Count of Hanau, and Count of Salm are joining a certain Count of Bitsch. They have descended to Frankfurt for the Schmalkaldic League. May all these things be favorable and happy for us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Today I heard from the head of our city that the Emperor is preparing for a new war against the French. Here indeed I hesitate. How, I will explain later, if I remember and the present mood is not dispelled.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Please, deliver the letters to Sulzer to Thomas Grunder; send the others, to whom they are addressed, as quickly as you can.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell in Christ with yours. Greet Theodor in my name, and likewise Pellican. Basel, the last day of January in the year 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, his most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
