    <p xml:id="regest1">Schuler received Bullinger's letter [not received] on March 22 and [the "Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio" or the "True Confession"] and rejoiced, not because Memmingen had been unsettled by Luther's [“Short Confession”], but because this publication had aroused more interest in the [Zurichers] among some [Memmingers]. - The Memmingen doctor Ulrich Wolfhart, after reading Luther's writing, could not sleep for a night. He passed the book on to Schuler and wanted to hear no more of it. Luther's vulgarity is regrettable for the church! - In Kempten, a certain Johannes [Jakob] Schober preached that through the words of institution, wine and bread were no longer wine and bread, but the true body and blood of Christ. Schuler was called there by the other two Kempten brothers [Paul Rasdorfer and...] and proclaimed the opposite from the pulpit. [Schober] was expelled from the city. - Doctor Johannes Marbach, a former colleague of Paul Fagius who had studied in Wittenberg, represents the Lutheran doctrine of the Lord's Supper in Isny. Recently, about fifteen [hosts] were left over at the [communion service], which [Marbach] shoved into the mouth of the deacon [Georg Denneler], along with wine that Marbach drank in one gulp. As is customary in Lutheranism, he consecrated the chalice and made the sign of the cross over it. He is said to be a traitor to the Swabian churches at Luther's, who sent him his writing. [Ambrosius] Blarer, who is slandered by Marbach, is supposed to meet with him soon. - Schuler will read the Zurichers' writing carefully. They should continue to defend the truth. He will ensure peace in Memmingen. - At the Diet of Worms, religion has not yet been negotiated. [Charles V.] is ill in Brussels. Ferdinand [I.] arrived in Worms on March 14. The cardinals and the papists received him splendidly and are trying to prevent him from undertaking anything [in place of his brother]. Schuler received a letter from the [Memmingen] envoy [Lutz von Freyburg or Georg Maurer] with the news that the imperial police [regulation], which counts about 50 pages, had been drafted. Religious matters still need to be negotiated, but the [Protestant estates] have submitted [proposals] to the imperial councilors. - Schuler thanks for the [Zurich writing] sent by Bullinger. He and his pregnant wife [..., née Lübegger] along with all the children are well. The council has increased his salary. - Greetings from Ulrich Wolfhart, the mayor [Balthasar] Funk, [Pastor Bartholomäus] Bertlin, and the brothers. Greetings from Schuler's wife to [Anna, née Adlischwyler]. - [P.S.:] Bullinger should send two good Glarus Schabziger [cheeses], via the "Gretmeister" or "Hofmeister" [...] of Lindau. Schuler will pay for them or send Bullinger's wife the finest flax in return.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ, our Savior.</p>
      <p>On the twenty-second day of March, I received both your letter and the writing against that slanderer Luther, most learned Bullinger and venerable brother, which I accepted with great joy of my heart, I assure you, not because the church of Memmingen was offended by Luther's insane writing and needed to be restored by this writing - for it lives in utmost tranquility, especially concerning the matter of the Eucharist -, but because some friends, zealous for the truth and my fellow believers, have been greatly refreshed by it for your sake.</p>
      <p>We have among us a man distinguished in piety and learning, named Ulrich Wolfhart, a doctor of medicine and the sole patron (Mäzen) of all scholars, to whom Luther's recently published book, the "Lasterbuch," first came. He read it and was so disturbed in mind that he almost spent a sleepless night. The next day, he sent it to me to read with the condition that, once read, it would never return to his hands; he so abhorred Luther's most trivial writing. In short, no one who even moderately loves the truth wished for this booklet to be anything but rejected.</p>
      <p>What shall I say? The rogue's mother has completely left Luther's little house. I truly grieve for the repeated afflictions of Christ's church. There are enough other disturbances in the whole world! Alas, what madness, what impudence, to recall this sacramental contention as if by right of return!</p>
      <p>Recently, in Kempten, there arose a notable rascal who dared to say in a public sermon: "When the bread is in the baker's house and the wine is with the innkeeper, it is truly and naturally bread and wine; but when the words are spoken over them, it is truly the natural body and blood of Christ and no longer wine, etc., and bread." I, having been called there by the other two brothers, was compelled to speak the opposite from the pulpit out of love for the truth, and after many dangers, I managed through the Lord to have that Lutheran expelled from the city, who allowed himself to be called Johannes Schober under his own name. Furthermore, there is a certain Doctor Johannes Marbach in Isny, who came there from Wittenberg a year ago after Paul Fagius. He is a most ardent defender of the Lutheran opinion on the Eucharist. Recently, wanting to celebrate the Lord's Supper, he wanted to have the bread counted, along with the communicants; but he miscounted. About fifteen hosts were left over. He shoved them all into the mouth of the deacon there, who almost choked on them. And a good portion of wine remained in the chalice; the doctor drank it all in one gulp, so that his eyes almost overflowed. Moreover, when he consecrated (as Lutheranism has it), he uncovered the edges, made the sign of the cross over it, so that the effect of the consecration might have an entrance. They say this doctor is a traitor to the Swabian churches at Luther's, to whom Luther sent this brief confession of his on the Eucharist along with letters. Perhaps Doctor Blaurer will soon deal with this Doctor Marbach. For he slanders that excellent man with dire blasphemies, saying: "Blaurer has done no good in the Swabian churches and has badly corrupted them with Zwinglian heresy." Thus all Lutherans reflect the spirit of their teacher, everywhere like themselves. May the Lord cause all such contentions, by which both the truth is obscured and the churches are disturbed, to be removed from our midst.</p>
      <p>I dread nothing as much as the Lutheran affections. Shame on the eternal disgrace! If the worst rascal had done it, it would still be too much. Behold the judgment of all lovers of the truth.</p>
      <p>I will read this writing of the Zurich brothers most diligently, for nothing could have happened to me more pleasing at this time, so help me God. Therefore, continue, most esteemed brothers, to defend the truth with that modesty which befits Christians, and allow Luther to play the buffoon; for he is mad. As for the tranquility of the Memmingen church, I will strive to do whatever can be done.</p>
      <p>Nothing has yet been done at the Diet of Worms concerning the matter of religion. The Emperor is suffering from a severe illness in Brussels. Ferdinand arrived in Worms on March 14, whom the cardinals and papists received magnificently, laboring with many efforts to keep him in office. On the same day I write this, I received letters from the envoy of our city from the Diet, who wrote to me: "There is an improvement and a way present, through which, by the providence of the Almighty, the matter may still turn out well. The points of the imperial policy concerning human matters have been opened. It is a long thing, holding up to 50 pages.</p>
      <p>Watch, it will be printed. As far as I have heard, I worry that it will not be lived to see in this world. The matters of religion are still stuck in the quills, for partly through a committee of the Protestants, a proposal has been made to the imperial councilors, with special consideration of some articles, from which the imperial councilors can well understand what we intend," etc. Thus he. Finally, I thank your charity for the booklet sent to me, my dearest Bullinger. May the opportunity be given to repay the favor! I am moderately well, along with my pregnant wife and all the children. In the Lord, I enjoy the wonderful peace of the brothers and the church. The council has increased my salary, so that I have two hundred florins annually, ten malters of grain or twenty mutts, along with sufficient housing and firewood. In short, as far as the condition of this present life is concerned, everything is safe.</p>
      <p>Ulrich Wolfhart, doctor of medicine, our patron, greets you a thousand ways, as do Funk, the mayor, Bertlin, and all the brothers. May the Lord Jesus Christ, the chief shepherd, preserve you for us and the church, along with your whole family, for a long time. My wife sends many greetings to you and your wife.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, March 23, in the year of our Lord 1545. Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>It is my friendly request, if possible, that you send me two good Glarus Schabziger cheeses, to the "Gretmeister" or "Hofmeister" in Lindau. Whatever they cost, I will gladly pay you in thanks, or, if it pleases your wife, send as much flax in return.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the city of Zurich, lord brother and dear old friend.</p>
