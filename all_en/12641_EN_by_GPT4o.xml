    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich received Bullinger's letter from September 7 [not preserved]. He has also received all other letters from Bullinger and, if he is not mistaken, has answered them all. However, the fact that his own letters arrive so late or not at all to Bullinger is not his fault, but due to unreliable messengers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger does not need to thank Frölich for his writing efforts, especially since [his letters] were not particularly carefully composed due to lack of time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Joachim Vadian wrote a letter to Frölich concerning his relative Hieronymus Sailer. His concern is justified, but he expects too much. If only Frölich could achieve even half of what is expected of him! In any case, he greatly values the acquaintance with [Vadian].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [Hans Wilpert] Zoller is healthy again. Yesterday, Frölich received a handwritten letter from him, in which he reports on his successes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The Augsburg authorities, Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse], and the other princes do not reproach the [Protestant] Confederates. They believe they can count on them. However, it must be known that the [Schmalkaldic League] has already spent about 1,500,000 guilders on the war and more than 100,000 soldiers need to be paid. Such a large army has never been seen before! Therefore, if no new Confederates are accepted before the beginning of winter, it is because there are already far more soldiers than is good, and [Emperor Charles V] still avoids the fight, even though the Dutch army has joined him. But he will be challenged to battle!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- 14 days ago, the heavily bombarded enemy lost about 2,000 men. They would have been forced to flee if the [Schmalkaldic League] had stayed in the same place for one more day. They are exhausted by the enemy's delaying tactics. Yet they are ready to sacrifice everything, especially since everything is at stake!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The opposing side is seeking peace. However, such peace cannot be acceptable unless God performs a miracle.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The learned and pious Thomas Naogeorg, who wrote the work "Pammachius," was expelled by the Lutherans and fled to Augsburg, where he found refuge with Frölich. When Elector [Johann Friedrich I] of Saxony learned of this, he ordered his arrest by the Augsburg authorities. The only reason for this is Naogeorg's view of the Eucharist, which is not Lutheran. Frölich had to hide him in a village [Lauingen]. It is feared that due to the "new papacy," Naogeorg will not be able to stay in Augsburg even after the war. Perhaps Bullinger can find a solution for him. He is married and has two children.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The imperial army has left Ingolstadt and is moving against the helpless little town of Neuburg [on the Danube]. It will likely be conquered.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The enemy is no more than a short day's journey from Augsburg. The [Schmalkaldic League] will attack them or then take a position in front of Augsburg. Therefore, a battle could occur before winter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Enclosed, highly confidential, are the "Articles" for which Naogeorg is being persecuted. They were copied by Frölich from a letter of the Saxon Elector. However, Frölich does not know if they truly reflect Naogeorg's opinion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- What Bullinger wrote to [Johannes] Haller regarding [the Augsburg request for] preachers, Frölich was pleased to hear. As soon as the messenger [...] returns, [the council] will write to Zurich again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. The letters you wrote on September 7, as well as all your other letters, most illustrious and especially dear friend, have been delivered to me, and I believe I have always responded to each one individually. However, I am not quite sure why my letters sometimes arrive late or not at all. The messengers are incidental and therefore unreliable, and their negligence easily leads to mistakes. But you should not blame your brother for this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Thanks for my writing are not necessary, for I write sluggishly and negligently, as business and time permit. I earnestly beg you not to be offended or burdened by my rusticity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Dr. Joachim Vadian, an excellent man, sent me a very friendly and learned letter concerning his relative Hieronymus Sailer. Although the speech itself refers to a certain honorable instigator, I am indeed praised and made too much of. If only I could achieve half of what is expected! But let those who think and spread more about me than is appropriate see to it. I certainly highly value the acquaintance and any kind of fellowship with such a great man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Zollerenus has recovered very well, and the infallible sign of this is his handwriting, which I received yesterday, in which he also informed me of his successful outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>You should believe that the common Confederation is not only excused by my lords but also by the Landgrave and other princes to the highest degree, and we all rely on their honor, loyalty, and support. I also hope to cause further understanding and friendship to be sought and found on both sides. We truly do not spare money, and I will not hide from you in confidence that we have already spent over 1,500,000 guilders. We also have to pay more than 100,000 soldiers. And if it were not for the winter approaching so closely, more Confederates would be accepted and sent to them, although we have more people than is actually good. I have not heard of any military man who has ever seen such a large gathering. And I believe it is credible that the excessive number is not good against God and otherwise. For although the enemy has gathered the Dutch people and cavalry, he still remains entrenched and does not want to fight. But he will be sought out!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The enemy lost over 2,000 men due to our shooting 14 days ago, and he became so discouraged that he would have fled if our forces had stayed in the same place for one more day. However, we could not take advantage of such an opportunity. The matter is being prolonged, and the enemy intends to wear us out. But we are willing to extend ourselves, as we have and are able. For it concerns soul, body, wife, children, freedom, honor, and property.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>On the enemy's side, peace is being sought and means are being devised. But I cannot see or recognize any honest, divine, and useful peace unless God sends it miraculously.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I cannot hide from you that a distinguished, learned, and pious theologian named Thomas Naogeorgus, who wrote the most learned tragedy "Pamachius," was expelled by the Lutherans and fled here to Augsburg. He has been a guest with me and has been welcome and agreeable to us all. When the Elector of Saxony learned of this, he requested through a letter to my lords that the honorable pious man be arrested. The only reason is that he does not want to be Lutheran regarding the Lord's Supper but holds with us. Therefore, I had to send the pious man away from me and hide him in a village in high secrecy. I fear that even if this war comes to an end, my lords will not be able to keep him from the new papacy. Therefore, consider where we might shelter the dear man with his wife and two young children. Let me know your thoughts in return.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>After this, news comes that the enemy has moved from his camp before Ingolstadt up towards Neuburg. And it is to be feared, since it is a small, unfortified town, that it will be conquered before help arrives.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Our forces will meet the enemy, who is no more than a short day's journey from Augsburg, or they will camp in front of Augsburg, so that the matter of this great work may come to an end before winter. May the Almighty stand by us. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>In the highest confidence, I hereby send you the articles for which Thomas Naogeorgus is being persecuted. These articles were copied by me from the letters of the Prince of Saxony, although I do not know whether he himself feels this way or otherwise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>What you wrote to my dear lord and brother Haller regarding the preachers, I was pleased to hear. As soon as our messenger returns, you shall be written to again.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>May all and each of our brothers in Zurich fare well! September 20, 1546. Yours, Georgius Laetus, etc.</p>
      <p>To the Christian, highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed (Antistes) of the church in Zurich, my gracious lord, to be delivered.</p>
