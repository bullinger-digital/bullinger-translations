    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports in response to Bullinger's letter [No. 1799] on how the conflict between Bern and Geneva was resolved: Although he himself had almost given up hope several times, as the second arbitration award from Basel [dated August 24, 1543] demanded even more concessions from the Genevans than the first [from January 1541], not only peace but also the highest harmony has now been achieved. Greetings to Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], Megander, Gwalther, and the other [Zurich theologians]. [Postscript:] Calvin's colleagues also send their regards.</p>

      <p>I have not yet responded to your letter in which you reminded me how necessary it was for the controversies, which were then being agitated between the Bernese and our people, to be settled by friendly negotiation, and you asked me to consistently, as far as possible, interpose myself so that the discord, useless to both parties at such an inopportune time, would not spread further. Although you were urging someone who was already inclined to act, it nonetheless helped me greatly, as I was almost exhausted from rolling this stone in vain for so long, to be driven by this new spur not to desist until the matter was settled. And so that you may better know how much your exhortations and those of others have benefited me, I was on the verge of giving up more than ten times. It was not without great difficulty that it was achieved that the first decision made by the Baselers was accepted here: the second caused me more trouble. For more had been conceded to the Bernese in it, and our people, because they already considered themselves to have fulfilled their duty, showed themselves somewhat more obstinate.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I had to sweat not a little. Although I was on the verge of seeing all my labor fall in vain.</p>
      <p>But when I scarcely dared to hope for a happy outcome, the Lord unexpectedly shone upon us wonderfully.</p>
      <p>Now, therefore, by the grace of God, we have not only peace but also the highest harmony, which I trust will be firm. Farewell, most learned man and brother most dear to me in the Lord. Greet respectfully Mr. Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], Megander, Gwalther, and the other brothers. May the Lord always guide you all by His Spirit. Geneva, February 17, 1544.</p>
      <p>My colleagues send their regards to you all.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and endowed with exceptional learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, most esteemed brother and friend.</p>
