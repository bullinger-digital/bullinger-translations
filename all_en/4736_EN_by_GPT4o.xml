      <p>Praise be to God, March 30, 1561, in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>My unknown friendly, willing service to you in the time before, etc. Gracious, venerable, dear Mr. Bullinger, this letter of mine to you is solely because, today through the bookseller Froshauer from Zurich, I am sending you in a box wrapped in cloth; inside you will find one silver goblet. The same is gifted to you by Mr. David Haug; he could not otherwise bring it to you safely, and he will also write to you about it himself in person. I did not want to withhold this from you as my lord.</p>
      <p>Your knowledge without harm to receive. I also wish to take my leave with this.</p>
      <p>May the grace of God be with us all. Amen. Your reverence/(honor) willing/(wisdom) willing servant Hans Ziegler.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the word of God, my gracious lord, to be delivered. Zurich.</p>
