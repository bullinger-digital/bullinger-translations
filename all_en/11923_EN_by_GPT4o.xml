    <p xml:id="regest1">Believed that Myconius remembered the names of the brothers, otherwise he would have had them sign individually: Kaspar Megander, Erasmus Fabricius [Schmid], Rudolf Gwalther, [Konrad] Pellikan, and Theodor Bibliander; as often, this time too, it was written by an individual on a joint decision and in the name of the others; Myconius' response could not be shown to the brothers due to the barbs contained in it, who are by no means hostile to Myconius. Regarding Bucer's book to the Münsterites, he refuses to be obliged to an alleged agreement that he has long since rejected; his dispute with Bucer at the first Basel Synod [from January 31 to February 4] 1536 should be well known to Myconius, who, moreover, himself asked in a letter, which Bullinger still possesses, what was recommendable about the book, to which Bullinger responded with a clear demarcation; he is not suppressed by writings of Luther or Bucer. Bullinger sent the [First Helvetic] Confession and the explanation translated into Latin to Luther with the main articles that were discussed at the second Basel Synod [on September 24/25, 1536] to the Scot George [Wishart]. He did not oppose Bucer's statement about the Wittenberg Concord because he hoped for Luther at the time; the [Zurichers] never wanted to fully adopt the Augsburg Confession and the Wittenberg Articles as Bucer demanded, and did not sign, but drafted their declaration, which was sent to Luther from the third Basel Synod [from November 12 to 14, 1536]; Myconius also knows the decision that was unanimously made at the last Zurich Synod [from April 28 to May 3, 1538]. He defends himself against the insinuation that in his letter he did not write some things on his own initiative; neither does he let his work be misused by others nor does he feign agreement where he cannot truly agree. The [Zurich] theologians are well-disposed towards Myconius; Bullinger has so far only responded in his own name, the [Zurich theologians] may write to him separately shortly; a request to Myconius not to misunderstand him and to regain composure; may God teach what is right in word and deed for the edification of the church.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Unless I had thought, dear Myconius, that you remembered the names of all the brothers, they would undoubtedly have signed individually. However, I will list them for you in order: Kaspar Megander, Erasmus Fabricius, Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander. In their name and his own, Bullinger wrote. It is not uncommon for us that one writes on behalf of all others and indeed writes what has been ordered and decided by the common counsel or discussion of all. Thus, it happened here too, that Bullinger wrote to Myconius from his own mind and with the advice of the brothers or fellow ministers, and indeed with the unanimous opinion of all. I wish, therefore, that you had refrained from those sharp remarks with which you sprinkled your letter from the very beginning, saying something about the metamorphosis of the brothers.</p>
      <p>Be assured, Myconius, and of cheerful mind. I know no one among us who harbors any private hatred towards you. And the beginning of this letter, full of bitterness, suspicion, and acrimony, has so far prevented me from presenting it to the assembly of brothers. And this is for your sake, who would bear no ill will towards the brothers, unless a vain suspicion had somewhat led you astray.</p>
      <p>You reproach me with Bucer's book to the Münsterites, which I once recommended, especially in the matter of the supper. I wonder at this reproach, whether you wanted to burden me with envy among others or provoke me. For you, above others, know how much I have contended with Bucer over this matter, who exercised me with this objection so that I openly told him to his face in Basel at the first synod in 1536 that I did not want to be pressed by the book to the Münsterites, that if I had ever recommended anything in it, I now retract it, lest it be a fraud to me, etc. Furthermore, I wrote to you a rather copious letter, in which I explained what I recommended in that book, expressly testifying that I did not want to be oppressed by obscure expressions or the prescription of that book. For you asked in a written letter, which I still have, what I recommended in that book, about which Bucer exults so much; you do not yet grasp or understand what these men want. In some other notes, you wrote in German: "White or black or nothing at all, I would gladly say to them," etc. Now you reproach me with that book as if it were authentic. Therefore, I simply and candidly tell you, my Myconius, that I do not want to be oppressed by any of Bucer's writings published after our disaster, no more than by Luther's, whose opinion he received and defended.</p>
      <p>You add that I gave my confession to a certain Scot. Indeed, I gave the Basel Confession and the declaration translated into Latin to Luther, with the main articles that were discussed at the second Basel Synod, to George the Scot.</p>
      <p>You ask why I allowed Bucer to speak in this way: "The Wittenberg Confession has nothing new, but is in the writings of Oecolampadius and Zwingli," etc.</p>
      <p>Bucer speaks and has spoken many things, which, although I heard, I did not simply approve. And those things which I did not oppose, I did not oppose because I hoped for better things from Luther at that time. But you do not ignore that it is very true that we never wanted to fully and absolutely accept the Augsburg Confession and the articles brought from Wittenberg, as Bucer demanded from us. For this was long labored over. Bucer explained them in a long writing; but our people did not want to subscribe. Indeed, they also added their declaration, which was sent to Luther from the third Basel Synod. Nor is it obscure to you what was decreed and agreed upon by all at the last synod held in Zurich.</p>
      <p>In the end, you append that you pass over some things, as if I wrote them not from myself, but from the mouth and stomach of others, and so as not to harm an undeserving friend. But I truly wonder at your judgment and these thoughts of your mind, Myconius. Do you think me so timid that I would allow others to misuse my work or permit those given to passions to blurt out through my mouth and pen what they please? Or do you think me so insincere that I would allow my name to be inscribed by the brothers, yet be alien in mind from those things that are handled in the name of all and my own as well? I am not such. If I think something is done unjustly, I do not assent; if I think something is not done badly, I do not withdraw. But I understood that the brothers and ministers wish well and desire well for Myconius, the old friend, and therefore that common admonition was instituted. Why would I not have joined myself to this good institution in mind and pen?</p>
      <p>I have not yet spoken of the main cause, which is of the greatest concern. For it pertains to all. These things, because they seemed peculiar to me, I wanted to handle briefly and respond to you candidly and immediately or at once. The brothers and ministers may perhaps respond themselves shortly. However, I have not yet presented yours to them. But understand these things of mine, hastily written, rightly and as you ask me to understand yours.</p>
      <p>I understand that you have been more agitated by our people than is fitting. Therefore, collect your mind and consider that the brothers wanted to benefit, not harm, to heal, not wound. We labor under no spirit of pride, which extinguishes gifts once kindled. Let us rather pray to the Lord, that he may teach us to speak and act in such a way that we may please him and the church be edified.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 21, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, beloved brother and lord.</p>
