    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has not written for a year and a half due to the unfortunate dispute over the Lord's Supper between the now deceased Luther and the people of Zurich. He wanted to prevent Luther from being incited against Melanchthon and to avoid the suspicion that Melanchthon was in league with the people of Zurich. Bullinger knew from Melanchthon's last letter [HBBW IV, No. 1966] what Melanchthon had to endure from bothersome brothers. In view of the restoration of the unity of the Church, Bullinger will now, if Melanchthon agrees, resume correspondence with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- If Bullinger is glad that Luther is with the Lord, it is not because of the [Lord's Supper] dispute, but because he is glad that Luther is freed from all the evils of this world. Yet at the same time, Bullinger mourns, especially since the Church has lost, with Luther's death, despite his faults, a helpful advisor and a determined, unyielding opponent of the cunning Papists. May Melanchthon now fight these people with similar steadfastness and strength of the [Holy] Spirit, who, according to Christ's judgment, seek only their own honor (John 5:44) and who, as Paul says (2 Tim 3:8), have only one thing in mind, namely to resist the truth. In this conflict, the people of Zurich are ready to assist Melanchthon, especially since he probably does not see them [as Luther did] as impure.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The people of Zurich had to respond to Luther's "Short Confession" because they and their deceased teachers [Zwingli and Oecolampadius] were publicly attacked. They took the opportunity to declare their faith with their [“True Confession”]; a faith that aligns with the [ancient] creeds and which Melanchthon will probably not disapprove of. What the apostles taught about the resurrected body of Christ and about justification by faith allows no other understanding of the Lord's Supper. Man is justified only by faith and not by other external means. The Word and the sacraments confirm (obsignare) this. Even Abraham was justified not by the sacrament of circumcision, but by faith in God (Rom 4), and circumcision was a confirmation of this. And when Paul writes: "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup" (1 Cor 11:28), it shows that the participants in the Lord's Supper are already justified and partakers of Christ. Through their participation in the Lord's Supper, they receive, as it were, a seal (sigillum), a visible testimony (testimonium) that they are justified by Christ's death, their sins are forgiven, and they have become partakers of Christ's good gifts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- If the people of Zurich were not clear in their confession, they are ready to provide further explanations. If they are mistaken, they are willing to be taught better. The Lord's Supper is a sign (symbolum) of unity and peace among believers. It is all the more regrettable that the devil and some people sow discord with it. However, the people of Zurich wish to fight the Antichrist together with all believers. May Melanchthon, with all his might, bring about the resolution of this internal dispute so that [the Protestants] can fight united under the leadership of Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- As a gift, Bullinger includes some writings translated by the people of Zurich from Greek into Latin: Theodoret's work "De providentia," Tatian's speech ["To the Greeks"], the treatise "Against the Gentiles" by the Bishop of Antioch, Theophilus, as well as other attached writings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings from the pastoral colleagues [Konrad] Pellikan, [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Heinrich] Buchter, the teachers Konrad Gessner, [Johann Jakob] Ammann, [Rudolf] Collin, [Otto] Werdmüller and all others. Greetings, among others, to [Justus] Jonas, [Kaspar] Cruciger, and [Johannes] Bugenhagen.</p>

      <p>To Philipp Melanchthon, his own, Bullinger. Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have refrained for a year and a half now from the duty of greeting and writing, most learned Philipp and most esteemed lord and dearest brother, not because I have ceased to love you or have begun to hate you, but because that unfortunate contention between Doctor Luther of blessed memory and us intervened. I greatly feared that if I continued, as I had begun, to greet you more familiarly and to send letters and books, I might incite Dr. Luther against you and arouse great suspicion among many more morose people that you were colluding with us. For I was not unaware, even from your last letters to me, what you had suffered not so long ago from certain more troublesome brothers. But now, since Dr. Luther has departed to the Lord and there is no longer any danger of exacerbation between you and him, which suggestions might provoke, where concord among brothers is not as it ought to be, I resume the duty of writing and will diligently continue in it, unless you are unwilling and my familiarity is not yet whole and pleasing to you. I do not wish to be a burden to you, my most esteemed Philipp, nor to inconvenience you; if it is not permitted to write with your good grace, I will gladly remain silent; meanwhile, I will nonetheless honor and love you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I rejoice that Doctor Luther, a learned man and one who served the church well, has migrated to the Lord, not because of the cause we had to litigate with him, the Lord knows, but because, freed from the greatest evils and snatched from future calamities, he happily completed his course and now rejoices in glory with our Lord, whom he served. Meanwhile, I am not moderately grieved that we are deprived of that man, whose help and counsel could have aided us in the common cause of religion. For although he had his faults, as is the nature of human flesh, he nevertheless obtained the notable gift of constancy, being strong and tenacious in maintaining the sincerity of doctrine against the Papists, to whom he wished to concede nothing through compositions and colloquies. He undoubtedly saw, with his singular prudence, that these men acted insincerely and malignantly in all things; he saw that there was little or no hope left in them. For our Savior says in the Gospel: "How can you believe, who receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?" He considered what Paul, the vessel of election, said about these men: "These are men of corrupt minds, resisting the truth and reprobate concerning the faith, and avoid them." We hope, however, that you too, by the grace granted to you by the Lord, will assert the truth and simplicity of doctrine against the corrupters with equal constancy and strength of spirit. If we can provide any counsel and assistance for the successful completion of this matter, we offer and promise all our efforts and ourselves to you and the pious. I do not think it is abhorrent to us, that your piety, Philipp, should be impure. We indeed responded to the short confession of Dr. Luther published against us; for we could not ignore what he imputed to us, especially to our teachers of pious memory and our churches. At the same time, we published the confession of our faith and doctrine; which, knowing it to agree with the confessions of all the saints, we hope will not displease your piety. Concerning the Lord's Supper, unless we wished to speak against our faith and conscience, we could not speak otherwise, especially as we are urged by the articles of apostolic faith and the matter of justification. For the articles of faith teach what we think about the glorified body of Christ; the pure and sincere doctrine of justification teaches that we are made acceptable to the Father not by sacraments, not by any external things, but by the mercy of God alone through Christ, or that we are received into the grace of God and heavenly gifts of life are exhibited to us, but are received by us through sincere faith, so that the gifts of life are conferred and exhibited by God alone gratuitously, received by us only by faith, announced by the word, and sealed by the sacraments. You know the Apostle Paul teaches this to the Romans 4, where he shows that Abraham was first justified by faith, and then, being already justified, received the sacraments, not indeed vain and useless, although he was justified. For he received circumcision as a sacrament, a sign or seal of the righteousness of faith, which was in the foreskin. You know, however, that the reason for the sacraments is the same, especially since the same apostle says: "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup." It is necessary, therefore, that those who legitimately communicate in the Lord's Supper are first justified and made partakers of Christ, but participate in the Supper to receive the seal of the righteousness of faith, a seal, I say, and a visible testimony instituted by the Lord himself, testifying that the faithful, justified and washed from sins by the body given and blood shed of Christ, are made members of Christ and heirs of all the good things of Christ.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>However, I do not intend now to discuss the Lord's Supper or the sacraments; I have only said these things on occasion. But if in that confession of ours some things seem not yet clearly and sufficiently said or considered, we will explain more fully when advised; if we seem to err, we will willingly endure to be taught. We acknowledge the Lord's Supper to be a symbol of agreement and concord, a bond of peace and unity, and therefore it grieves us greatly that it is seized by Satan and some people more than sufficiently pugnacious as a matter for wars and discord. However, we earnestly desire from the depths of our hearts to join hands and forces with all who call upon Christ in truth and to wage the Lord's battles for the church of Christ against the antichristians and to bring aid to the saints. This we indicate to you, the chief leader of the Lord's army, with a brotherly mind, beseeching by Christ our King and by brotherly love, that you direct all your counsels and all your strength to this end, that we, who have received Christ, contradict the antichrist, setting aside enmities and composing civil and internal wars, may become unanimous in Christ and be soldiers for the one Prince of Christ.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I send to your humanity some booklets, indeed Greek, but given to Latinity by our people and printed here last winter, namely Theodoret's books on providence, Tatian's oration, and the three books of Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, against the Gentiles, and some other booklets joined to them, which I pray you accept from me as a gift.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell, my most esteemed Philipp, and receive these things of mine with a brotherly mind, and farewell again. The brothers and all the colleagues greet you, Pellikan, Gwalther, Bibliander, Buchter, and also the professors, Conrad Gessner, Ammann, Collin, Werdmüller, and the rest. You will greet for us Dr. Jonas, Cruciger, Dr. Pomeranus, and the rest of our most esteemed lords and brothers.</p>
