    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller did not send a letter for a long time because he could not find a reliable messenger, but the mere frequency of his earlier letters shows that negligence is not at play here. Now he writes with the servant [...] of the Augsburg merchant Stephan Veit, even though there is little new to report and not everything can be entrusted to the letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] First, regarding Bullinger's letter [not received]. The Zurich pastors [Lorenz Meyer and Rudolf Schwyzer] have returned safely [to Augsburg]. They also delivered the letters from Zurich, including the letter from Bullinger and that of the Zurich councilors [from October 26]. The latter reported, just like Bullinger, about the dispute that arose between the pastors on their journey to Zurich and about the reprimand of Schwyzer in Zurich because of it. Furthermore, the councilors urged Haller in their letter to report any transgressions of the Zurich pastors in teaching or conduct immediately. Hopefully, they will abandon their obstinacy! They initially stayed with Haller again. However, since his apartment is too small, and it would have been inconvenient for everyone to continue living with him, they have taken a heated living room and [each?] a room in an inn in Augsburg, where they had already stayed for some time when they first arrived in this city. The owner’s family is respectable. It is regrettable, however, that the [two] pastors are staying in a public inn. But they will soon move to the accommodations intended for them, which are currently being repaired, in the Martinskloster. Today or tomorrow, it will be determined when they are to preach. Bullinger may learn more from them directly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Regarding Bullinger's question about how [Hans] Welser is doing and how he received the preface to the commentary on Luke, Haller unfortunately cannot speak freely. This is because letters from departing individuals are often opened at the Augsburg city gates to check for anything suspicious. Welser gratefully received the [German version of the] preface from Haller. He also gave it to his confidants to read, some of whom even copied it. However, he is anxious and appears extremely busy. Due to the outright hostility between him and [Georg] Frölich, he avoids Haller. Nevertheless, Haller remains loyal to Frölich (whom he often meets). Despite this, Welser continues to prefer attending Haller's sermons. Frölich, with whom Haller dined alone yesterday evening, could report more about Welser.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The date for the mayoral election is approaching. It is uncertain whether Welser will be re-elected. There are strange intrigues against him. Whether they are justified, Haller cannot judge. Certainly, jealousy plays a role, even though one must admit that Welser is anxious and therefore possibly not up to the upcoming [political] tasks. One must pray for him. After all, he has done much for the faith and for the [Reformation] in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Frölich is also under sharp criticism and is even in great danger. His envious opponents would like to remove him from his office and the council to deviate from the [political] course they have taken, which they do not dare to do as long as he is there. He also recounted yesterday evening that last week, two men were imprisoned and interrogated without his knowledge because of him, to raise an accusation against him. A guild master [...] informed him of this. Frölich would have immediately submitted his resignation if he were not concerned about the future of the official business (in which he is largely involved). Frölich also read Haller a very friendly letter from the Venetians to the people of Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] On Bullinger's behalf, the [two] Zurich pastors informed Haller about the decision of the [Four] Helvetic [cities] to provide the [Schmalkaldic League] with 16,000 mercenaries. Frölich had already been informed from Ulm about the entire negotiation in Zurich. However, a problem remains! At whose expense should these soldiers be mustered? If at the expense of the [Schmalkaldic League], the offer is in vain. For it is not people that are lacking, but money. Moreover, the [Schmalkaldic League] could hire twice as many landsknechts with the sum they would have to pay for the 16,000 Swiss mercenaries. Therefore, only one thing is expected, namely that the Helvetic cities also do something on their own for the salvation of Germany and for evangelical freedom. The Swiss could cover their expenses by occupying the territories of Austria and the clergy. The other states of the evangelical alliance are doing this as well. However, it is heard that the Swiss do not intend to do this. It is certain that the [Schmalkaldic League] cannot raise this high amount! Every month they already pay 600,000 guilders, which come almost solely from Augsburg, as the coffers of the other cities have long been empty. This raises a big question. Haller already knows (and this is not hidden from the [Schmalkaldic League]) that the Helvetians believe that the merchants' money bags must be emptied. And it is also true that money should not be wasted. But unfortunately, there is almost no money left, even though little has been achieved so far. It would be good if the Swiss contributed something of their own! This would earn them great and eternal esteem with the [Schmalkaldic League]. But since Haller knows that [the Swiss] have more people than financial resources available, he doubts that anything can be expected here. So much for that. Perhaps Frölich will also write about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The people of Ulm are said to have dismissed the eight Swiss companies. This is surprising because the war is not over yet! Probably they want to save money.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] There is nothing new about [Hans Wilpert] Zoller. Haller admonished him in a letter to stay away from prostitutes and married women, and to think about the outcome of his experience! Zoller responded extremely sarcastically. Haller then made it clear to him that his reaction to his friendly admonition was inappropriate. Since then, Haller has heard nothing more from him. Bullinger should not tell Zoller's relatives about this!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] In the postscript of his letter, Bullinger asked for the "Apology" of the [Schmalkaldic] princes [Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse], with which they justified themselves to the Emperor. Haller now sends it and hopes that it is the text Bullinger wanted. He also encloses the letter of refusal [from Emperor Charles V.]. So much for Bullinger's letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Now to the events that have occurred in the meantime, even though Haller has had enough of always conveying almost the same and even worse news, while the leaders of the [Schmalkaldic League] accomplish nothing!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] On October 25, Haller sent his last letter (with news up to that date) through the son [...] of [Hans] Schweiglin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] On the evening of October 26, eight of the captured Italian arsonists were handed over to the provost [...], who drowned them in the Wertach.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] On the 27th, 28th, and 29th, there was heavy shooting during skirmishes. The Landgrave reported to Augsburg that the [Schmalkaldic League] had behaved extremely bravely.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] On the 28th, the [Augsburg] citizens and mercenaries set out on raids with up to 200 horses and returned on the evening of the 29th. They brought back about 25 supply wagons and had stabbed some cavalrymen and captured five others, including a Spanish secretary [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] In the meantime, the Emperor set out again towards Lauingen and Dillingen. The [Schmalkaldic] troops followed him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] On the 30th, the [Schmalkaldic League] captured seven supply wagons.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] On November 1st and 2nd, mercenaries were mustered and paid [in Augsburg].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] On November 2nd, the Zurich pastors arrived.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">[19] On the 3rd, the peasants brought several prisoners into the city. Schertlin was angry because they had not killed them immediately. So the peasants drowned the prisoners in the river.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">[20] On the 4th, the [Schmalkaldic League] killed up to 40 enemy riders, captured 18 horses and money, and took three prisoners.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">[21] On the 5th, money was sent from [Augsburg] to the camp, accompanied by [Augsburg] riders and 1,000 arquebusiers up to Ulm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest22">[22] These days, 40 riders have set out again and have not yet returned.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest23">[23] The Emperor, who is now supposedly near Dillingen, is letting many miserable mercenaries go. They are ravaging and plundering the land of the Bishop [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] up to Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest24">[24] Haller does not want to write about the [Schmalkaldic] troops, otherwise, he risks the gallows at the fish market. However, he is displeased with them, even though Frölich does not judge their hesitation as harshly as he does.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest25">[25] Many imperial mercenaries are dying [of the plague]. Upon departure, the Emperor set the camp on fire. Many dead horses and people were found in it; also wounded and sick, of whom 800 were still alive, and some of them perished in the fire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest26">[26] Hopefully, the Italians and Dutch will all be dead soon! Then the Germans [in the imperial camp] would probably no longer resist, and bloodshed [among Germans] would be avoided. But Haller prefers to remain silent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest27">[27] Haller's only comfort is God. In view of the impending evil, the [penitence shown by people] seems insufficient. May the Lord help!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest28">[28] Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg is said to have often sent a messenger [the postmaster of Ebersbach] with letters to the Landgrave. But the messenger went with the letters to the Emperor. The latter opened them, forged the Landgrave's seal, and repeatedly had the Duke answered by the messenger, under the pretense that he was the Landgrave, to stay at home [with his troops]. When the whole thing became suspicious to the [Duke], he had the messenger seized. The latter confessed everything and was quartered, like Mettius Fufetius once was by the Romans.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest29">[29] [Hans] Vogler [the Younger] is quite peculiar! This week he set out with some soldiers without Haller's knowledge. He had borrowed weapons from a citizen [...]. The next day he returned and wanted Haller's permission to attack roaming enemies with a band of peasants and seize their loot. Haller sharply reprimanded him and threatened to remove all his belongings from the apartment if he went. He could only prevent him from going when he made him understand that he could be killed just as well by the [Schmalkaldic League] as by the enemies, since [his band] had neither a commander nor a banner and he also looked somewhat [southern]. Haller then brought him before the city clerk Frölich, and both reprimanded Vogler again. He has a good nature but is unstable. Haller will inform the father [Hans Vogler the Elder] about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest30">[30] Greetings from the [two] Zurich pastors. Nikolaus [Müller, called] Maier is one of the war councilors in Ulm. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther, to the other colleagues, and to the family.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest31">[31] [P.S.:] Just now comes the news that Duke Moritz [of Saxony] has invaded or is about to invade the territory of the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony]. Haller immediately went to Frölich, who confirmed this and said that the Duke [Elector Joachim II.] of Brandenburg, together with Duke Erich [II.] the Younger of Brunswick-[Calenberg-Lüneburg], is invading the Duchy of Brunswick, which was previously under the rule of the Elector [of Saxony] and the Landgrave. These are indeed devilish plots! Nothing is safe anymore, not even from one's own allies! May the Lord protect His own!</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings through Christ, etc. I do not doubt, most excellent man, that you are again wondering why my pen has been silent for so long. However, this is not due to our negligence, but to the scarcity of messengers. For I could not find anyone in all these days through whom I could safely write to you. The continuity of my previous letters will abundantly testify that I do not neglect any opportunity to write. Therefore, since a convenient messenger, the servant of Stephan Veit, a citizen and merchant of Augsburg, offers himself to me here, I cannot refrain from writing something, even though I have little news worth mentioning (which cannot even be safely written).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>First, I will respond to yours. Our brothers, the lords, have returned safely and unharmed, who brought your letters to me along with many others from friends, especially also from the lords of Zurich, who write to me the same as you about the dispute and reprimand of Schwyzer that arose between them on the journey. They therefore advise me that, wherever I see them teaching or living offensively, I should inform them at this time so that they may correct it. However, I hope they will cease their obstinacy somewhat. They stayed with me again. But since my lodging is very small, and it seemed neither convenient for them nor useful for me that they should be with me, they therefore rented a heated room and a bedroom in that inn where they first stayed when they came to Augsburg. The family is honest and pious, but it is not very commendable for them to stay there, because it is a public inn. However, I think they will stay there for a short time. For accommodations have already been assigned to them in the monastery of St. Martin, which, since they have not yet been habitable, will be prepared in the meantime while they summon their families. The hours for preaching have not yet been arranged for them. I think this will happen today or tomorrow. This about them. They may write more to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You ask about Welser, how he behaves; how he received your preface from me; about which indeed it is not very safe to write much. For letters are frequently opened at the gates of those departing, if there is any suspicion. However, he received the preface from me very kindly and gratefully. He gave it to many of his friends to read, many of whom also copied it and judge it very highly. However, since he is now busy, and the more so, the more timid he is, I meet him less often. This reason also adds, that there is a quarrel (I do not say a quarrel, but almost a deadly hatred) between him and my godfather, Mr. Laetus. To whom, while I adhere entirely, the other somewhat leaves me, although he most diligently attends my sermons as no one else's. Therefore, Mr. Laetus could describe him to you more accurately, with whom I dined alone last night and discussed many things about this very matter and other things. We two meet frequently, and while one complains to the other about his burdens, we take mutual comfort from these evils.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The time is now approaching again when he is to be elected to the consulship. However, strange intrigues are being made against him, so that he may be degraded; whether he deserves it, I cannot judge. He is accused greatly of timidity. If this is true (which I suspect), I fear he may be inferior in managing these very serious matters. However, we will faithfully pray to the Lord for him. And because he has hitherto shown himself to be an excellent supporter of our religion and has greatly helped our cause in this city, I do not think he should be completely rejected or condemned, but rather gathered and strengthened. But what always happens, happens, that envy accompanies fortune.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Mr. Laetus is also oppressed by the most severe envy of wicked men, so that he sometimes sustains not small dangers. They would gladly drive him from his office and from the senate, so that they might deviate somewhat more freely from equity, which they do not dare to do while he is present and criticizing them. The good man complained to me yesterday that this week two men were secretly imprisoned and examined because of him, to see if they had anything against him. This was indicated to him by a certain tribune. He was almost about to ask for leave to be given from his office. And indeed he would have done so, if those public dangers, of which he bears a great part, had not prevented him. He also read to me letters from the Venetians to our senate, which were very kind and friendly indeed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Our brothers have explained to us the plan of the evangelical Swiss revealed to them by you about selecting 16,000 to our parts; which Mr. Laetus also has from others. For from Ulm all those things that were done in Zurich have been written to him. But this knot has not yet been solved, at whose expense these soldiers should live; which has been left in doubt. For if at the expense of the empire, they think they have achieved nothing, for it is not men that are lacking, but expenses, and they could collect twice as many lancemen with the money they would be forced to spend on these 16,000. Therefore, they seek this one thing, that the evangelical cities of the Swiss also do something of their own for the salvation of all Germany and evangelical freedom. And all this is to be restored to them afterwards by occupying the territories of the priests and Austrians, just as the other orders of the Protestant confederation do. However, I do not hear that this is dear to the Swiss. They say they cannot bear the inhuman costs. For they spend more than 600,000 florins every month; which our city almost alone spends, the coffers of the other cities having long since failed. Therefore, there will be a great question here. I know what the Swiss say, nor are our voices hidden from them: "One must empty the merchants' sacks." But in truth, one must not waste. I fear they are almost scraping the bottom, although little has been achieved yet. God have mercy! Therefore, I wish, if it could be done in any way, that the Swiss would at least do something with their own stipends and expenses. For I do not doubt they would achieve something and prepare the greatest and eternal goodwill for themselves with the empire. But since I do not ignore their strength being more in men than in money, I also doubt myself if anything can be obtained from them here. I wanted to signify this to you in passing from what I heard from Mr. Laetus. He himself may write more to you. For he promised to do this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I also hear from the people of Ulm that 8 banners of the Swiss have been dismissed with permission. I wonder how this happens, whether they deserved it or not, since the war is not yet finished. I find no reason, except that perhaps they are sparing expenses.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>There is nothing to write about Zoller. I once advised him by letters to be frugal and to beware of prostitutes, especially married women, considering from his own example how well this has turned out for him! To which letters, in which I did my duty, he replied with such dog-like, inhuman, and abusive words that he gave me just cause to be grieved and to judge of him that, if he were wise, he would act otherwise. But I hope he has come to his senses, for I responded to those of his very copiously, showing him how prudently and deservedly he received that friendly admonition from me with such insolence. To which he has hitherto said nothing. However, I do not want you to say anything about these things to his relatives. For unless I believed you would keep these things to yourself, I certainly would not have written.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>You also ask in the appendix of your letters that I send you the apology of our princes, by which they justify themselves against the emperor. Therefore, I send it, if it is the one you ask for. I also added the letter of refusal, if you perhaps think it is that. These to yours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Now I will briefly add what has been done in the meantime, although it is a great weariness for me to write almost the same things repeatedly and worse than our previous ones, doing nothing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>On October 25, I sent my last letter to you through the son of Sveickli, in which I described what I had up to that day.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>On October 26, at night around 7 after supper, 8 of the captured Italians, who had orders to burn, were brought out and handed over to the provost, who led them to the nearest place to the city, threw them into the Wertach, and drowned them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>On the 27th, 28th, and 29th, there was heavy shooting to be heard every day. Skirmishes occurred, so that the Landgrave himself wrote to Augsburg that our people had never behaved better.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>On the 28th, our citizens and mercenaries set out with up to 200 horses, went out, and returned on the night of the 29th, having brought about 25 supply wagons, some with wine, some stabbed, and 5 captured cavalrymen, one of whom is a Spanish secretary.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>In the meantime, the emperor has moved back up towards Lauingen and Dillingen, and our people followed him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>On October 30, our people brought 7 supply wagons again.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>On November 1st and 2nd, there was a muster and payment.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>On November 2nd, the brothers also came.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>On November 3rd, the peasants brought some prisoners home. Schertlin was angry with them for not killing them. So the peasants had to take them again, lead them out, and throw them into the water.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest20">
      <p>On November 4th, our people were out again, met the enemy, killed up to 40 riders, brought in 18 horses and quite a lot of money, and also 3 prisoners.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest21">
      <p>On the 5th, money was sent to the camp. Our riders and about 1000 arquebusiers accompanied it to Ulm.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest22">
      <p>These days, 40 horses have gone out again, not yet returned. I do not know what they will bring.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div23" corresp="regest23">
      <p>The emperor lets many mercenaries, also some riders, go. They are plundering, burning, devastating the bishop's land miserably up to Augsburg. He is said to be lying at Dillingen now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div24" corresp="regest24">
      <p>What our people are doing, I cannot write a word. I am very impatient. But I must not say anything. Mr. Laetus is not very displeased with their delay. However, I do not know the reasons. It is good to be silent. The gallows stands at the fish market.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div25" corresp="regest25">
      <p>It is certain that the emperor's people are dying heavily. When he moved up and burned the camp, large heaps of dead horses and men were found, and up to 800 wounded and otherwise sick, who remained behind and were partly burned in the camp.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div26" corresp="regest26">
      <p>It is hoped that the Italian and Dutch people will soon be weak. Then the Germans will no longer defend themselves, and one can thus get through without bloodshed. But, etc., I am silent.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div27" corresp="regest27">
      <p>May God send it most graciously! To invoke Him, to complain to Him is my only comfort. Indeed, little repentance appears, although the evil is at the door; which the Lord may mercifully avert!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div28" corresp="regest28">
      <p>How the Duke of Württemberg has treated a messenger, I do not know if you know. He has often sent a messenger with letters to the Landgrave (as they say). The messenger went to the emperor. The emperor had the Landgrave's seal copied and wrote back to the Duke through the messenger, as if the Landgrave had done it, always hindering him, ordering him to stay at home. The messenger went back and forth several times, bringing such a message that it became suspicious to the prince. Therefore, he seized the messenger and learned everything from him. Therefore, he had him torn apart by horses, as happened to Mettius Fufetius by the Romans.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div29" corresp="regest29">
      <p>Vogler is remarkable. This week, when I was not dining at home and the soldiers were going out, he borrowed arms from a certain citizen and went out with them. The next day he returned, and when I did not know where he had been, he confessed and asked me to give him permission to go out again; he was going to attack wandering enemies with some peasants, hoping to seize some loot from them. I severely rebuked his impudent request and ordered him to remove all his belongings from the house if he did not want to stay. For I did not want to have him with me if he was going to attempt such things. I persuaded him to stay. I moved him with this sole reason, that if he attempted such a thing and was found by our soldiers, he would be killed by them as well as by the enemies, as he had neither a leader nor a password, and in appearance and face somewhat resembled a Spaniard. I therefore compelled him to return to the arch-scribe, and immediately followed him to Mr. Laetus, explained the whole cause, and both he and I severely rebuked him. He has a happy nature, but inconstant and changeable. I will write some things about this to his father, so that it will not be necessary to inform him of this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div30" corresp="regest30">
      <p>Farewell. Our brothers all diligently greet you. Mr. Nikolaus Maior is one of the war councilors in Ulm. You will greet Mr. Pellicanus, Theodorus, Gwalther, and others, as well as the most honorable family. Augsburg, November 8, 1546. Yours from the heart, Johannes Haller.</p>

      <p>Behold, while I am preparing to conclude these, a rumor flies that Duke Maurice has invaded or is about to invade the territory of the Elector. I immediately go to Mr. Laetus to inquire. He affirms it to be true, adding that the Duke of Brandenburg, together with Eric, the younger Duke of Brunswick, is invading the Duchy of Brunswick, hitherto held by the Elector and the Landgrave. Behold, what Satan does not contrive? This is done to us by the associates of our league! O God, how nowhere is faith safe! Faith has departed from the sons of men. Sanctity has perished. Everyone speaks vainly with his neighbor. Therefore, Lord, keep us from this generation forever!</p>
