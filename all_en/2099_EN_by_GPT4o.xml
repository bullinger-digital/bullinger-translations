      <p>S.P. I received your letters along with those of Vergerius, which were most welcome. Since I have nothing new except what I write to your lords, I do not respond to him, but I ask you to send a copy and greet him with my words. From England, you may be certain that this queen desires the son of the Emperor; unless the princes and magnates of the kingdom prevent it, as they are striving to do, I fear a bad outcome; for I have certain news from there. But what worse can happen to the whole Christian world? With us, all is well and in Corsica, things are excellent, and the Genoese are cooling off with their vain undertakings. We hear that the marquis is seeking peace and has his people with the King of the Romans, and it is now clear that the princes stand against the Emperor and his son for the brother. But I always fear the tricks of that old fox, who is accustomed to sway his brother's mind with a single word. Nevertheless, Maximilian abhors the Emperor and has his father completely under his control. As soon as you have any of these things, please do not allow us to believe falsehoods. For they are of great importance. Farewell, most excellent one.</p>
      <p>From Solothurn, December 6. Yours always, Bass[afontaneus].</p>
      <p>I believe you know that the Pope is very ill, the Turk has killed his firstborn son, and our people in Corsica have intercepted three banners of the Genoese...</p>
