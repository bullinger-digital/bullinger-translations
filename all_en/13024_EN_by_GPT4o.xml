    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] As always, Vadian was pleased with Bullinger's letter [not preserved], especially because it was so detailed. He is only annoyed that Bullinger felt the need to apologize for his openness, as if it had not been well received until now. It is well known how easily even significant people can despair. Like everyone else, they need admonition and comfort to better endure setbacks and recover more quickly!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] And certainly, Vadian would have welcomed Bullinger's admonition if he had needed it. But that is not the case. He did not write for a long time to avoid having to report his severe illness to Bullinger. In the future, Bullinger need not act as if Vadian is easily offended and ungrateful for his concern!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Now to the matter at hand. He has entrusted the letter intended for Johannes Haller to a trustworthy messenger [...] and hopes that the recipient has already received it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Emperor Charles V arrived in Augsburg around July 23, accompanied by Bishop Otto Truchsess von Waldburg and other notable princes. He insists that the Diet be opened on September 1. He promises Germany an unblemished justice, mutual assistance, and eternal peace. But not a word about the religious question! Instead, he emphasizes his victory over betrayal, even though he achieved it precisely through treacheries (many wise people have no doubt about it)! His ability to deceive is well known! There is fear that the whole thing aims at establishing a monarchy. Although some write from Augsburg that the relationship between Pope Paul III and the Emperor is marked by rivalry, Vadian is convinced that it is only superficial. There are several reasons for Vadian's view, especially the following: The Pope, in agreement with the Emperor and the French King [then still Francis I], sent Cardinal Reginald Pole (primarily to [combat] the Gospel) to Scotland to cause difficulties for the English King Edward VI. It is also certain that the suppression of the Bohemians by the Emperor was prompted by the Pope, in order to eradicate their faith (which partly does not align with papist nonsense).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Martin Frecht's wife [...] was taken by the plague. It is apparent to everyone that Frecht is having a hard time coping with it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings. More soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [P.S.:] Immediately after his arrival in Augsburg, the Emperor dismissed the garrison he had previously sent there. It is unclear why. Some conclude from this that he will settle everything in a mild manner like a father; others, however, think that this is just a deception so that one is not prepared for worse! Vadian thinks that the dismissal was to create more accommodations for the many visitors of the upcoming promising Diet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Yesterday, the council of St. Gallen received an official invitation to it. But it is already decided that the people of St. Gallen will not attend the Diet as before. Vadian inquired with the [imperial] messenger [...] whether he had also brought an invitation for Abbot Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee. The messenger said that the corresponding invitation was sent to the Bishop of Constance, Johann von Weeze, who, as the Emperor's representative, would ensure its delivery. He was instructed to deliver the invitation to the cities [of the Confederation]. Therefore, diplomatic approaches are preferred over coercive ones!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Bullinger is greeted again and may Vadian remain in his favor.</p>

      <p>Your letters, most learned man, have always been most welcome to me, and indeed this time even more so because they were longer. One thing saddened me, that you thought it necessary to excuse yourself for your frankness, which you used in your letters to me, as if I had not received with equanimity whatever freedom and candor you have infused into your letters thus far. You know well how easily great men have been shaken by trivial causes, so much so that even careful consolations were needed to prevent them from taking common setbacks too hard and to help them return to themselves more quickly.</p>

      <p>Indeed, I would have been fraternally admonished by you if I had committed or admitted anything of the sort. But since that is not the case, I did not want to inform you of my illness and pain. Therefore, I beg you not to suspect me of being so morose in nature that all your efforts towards me could not be most welcome and should be.</p>

      <p>To return to the matter at hand, know that I have entrusted the letters to be delivered to Haller to a trustworthy messenger, and I hope he is already enjoying them.</p>

      <p>The Emperor came to Augsburg around the 23rd of July, accompanied by the bishop of that city and other notable princes, and he is entirely focused on ensuring that the Diet, scheduled for the 1st of September, is held without delay. He promises Germany unblemished justice, mutual assistance, and eternal peace. No mention of religion! Much boasting of victory against traitors, although many good men are convinced that victory stood with the traitors. However, the victor has the power to embellish! All good men fear the faction and ambitions of monarchy, and from Augsburg, although there are those who write that much rivalry exists between the Pope and the Emperor, I believe it is cold, to be believed. Many causes contribute, especially that the Pope, through Cardinal Pole sent to Scotland, is plotting against the English King in the name of the Gospel, with the Emperor and the French King conniving, and it is certainly said that the Pope, with the Emperor's urging, has devised a plan to harass the Bohemians, for no other reason than that their religion (which indeed does not agree with papist madness) be removed.</p>

      <p>Frecht's wife was taken by the plague, to his great sorrow, and he is not bearing the public calamity with much equanimity.</p>

      <p>Farewell. I will write more soon. St. Gallen, on the first of August, in the year 1547.</p>

      <p>As soon as the Emperor arrived in Augsburg, he dismissed the garrison previously imposed on the city. The reason for this is unclear. Some have conceived good hope from this, thinking he will arrange everything paternally and kindly; others think it is a deception, so that they do not anticipate worse. I think they were ordered to leave the city so that more empty and convenient lodgings could be assigned to those who are gathering from all sides for the promising Diet. Yesterday, our council also received a diploma, reminding us to attend the Diet. But it has already been decided and decreed that we will remain within our own boundaries for the present.</p>

    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I inquired with the messenger whether he had also brought a mandate for the Abbot. He denied it and said that the letters summoning the Abbot were sent to the Bishop of Constance, who would take care of it in the Emperor's name. His task was given to the cities, so he said he would go straight to Schaffhausen to offer them their diploma. See how those willing to compromise are more than piratical.</p>
      <p>But farewell again and again, my most beloved Bullinger, and do not cease to love me.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most ample church of Zurich, lord and friend to be especially respected. Zurich.</p>
