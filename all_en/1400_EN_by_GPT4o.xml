      <p>Greetings. We are wondering about the council, whether they have convened and whether they have begun to do anything and whether they think they will accomplish anything after they have concluded. If you have any information about these matters, I ask you to let me know at your leisure; for I would not want to hinder you in your serious affairs on my account.</p>
      <p>We hear of a tyranny, such as has not been seen as long as the world has stood: the Emperor forbids that preachers be expelled from the empire, who have hitherto preached the gospel of Christ, which the Lord alone commanded to be preached throughout the whole world; thus I do not believe it has ever been heard. But I hear the reason: they say that Julian has been persuaded that he will not have any success against the Turk unless he first expels Christ, and I believe he has been persuaded thus; for he could not do what he does unless he were possessed by many demons. He strongly threatens Württemberg, and he has written to the people of Strasbourg; what response he has received, I do not know. This I know: Marbach has been secretly sent to Wittenberg to inquire what should be done; this indicates the pusillanimity of the people of Strasbourg. In this vice we all wallow; so much does the prince of this world prevail.</p>
      <p>In reality, I have found that when I go out, I cannot sin more grievously in the eyes of most than when I speak ill of the Pope. They impudently flee from the temple. And although they are such that I could despise them, yet their impudence pains me.</p>
      <p>And what do you think will happen if the council is to achieve the outcome it seeks? Indeed, I foresee persecution and no one to resist; so much have all contracted a nausea from the unrest that the gospel seems to bring. And the more diligence you apply in exalting Christ, the greater the nausea becomes among the common people. If the Lord retains anyone in persecution, he will retain some of the preachers and those few. No one wants God, no one wants Christ; all seek the mass, under the pretext of which all sins are covered, and meanwhile, God is satisfied for everything.</p>
      <p>The mass is an excellent thing: it brings wealth, it brings dignities, it removes iniquities and confers grace; therefore, it is deservedly sought after.</p>
      <p>But I truly do not sense a greater stench in the whole papacy than the mass; for if it were not, all things of Christ would be flourishing; while it is, Christ lies, Christ vanishes, and all his power perishes. I fear, therefore, that the word of Christ may be taken away from us; would that this fear were only a fear. While I look at the sacrifice, I seem to see an infernal fire solely because of the mass. How abominable is he in the sight of God, who daily performs the mass and thereby fully buries Christ. But enough of these things.</p>
      <p>Coelius received letters from Italy that seven hundred Italians were slain along with the best leader the Pope had, by the Turkish army.</p>
      <p>From the court of Count Georg, someone told me that the imperial fleet was driven into a certain port by the French, from which it cannot exit unless freed by a stronger force. From Paris, someone writes that they fear war from the Emperor; thus the Emperor attempts war against the Turk by sea and land: against Parma, against Saxony, against Württemberg, against Christ. Let us see whether he will also engage with death at some point and with what success.</p>
      <p>I hope in the Lord that he will defend his church and deliver us, who are weaker, from such a powerful enemy; for what he does, he does against the Lord. Why, then, should he not sometimes exert his power, since he is most powerful? Farewell with your family, I wish Theodor, Rudolf, and Otto well, until I can write to them as well. In Basel, on the Sunday after Felix and Regula, from my bed in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
