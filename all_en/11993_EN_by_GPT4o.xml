    <p xml:id="regest1">Would like to write to Bullinger more often, but is hindered by his office with Prince [Ottheinrich von der Pfalz], as all preachers of the Palatinate Church, surrounded by opponents, have to endure unspeakable hardships; thanks for Bullinger's book against Cochläus [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“]. It is the appropriate reaction to Cochläus’ shamelessness, who might also try to confuse Bartholomäus, as Bartholomäus has sent Bullinger's book with a commendatory letter to the [Bishop] of Eichstätt, where Cochläus is hiding; therefore, it would be advisable for Bullinger to publish any possible response invoking [Count Palatine] Ottheinrich and to warn against such people in a [dedicatory] epistle. The Frankfurt canon had gone to Mainz, then to Saxony, and from there to Silesia, where he was called by the Bishop of Eichstätt [Moritz von Hutten], perhaps to counteract the spread of the Gospel in Bavaria. Greetings to the [church] servants and recommendation, also from the prince, to Vadian.</p>

      <p>Greetings more than the greatest.</p>
      <p>Although I have often resolved to write letters to you, most learned and pious Bullinger, I have always been hindered by the affairs of the most illustrious prince and of religion and piety. For the Palatinate Church, long since reborn by the word of the living God as by an immortal seed, as Peter says, cannot be described by how many labors and anxieties they have burdened me and all of us who preach Christ here in the borders of Bavaria, so that we might retain these very churches, like new plants, in the purity of the word and sacraments amidst such a crowd of pseudo-apostles, Cochläus, Scots, and other papist monsters. But since I have been gifted by you, most learned man, with a paper gift, namely a book written against Cochläus, setting aside all business, although very numerous, I can do no more than, even if I have nothing worthy to write back, at least in this small writing of whatever quality, give thanks in some part for the received benefit. Therefore, with a grateful mind, accept from me what I write here to you, so that I may thus satisfy the request of your letters.</p>
      <p>First, it was not necessary for me, with my little progress in letters, to ask for this judgment, whether you have satisfied Cochläus in your response. For having read your book, I thus judge with myself: the unclean and slow-moving snail is so refuted that it cannot be more vehemently brought into order by anyone. But since this vain man has long since become shameless, it is certain that he is preparing again to retort against you with ill-conceived and most inept, not to say even most impious writings. Perhaps he will also try to disturb me with his most tedious quibbles.</p>
      <p>For with a rather lengthy encomium in epistolary form, I sent your book along with a letter written to him to Eichstätt (for here the tortoise hides in the college of canons, which they call the choir of St. Willibald), by his own messenger. Among other things, I asked him thus, not to be like Ishmael, a harsh and fierce man, against all, lest again the hands of all be against him. For if he provoked all learned men against himself, he could hardly satisfy, not to say even respond to, one, especially Bullinger, let alone so many and such great men. Therefore, if Cochläus, by his usual impudence, should respond, I wish, if you judge it worthy to respond to such a foolish donkey, that you would publish those secondary writings in the name of the most illustrious prince Duke Ottheinrich, I pray, with a prefixed letter, in which you remind the prince to beware of such foolish men or not to care, as they are useful for nothing other than stirring up seditions.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, where this snail hides, I have shown a little above in parentheses. But to be more certain where the tortoise holds itself, behold, I will show more rudely, but more clearly. There is a rather famous town. There is the episcopal seat. The river called the Altmühl flows by, two miles distant from Neuburg on the Danube. Here the snail hides itself. The name of the town is Eichstätt. First a canon of Frankfurt Mainz, from there he went to Saxony, then he withdrew to Silesia, the duchy of Bohemia. Now called here from Silesia by the Bishop of Eichstätt, perhaps to prevent the nascent gospel in Bavaria, if at least he could, both watering and growth.</p>
      <p>Farewell much.</p>
      <p>Given at Neuburg on the Danube in the year of our Lord 44, on the day of the Apostle James.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name all the ministers, especially make Vadianus either familiar to me or to the prince.</p>
      <p>Adam Bartholomäus, of the ducal court from the sermons of Neuburg on the Danube, your brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant preacher of the divine word in Zurich in Switzerland, my very esteemed lord and brother.</p>
