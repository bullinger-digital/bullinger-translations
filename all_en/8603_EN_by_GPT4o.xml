      <p>Your letters delighted me greatly, dearest brother in Christ: I received them not before the end of the month of June. I also received two booklets together, one against the testament of Johannes Brenz, a man deluded by multiple errors: you timely blocked the way for this error of his, which was creeping in. The other is a very strong defense against that terrifying bull, more vain than any bull: in which you have so thoroughly defeated the author that no breath of free air remains. We all owe you much, because the cause of us all is so dear to your heart. I wrote to you on this subject in a dry and diluted manner; but another of my brothers dealt with it more fully and copiously, who also provided you with a copy of the bull itself. This attack on the bull was extorted from your piety by our love, the indignation of the matter, and the most ardent zeal for truth.</p>
      <p>Thus far you have lived in the most holy and sacred studies of the divine word, so that you might cultivate and promote it in every way.</p>
      <p>You were called to this from an early age; you have adorned this calling of yours diligently, and the Lord will grant that you persevere in it until the end of life, for the tranquility of conscience and the eager expectation of all the pious. Hence it is that you seize every opportunity to deserve well of the Christian religion, and to sharply observe the enemies of piety.</p>
      <p>Hence it is that you timely heal the disease of Brenz, and restrain the fury of the bull. Indeed, I will most diligently ensure that our queen, most learned in Latin and Greek, understands your zeal and benevolence towards her, and I will make sure that she takes the sweetest taste of your booklets. As for the way you commend to us for handling your booklet, we are thinking of having it printed as soon as possible, and published under the name of Heinrich Bullinger; and I will send you, as soon as I can, several copies.</p>
      <p>That Heinrich Butler, whom you write about, has not yet visited me. I will make sure that, when he comes to me, he will not lack my assistance. May the best and greatest God keep you, dearest brother in Christ, for many years, for the benefit of the church; and we pray that you commend us to the Lord in your prayers, especially those of us who labor in His vineyard. I impart no new things to you; for my brother Lord Horn promised to provide that.</p>
      <p>Your dearest brother in the Lord, Richard, Bishop of Ely.</p>
      <p>[...] To the most esteemed brother in Christ and my dearest, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the church of Zürich. [...] To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, let these letters be given. In Zürich.</p>
