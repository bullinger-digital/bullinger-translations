      <p>Most illustrious man, I give great thanks to your piety for appeasing Gasner; I certainly promised nothing beyond Matthew.</p>
      <p>Some of the brothers from Geneva are altogether more irritable than I would like. They have criticized Gribaldo too much, and they want their jurisdiction to extend too widely and almost to dominate the churches. I have seen the form of words they have written to me so far. However, I think they should be tolerated because there are many praiseworthy things in them. Gribaldo will not say a word, he observes what you have advised, and what I have still impressed upon him. Thus, spirits are conquered, not by harshness. I suppose you have seen what Westphal has written against Calvin. If only he had written more calmly, that is, if he had emulated you who had written a most moderate letter. It is one thing to act against the Antichrist, another against the Lutherans. Now I hear many things. Spirits are embittered. The council could not have fallen into a worse condition. If only he would give way to the foul storm and keep himself in the harbor. There has been no assembly since the gospel was renewed in which the Protestants have obtained more. The Emperor thought he should comply, as he intended to sail. You know a convention is being held below Mainz, where a new alliance is being discussed. See what the Duke of Prussia has decided in the Osiandrian cause; for this is the advice of Melanchthon inserted into his decree. He urges that I come to him; but it will scarcely be possible for me; for some Italian brothers, who have decided to leave Babylon, have expressly said they will not depart unless they are certain they will find me in the duchy at least, as soon as they arrive. I would not want this prize to be lost through my fault. A place and circumstance will give me counsel.</p>
      <p>I have translated Brentius's book into Asotus and now I will print it somewhere with additions. When the image comes from Bern, I beg you to send it to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well together with your family, with Gwalter and all the colleagues and brothers. In Reutlingen, the day before the calends of November 1555.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zürich, honorable brother. In Zürich.</p>
