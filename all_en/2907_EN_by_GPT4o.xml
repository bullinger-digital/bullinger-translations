      <p>S. D. We are all deeply saddened by your poor health.</p>
      <p>May the Lord restore you to us. For your letters written to your homeland, I give great thanks to your kindness. They are very pleasing to all of us as they are written piously, learnedly, and prudently. May the Lord grant that they bear abundant fruit. With us lived for some time an old man, Mr. Franz Lysmaninus, who heard the confessions of Queen Bona, of that Seraphic order. However, he renounced monasticism and lived for some time in Geneva and listened to our Calvin. Finally, he came to us. The same man, recalled to Poland in January, left his wife here and went to Poland, heavily laden with our letters to the Most Serene King, to some princes, and to learned men.</p>
      <p>We are expecting at any moment what he will write back or when he will return. He has great hopes for Poland. May he not be disappointed in his hope. If you have anything about Polish affairs and share it with us, you will do us a great favor. You indicate that there is hope for a colloquy to be established to settle the doctrinal disputes among those who profess the gospel. You wish that I inform you as soon as possible what, if any of ours were called, you could promise about us. Indeed, my most esteemed lord and always honorable and dearest brother in the Lord, I will not dissemble here, but I will candidly and freely open my judgment to you, and I beseech you by Christ to consider kindly. And I wrote the same things yesterday to our Calvin.</p>
      <p>I greatly fear that a fire much more dangerous than the one we intend to extinguish will arise from the colloquy, which is instituted with such men. For those with whom the colloquy will be held are either of a more vehement and plainly Lutheran disposition, like Schnepf, Stoltzius, Amsdorf, Westphal, and countless others of this kind, or more moderate, like Melanchthon, Pacaeus, and a few others. But these, by their nature, I will not say softness, will not want to offend those. The others, however, by their incredible obstinacy and fierce barbarity, will not yield even a hair's breadth, however sound and many reasons they may hear. For they hold this as a sacred anchor, not to depart from the clarity of the words, nor to concede a syllable to the Suermeris. While the blessed memory of illustrious men were conversing at Marburg, they could not agree on the principal point. I call it the principal point for which they were especially convened. For Luther repeatedly and to the point of weariness reiterated his: This is my body, and he clung to it stubbornly. This is what his disciples learned from him, much more stubborn and furious than their teacher.</p>
      <p>What is more, immediately after the colloquy, Luther himself spread letters in which he boasted that not even a letter had been snatched from his hands by those Suermeris, as they were unlearned, rude, fanatical men, etc. Others sang victory in public and sacred pulpits and spat the most unworthy things on the best men. Nor is there any reason for us now to promise ourselves other and better things with some sweet imagination. These Lutherans have been too well known to us for thirty years now. But you yourself have experienced their humanity.</p>
      <p>However, better things might seem to be hoped for from the modesty and fairness of the Princes, by which the harshness of some barbaric preachers might be broken or at least softened. Although I am not unaware that there are many pious and most fair men among the Princes, I also know that the Princes will consider us kindly if we either yield from our doctrine or at least wrap it in certain coverings of words by which clarity is obscured.</p>
      <p>Then indeed the form of concord will be the Augsburg Confession, which in the meantime, although offered so many times by Bucer, our churches never wanted to recognize or accept, both for many reasons and also because it is explained too grossly by the Apology and approaches the papists. If we do not want to accept it, I know well enough that we will be dismissed as proud and stubborn. And certainly what Westphal writes about the Augsburg Confession, all Lutherans are sure to feel. But why should I not hope for greater things from the best Princes, listen. Most of the Princes are professedly Lutheran in the article of the supper: they all depend on the Emperor, to whom they presented the confession at Augsburg, which the papists themselves approved in the tenth article. In those very Augsburg diets, the doctrine of the Zwinglians was condemned. It was also condemned in subsequent imperial diets. Nor is it obscure what was done at the last Augsburg diets. Otherwise, the best Prince of WÃ¼rttemberg, persuaded by his learned men, offered a confession in the doctrine of the supper well Lutheran to the Council of Trent. You know this Prince now holds the primacy among the Princes. I will never be persuaded that the Princes will yield even a little from those things which they have publicly presented to the Emperor, the Orders of the empire, and the council. They will not want to incur the crime of infamy, inconstancy, or defection, as if they seem to either support us or collude with the Zwinglians, whom neither Augustus, nor the Emperor, nor the Pope wants or can bear, as they have testified and published by so many and such decrees and recesses of the empire.</p>
      <p>Now I myself do not see what else can return to our churches from this colloquy than great disgrace and detriment. When our men return home with the matter unfinished, indignation will increase, scandal will increase, and ample material will be supplied to the impious for playing, laughing, and boasting. What is more, I do not fear in vain that much sharper contentions about some other doctrines will be stirred up than we now think. In these, examples terrify me. For, to say nothing of the imperial colloquies, how much, I ask, harm did Mr. Bucer's colloquies give to the churches of both Germany and Switzerland? He certainly sought peace and seemed to want to care for the wound of the daughter of Zion with some good zeal, but the event itself proved that he acted imprudently and badly. I heard from the English, men of no fleeting faith, that Bucer, when asked about the cause of the supper and the cause of concord, replied: I see that God does not want to instruct the churches through me. Therefore, I wish you an excellent spirit of prudence, my best brother, lest you do anything in instituting the most dangerous colloquies that you may later regret. If Mr. Vergerius opens any hope to you, I am surprised. For he wrote to me that you are indeed striving for a synod to be convened, but in vain. At this very hour, he indicates that the minds of his people are most exasperated because of the books published by Calvin, Bernhard, and me, and now nothing else is to be hoped for than a fight.</p>
      <p>I do not think the Bernese will easily agree to any colloquy, as they still remember how much the unhappy colloquies of Bucer exercised them and involved them in so many dangers. As for ours, they will hardly send any delegation if Bern sends none.</p>
      <p>If they do send, they will send on no other condition than to listen, propose and defend the doctrine of our church, but neither to accept nor reject, approve nor disapprove, but to report the acts themselves home to the senate and the people. For this is the native custom, and they will not allow themselves to be persuaded otherwise. For they too have been vexed and wearied to the point of disgust by those Buceran colloquies. As for me, I would rather indeed converse with the most papistic than with this kind of men, whom I see have renounced humanity and armed themselves with deplorable obstinacy, so that I may not say anything more bitter.</p>
      <p>I wanted to recount these many things to you, reverend man and dearest brother, so that you might not be ignorant of our thoughts. You, for your piety, consider everything well. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, the Calends of May 1556.</p>
      <p>Please take good care of the letters you receive addressed to Mr. Micronius. The best old man, Mr. Pellicanus, has died, and Mr. Peter Martyr is now called to his place. All the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
