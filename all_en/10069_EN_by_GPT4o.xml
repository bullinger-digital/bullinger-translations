      <p>Peace and grace through Christ.</p>
      <p>To all our afflictions, yet another, the saddest and most pernicious of all, has been added; for our Oecolampadius, the unique pillar of all piety and learning and the most vigilant pastor of all churches, met his death on November 24th. If I wished to pursue this grief with just and worthy tears, all my strength would fail me. But what else should the faithful think or say than that of Job: "The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away, as the Lord" etc. [Job 1:21]. Nor can it be hidden from you the miserable demise of our most pious and diligent Hieronymus Bothanus, by which it has happened that our church is bereft of two never sufficiently lamented, a bishop and a minister.</p>
      <p>In these sorrows, we especially remember you, most learned Heinrich, as one whose learning, as well as piety, fervor of spirit, modesty, and skill are well known; it would therefore be most pleasing to us if you could come as soon as possible, so that if it pleases your mind to serve our church, we might discuss and deliberate on this matter in person. Do not be offended, excellent man, by my name perhaps unknown to you or the lack of any familiarity; those are sufficiently friends and family whom the spirit of Christ and the same pursuits bind together. Trusting in this confidence, you can freely visit my house and enjoy the hospitality of a brother; however, do let us know your mind in the meantime.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>November 27th, in the year 31.</p>
      <p>Yours, Markus Bertschi, minister of the church at St. Leonhard.</p>
      <p>To the learned and upright man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his beloved brother, etc.</p>
