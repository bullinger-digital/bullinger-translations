      <p>Worthy and most gracious, dear sir, I have duly read your letter and faithful warning and good intentions, and understood it in the best way, and you should not doubt that it will reach its place, where it may bear fruit, within a few days. My son has ridden out on this matter and then on another. So I intend to set out next Monday and, with God's help, personally ride to my lord and tirelessly help to promote it, hoping that I might finally bring it to a good work. It has never been more timely and necessary for many reasons. Would God, you were with me for an hour; you would hear wonders, on which nail it hangs.</p>
      <p>It is with me as with you; I know that my king would gladly be greatly provoked to war and has it before him; but to fully obtain cause, he would like to delay until next spring. However, he does not consider that people are also watching him, thinking it should not be understood that he has struck the emperor in the right eye with Parma and that all his armada has joined the Turks, attacked Sicily; Calabria has already received a setback from Dragut; without a doubt, the cunning devil will not rest longer. There is indeed a suspicion that the emperor will take Lorraine for betrayal; but my king tastes the talk, has had 21 companies of adventurers mustered at Troia within 14 days. I also know well and have partly seen that he has mustered 116,000 horses and is waiting for this matter. I should not have concealed this from you, to whom I wish much honor and good from God. God protect you. Given in Basel on the 16th of July in the year 1551.</p>
