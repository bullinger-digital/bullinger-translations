      <p>The grace of God, the heavenly Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ be with you at all times, pious, godly and Christian, venerable Lord Heinrich Bullinger, and also with the honorable city and canton of Zürich and with all Christian people, etc. That I undertake to write to your wisdom, I have not done presumptuously, but with fear and trembling. But as in all things, I pray to God the Lord through our dear Lord Jesus Christ, that my simple writing may have a pleasant appearance to you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Highly learned and Christian lord, it seems to me that I am daily slandered by you and other my dear and gracious lords regarding the doctrine and way of life, and since this might also happen to me at your synod by my adversaries, etc., I ask you in this my humble writing, for the sake of our dear Lord Jesus Christ, that you do not believe everyone, but rather let me come to a defense. I will indeed not testify on my own behalf, but let honorable and Christian communities testify on my behalf with good hope that you will be satisfied.</p>
      <p>Therefore, gracious, Christian lord, although I have much to write, I will now strive for brevity and promise with the help of Almighty God to work faithfully in the holy gospel and not to bury the single talent. May God grant grace to all evangelical church servants, including me as a humble servant. Amen.</p>
      <p>For I am eager and willing to commit myself with God and the truth together with Christian people and communities in the honorable county of Toggenburg. May the Almighty, eternal God graciously preserve you, your household, together with the honorable city and canton. Amen.</p>
      <p>Rudolf Meyer, at this time preacher in Herisau in the land of Appenzell, your ever humble servant.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, godly and Christian lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher in Zürich, my kind, dear, honorable lord, to hand.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
