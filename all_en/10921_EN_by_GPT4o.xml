      <p> That I have more rarely sent Philipp Melanchthon's "Dialectic," which you have long requested from me, I wish you to consider not without reason. For I thought I would have the latest edition, much more illustrious and complete, beautifully adorned by the author himself with clear tables in the ten categories. Since I have not found this, I will not hesitate to send another. But as soon as I obtain a copy of the other, it will be sent to you immediately. I have also added a not inelegant booklet on the discipline of finding arguments, as well as the "Dialectic" by Neobar, which I used in Paris with my teacher. These are indeed either nothing new or certainly little, but they contain the first principles of dialectics in a new way of teaching. I wanted to send this not for your use, but for you to glance through. If it does not displease you, you might hand it over to be read by the boys. For the nature of dialogue itself has this, that it alleviates tedium, which you will easily feel even in this. Furthermore, I have just received the compendium by Bartholomäus Latomus, which he has again expanded and revised in the art of disputation of Rudolf Agricola, only a single copy. Since there is a great scarcity of copies with us, I have given it to the printers to be reprinted for the use of students. At the next fair, I hope, it will be completely finished. </p>
      <p> I have nothing new to write. However, I will not omit this: Today letters have been brought from the French, by which we have certainly learned that the Dauphin, the son of the King of France, has died. Whether it is true, we also doubt. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Due to the lack of time and the quick departure of the messenger, I could hardly write this. Therefore, take it in good part. </p>
      <p> Written hastily, in Basel, August 20, 1536. </p>
      <p> Yours sincerely, as much as is subject. </p>
      <p> To the learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the divine word among the people of Zurich, his especially esteemed patron. From Zurich. </p>
