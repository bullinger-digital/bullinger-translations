      <p> Greetings. I am waiting for you to write about the recent assembly. I cannot tell you anything that you cannot hear much more fully and clearly from that Memmingen consul, Funck, my special friend, in person. I commend him to you for this reason as well. One of our citizens has returned from France, affirming that everything is peaceful there; the king, carefree about all matters, is indulging in pleasures not worthy of a Christian king, but nevertheless has sent soldiers to the Scots to assist them against the English. May our peaceful Lord King inspire the hearts of our princes towards a solid and true peace in Christ! Farewell in Him. May 24, 1548. </p>
      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blarer. </p>
      <p> I wanted to send this to you through Consul Funck. But he has already left. Now I am sending you these two writings, which, if it seems appropriate, I ask you to return as soon as possible. However, I earnestly request from you, by our friendship and our Savior Christ, that you respond to the questions I am sending here, for the gift of the spirit, which we recognize and honor in you, as soon as you have the opportunity, since delay cannot be without danger. You will also consult other men outstanding in spirit and judgment, so that we may hold the clearly explained will of our Lord God, which we have resolved to follow and firmly grasp. In this matter, you will serve not only our church but also other churches that are in the same boat with us. We place little trust in our own judgment here, as in present dangers, emotions, which are the worst advisors, often hinder sincere judgment. </p>
      <p> Kindly and respectfully greet all your ministers in the Lord with your whole household, and diligently urge them to make perpetual prayers for us before the Lord. May 26. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother in the Lord, most venerable and beloved. In Zurich. </p>
