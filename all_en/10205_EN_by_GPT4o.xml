    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Bern are so disturbed by Bullinger's letter, in which he hinted at the imminent danger of war, that they are sending a special envoy to Zurich to ask the council for more information. At the request of the people of Bern, Bullinger is to persuade Zurich to inquire about Bernese assistance in case of emergency; unofficially, this is already assured by the most prominent in Bern. This letter is to be burned, those from Bullinger are in a safe hiding place. Haller reiterates Peter Huber's appointment as a schoolmaster in Bern. He wishes for the latest works of Pellican and Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Dearly beloved brother, what you wrote last time frightened me so much that I spent several sleepless nights. However, when the patrician brothers considered the matter more seriously, they ensured that, with the unanimous consent of all, a messenger was sent to you, who implores through letters, so that our people may understand from yours what they have either from reliable rumors or from the testimony of scouts, so that our people may also foresee the imminent and greater danger that threatens them after you. An expedition was almost undertaken. But it was decided not to proceed, so as not to be interrupted by practical matters. Today, they certainly gave me courage, which I did not expect. But they ask you, who have great authority among your people, to request from our senate, either through letters or messengers, since they wish to stand by the law and also desire peace; if they are overwhelmed by force from the mountain people, whether our people, by the strength of the alliances, would be willing to stand by them. Communicate this with your people according to your wisdom. Scouts have been sent to Italy, Valais, etc. Therefore, do not despair nor trust in man. For although they promise nothing openly, yet the best among them promise to do what befits brothers. For God's sake, burn this letter, and do not worry about yours, unless you prefer that I return them all. For I have them all very securely hidden.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, ensure that Peter Huber is with us on the Sunday of Invocavit. If he does not want the position, let him indicate it soon; for the school lacks an assistant teacher.</p>
      <p>Finally, direct this messenger, while he awaits a response from the senate, to Froschauer, so that he may send the first quire of the first volume of Pellican, then what has been printed in the second volume, and if anything has been printed in your Romans.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>January 8.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his dearest lord and brother.</p>
