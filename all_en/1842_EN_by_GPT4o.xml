      <p>Most illustrious man, etc.</p>
      <p>I received your letters along with the vessels, which you diligently arranged to be transported here, as I had requested. Although they do not pertain to me at all (for they belong to a certain friend of ours, a truly pious man, who is currently residing in Italy, but whom I hope will come to us shortly, for whom I am taking these into custody), nevertheless, it was as pleasing to me as if they had indeed pertained to me, and I give and hold no less thanks to you. I was prepared to pay both for the transport and for the duty, whatever was necessary, down to the last penny; but since you indicated that I should not pay anything at all, but that the entire payment should be demanded from Vergerio, I did as you advised, yet I will act otherwise whenever you advise otherwise. I have nothing more to write to you now, my dear Bullinger, except that I wish to assure you that I am very eager to do you a favor in any matter if I can. Farewell in the Lord, whom I ask you again and again to commend me to in your prayers for your piety.</p>
      <p>Geneva, April 10, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord as a son, Galeazzo Caracciolo.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, a lord to be especially revered, etc.</p>
      <p>Count Caracciolo of Naples.</p>
