      <p>Greetings. We pray for you, dearest and most esteemed lord and godfather, and for all of yours, not only for this year but for many more happy, fortunate, and most blessed years. We especially ask the Lord to keep you safe for us and the church for a long time. We return your letter to Beza and express our great thanks to you for sharing it with us. We have already warned him before and will continue to do so; for his schemes displease us, as they could easily cause us great disturbances again if he continues in this way. I am glad that my preface pleases you; I will correct those things you have pointed out.</p>
      <p>I will also form the title according to your prescription. In the meantime, I ask you to grant me this, that I may use the term "hochgelehrt" (highly learned).</p>
      <p>It was indeed your modesty to remove it; but it is my duty to use it; for I would have omitted it very rudely, and it should not be burdensome for you to accept that title which the judgments and thoughts of all the pious confer upon you. I have long been compiling a threefold index: the first containing the material of each sermon in order, the second an alphabetical index of things and words, the third of the places of scripture explained. I do not remember you writing anything to me about your prefaces, and upon searching your letters sent to me within a few weeks, I find nothing of it. However, they are translated, as they contain beautiful and necessary materials.</p>
      <p>I only fear that the printer may not be able to complete the work before the fair. Therefore, it seems necessary that Froschauer himself prints the title, preface, and your prefaces, and, if necessary, also part of the work.</p>
      <p>In those prefaces of yours, I would like you to supply me with the titles of the King of England and the Marquis of Dorset in the German language, so that nothing inappropriate is placed here. I have translated the king's title as follows: "To the most illustrious King Edward VI of this name, King of England and France, Lord of Ireland, Prince of Wales and Cornwall, Defender of the Christian Faith" etc. The other title to the Marquis of Dorset as follows: "To the illustrious prince and lord, Lord Henry Grey, Marquis of Dorset, Lord of Ferrers, Groby, Harington, Bonville, and Astley, counselor to the royal majesty and the entire crown of England, etc." The symbols prefixed in the Latin original I have not yet translated; I do not know how all can be conveniently expressed in the German language. They are mentioned in the first of your prefaces; if they were omitted, it would have to be noted in the margin there. Write what seems appropriate.</p>
      <p>In the second sermon of the first Decade, in the chapter where it is stated that all true piety has been handed down to us in the holy scriptures, after the passage from the apostle 2 Timothy 3 "All scripture" etc., you finally add: "I do not think anyone is so stupid as to interpret these words of Paul only about the Old Testament" etc., which passage I do not yet fully understand, and I forgot to ask you about it sooner.</p>
      <p>If anything needs to be changed, it could be added in the corrections; for I have simply followed your words; for it seems indeed that the apostle is speaking about the scripture of the Old Testament; for the books of the New Testament were either not yet all written at that time or at least not yet compiled. And you yourself also seem to feel this way; although these words refer to something else, when you soon apply this passage, you write: "If the doctrine of the Old Testament is complete, how much more complete will it be if the book of the New Testament is added. Therefore, you yourself also seem to understand this passage about the Old Testament; otherwise, that argument drawn from comparisons would not hold.</p>
      <p>How then do you call stupid those who understand this passage only about the Old Testament? Forgive me, please, if due to the dullness of my mind I do not grasp your meaning. We have nothing new, except that it is written from Augsburg that the book of Adam the Christian, printed in German in Zurich, is held in high esteem by many; however, it seems that the good man, whoever he is, is somewhat mistaken in it, as he mentions several times a certain virtue emanating from the body of Christ, when it is not properly of the body, but of the divinity united with the body. Musculus observed this; therefore, he could be warned, or if the booklet were to be printed again, this could be corrected or at least conveniently explained. I wanted to warn you about it.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours, whom you will greet very much in my name and in the name of mine, and wish them happy times. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Iungius has been recalled by the people of Aarau, but, as I hear, the people of Basel do not want to let him go. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 29, at the end of the year 1557. Your I. Haller.</p>
