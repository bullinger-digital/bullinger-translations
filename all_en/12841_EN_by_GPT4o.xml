    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Meyer wishes that Bullinger would read the conclusion of the Augsburg [recruitment] letter [from September 1, 1546] once again! It states why the Zurich preachers were called to Augsburg. But now the situation is completely different. The [Schmalkaldic] League no longer exists, and the exercise of the pastoral office in Augsburg is no longer possible. So why should the Zurich pastors [Johannes Haller, Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] remain there any longer? What do they, as Confederates, have in common with the Spanish, imperial arch-enemy?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Augsburg church will continue to manage without Swiss pastors, as it has in the past. What will become of it if its main pastors leave the city, Meyer does not know. But as long as they stay (even if the Zurichers were sent away), they demonstrate to the [population] that they do not expect the arrival of the Spanish troops. However, Bullinger demands that the Zurichers remain steadfast in Augsburg until death! Whether that is wise is questionable. Outside the city, the situation is already completely hopeless! Bishop Otto Truchsess von Waldburg has brought the surrounding area under military control and ordered his priests to re-establish the horrors of the Antichrist and his sacrificial service! Pope Paul III has taken control of the churches and driven Christ out of them. Even worse: The fearful Augsburg council has expelled Bernardino Ochino, Francesco Stancaro, and Sebastian Schertlin (what will happen to Georg Frölich is unclear), who have done so much for the city! And Bullinger now wants the Zurichers to stay in Augsburg, as if they were destined to become prey for the Spaniards or slaughter cattle! What should they do? They are caught between Scylla and Charybdis!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Meyer and Schwyzer had long recognized the danger. Even in the letters to Meyer's wife [Regula, née Meier?], which Bullinger may have also read, he wrote about it. But in Zurich, this was not taken seriously. It was not fear that prompted him to issue these warnings! Rather, he wanted to give the council the opportunity to deliberate on it, so they could provide timely instructions to their subjects abroad. Now it is too late! Only God can still help.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is painful to have to wait for death completely abandoned, and not for the confession of the truth, but as Zwinglians and Helvetians! For the Augsburg council will not be able to save the Zurichers from the enemy, as it would then be in danger itself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Should they die, Bullinger must account for their innocent blood before Christ! But they must perish so that their fate becomes an example for posterity, so that Zurich never again recklessly exposes brave church servants to death for the sake of a city or a prince! Only the Lord can still save. Nothing is to be expected from humans.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wish, Bullinger, that you would carefully review the boundaries of the Augsburg letters, for they teach what the preachers were called for. But now, a different situation appears. The League has ceased, the calling and function have ceased. Why linger any longer? We will not be part of the imperial factions. For what friendship is there between us and the Spanish, the sworn enemies of the Swiss?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Nevertheless, the Augsburg church will stand, which has long been intact without a Swiss pastor. However, with the main pastors now contemplating flight, I do not know what the future holds. For they, being shepherds, testify that they will not wait for the Spanish. But you urge us to wait for the worst. Whether you do this with sound advice, I do not see, etc. Outside the gate, all hope has vanished. The bishop, with armed soldiers, has seized the land into his jurisdiction and resurrected the former horrors of the Antichrist's deeds, and to create abominations of lies, he has ordered his priests. The Pope holds the churches, Christ is expelled and trampled upon. Add to this even greater things: Bernardino, Stancaro, Sebastian Schertlin (what will happen to Frölich, I do not know), those excellent men who have deserved so well, indeed most saintly, from the city, have been expelled by the ungrateful city and the trembling council! And you write to us to remain, as if we were sent here to become prey for the Spanish and destined for the lustful slaughter of the worst men, sheep for the slaughter! What should be done? Certainly, we are caught between Scylla and Charybdis.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>This dangerous business, which now threatens us, I and Rudolf have long foreseen, and I have somewhat revealed this in letters sent to my wife, which perhaps you have partly seen or read. But everything has seemed so far as if we had invented a fable or some other vain thing! Would that they had been as false as they are most true, alas, today they are and are before our eyes. I testify to God that I wrote nothing out of fear or trembling, but, foreseeing the future danger, we wished not to conceal it, so that in time we might be given certain counsel against the most savage enemies of our city, the imperial factions, as to what we should do, lest we act without the authority of the council and the advice of the brothers. But the die has fallen with sinister Hercules! We promise ourselves happier things from divine goodness.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But it pains that, thus far deserted, we have nothing to expect every moment but the most immediate death, not for the testimony of the truth, but because we are Zwinglians and Swiss! Nor will the city council save us from the bloody hand, as it itself will perhaps not be safe and secure.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>If therefore it is necessary to perish, see you, by what means you will render account of our innocent blood to the Lord Jesus Christ, whom we also know to have yielded to the fury of the enemies. Certainly, we will be an example to posterity by our loss, so that they may not rashly expose brave ministers of the word to any city or prince. We are the Lord's. He will save and preserve us. The salvation of man is vain!</p>

      <p>Farewell. Augsburg, February 3, 1547. Laurenz Meyer, prey of the Spanish.</p>
