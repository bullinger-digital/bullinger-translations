      <p>London, on the first of August.</p>
      <p>The Queen is in excellent spirits, and the people everywhere are thirsty for religion. The bishops prefer to vacate their positions rather than renounce the Pope.</p>
      <p>In Scotland, everything is in turmoil.</p>
      <p>Mr. Knox, surrounded by a thousand followers, holds assemblies throughout the entire kingdom; the old queen has been forced to confine herself for protection. The nobility, with united minds and forces, is restoring religion everywhere against all opposition; monasteries everywhere are being leveled to the ground, theatrical garments, sacrilegious chalices, idols, and altars are being burned; not even traces of the old superstition and idolatry are left.</p>
      <p>The King of France, who is now reigning, writes that he is the King of Scotland and heir to England. Our people are very troubled by this; I do not know where things will erupt; perhaps, as it often happens, a common enemy will reconcile us with our Scottish neighbor. I have been designated as the Bishop of Salisbury.</p>
