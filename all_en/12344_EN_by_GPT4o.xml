    <p xml:id="regest1">Schuler did not respond to the two letters from Bullinger [not received]. [Johannes] Reinbold Funk went [unfortunately] to Zurich without Schuler's knowledge. Johannes Haller, Huldrych Zwingli [the Younger], and the Zurich patrician [Hans Wilpert Zoller] also arrived unexpectedly on the evening of November 14, only to continue their journey the next morning. Since they will return to Zurich not via Memmingen but via Ulm, Schuler cannot write through them either. - Overwhelmed with tasks, Schuler writes in haste. Bullinger, who accuses Schuler of neglecting their friendship, should consider his official duties. Schuler gave Haller a letter to Musculus, who has accordingly treated Haller kindly and will likely continue to do so. - The joy of the [Zurichers] over the victory of the Hessian [Landgrave Philipp] is not surprising, as this heroic deed serves the glory of the Gospel. After the victory over the army of the Brunswick [Duke Heinrich], [Philipp of] Hesse marched against Count [Otto] of Rietberg, whom he expelled from his seat and whose territory he occupied, as he had supported the Brunswick against [the Protestants]. Now [the Landgrave] is summoning all Protestants to the [Schmalkaldic League] meeting in Frankfurt on [December 6], where they will discuss the discovery of the letter with the Duke and the extension of the League. Balthasar Funk has been appointed there by the [Memmingers]. - [Charles V] has scheduled a [religious] discussion in Regensburg; however, this will likely not contribute to the glory of Christ. - In Nördlingen, the estates of the old Swabian League wanted to make peace with [Albrecht] of Rosenberg these days; but they parted without result. The new tensions arising from this are probably due to the emperor's plan to weaken the Germans. - Kaspar Schwenckfeld complained on November 23 through the envoy Hans Wilhelm von Laubenberg to the [Memmingen] council about Schuler's sermon against him. He claims a right to a public disputation and urges the council to silence Schuler. The authorities asked Schuler for advice on this matter. Schuler will send the wording of Schwenckfeld's supplication with his own response and that of the council with the next messenger. Since Schwenckfeld questions the [Protestant] service, this hypocrite should be refuted at a public Upper German synod. - Zwingli [the Younger] is informed about the flax intended for [Anna Bullinger]; it has been packed and ready for two months. Actually, [Johannes Reinbold] Funk was supposed to arrange the transport to [Bullinger]. Why this did not happen, he will have to answer to Schuler. - Schuler is just being called to the council regarding the Schwenckfeld case. - Schuler's wife [..., née Lübegger] is very ill; Bullinger should pray for her. She sends greetings to Bullinger and [Anna]. - Greetings, among others, from Mayor [Balthasar] Funk and from Bartholomäus Bertlin.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father through Jesus Christ. I have already received two letters from you, dear brother, to which I have not responded, I confess. Reinbold Funk went to Zurich without my knowledge and thus perhaps through forgetfulness deceived me; for I do not think it was done with any ill intent. Later, Brother Johannes Haller came to me together with Huldrych Zwingli and a certain Zurich patrician, whom I received as if they were my own flesh along with my other brothers and companions. Finally, they were about to leave for Augsburg, promising to return to Zurich via Ulm, not Memmingen, thus frustrating my hope of writing to you. On the fourteenth of November, they came to Memmingen too late, with me expecting nothing of the sort, intending to leave the next morning.</p>
      <p>I am occupied with many tasks and write hastily, as if returning from exile. You accuse me of negligence and fear that our mutual love has cooled.</p>
      <p>As for the first, I do not wish to contend with you, my Bullinger, as long as you consider some of my affairs, which disturb me. Regarding the second, I wish such suspicions about me would completely vanish from your mind; for I would like you to be persuaded of nothing less. I sent Johannes Haller to Augsburg with my letters to Musculus; he treated the man commendably in your name and will undoubtedly continue to do so.</p>
      <p>I hear you rejoice exceedingly over the victory of the Hessian prince, and I do not think it surprising, as you recognize that heroic deed as granted to us by the Lord to further the glory of the Gospel.</p>
      <p>You wish him to use this victory well, which we also confess to be necessary for him and wish for with equal prayers. Gradually, the schemes of the papists, which threatened us with destruction along with the Gospel, are being exposed; but the Lord, to whom alone all things are to be attributed, has been with us. After the defeat of the Brunswick army and the capture of the princes, the Hessian prince, having gathered his army, attacked a certain Count of Rietberg, whom he drove from his seat and occupied his territory by force of arms, because he had supported the Brunswick against us. Now he is summoning all Protestants to Frankfurt on St. Nicholas' Day. There they will deliberate on certain letters found from the Duke of Brunswick and on extending the league. Balthasar Funk has been appointed by our people. May the Lord grant us to meditate on those things that are pleasing to Him.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has summoned our people to a colloquy in Regensburg; however, our people fear that little or nothing will be added to the glory of Christ from it. The papal impostures are [...] impious respites. For the impious, when he has fallen into the depths, despises. Our people [...] refuse. The Lord is the one to whom the whole cause must be entrusted.</p>
      <p>These days, all the estates of the former Swabian League had gathered in Nördlingen to settle peace among themselves and with the nobleman of Rosenberg. But they parted with the matter plainly unresolved; this will give birth to new tumults in Germany. I fear it was done by the Emperor's counsel, who desires the strength of Germany to be gradually weakened until it is completely subdued by him and reduced to servitude. But the Lord will provide for all these things.</p>
      <p>Caspar Schwenckfeld sent a complaint on November 23 through the envoy Hans Wilhelm von Laubenberg to our council about the injury inflicted on him by me in a public sermon in Memmingen. He desires to defend his cause or rather his error publicly. He asks our council to impose silence on me. The council wishes to hear my advice on this matter, which I will not hesitate to give. I would have sent the tenor of Schwenckfeld's supplication, had the messenger not hastened his departure, but I will send it with my response and that of our council with the next messenger. Indeed, this hypocrite disturbs the churches everywhere and secretly. He is slippery and acts in such a way that he can escape when attacked. He complains that he is admitted to no hearing anywhere. He dissuades everyone from our sermons and the use of our sacraments. He says our churches lack Christ and solid knowledge of justification. I would sincerely wish to deal with him in some public synod, where at least the ministers of the churches of Upper Germany would convene to refute this heresy, which he sows here and there. But perhaps we will give more on these matters in the next letters.</p>
      <p>Zwingli knows about the flax to be sent to your wife, how the matter stands. It has been prepared and packed for two months. Funk promised to take care of its delivery to you; but why it has happened otherwise until now, he will perhaps explain to me in person. In the next letters, everything to you.</p>
      <p>Now, while I write this, I am called to the council regarding the Schwenckfeld case. May the Lord grant that all things be conducted to His glory!</p>
      <p>My wife is very ill. Pray to the Lord that, if it be for His glory, she may be granted to survive for her children. She sends greetings to you and your wife. Farewell, my dearest brother, and love me as you are accustomed. Given in Memmingen, November 25, 1545.</p>
      <p>Funk the consul, Bartholomäus Bertlin, and all the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Zurich church, lord and brother and old friend in Christ most dear.</p>
