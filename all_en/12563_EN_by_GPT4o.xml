    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger received four letters from Myconius. The first from July 22 [No. 2508] requires no response. The second is from July 23 [No. 2509].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The Zurich council today received the invitation to the Council [of Trent] addressed to the 13 cantons from Pope [Paul III]. Oh! If only Myconius could hear the words of the beast [Rev 13]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The jokes from the people of Freiburg about the "cow widows" are outrageous. The cow should knock over their bucket and splash them not with milk, but with [dung]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The people of Basel should tell their correspondents in Strasbourg that the Swiss Confederates have gathered about as many [mercenaries] as a [southern German] imperial city [of the Schmalkaldic League]. Furthermore, Bullinger senses a genuine obligation [towards the Schmalkaldic League] within the Swiss Confederation. If these mercenaries were to turn against [the Schmalkaldic League], the latter would feel it... Even though God will ultimately judge, the behavior of the people of Strasbourg is already outrageous!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The news of the confiscation of the money [intended for Emperor Charles V] in Landsberg is false. However, it is certain that the [imperial] mercenaries from Hungary and Austria around Landsberg have taken about 400 oxen from the people of Ulm, and that a [wagonload] of money for Charles V was intercepted at Weißenhorn. Furthermore, the people of Frankfurt are said to have confiscated several thousand arquebuses, 1000 armors, and several hundred barrels of gunpowder, all intended for Charles V.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Denmark and the Hanseatic cities have blocked the sea route to the Netherlands, causing hunger there, and Charles V can no longer expect help from there. [Hesse] is supplied. Landgrave [Philip] is moving south.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The people of Zurich have received the [recommended] Englishman [...] well. Bullinger even dined with him. He seems pious and learned.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Bullinger has just received Myconius' letter from July 27 [No. 2515]: He also regrets the hesitation [of the Schmalkaldic League]; this allows Charles V to gather his troops and then strike decisively.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [Sebastian] Schertlin has taken Günzburg and all the Danube crossings. [Duke William of] Bavaria has summoned his entire land and is certainly also targeting the [Swiss Confederates].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Queen [Anna of Bohemia and Hungary] and some bishops have pleaded with Charles V for peace by prostrating themselves. However, Charles V reminded the bishops that they had prompted him [to war].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- The defenders of the Ehrenberg pass are holding out bravely.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Greetings to [Johannes] Gast. Why does he not write?</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I have now received four letters from you. The first is dated July 22; it contains nothing that requires a response. The second is dated July 23.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Today, however, a significant letter has been delivered to my lords from the Pope. It invites them to the council and shows how he wishes to assist the Emperor with all his might. He asks the 13 cantons for help. If only you could hear the words of the beast! It is a mess with the cow widows, all singing in Freiburg. What if the cow knocked over the bucket, splashing not milk but the other stuff over their heads?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>To those writing to you from Strasbourg (joyfully out of old envy), saying that the Swiss Confederates, especially those of the gospel, have as many in their number as once a city, etc. I see all seriousness and all loyalty. If one had the matter, as much against them as with them, they would feel what our help was. But one must entrust it to God. It is, however, bad that they are now hesitating in those dangers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is not true with Landsberg that ours have won money there, but it is true that the occupiers from Hungary and Austria, around 1500 at Landsberg, have captured about 400 oxen from the people of Ulm. However, it is certain that at Weißenhorn, ours intercepted money for the Emperor, as much as three horse-drawn loads. Now the people of Frankfurt are said to have confiscated several thousand arquebuses, armor for 1000 men, and several hundred barrels of gunpowder for the Emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In the Netherlands, Denmark and the Hanseatic cities have blocked the sea. Therefore, there is unbearable hunger in the Emperor's hereditary lands, and he cannot expect help from there. The land is supplied down there, and the Landgrave is moving up with all his might.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We received that Englishman with as much humanity as we could. The day before yesterday, he dined with me. He appears to be a pious and learned man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>What you fear, I also fear, they are proceeding too slowly with the matter. The Emperor wants to gather his people and then strike quickly. I just received your last letter dated the 27th.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Schertlin has taken Günzburg, as well as all the passes on the Danube. He continues to advance. Bavaria has summoned all its land. Be careful, also against us, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The queen and several bishops have fallen at the Emperor's feet. However, they have achieved nothing; for they pleaded for peace. To the bishops, he said why they were doing this: they had brought him to this point.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>May God grant his grace. Those holding the pass at Ehrenberg are standing firm (bravely). They trust to be preserved with God's help.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>God be with you. July 29, 1546.</p>

      <p>Greetings to Gast. Why does he not write?</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother. Basel.</p>
