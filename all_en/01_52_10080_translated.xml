  <input>Gratiam et pacem a domino.

Non dubito, cordatissime Huldrice [!], quin a Funckio Bernate meas acceperis litteras quibus ita morosum atque molestum tibi proculdubio me facio, quod malis Berchtoldum nunquam novisse, quam sua ignorantia suisque nęniis et quaestiunculis ita onerari et urgeri; sed certe charitas erga me tua iam dudum mihi perspecta a cogitationibus huiusmodi retrahit. Quod igitur in multis tuo consilio tuaque ingenii dęxteritate [!] indigeo atque expostulo, non graveris vel per Funckium vel hoc nuncio respondere; singula enim sunt, quae movebuntur, quibus citra longam meditationem satisfacere nequeo.

Hac hora accipio a parochis quibusdam, quod ministri excommunicationem verbi a senatu impetrare nituntur. In promptu sunt, quae olim ad me scripseras ea de re, quę item ante annum Oecolampadius in comitiis Aroensibus legatis christianę olim civitatis obtulerat. Locutus sum et ego Aroę prima augusti huius anni cum Oecolampadio, et certe eo veneramus, quod ritus noster in mulctandis malis non adeo absurdus illi videbatur, nisi quod contendebat suum scripturę et verbo viciniorem alienumque esse debere a functione nostra, quod ordinatis a magistratu iudicibus assideremus; sic enim ecclesię adimi auctoritatem et totam reiici in magistratum, nosque et verbum nostrum ob hanc judiciariam functionem odiosos reddi. At ego spero senatum nihil immutaturum, nisi prius a fratribus etiam aliarum ecclesiarum consilia suscęperimus.

Megander noster adhuc quiescit, ad cuius causam probe diluendam te quoque expecto. Velim tamen priores litteras omnino igni commendares, ne per alios, quibus id tu crederes, male de me suspicari posset; nolim enim quempiam facile offendere.

Cęterum audimus hic et Tigurinos Gallorum regi milites admisisse; quod si ita fuerit, statim actum erit per totam Helvetiam de verbo dei. Iusserat dominus Imm Hag, ut a te veritatem percontarer. Obsecro igitur per communem nobis Christum, respondeas ad omnia. Pellicanum urge, ut et ipse credat, si quę fuerint annotationum suarum excuse.

Vale et perpetuo barbariei parce.

28. decembris.

Tuus ex animo et ad aram

  <output>May you receive grace and peace from the Lord.

I do not doubt, most wise Huldrych [!], that you have received my letters from Funck Bernat, by which I must certainly have made myself so troublesome and irksome to you, that it was a misfortune Berchtold never knew of his ignorance and his disputes and questionings; but certainly your long-ago expressed charity towards me draws me back from such thoughts. So do not be troubled if you reply either through Funck, or through this messenger, to the many things for which I require and demand your counsel and your ingenious dexterity [!]; for I cannot satisfy myself without long study of them.

At this hour I have received word from certain ministers that they are striving to obtain the excommunication of the Word from the Senate. The things you wrote to me on this matter, and also what Oecolampadius offered to the Christian delegates of the Aarauen Conference last year, are already available. I too spoke at Aarau the first of August of this year with Oecolampadius, and certainly we had arrived at the conclusion that our ritual was not so absurd in punishing the wicked, except that he argued that it should be closer to the Scripture and the Word, and farther away from our function, in that we associate with judges appointed by the magistrates; thus, he argued, the authority of the Church is taken away, and all is cast upon the magistrates, and we and the Word are made odious by this judicial function. But I hope the Senate will make no changes until we have taken counsel also from the brethren of the other Churches.

Our Megander still lies quiet, and I am awaiting your assistance in investigating his case thoroughly. Nevertheless, I urge you to entirely burn your earlier letters, lest any others, in whom you might have confidence, form an evil opinion of me; for I do not wish to easily offend anyone.

Furthermore, we hear here that the troops of the French king have been admitted by the Zurichers; if this should be so, the Word of God will be acted upon throughout all of Switzerland. The Lord Im Hof had commanded me to inquire of you concerning the truth of this. I therefore entreat you, through our common Lord Jesus Christ, to reply to everything. Urge Pellican to believe, if he has any doubts concerning our annotations.

Farewell, and forever spare me your barbarism.

Your in heart and at the altar,

B. Hallerus

To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of Zurich, his gracious and honourable lord.</output>
