    <p xml:id="regest1">Hears from Joachim Maler that Bullinger wants to dedicate [the first of the two books "De origine erroris"] to him again, if it is not inconvenient for him; is somewhat surprised, because he has already given his consent from Württemberg, and is also surprised by Bullinger's preference for him, as he could also present it to a generous monarch like King [Henry VIII]. He wrote recently and already on August 31 [1538] [No. 1166] without receiving a reply; assumes that Bullinger is too busy, and assures him of his admiration and affection. The evangelical churches are in grave danger, as authorities, pastors, and people have slackened in their zeal; improvement is urgently needed to avert the wrath of God. Greetings. [Henry VIII] has executed some leading people because of a conspiracy instigated by Cardinal [Reginald Pole], among them [Henry], the brother of the Cardinal. Expects a report from Bucer, who has returned [to Strasbourg], at any moment.</p>

      <p>Our Joachim Maler, returning from there not long ago, informed me with your words that you are considering, with a certain plan, to make the excellent and worthy book, which you dedicated to me in previous years, more enriched and to have it printed again, and to dedicate it to me, if you find it not to be troublesome. I am indeed very surprised for two reasons; for I remember receiving your letters on this very matter when I was still in the Duchy of Württemberg, and then responding to them that I would consider it a great favor, so far from suspecting that you should think it troublesome to me. Either you did not receive those letters, or you think I have perhaps changed my mind, so you wish to be informed about it again. Furthermore, I am even more amazed by this constant affection for me, that, although you received nothing at all for the previous dedication from someone who loves you as much as anyone, you nevertheless persist in adding benefit to benefit, intending to return a doubled gratitude, so that, having received nothing before, you might now receive less than nothing, if that were possible. How much better it would be, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, to present this gift, more valuable than gold, to the most generous King of the English or some other monarch of the world; for those who love letters and the learned among them, however otherwise sordid, are accustomed to reward such dedications most generously. But from this, you clearly show how far you are from that sacred hunger for gold, which destroys and ruins almost all the learned, and how much you value me, how you love me not in a common way, so that all good and piously learned people rightly love and admire you in this respect - as in many others - as being placed outside the common lot of theologians; and I, indeed, ought to show myself worthy of this love and honor of yours with all my efforts. And I certainly wish to prove myself to you and to men like you, the greatest men, who so tirelessly and happily assist the Christian republic, with all my heart, which I strive to obtain daily and earnestly from the Lord himself, the author of all good things, through both my prayers and yours.</p>
      <p>I wrote to you recently through the servant of a certain printer from Basel, and also earlier through that bookseller from Ulm, who poorly understands German, at the end of August, when I came to Konstanz on the 26th of that month. In return, I have not received a single word from you, except that in the letters to my dearest cousin Zwick, I read with great pleasure the greeting written to me; for I willingly attribute your silence to those occupations which keep you continuously busy beyond measure and limit, and I think it is entirely fair that I too, when I am idle here, as I often am due to other pressing and violently demanding business, should be granted pardon. I am most assured of your former affection towards me, being fully convinced that it remains as it always was. As for my affection towards you, I dare to truly affirm to you that it is more loving and devoted than it ever was. Indeed, that singular humanity, incomparable candor, exceptional learning, and the most fervent zeal for benefiting the churches, all of which the Lord has bestowed upon you with such kindness, ignite my entire admiration and veneration for you and make me yours, however small I am, so that nothing is now more in my wishes than to see you in person, to speak with you, and to embrace you most closely in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Commend me and my ministry diligently and earnestly to the Savior Christ in your sacred prayers. I see now, if ever before, a great calamity impending upon our churches, after the former zeal of the magistrates, the vigilance and faith of the church elders, the former charity of the people, and in sum, all our affairs have miserably slackened, so that no one can now recognize the former appearance of all things among us, after our gospel has lost the grace of novelty and we have cast off the yoke of the pope from our necks, alas, with as much vanity as piety, abhorring the yoke of Christ no less and even more. We shall indeed pay the deserved penalties for our ingratitude, which I greatly fear, and the Lord will permit our adversaries to do something against us, so that, exercised by crosses, we may be timely recalled to the way from which we have so fallen. Therefore, all torpor must be shaken off, true and genuine repentance must be urged, lest the fiercely raging wrath of the Lord oppress and destroy us entirely. Ah, save us, Lord Jesus, through the bowels of your mercy, and save us eternally, whatever we must endure here, provided we are not deprived of your unique and solid salvation! In this very Christ, my soul, my more than dearest and venerable brother, farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Greet most respectfully and Christianly in the Lord, in my words, the excellent and truly venerable men and brothers, Master Conrad Pellican, Leo, Theodore, and the rest of your ministers, and commend me to them most carefully. All our brothers send their greetings to you. Zwick himself also writes to you. My sister Margarita and my dear wife likewise send many and as loving greetings as they can to you and your wife, which I also do. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, January 28, 1539.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>The English have executed some born of the principal family by beheading, because they conspired against the king with the advice of the English cardinal, whose own brother he also had executed. Some others have been thrown into prison and expect the same fate.</p>
      <p>From Bucer, who returned to his own on January 21, we expect both a travelogue and a history of events at any moment.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most sincere Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my lord and brother, most to be respected and cherished.</p>
