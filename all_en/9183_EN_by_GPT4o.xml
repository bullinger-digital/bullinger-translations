      <p>Greetings. Never in all the time you have served the Rhaetian churches have you written me letters that have saddened and disturbed me more gravely and vehemently than your latest ones. Not so much because I understand from them the inconsistency and ingratitude of those people, which I find exceedingly disapproved, but because I see your spirit broken by the wickedness of the adversary to such an extent that you are considering changing your place and leaving, even though the cause is not such that you should abandon the church entrusted to you by the Lord. For if the ingratitude and inconsistency of people are just causes for abandoning inconsistent and ungrateful churches, if the wickedness of adversaries allows for departure, how often would the good God have allowed Moses to abandon the people entrusted to him by God? I do not recount more examples to you, as I know from this one you can estimate all the rest, and you have long experienced who Ganthner is. If you are asked who he is, you will answer, I know well: "A wolf." Therefore, remember that excellent saying of the Lord himself: "The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep; the hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches and scatters them. The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand and does not care for the sheep." Nor can you doubt that if you leave, he will invade your place; thus, before God and all good people, the blame for the lost and disturbed church will stick to you. Now, what will be your future authority, what favor of all good people, you understand yourself; your labor, glory, reward, favor acquired over so many years and labors will perish. But you can also conjecture how you will be received by our magistrate.</p>
      <p>But if the sheep have driven out the shepherd, the shepherd will be blameless, nor will his return be ungrateful, provided he has given no just cause for ejection, but has been ejected for integrity and faith.</p>
      <p>If Ganthner is as he was before, a supporter of the Schwenckfeldians and Anabaptists, he does not sincerely accept our confession; he pretends to accept it until he has the opportunity to do what he intends. You know what the Schwenckfeldians' opinion is about the word of God and ministry, you know what my opinion is about the magistrate and punishing heretics, etc. Therefore, he will not sincerely subscribe to those things recited in the confession from the beginning of folio 6. 7., likewise those at the end of folio 61b. If he truly subscribes, he will condemn the Schwenckfeldians and Anabaptists.</p>
      <p>Be strong and constant in the Lord together with our brother Campello. If he sincerely accepts and sincerely subscribes, things will go well; if not, it will soon appear from words and deeds who he is. Often adversaries arise in churches and have many adherents; but if the good persevere in defending the truth, the Lord never fails them. We write to the honorable consul Willio, Gwalther and I, urging him to protect the truth and you, the witnesses of the truth; to be vigilant, lest Ganthner harass you, who he has learned from past events. - I have nothing more to add to this. Neighbors are impatiently waiting to be called to France; the people of Lucerne and others have prepared themselves. Meanwhile, it is reported that disturbances are raging in France in a remarkable way. The Dauphinois, Occitans, whom they call Languedoc, and especially the Basques rise against the robber king, and the people of La Rochelle have defeated the king's forces. I report this to you as I received it from uncertain reports. If they are true, they will soon be confirmed. Many other things are also added, about which, as they are uncertain, I say nothing to you.</p>
      <p>A rumor has spread about the death of the Emperor, which I entirely believe to be false. If it is true, before another is elected, the empire will fall into factions; the factious pope will support the factions.</p>
      <p>I await your letters. Greet Campello and other good men, friends, brothers, most amicably. What I have written, you will hear shortly, I suppose. Farewell with all yours. January 29, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my dear lord and brother.</p>
