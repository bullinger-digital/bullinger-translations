    <p xml:id="regest1"> Hallwyl thinks it was a grave mistake to allow the Dutch army to reach the Emperor [Charles V] unimpeded. However, since then, the Emperor has not shown himself to be more aggressive, nor has he shown himself to be timid by avoiding the area along the Danube where the [Schmalkaldic] troops are stationed. The latter have also been noticeably reinforced [by the arrival of troops under the command of Count Christoph von Oldenburg]. There are fierce skirmishes. The troops of Count von Oldenburg are said to have killed 200 Spaniards in a village [...]. Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] does not attach great importance to the loss of Neuburg [on the Danube] (but rather to the betrayal of the captains stationed there). </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> - In reference to the recent conversation with Bullinger, Hallwyl reports that a [written] petition from the [Schmalkaldic League] to the [Protestant] cities of the Confederation is now certain. Bullinger should ensure that the response clearly reflects how important God, their religion, and their freedom are to the [Protestant] Confederates. A lukewarm response would provoke ridicule and anger, and they would surely feel God's punishment. So, courage! In the camp, Hallwyl always praises the steadfastness and sincerity of the Zurich authorities, about which he was recently informed. Should action be taken, they will surely know how to proceed. Not everything can be entrusted to paper. The wise will understand. God help! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> - [P.S.:] The topic of Graubünden is often brought up in Hallwyl's presence. Zurich should negotiate intensively with this place and then report back. Many foreign attackers could spoil the Emperor's delaying tactics. </p>

      <p>My good-willed, friendly service beforehand, dear lord and good friend. Regarding the war actions, in my opinion, a grave mistake has occurred, as the Dutch troops have reached the Emperor without any hindrance. However, I cannot yet notice that the Emperor has become much more defiant or presumptuous because of their arrival, nor that he is avoiding the area along the Danube where our troops are stationed. Our troops have also noticeably strengthened themselves since the arrival of his troops from the Netherlands. At this time, nothing else is being done but fierce skirmishes and a remarkable number of poor people are being made. On the 24th of September, the troops of Count von Oldenburg are said to have killed 200 Spaniards in a village. I have understood from the Landgrave that the loss of Neuburg is not considered significant (apart from the betrayal by the captains stationed there).</p>

      <p>Regarding the matters we recently discussed, it seems that the Protestant cities in the Confederation will be approached by these estates, as you will undoubtedly learn. Then, with earnestness and diligence, you should ensure that the response clearly shows that God, His name and honor, our religion, and liberty are dearer to us than the rest of the whole world. If this does not happen, our lukewarmness and spirit will be ridiculed and despised by the whole world, and unavoidable punishment from God will follow. Well then! You know how to handle these matters well. I praise the steadfastness and sincerity of my lords from Zurich in these matters (as I was recently informed). Without a doubt, it will now be sufficiently proven in action. If it comes to action, as I have noticed, honest, suitable, and secure means will be found. Not everything can be written. The wise will understand enough from this. May the Lord God grant His grace. Dated in the field camp Donauwörth, the 26th of September in the year 1546.</p>

      <p>Regarding the topic of Graubünden, I am often approached about how to deal with them, as they are considered firmly committed to the cause. Much could be negotiated through Zurich at that place! Please consider this and inform me of your thoughts. The Emperor's delaying tactics cannot be better thwarted than by many foreign hands spoiling his plans.</p>
