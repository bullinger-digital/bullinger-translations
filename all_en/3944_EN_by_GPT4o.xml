      <p>Greetings. What I have from England is as follows, written in London on April 8: "Peace between the French, English, and Scots has been proclaimed here; the pope has been completely renounced, so that he no longer has any jurisdiction in England; but religion has not yet been settled. Parliament is still in session, that is, the council of the kingdom; that is, the assembly is still ongoing.</p>
      <p>In recent days, there has been a debate on three articles: whether the church should conduct prayers and sacramental rites in a foreign language, whether it can change ceremonies for the benefit of the faithful, and whether the mass is a sacrifice for the living and the dead.</p>
      <p>The debate was conducted by 18 selected individuals; for each side, 9 men were chosen. Due to the obstinacy of the papist bishops, the discussion was interrupted, and two, the Bishop of Winchester and the Bishop of Lincoln, were imprisoned. Now the matter of religion is being addressed.</p>
      <p>There is great hope; for the queen, the nobles, and a good part of the people are very well disposed towards true religion," etc. From the Augsburg assembly, we have nothing certain yet.</p>
      <p>Now, sad news is brought to us that Dusas has been consumed by fire set by robbers among you; I await from you what it is.</p>
      <p>Here, vigilance is maintained, in the city and countryside, against arsonists. May the Lord deliver us from evil.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Commend me to the honorable legate, to whom you will communicate this and greet him most amicably.</p>
      <p>Greet the councilors, Philipp, Pontasella, and friends. Zurich, May 6, 1559.</p>
      <p>I have hurried as never before.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>These letters were first brought to me on May 17.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, the most faithful minister of the Chur church, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
