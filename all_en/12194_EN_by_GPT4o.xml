    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer thanks for the precious writing [Capilupi's "De vita monachorum"], which he received after sealing his letter [No. 2146] with Bullinger's letter from April 19 [No. 2140]. He has forwarded the copies to the recipients [...]. He also returns the "Admonitio [paterna... cum scholis]" lent to him by Bullinger through Jakob Funcklin; it couldn't be done faster as he had no messenger. How aptly [Calvin] shows the true colors of the Silenus [Paul III.], and how much [Charles V.] ignores all those who reveal the true nature of this monster! - The rumors conveyed by Bullinger about [Johannes Marbach] are false. - Blarer is pleased with [Jakob] Metzler's good conduct; however, he should continue to be monitored. - Blarer expects further reports on [Johannes] Gast. - [In the alliance negotiations between Konstanz and Zurich] may God show them the right way! - [Blarer must stop, as] the young man [...] wants to depart. - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. After sealing our little letter, I received your letters dated April 19 along with Laelius' writings, for which I thank you; for this muse pleases me greatly, not only because of the subject matter. I will send copies to those to whom they are addressed. I am also returning the booklet of notes on the paternal admonition of the pope, which I received from my more than dear son Jakob Funcklin, who wrote that he obtained it from you on the condition that I return it as soon as possible. I could not do it sooner because there was no messenger. Ah!</p>
      <p>With what gravity, with what truth, this absurd Silenus, the Roman pontiff, is explained by the best and most learned men and depicted to the emperor in his true colors! And yet, seeing and knowing, I do not know by what misfortune of his own, so that I may not say anything harsher, he pretends not to notice (the Emperor) - as the saying goes, a story to a deaf man - whoever reveals this monster either by words or writings.</p>
      <p>Such is the atrocity of our sins, that almost everything is lamented, so much more must we implore Christ, the sole and most certain author of our salvation, that we may be allowed to be secure under his wings and that, with him as our avenger, we may someday achieve victory over both his and our enemies.</p>
      <p>Regarding the doctor from Isny, whoever said what you wrote to us, spoke falsely. It is pleasing to hear that Metzler is conducting himself well; but do not cease to diligently observe his manners and studies.</p>
      <p>I will await what you will write further about Gast. In another matter, the Lord must be earnestly prayed to, that he may kindly show some way to bring it to a most successful conclusion.</p>
      <p>But I must not delay the young man, whom I most diligently commend to you, any longer.</p>
      <p>Farewell, best and dearest brother, with all yours. April 27, in Konstanz, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his venerable and dearest Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich.</p>
