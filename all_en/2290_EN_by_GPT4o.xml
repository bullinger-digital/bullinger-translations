      <p>S. P. I would have written more often, if there were anything worth mentioning...; but so far the princes are only thinking about gathering armies, and next month we will hear about their efforts.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with us. Our King attacks the enemy everywhere with great strength and already clearly sees... his efforts are in vain and what she had promised to the Emperor is null. The Roman King meets with the princes in Augsburg, as you know, I believe, whom even Queen Maria of Hungary intends to visit on the Emperor's orders due to his infirmity.</p>
      <p>What I am sending you now I received from the Lord of Bayonne, our legate to the Rhaetians, and he himself is surprised that they have been delayed on the way for so long, as you will see, I believe, from the date of the letters of Mr. Vergerius, who writes to me and asks that I send them to you immediately, which you will find here. It will be too long immediately, but I do not know whose fault it is; for our legate does not indicate who sent it to him. The letters of Vergerius to me are dated February 22.</p>
      <p>I greet your lords, whom I will rightly warn about what is happening this summer, so that no one imposes on them in the usual Caesarean manner. Farewell excellently. From Solothurn, May 26.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bass[efontaneus].</p>
      <p>To the excellent man, Mr. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich</p>
