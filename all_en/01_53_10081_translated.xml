  <input>Heinricho Bullingero Heinrichus Luthius Christum felicitatem ex animo optat.

Vehementer equidem non ita pridem duplici nomine exhilaratus sum, simulatque rumor certus apud nos increbuisset, Zuinglii te (cuius immatura mors propemodum me enecat) apud Thugurinos [!] predicandi evangelii provinciam hui duram sane, at honestam in te susceperis [!]; partim ob ecclesie tue felicitatem, quod sciam illi optime consultum, cui tam fidus ac vigilans pastor dei bonitate obvenerit, partim quod sperem nos, qui in agro Thigurino evangelium praedicamus, haud mediocriter fortunatos, qui alium patronum nacti sumus, ad quem rebus dubiis aut si quid alias urgeat, confugere liceat tanquam ad extremam, quod aiunt, anchoram. Tu vero pro virili dabis operam, qui munus tuum sic exornes atque talem agas episcopum, qualem te fore plerique sibi pollicentur, scilicet prudentem, purum, incorruptum, publice pacis mire studiosum, modestum, qui tua modestia vel male sanos atque repugnantes ad veritatem amplectendam inducturus sis, que sane sepenumero plus potest quam quorundam importuna vehemencia ac peccatores insectandi mordacitas. Prudencia quadam nosti temperandam esse orationem, ut nec libertas exeat in convicium, ne [c] levitas sapiat adulacionem aut metum.

Porro, Heinriche humanissime, rogavit me eciam atque eciam Michael Schlatterus homo in litteris et divinis et humanis impense doctus, quod se tibi commendem; quod eo lubencius nuper epistolio ad se dato me facturum recepi, quod sciam optimos quosque tibi alias esse commendatissimos. Ipse vero sibi persuasit tue humanitati aliisque qui istic sunt fratribus meo testimonio se fieri commendatiorem. Quo circa hominis fidei deesse nolui, quandoquidem erudicio illius et pietas in Christum digna est, que ab omnibus vere piis deametur, foveatur. Quod si apud te minus mea valebit authoritas, sarciet forte familiaritas, quae tibi cum illo ab hinc iam aliquott [!] annis intercessit, cum uterque Thiguri grecis litteris navaretis [!] operam, magna certe laude, nec minore fructus accessione. Hic noster frater sane eo est in loco, ubi plerique veritati reclamant, propediem aram denuo extructuri, mox eciam sacra facturi Iam percontantur de sacrificulo aliquo, quem ubi nacti fuerint, mox suam impietatem auspicabuntur, homines male feriati. Quod si evenerit, quod omnino metuit eventurum, proximum erit, ut aut suam annuam pensionem, quae vix sibi sufficit, cum sacrificulo partiri aut penitus locum mutare cogatur, quo fit, ut bonus vir mops sit omnis cum consilii tum auxilii. Cui te ita adesse velim, ut senciat non nihil ad se consolacionis ob mei commendacionem accessisse, maxime si aliquando intelligas hunc nostrum Michaelem a praedicandi munere amotum, quod est in proclivi, tum saltem eam humanitatem declares, quam soles contra omnes. Alia condicione opus habebit, qua liceat vite necessitatem cum uxore ac liberis sustinere.

Vale feliciter ac deus optimus maximus diu servet te nobis incolumem.

In profesto circumcisionis Christi, cum modo 1532 annus esset pro foribus.

Salutabis meis verbis coniugem tuam una cum tota familia, quibus hunc natalem et plurimos alios quam felicissime agant, totis opto animis, tuorum vero studiorum eterna cum laude perpetuo florentem gloriam, quam ut fingendo et cudendo in reipublicae christiane profectum subinde augeas, dii faxint.

Erudito viro domino Heinricho Bullingero, apud Thigurinos facundissimo verbi divini preconi, domino et amico incomparabili.</input>
  <output>Heinrich Bullinger, Heinrich LÃ¼thi wishes you all the best from the bottom of his heart.

I was truly delighted when I recently heard the double news that you, whose untimely death almost destroys me, had accepted the difficult but honourable position of preaching the gospel in Zurich, partly because I know it to be a great benefit to your church to have such a faithful and vigilant pastor, and partly because I hope that those of us who preach the gospel in Zurich will be very fortunate to have another patron to whom we can turn in times of doubt, or any other difficulties, as to our last hope, as they say. You will do your best to decorate your task and be the bishop that most people expect you to be, that is, wise, pure, uncorrupt, with a great zeal for public peace, modest, so that you can lead those who are ill-minded and unwilling to accept the truth with your modesty, which is often more powerful than the obstinate vehemence and bitter words of some sinners. You know how to temper your words with discretion, so that your freedom does not lead to slander, nor your gentleness to flattery or fear.

Furthermore, Michael Schlatter, an incredibly educated man in both divine and human sciences, asked me to recommend him to you, which I gladly accepted in a letter sent to him recently, since I know that all the best people are recommendable to you. He believes that my testimony will make him more commendable before you and the other brothers there. Therefore, I did not want to fail in my duty of faith, since his knowledge and piety towards Christ deserve to be loved and cherished by all the truly pious. If my authority does not hold much power before you, I hope that his familiarity with you, which began several years ago when you both studied Greek in Zurich, with great honour and great benefit, will help him. This our brother is in a place where many people oppose the truth and will soon build an altar again and soon make their impiety official. They are already asking for a priest, and when they find one, they will soon start their wickedness. If that happens, which he fears is inevitable, he will soon have to share his meagre annual pension with the priest or he will have to change places, so that a good man becomes completely deprived of support and advice. I wish you to be present and to make him feel that he has been comforted by my recommendation, especially if you ever hear that our Michael has been removed from his preaching duties, which is very likely. In this case, at least, show him the human kindness that you usually show everybody. He will need another condition to be able to sustain his life necessities with his wife and children.

Goodbye and may God Almighty keep you safe with us for a long time.

On the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ, that was the year 1532 at the doors.

Greet your wife and your whole family with my best wishes, and I wish them all the best in this holiday and many others, with all my heart. I also wish you eternal glory in your studies with endless praise, which you will increase by writing and printing for the benefit of the Christian Republic.</output>
