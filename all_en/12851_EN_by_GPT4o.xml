    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Although there is hardly any reason for joy in these difficult times, Curione is very glad that the pious, learned Bullinger is now better disposed towards him than he was recently. This recognition means a lot to him. He also knows that Bullinger did not react to his misfortune with hypocritical indignation, but with genuine sympathy. Thank God that despite his misfortune, he still has a conscience in harmony with God, a hopeful soul, and a clear, forward-looking mind. He hopes that his life, to the annoyance of his enemies but to the delight of his friends, will, on the whole, dispel these shadows like a light. Bullinger should pray for him! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Curione has been friends with Stancaro for a long time. He is currently living with him and showed him Bullinger's letter [not received], a proof of how well-disposed Bullinger is towards good, persecuted, and learned people. Actually, Stancaro should have asked Bullinger for help. Instead, Bullinger anticipated him to avert an impending emergency. Therefore, Stancaro no longer needs to be recommended to Bullinger. However, if Curione can assist Bullinger in this, he is happy to do so, as he too had to flee and endure hardships because of Christ. Such wandering people must be helped. In Lausanne, they are looking for a theology teacher, for which Stancaro, who is well-versed in the three ancient languages, would be very suitable. Bullinger wrote that he would inquire with the Bernese. He should then communicate the received answer so that Stancaro can act accordingly. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Greetings. Curione will always remain connected to Bullinger. Written in the house of Johannes Herwagen the Elder. </p>

      <p>C[aelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] S. P. D. per Christum Iesum. I rejoice, my most excellent and holy Bullinger, if there is any place for joy in such great evils, that you now think better of me than you did a little while ago. For what do I desire more than to be approved by such a pious, learned, and friendly man? I know that you (endowed with such humanity or rather piety) have borne my very grave calamity most gravely, and have pursued my most unjust misfortune not with indignation (as hypocrites and Pharisees are wont to do), but rather with mercy. But be of good cheer, my sweetest brother! For the divine clemency is still safe and intact, which can be most excellent in a man in such great troubles: First, a conscience splendidly agreeing with God; a spirit raised to the firmest hope after great sorrow and long squalor, and patient in inconveniences; a sound mind mindful of the past and much foreseeing the future. Therefore, I hope that with Christ my helper, my life, previously lived innocently, joined and compared with all the time that divine providence has seen fit to impart to us, will illuminate and utterly abolish the shadows of that insidious moment as if it were a great light, and will bring as much joy to my friends and pain to my enemies as the calamity, received with unworthy fear, seems to have brought them sorrow and these joy. To achieve this, you will assist me with your most holy prayers to God our Father. But enough of this.</p>

      <p>Now a few words about our Stancaro. He is here with me, because I have an old acquaintance with him. Therefore, he shared with me your most kind letters to him. In these letters, I recognized your well-known, yet always appreciated, charity towards good, afflicted, and learned men. You offer him voluntarily what he should have asked from you with great entreaties. And he would have done so, had you not anticipated him and wished to overcome even the man's urgent need with your piety. Therefore, I see no need for my recommendation to you. However, if anything from my side adds to your willingness, know that you will do something most pleasing to me. I myself have experienced what it is to be exiled, to be a fugitive, and to suffer almost all extremes for the cause of Christ. Therefore, I wish to provide for such people who wander for the same cause, such as our Francis Stancaro here. I know that the church in Lausanne needed a theology lecturer in recent days; if one has not yet been found, this trilingual man would be most suitable. You will inquire (as you write) with the Bernese and inform us, so that this good man may know what he should do.</p>

      <p>Farewell, my most learned and excellent Bullinger, and know that I am perpetually devoted to you. Greet the domestic church and love me. Basel, February 8, 1547, at the house of Herwagen. Yours sincerely, Caelius S. C.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, both most learned and most vigilant, brother and most esteemed and beloved friend. In Zurich.</p>
