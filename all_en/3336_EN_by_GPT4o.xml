      <p>Grace from God the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>In two places, dearest Bullinger, in that digression where I incidentally diverge to the treatment of the sacraments, you seem to me to be offended, in one where I remind that sacraments are signs of present things, not absent ones, and in the other where I write that the heaven in which Christ dwells and his throne on which he sits should be understood not as a material heaven and throne, but as a spiritual one. In the explanation of both places, whether you desire clarity or, if I indeed feel as the words suggest, you think good men would be amazed, I, on the contrary, neither think clarity is absent from my writing nor that good men would be amazed at why I feel this way, if only they would more carefully consider what I have written. Therefore, I gladly accept and interpret in a better light what you confess in your letters that your business did not allow you to consider my writing more diligently. For as far as the former place is concerned, where the presence of those things which are signified by the sacraments is explained, I do not think it is obscurely indicated in my commentaries about which presence of Christ I speak.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, what, I ask, could be said more clearly than what I say, that Christ is present to the pious with the spiritual nourishment of his flesh and blood, and that the flesh and blood benefit us through the spirit for the completion of all salvation, without which they benefit nothing. To declare this sentiment, I bring forth testimonies from the scriptures of the prophets and the new covenant, by which I prove that Christ Jesus our Lord is made sacred and salutary to us through his spirit, from whom he is called the Messiah, that is, the anointed one.</p>
      <p>For he is anointed with all abundance and fullness of spirit, through which the righteousness and life lost by the fault of the first parents are restored by removing the right of sin and death. Therefore, I am more surprised that you say Augustine does not satisfy me, where he says that the pious use both the sacrament and the reality of the sacrament, while the impious use the sacrament, not the reality, and thus Judas ate the bread of the Lord, not the bread the Lord. Augustine's words indicate that he satisfies me when I say: "On this matter, Saint Augustine speaks, where he says this sacrament is prepared for some to life, for others to destruction, but the reality itself, of which it is a sacrament, is prepared for every man to life, for none to destruction, whoever partakes of it." The words placed in my writing confirm that I uphold this sentiment, by which I explain what it is to partake of the flesh and blood of Christ. But what I add to Augustine's words: if anyone wishes to say that the wicked partake of Christ sacramentally, inasmuch as they feel Christ proposed sacramentally and mystically present as a judge, not a savior, I do not wish to contend greatly with him, what, I ask, do I imply with these words? Do I say that the impious truly partake of Christ? But I do not say this, but affirm the contrary, as the following and preceding in the commentary declare. But this I say: if anyone calls partaking of Christ partaking of the bread of Christ, who is present to the wicked partaking as a judge, not as a savior, I do not wish to contend greatly with him, where I understand that Christ is present to the impious in the supper to their destruction through the judicial spirit, as he is accepted to be present to the pious through the comforting, saving, and nourishing spirit to eternal life. But even if anyone understands in this way that the wicked partake of Christ, I clearly show with the words that follow: "But whether this is from the simple sentiment of Christ and the apostle, they themselves will be able to see." But indeed, I have used this moderation to placate those who have been exacerbated by a more vehement discord to the great joy of the enemies of the gospel and the sadness of pious men, avoiding harsher reproof by some reason, but one that the word of the Lord would bear.</p>
      <p>Thus far briefly on the former place.</p>
      <p>As for the latter, where you are surprised that I teach the heavenly throne on which Christ the judge and Lord of all sits is not remote from us, but present, I would in turn be surprised that you are surprised that I feel and speak this way, unless I thought that my writing had not been read more diligently by you, which you also confess. For I understand the throne of Christ to be extended through this universe no differently than the right hand of the Father, which, as it is diffused through all nature by power and command, is not circumscribed by any place or time or any elements of the world, so the same is to be understood of the throne of the Messiah, which is the throne of that command extending over all, as the majesty of the emperor of heaven and earth confirms and the faith of the saints recognizes. Of which throne of majesty the emperor and king himself, when he had been raised from the dead, makes mention with these words: "All power is given to me in heaven and on earth." For no one would say that the throne of the Messiah is a creature bounded by its limits and spaces, but the seat of power and administration, in which sitting Christ wisely administers all things contained in heaven and earth, to whom equally the heavenly legates, angels, men dwelling on earth, Satan with demons condemned to Orcus stand by obeying, to whom heavenly, earthly, and infernal knees bow, adoring him sitting on this throne, extended as far as heaven and earth extend. I do not think there is any of the pious... to whom this explanation of the sacred throne and throne would be disapproved, much less to Bullinger, if he truly understood my sentiment, a man exercised in the sacred letters and knowledgeable of the majesty of Christ the man complete in all the numbers of divinity. Moreover, what I feel about the right hand of the power and majesty of God the Father and the throne of command over all, I feel the same about the heaven in which the Son dwells with equal power with the Father, namely that this heaven is not a visible material and created heaven measured by place and time, but a heaven illustrious with the splendor of divinity, which extends as far and wide as the brightness of the Father and the Son extends. Such as no... of the revolving... aspect of the falling substance... would be.</p>
      <p>In the visible heaven, light is seen casting its rays on the earth, the spirit is felt in all things below... this is traversable, in that same heaven rain clouds are prepared, by which the earth, being fertilized, brings forth various fruits for the use of men and other living beings.</p>
      <p>But there must be another heaven in which the pious place their happiness, namely a heaven that is bright with inaccessible light and splendor, from which the elect are illuminated to eternal life and which is distinguished by the spirit that grants true life and glory to the pious, which also contains the waters of life by which new men are generated and from which heaven it is permitted to seek firm treasures for eternity, such as are not sought from those revolving and material heavens described by Moses. Of which the Lord, who opened this heaven and its treasures with his blood, makes mention with these words: "But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal." What kind of heaven this is, the treasures to be laid up and laid up in it declare, and they will know who have some taste of the third heaven, into which the apostle Paul was caught up and saw things which it was not lawful to utter. In it the Father dwells with the Son, the heavenly Father and Christ the heavenly man is called, and from that heaven the kingdom of God is called the heavenly kingdom, the spirit of God the heavenly spirit, that divine fire the regenerator, by which Christ baptizes to a new and heavenly life, the heavenly fire, light, and splendor illuminating us to the true knowledge of God the Father, the heavenly light and splendor, the treasures to be opened to the sons of God are called heavenly treasures. Which indeed as they are spiritual, firm, and eternal, so the heaven in which they are laid up will be called a spiritual heaven inhabited by eternal justice, glory, and life. But if anyone requires the testimony of the fathers who are of this sentiment, I will cite a father whom you prefer to both Greek and Latin theologians in the knowledge of Christ, namely Augustine, whose words in the first book of the fourth volume on the sermon on the mount are: "Rejoice," he says, "and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven; I do not think," says Augustine, "that the heavens here mean the upper parts of this visible world; for our reward, which ought to be unshaken and eternal, is not to be placed in things that are changeable and corporeal.</p>
      <p>But I think it is said of the spiritual heavens, firm... where eternal justice dwells. Thus far Augustine, whom I cite not because I did not follow that sentiment before I came across him, but because I see that the authority of the fathers is of great value to many, it seemed right to bring forth his testimony. And I consulted him on this matter a little before your letters were given to me.</p>
      <p>If it is permitted to speak the truth, my Bullinger, I do not frequent the writings of the fathers as much as you think, but content with the reading of the sacred letters led by the spirit of Christ and with instruments suitable for handling them, I would rather seem to some to be wise from the divine letters than from the commentaries of men. For by the grace of the Lord I understand what is to be attributed to the times of the apostles, to the fathers, and to the intervening times in which the antichrist sat in the holy place devastating all things in the church, and what is to be attributed to our times of the restored gospel in this advent of the revelation of the Messiah. In which many things about the whole cause of justification, about divine predestination, about the distinction of the elect and the rejected, about the nature of the new and old man, about the spirit of adoption, what kind of spirit it is and what is the difference between it and the spirit of the legal pedagogue and whose it is, about the manner of finally explaining the mysteries of the prophets are revealed, which have not been clearly revealed until now. If Luther and Brenz, men well-deserving of religion, are of my opinion, which I have set forth, I confess I do not dissent from them.</p>
      <p>But what these think about this heaven in which Christ dwells, I am not sufficiently certain, in whose writings I have not been much engaged. Recently I came across a little book by Jakob Andreae on the Lord's Supper, in which indeed mention is made of the heaven in which the Father with Christ and the angels dwells present to us; but what kind of heaven it is, he neither explains nor seems to say he understands. To these he discusses the body of Christ, that it is everywhere and is corporally present with the bread and is exhibited to us corporally in the sacred supper. Such I neither teach nor confirm.</p>
      <p>For the heaven into which Christ has been translated, what kind of heaven it is, I show somewhere, and that his body is everywhere and is corporally offered in the sacred supper to be partaken of, I nowhere teach, but I teach that Christ fills all things with the majesty of his command and the unfolding of his perfection diffused into all nature, where I speak separately neither of the body nor of the soul nor of the spirit, but of Christ himself, the man full of divinity and of equal power with the Father, in the way that the sacred letters speak of him for the edification of the church.</p>
      <p>What you bring about the ascension of Christ into heaven, I understand to be considered in two ways: in one way, that Christ was lifted up from the earth in a visible form from the sight of the apostles, in another way, that he is received as having attained heaven, translated from the humble state of the cross into glory, full of the splendor and brightness of divinity. In which he himself reigning with God the Father bestows the gifts of his spirit present to the citizens of his kingdom. And this is what we read in the epistle to the Hebrews that Christ Jesus our Lord was made higher than the heavens by the ascension of his glorification; but which heavens? the material and visible heavens, as created by him and thus to pass away. Which heavens surpassing in glory and brightness he dwells in that heaven which is not comprehended by any limits, illustrious with divine splendor and prepared for the elect and the angels contemplating the face of the Father in that very heaven. The splendor of which heaven of inaccessible nature is estimated not from place, but from the blessed state, as on the contrary Orcus and hell are especially weighed from the miserable condition deprived of the light of divine favor and benevolence. Thus far on these matters.</p>
      <p>If these things will be approved by you, it is well; if not, a time will come, I hope, when they will be approved; for where a fuller explanation of this matter is to be sought, it is not for this purpose and place to indicate. Farewell, my dearest Bullinger, in the Lord, who in his kindness, having begun to kindle the light of truth in us, continues to make it clearer and more illustrious for our renewal. I bid all the brothers and friends there much health in Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 27, 1557.</p>
      <p>Martin Borrhaus, yours.</p>
