      <p>S. D. Froschauer is preparing to depart for Frankfurt; you know the constraints I am under: letters must be written to England, the Netherlands, Hesse, Saxony, Pomerania, Prussia, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am sending letters from which you can gather what you seek.</p>
      <p>Use them wisely; I would not want what is reported about Cond√© to be known to everyone.</p>
      <p>I wrote something similar to you about the people of Glarus. I fear that while they are eager for duties, they may lose greater things.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord to bless this matter.</p>
      <p>The letters I share with you, I share with you alone, and I want you to return them promptly.</p>
      <p>Now there is a rumor in Lucerne that new soldiers are being gathered to be sent to France; the reasons are inferred more from conjecture than from truth.</p>
      <p>Some think that the remaining church in France is to be destroyed by the work of these soldiers, others think the French war is flaring up again.</p>
      <p>We will hear what it is shortly.</p>
      <p>I wrote earlier that the coronation of Maximilian as King of Hungary is stirring up hornets; now I hear that a huge Turkish army has come to Buda.</p>
      <p>If this is true, you can easily gather the rest. They add that those conscripted for the game or contest of cannons (called to the shooting) are being held back until it is seen where the matter leads.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Greet your family, the honorable councilors, Gallicius, Pontisella, and all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. August 27, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours truly.</p>
