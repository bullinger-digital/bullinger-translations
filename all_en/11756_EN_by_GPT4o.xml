    <p xml:id="regest1">That Bullinger did not respond to his last letter [No. 1699?] is also an answer; he wanted to return Vadian's letter long ago, but has been waiting for a letter from Bullinger and also had no messenger at hand. Regarding the [confiscated] Quran edition by the Basel council, Bullinger is probably better informed than he himself; according to [Johannes] Gast, it was released but may not be sold in Basel; the resistance to this publication remains incomprehensible to Myconius. A shorter version of the sent pasquinade was shown to him by [Ludwig von] Reischach a few weeks ago, but due to a lack of messengers, the communication was omitted; he thanks for the report on an inexplicable [ghost phenomenon] that reminds him of the demon of Karlstadt. [King] Ferdinand could become dangerous for Germany; in the Netherlands, it is assumed that Emperor Charles [V.] is no longer alive, and the uncertainty about his coming to the Nuremberg Diet also gives rise to speculations about his death. The [Arch-]Bishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] is striving for reforms; Bucer preaches and teaches [in Bonn] and plans to visit more cities; the people are rough, but Christ also has some disciples there. The Bishop of Münster [Franz von Waldeck] is also seeking [evangelical] scholars, and regarding Minden and Paderborn, Bullinger is already informed. Many soldiers returning from Hungary die on the way; of the 270 horsemen of the Archbishop, only 15 have returned, one of whom, [Wirich?] von Oberstein, died on the last stretch. Duke [Wilhelm] of Jülich is supported by Geldrian, Saxon, and Danish troops and shelled Düren in December; the mediation attempts of the Archbishop and [Landgrave Philip] of Hesse have so far been unsuccessful according to Bucer. From Hungary, it is reported that King Ferdinand, on the occasion of his daughter [Elisabeth]'s marriage to [Sigismund II Augustus] of Poland, is making high demands on the subjects. Request to forward the enclosed letter [Blarer BW II, No. 987], which contains the above news in more detail. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have been waiting for a response to my last letters, but in vain. And since you have not mentioned them even now, I see that, as we often say, silence is also a response. There are two reasons that have kept me from writing: One, I was waiting for your letters, and the other, no one from Zurich has come for a long time; for I wanted to return the letters of Mr. Vadian long ago.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Quran, I believe you know more than I do, even though Oporinus is nearby. I also thought you had learned everything from Gast by now, who told me yesterday that the Quran has finally been released, but on the condition that it may not be sold in the city. I am foolish, for while I see what is happening, I cannot understand why it is happening, even though everything is very clear, that is, both the beginning and the end. If the Lord grants life, I will wait to see what disturbances will arise from this edition. If there are none, I will laugh. Otherwise, I will then marvel at how the eyes of the prudent foresee the future so acutely.</p>
      <p>The pasquinade you sent, I saw a few weeks ago thanks to Mr. von Reischach, although I see some additions in yours, such as several cities and the Swiss. I admired the author's talent, whoever he may be. I intended to send it to you (for I had copied it for this purpose), if there had not been a lack of messengers.</p>
      <p>The demon you write about is not unlike the demon of Karlstadt; for what it did was not feigned, but real. I had never heard of this before, and therefore, I am completely ignorant of what it is. The Lord knows; may He protect us from such and other evils. I truly thank you greatly for making me a participant in these matters.</p>
      <p>I almost shudder at the name of Ferdinand, for he is so hostile to Germany and perhaps eventually to all of us. The title of Emperor is heard from time to time, but Charles himself never appears. No one in the Netherlands is convinced that he is alive. In Antwerp, a man was beheaded who claimed to have been on the ship in which the Emperor perished. However, after it has been repeatedly said that he would come to the Nuremberg Diet, it is now said he will not come, but is preparing arms against the French. Such suspicions about his death cannot help but arise, and yet there seems to be no reason why they would want to conceal his death for so long. Indeed, I neither deny nor assert anything here. Would that, whether he lives or is deceased, the Lord may advance His word.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Cologne wants a sound gospel, sound sacraments, and the expulsion of the fornication of his priests. Therefore, Bucer preaches on Sundays and three times a week, and on the other days, he lectures to the canons and those who understand Latin on the first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians. When this has been done for a time, he will leave vicars behind and go to other more populous cities. The people are very rough, although there is no doubt that Christ has some disciples there.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Münster is seeking pious and learned men from everywhere to teach himself and his people the gospel of Christ. He is said to spare no expense. You already know about Minden and Paderborn, which are subject to Cologne. A miserable spectacle meets the eyes throughout Germany: Soldiers returning from Hungary collapse on the way, wherever you go, as their strength fails.</p>
      <p>Cologne sent 270 horsemen; fifteen returned. Among them, the son of the Count of Oberstein, the standard-bearer, accompanied by a prostitute from Nuremberg, died between Frankfurt and his homeland, after he thought he had escaped all evils.</p>
      <p>Thus the number mentioned has dwindled to 14.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Jülich has an army collected from his own, Geldrians, Saxons, and Danes. In December, he bombarded Düren, so that the noise was heard in Bonn, where the gospel was first preached.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop and Hesse are interceding to obtain peace, but so far completely in vain; for the Archbishop told Bucer in person that no hope appears anywhere. I will also add this from Hungary: When Ferdinand married his daughter to the son of the King of Poland, he demanded three hundred thousand gold coins for the dowry from his subjects and asked them to maintain a harem for him perpetually and to protect the borders of his dominion from Turkish incursions at their own expense. Behold the king.</p>
      <p>These things, except for the last, are contained in a little more detail in the enclosed letters, which, I ask, you send to Blaurer.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in Christ. Greet Theodor and Pellicanus. May the Lord grant that you all labor healthily in the work of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, January 17, 1543. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord, venerable.</p>
