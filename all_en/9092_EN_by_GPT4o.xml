      <p>Greetings. Eight days ago, I wrote a letter to you, which I handed over to our Johann Baptist MÃ¼ller, who enclosed it with his own and addressed it to Mr. Pontisella, etc. I hope you have already received it. In those brief letters, I summarized what we hear about the affairs in the Netherlands. Now, letters are arriving from Nuremberg indicating that William of Orange has dismissed a good part of his army and led the larger part to Roermond, so that from there he may move into Holland and Zeeland for the winter; nothing is said about any defeat suffered. Meanwhile, it is unknown where Count Ludwig is; however, there are those who affirm that he is gravely ill from poison he ingested.</p>
      <p>Alba sent a well-equipped fleet to capture Vlissingen; but he was forced to abandon the attack, leaving it unfinished and with great loss, and to return. The Elector of Saxony recently returned from the King of Denmark. It is said that the kings of Denmark, Sweden, and the German princes have formed an alliance, and now Saxony, upon his return, has summoned all the masters of horse, 32 rittmeisters. The other princes are also reviewing their troops and are said to be preparing for war, in case the Holy League, that is, the Pope, the French, the Spanish, the Italians, and the German prelates, wish to wage war against them and execute the Council of Trent (which they are said to be planning). The imperial cities say they will join the princes. I received this news from Nuremberg today. However, I strongly doubt whether Basel, Schaffhausen, and St. Gallen will renounce the French alliance.</p>
      <p>It is certain, however, that they will not provide any soldiers, and in recent days the people of Glarus have responded that they do not wish to give soldiers to the king.</p>
      <p>Therefore, act wisely in this matter. I am returning Mr. Ruinella's letters and ask you to greet him on my behalf. I also ask you to be vigilant among your people, so that they diligently watch and inquire through their spies what is happening in Italy. If an expedition is to take place, let it be announced early and with certainty; previously, it was also said that an expedition would take place; the scouts sent reported that there was absolutely nothing. What is being said about the victory against the Turks, I believe to be false; I hear that the Venetians are arming and preparing themselves in such a way that it is more likely they have suffered some loss.</p>
      <p>I return everything you sent and thank you. Farewell. I wrote this in haste. November 7, 1572.</p>
      <p>May God restore your wife, etc. If they forbid me, if they let me go to the courts. Then you have good news printed from Rome and Milan.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
