      <p> Greetings. If the person to whom I entrusted this letter to be delivered to St. Gallen had either wanted or been able to stay overnight at my expense or remain with me, you would have received a longer letter from me, most learned and excellent Bullinger. Now, in this short time, my only concern was to inform you and Mr. Gesner as best as I could about what you wanted to know from me. I am most grateful for your most learned booklets, which you have sent me as gifts both frequently in the past and recently; I wish that I could someday repay you as the occasion arises. My wife and my daughter, whose name is Christina, also thank you for this, as I have been accustomed to hand them over to them to be read and reread after I have read them myself. Farewell, most learned man, and may the service of your Volmar always be dear to you. TÃ¼bingen, February 21, 1553. </p>
      <p> Most devoted to your name, Melchior Volmar, called Rufus. </p>
