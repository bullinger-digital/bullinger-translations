      <p> S. I was instructed to express the most ample thanks through you to Lord Consul Lavater for his singular faith; both will have it, and our senate will soon report it. We are now expecting a scribe, whose labors we will duly reward. Regarding what you announced from England, our mutual acquaintance recently informed me in a letter from Antwerp. He added, however, that the royal protector is in chains and that the envoy who acted at Charles's court last summer has also been captured. The English have indeed detected a faction against the gospel, which may perhaps emerge through these means. </p>
      <p> Pole does not rest, whom the Lord will abandon to his own pole. Maurice, the Elector, at the recent Leipzig fair, cleared himself through a herald: he never intended to hinder the course of the gospel, but wishes it to be preached freely and fearlessly throughout his dominion. Accordingly, the merchants of Magdeburg were also granted permission at the same fair to freely sell their goods. There is a persistent rumor that the Emperor will winter near us and enter Italy in the spring; but also that letters from Spain have brought him little joy concerning Gsariffo, the most powerful Duke of Mauritania, and Dragut, the commander of the Turkish fleet, who are said to be preparing to invade the kingdom of Granada with a great force of armed men. For this reason, many suspect that the Emperor will depart for Spain. </p>
      <p> You may know that Ferdinand's daughter was recently taken to Mantua to be joined to the Duke of Mantua. This is Ferdinand Gonzaga's nephew from his brother, not entirely unsuitable for restraining the Venetians, so they cannot easily join forces with the French. It is certain that the Pope has pledged all his efforts and resources to the French, and there is no slight reason why the French so insistently rage against us in the name of religion. However, the illustrious prelate Pietro Paolo Vergerio asserted that the favor of embracing the gospel is remarkably growing throughout all of Italy. He stayed with us in St. Gallen for three days, delightfully discussing many matters; he would have come to you without delay, but disturbed by the persistent rumor of contagion, he went to Basel, where he will perhaps remain for several months until he completes some of his writings. He is a learned, eloquent, pious man, and very fond of you. You may have heard about the envoys returning from the French. They were treated honorably and dismissed most courteously, all adorned with chains. They were given 300 gold crowns for their return, 150 to their companions, which is half; however, the Valesians received the same as the cantons; each of the three cantons is counted as one place and each received 300 crowns for the return, also a chain worth 500 crowns, like another place, but the others received a chain worth 200. It was too much for our pot, he did not desire it. Yet the mendicancy of some was so great and insolent that I was truly ashamed and disgusted on behalf of our Switzerland. The privileges concerning our trade in Lyon have been obtained by my lords according to their desire. This was our sole aim. Farewell. </p>
      <p> St. Gallen, November 8, 1549. </p>
      <p> Joachim Vadian. </p>
      <p> To the worthy and honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in ZÃ¼rich, my kind lord. </p>
