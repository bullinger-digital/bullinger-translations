      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, I am convinced that you are both well and alive.</p>
      <p>By the grace of God, I indeed live and am well, and (as it is with Virgil) I lead my life through all extremes.</p>
      <p>This week I have received nothing from you; I could not respond to your previous letters because there was no one to whom I could give them. Meanwhile, there is nothing but turmoil among us and the notable treachery of many, nothing firm, nothing safe.</p>
      <p>If I dared to entrust the matter to letters, you would hear astonishing things, indeed with amazement: those very people, in whom I had placed the most trust before and for whom the gospel was profitable and who were enriched by it, are the torchbearers of all this evil. For they knew Beatus very well and could never deny how bitter an enemy he was to our religion, and yet they desire to promote him with all effort (for if they had not incited, so few priests would never have attempted anything against the House of God) with their own, the church's, and the country's destruction and ruin.</p>
      <p>For I already see the destruction of this city before my eyes, unless God mercifully averts it. But all admonitions are scorned by those men.</p>
      <p>There are still many good men who groan. You can imagine me placed on slippery ground and exposed to many snares; thus, I lead long days and nights.</p>
      <p>I wrote to my father-in-law about the burning of the bishop's castle; my house is near the castle, etc.</p>
      <p>You will understand the rest from my father-in-law's letters, etc.</p>
      <p>I stayed at home because I had no one to trust, and because it was not at all safe to commit oneself to the indiscriminate crowd, etc.</p>
      <p>The other one was confirmed in Rome (if I can obtain the pope's letters, I will send them); it is also said that he was given much gold by the pope. And as for that good man about whom you wished to know, I can advise him nothing at all in such perplexing matters.</p>
      <p>He should act rightly, as he can.</p>
      <p>They were supposed to deal with this matter these days; but six hundred other things intervened.</p>
      <p>I think nothing was done, etc., nor could the consul himself say anything certain.</p>
      <p>As for your debt, Consul Tsch[arnerus] assured me for certain that the full amount would soon be paid to you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if he is to be believed, as I believe, the Setzstab should be advised to act nicely, and informed that the statements should be consistent.</p>
      <p>I have heard here that it is true, Setzstab has paid you half the amount. But if Setzstab was not paid for his half, it would stand that he would seek you for it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in my opinion, Setzstab may well proceed; but if he were asked how the matter stands, he should also answer accordingly, etc. You understand.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I hope to obtain the full amount, and so the consul said it was decreed anew by the senate. I sent a small amount of wine, I think it was delivered, etc. - The plague itself here takes one and another; it invaded a house where husband and wife died. A few days ago, two came here, father and son, from Schaffhausen (if I am not mistaken), goldsmiths, artists; they wanted to cut the minting walls. They were not very strong when they came, yet they went around with a fever; they died in an hour, so suddenly.</p>
      <p>The old man was half an hour before at Pontisella in the school. I received no letters from you.</p>
      <p>But there are those who say that the very honorable wife of Mr. Gwalther has passed away.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gwalther has lost a great good.</p>
      <p>But these and other things must be borne bravely and overcome with great spirit by Christians.</p>
      <p>You must believe this from me: it has been about two months now that I never received letters from Zurich without my wife asking whether Mr. Gwalther's wife was well, and when she repeated this for several weeks, I finally asked why she inquired so curiously about her.</p>
      <p>She replied: "I go now every night with her in sleep; sometimes we have a good life, sometimes I help carry her to the grave, so that I cannot believe it means nothing; for I have never dreamed of her before." This she said, and the outcome showed what these frequent dreams wanted for themselves.</p>
      <p>You will greet Mr. Gwalther reverently from me and console him with my words.</p>
      <p>You will also pray to the Lord for me, that He may protect me in these troubles and strengthen me with His spirit.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve and protect you from all evil. Chur, November 19, 1565.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>If the unrest increases and I must send my wife and child to Zurich, then always act as fathers, as you have done so far, and I assure you of nothing else, etc.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, you understand what has been done from this writing attached here, which you will return to me by God; for I have retained no copy. You will give it to Mr. Collin to read and tell the summary to the consuls.</p>
      <p>You see in what state my affairs are.</p>
      <p>At home, as much as I can, I stay, and so good friends advise.</p>
      <p>Here Consul Tsch[arnerus] or rather the avarice of the republic is a ruin, etc.</p>
      <p>I am secretly attacked by him, openly very flattering, etc. I can write nothing certain about the affairs of Chur; the House of God stands very firmly in its opinion.</p>
      <p>I believe the remaining Confederates will not take much notice of the matter. The one from Marmels has appealed for justice before the two Confederates; the House of God strongly opposed.</p>
      <p>The departure was with the cause unresolved; no answer was given to the one from Marmels. Also, they are in the negotiation that they will renew the Confederates.</p>
      <p>So the House of God would not agree to anything else than that each Confederate should remain with his rights and freedoms, etc.</p>
      <p>This is brought back to the communities. Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>But... the main thing, which was, I forgot, and the other consul said, they should have no more worry about your debt, and it is a unanimous sea before my lords, that, while they want to honor you in one thing and another, they will let you pursue the whole debt. The lady promised my lords to pour out wine and pay you 36 florins.</p>
      <p>Both consuls ordered to write this for certain.</p>
      <p>Therefore, they ordered the Setzstab to completely desist, so that it brings no confusion, and to wait for my lords' promise, yet to remain silent.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>November 20.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his and in Christ reverend father.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
