    <p xml:id="regest1">Hopes he has meanwhile returned healthy from the bath. Asks for a report on the conflict with the university and especially about the role that the people of Strasbourg are playing in it. Is glad that nothing will come of the Nuremberg religious discussion, as an agreement would only be possible at the expense of the truth. Thanks for everything he did for Rudolf [Gwalther]. The publication of Vadian's [“Orthodoxa et erudita... epistola”] and Vigilius’ five books [“Contra Eutychen”] was prompted by the interest of Myconius and Grynäus, but also by the events in Ulm; those fanatics who want to evaporate Christ's flesh are now exposed. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I hope you have finally returned from those baths, and may it be in good health and in all respects well. We are all well here, praise be to the Lord.</p>
      <p>We have not yet received any certain news about that university conflict; I have been waiting for you until now. Therefore, I ask you to write to me about the whole matter, especially what the people of Strasbourg have done and whose side they have supported, and furthermore, how the situation stands now. Various rumors are being spread.</p>
      <p>I am glad that the Nuremberg convention has either turned to ashes or has been absorbed like a sponge. For I have seen some of our people so fearful that I could not help but fear a less than complete agreement. However, it is better to remain on the cross and have pure truth on our side than to act in peace with the truth obscured. The opposing side is not such that an agreement can be made with them. Nor do they harmonize with us. Some people vainly promise themselves some kind of repentance, which I do not know. Let us therefore continue on the path of truth and sincere faith, and let us entrust the outcome to God himself, praying that he may strengthen his grace in us.</p>
      <p>Besides this, I have nothing to write except to thank you greatly on behalf of Rudolf. He praises your kindness and the benefits bestowed upon him. May the Lord be your reward.</p>
      <p>I have taken care to have Vadian's letter printed; I have added five books by Vigilius on the same subject. The students owe it to you and Grynaeus that they enjoy this letter. Since it pleased you so much that you had it copied for yourselves, it seemed unfair to share it with only a few. But also, that Ulm sore seemed to require such a plaster. If those fanatical spirits nevertheless continue to distill the flesh of Christ through an alembic, their foolishness will be evident to all the pious.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your whole family.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 30.</p>
      <p>Greet Lord Grynaeus diligently.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant overseer of the church in Basel, his esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
