      <p>Greetings. From the letters of our Beza, you will understand the state of our churches; I am sending you a copy of them. Although there are a few things in them that pertain to other matters, I have taken care to transcribe them in full, word for word, and have signed them with my own hand. However, since you can hardly understand them unless you know the history itself, I want to narrate it to you. There is a town on the borders of Champagne near Joinville called Wassy, where Christ had gathered a church of about fifteen hundred, who, relying on the king's edict (by which he receives all the sacred assemblies of the faithful into his protection), were meeting securely to hear the word and offer their prayers. The Duke of Guise, who was then in that region, knowing that the unarmed and unsuspecting could easily be overwhelmed by a sudden attack, armed his troops as if heading elsewhere, and sent them ahead to instill terror with pistols; he soon followed.</p>
      <p>What he hoped for happened, that he caught them unarmed and unprepared; for they were so intent on doctrine and prayers. More than one hundred and fifty were killed in the very assembly, two hundred wounded; the rest saved themselves by fleeing. Soon there was a rush for plunder, houses were ransacked as if victory had been won over enemies. Those who escaped immediately went to Paris and were soon brought to the king by Beza, who, complaining of such atrocious and barbaric cruelty, simply demanded in the name of all that the king should not allow innocent blood to be shed.</p>
      <p>The King of Navarre then took up the defense of the Duke of Guise; however, an inquiry was decreed. This is the story that Mr. Beza deals with in his letters, which otherwise you would hardly have understood.</p>
      <p>From this, my lord, you can easily see not only the danger in which innocent and pious people find themselves, unless the audacity and fury of importunate men are immediately countered. As for the queen mother and indeed the king himself, it is easy to judge from the recently promulgated edict, since the king commands all his officials not to allow the sacred assemblies, which he receives into his protection and patronage, to suffer injury, provided our people abstain from tumult and arms.</p>
      <p>But you see from Beza's letters how the queen fears for herself and her son from the audacity of the enemies, lest they claim the king for themselves and draw the supreme power to themselves under his name. It is to be hoped that the most illustrious Cantons, who have the kingdom of Christ at heart, understand these things and, although you can easily judge with your prudence what counsel should be taken, it seems to me and to all good men that nothing can better suppress the rage and mad plan than if these tyrants understand that there are most valiant men and powerful princes who not only ask the king through their envoys not to yield to the fury of madmen in such a serious matter, namely in which the safety of the church is joined with his royal authority, but also, if necessary, offer assistance. I do not give you advice, most illustrious man, but I reveal the spirit, not mine, but of all the faithful. Would that our Calvin had had the leisure to write to you about these matters, but there was no leisure, and he wrote to you two days before his departure. However, he ordered that we inform you as soon as possible from the journey and send a copy of Beza's letters. For we were scarcely dismissed after the plan was made to inform the most illustrious princes about these matters, whom we heard had already gathered in Heidelberg. I ask you again and again to write to Mr. Calvin as soon as possible your opinion, from whom I send you many greetings, and from my brother in Joinville, to whom if you write, he will diligently inform you of the state of the churches, for in my absence everything will be written to him from Paris.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed man. Greet in my name most dutifully all the pious brothers who are there. March 29, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your most observant of your kindness, Jean Bud√©.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ and most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
