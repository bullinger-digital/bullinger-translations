    <p xml:id="regest1">Karlstadt has not written anything that could incite him against Myconius; for Bullinger, the standard in the question of the theological doctorate is the early Christian custom. During the meeting of Megander and Leo [Jud] in Brugg, agreement was reached on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Myconius is to counteract any division in Basel with the support of the people of Zurich. Inquires on behalf of council members about the situation in Münster, the Imperial Diet in Worms, and the activities of the Anabaptists in Alsace and Breisgau. Asks about Bucer's return and Capito's attitude towards the Anabaptists.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Regarding the doctorate, venerable brother, I have never written or reproached Karlstadt in a way that could incite him against you or any good man. What can I say? I am displeased with the discord that has arisen between you because of this matter. I am displeased with the pompous Doctorate, indeed with all Doctorates that are not instituted according to the norm of the primitive church and the Pauline epistles.</p>
      <p>On April 29th, our Leo met with Megander in Brugg, and they reached a good agreement on the sacramental matter in all respects. All suspicion of discord has been erased.</p>
      <p>I would wish that, with those haughty titles set aside, you would agree in spirit and word, you who have come into conflict in Basel because of the doctorate. My dear Myconius, venerable brother, continue in your holy simplicity. Strive to keep the bond of peace and concord between you unblemished and intact. We promise mutual assistance if anyone more arrogant needs to be brought into line. Just show us the way. We will pray, advise, rebuke, do everything you command, only let there be no schism among you. I pour this into your bosom. You understand what I mean. You see enough other dissensions arising in the world.</p>
      <p>Then there are certain things I ask to know and be explained to me with certainty by you: About those who have fallen out of Münster, all stabbed and 8 blockhouses destroyed, whether a day has been set for Worms, whether there is concern in Alsace, Breisgau, etc., of an uprising, many secret Anabaptists who wanted to attack Colmar, therefore 10 are imprisoned in Colmar? Some senators have diligently ordered these matters to be investigated. Therefore, write to me in German what is said among you, whether by rumor or truth, so that I may present these to them and always expect my assistance in a similar matter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the prefect, the brother messenger will add something here.</p>
      <p>I wonder if Bucer has returned to Strasbourg, or if Capito still connives with the Anabaptists.</p>
      <p>Farewell greatly.</p>
      <p>May 8, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, most vigilant overseer of the Basel church, venerable brother.</p>
