      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, we have won, to God be praise and glory through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>My lords of the Grisons have restored freedom to the Valtellina in the assembly; for in previous years they had prohibited any preacher of our doctrine or schoolmaster from residing there. Thus, our poor brothers were forced to live in the Alps or flee to Geneva or even further. God used your Vergerio, a weak instrument, for a great matter; to Him be glory forever. I wanted to come immediately; but the lords themselves wish to discuss this matter with me, lest any wicked man might enter under the pretext of religion, which indeed must be guarded against.</p>
      <p>A synod will be held in Chur after St. Martin's Day. I wish you would urge with your letters to Comander and Gallicius, that they should not allow that valley to be infected with the Anabaptist disease; for there are those who act with authority and try to draw those two back. I know what I am saying; I do not write in vain. Indeed, also urge about Camillus himself; for when he escaped (as I wrote), I noticed that the man has become more insolent. I know how much those pastors value you. What if you also added the authority of your council?</p>
      <p>I heard about Morletto, who has fallen asleep in the Lord, praise be to God. Morosinus is stuck in Speyer with the other envoys by the order of the Emperor; he himself wrote to me. I beg you by your faith, to take care of sending my letters to him and others to Geneva. I would consider it advisable for you to send those pertaining to Morosinus to some good man in Speyer, lest they be lost if the envoy had left and followed the Emperor.</p>
      <p>For the third time I say: if the two vessels have not been sent, order them to remain until I come. Greetings to all; may the Lord God bless your labors. Amen. Vicosoprano, on the first of November.</p>
      <p>Vergerio.</p>
      <p>Write to the people of Speyer, that they should send letters to the Emperor's court, if Morosinus had left.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Regarding your letters to the pastors of Chur, I have thought otherwise, namely that they should be sent to them by someone else, not by me, to avoid suspicion, about which I wrote; therefore, I do not send them back.</p>
