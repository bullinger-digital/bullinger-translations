    <p xml:id="regest1">When Bullinger sent his Matthew [Commentary] to [Johannes] Gast and Myconius only learned about it indirectly, he expressed his surprise about it; his concern that Bullinger had found out about it and therefore remained silent in displeasure was apparently unfounded. Contrary to the expectation of [Ludwig] von Reischach, Bullinger does not mention the accusations that [King Francis I] is said to have made against Zurich. May the fate of the returning mercenaries bring others to their senses; the Basel mandate [against the mercenary trade] will hardly have much effect. Among the troops sent to Hungary, it is said that especially the contingents from the imperial cities suffered great losses, on the other hand, it is reported that Pest has been captured; it is to be feared that the unfavorable rumors are more likely to be true. After the devastation of Jülich by a [Dutch] army, a new war threatens Germany - the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied], [Johann Friedrich of] Saxony, and [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse are trying to mediate - while the people of God lose proven leaders; God's wrath is deserved and can only be appeased through repentance and prayer.</p>

      <p>Because you have been silent for so long, I feared that something unfortunate might have happened against me, for which I might have been the cause. However, when I looked into everything, I found nothing except your Matthew, about which I had said, after I learned that you had sent it to Gast: "Strange, that Bullinger did not mention it to me even with a word, nor did Gast. What could this mean?" I thought, therefore: "Perhaps someone who heard your words falsely reported to Bullinger, as the human tongue is a reckless and slippery thing." I recently wrote to our Theodore about this matter, to see if I could understand the reason for your silence. But now that you have used your usual style again, that is, friendly, my suspicion has disappeared.</p>
      <p>The rest is: The day before I received your letter, I heard from Lord von Rischach that the French had accused your people again at the Five Cantons, and indeed very seriously. "If there is anything, you will soon learn from Bullinger," he said.</p>
      <p>You wrote, but nothing about the accusation. If you have understood anything, please inform us, I beg you. The fact that the soldiers are returning, contrary to custom, is unusual; I wish it would teach many to be wise! For I fear that our mandate against the disobedient, not to say perjurers, will come to nothing. As for the rumor about the Hungarian army, I fear it is not just a rumor; for today they openly say here that our people have been slaughtered, especially the soldiers given by the cities, as they were placed in the line of battle by the princes.</p>
      <p>Although these days a messenger has arrived from Nuremberg announcing that many indeed have perished, but Pest has been captured. I am almost forced, as things stand now, to believe what is more unfortunate.</p>
      <p>The devastation of Jülich has surely reached you as well, which was begun by the army of Queen Mary. Therefore, a new war in Germany is to be feared.</p>
      <p>The Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied], Saxony [Johann Friedrich of Saxony], and Hesse [Landgrave Philip of Hesse] are said to be mediating to the best of their ability, but I do not know with what effect. Meanwhile, even the most proven men and leaders of the people of God are perishing for us. What do you think God has planned against us ungrateful ones? The learned fight among themselves with hatred; the people neglect, if not despise, the word of God; emotions dominate as never before. Therefore, the wrath of God justly burns against us, we are justly afflicted, we justly perish, because there is no repentance, but a persistence in all evils even after the scripture cries out and calls us to return to the Lord our God, that He may be merciful, only let us return. Come, unless the Lord delivers us in the midst of tribulations, it is over. Those who have a spirit not proud, but humble, not envious, but full of candor, not irascible, but calm, let them pray continually, that God may have mercy on us all. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your household in Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, November 6, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most learned theologian, his very venerable brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
