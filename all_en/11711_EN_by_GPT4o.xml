    <p xml:id="regest1">Asks for an apology for the inconvenience. The pastor Erasmus Ritter, Bullinger's friend, who previously worked in Schaffhausen and is now in Bern, is accused of having abducted a citizen's daughter in Memmingen and joined the rebels [in the Peasants' War]; the informant [Adam Heinricher] has cited an unnamed mayor of Memmingen as a witness. Bullinger asks to be informed, either by him or Ritter, whether [Funk] or another mayor is aware of such matters; Ritter declares that he only briefly stayed in Memmingen in the year 1525 and did nothing wrong. Bullinger is convinced that a preacher of the truth is being silenced by an insinuation; Ritter is ready to justify himself; request for an immediate response.</p>

      <p>Pious, prudent, wise, beloved, gracious lord, my friendly greetings, willing service, and whatever good I can do for you, beforehand.</p>
      <p>A matter has come to me that is so burdensome that I could not refrain from writing to you, though I am reluctant to trouble you; for I know well that you are otherwise burdened with many affairs.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I also kindly ask you not to take offense at my writing, but to take it in good part and to advise and assist me in my concern.</p>
      <p>I have a good, dear friend, patron, and brother in Bern, named Erasmus Ritter, who was formerly a preacher in Schaffhausen and now preaches the gospel very faithfully in Bern. Therefore, he also has great opposition from some people who want to drive him away or damage his honor and make him useless. It happened recently that someone spoke maliciously and with audacity: "Erasmus is a scoundrel, he did not leave Memmingen honorably, but abducted a citizen's daughter and joined the rebels, causing unrest, for which I have good knowledge from the mayor of Memmingen," etc. Now I cannot know whether he meant you or another mayor of Memmingen; however, he clearly named the mayor of Memmingen as a witness. Therefore, my friendly and urgent request to you is that you would be so kind as to write to me or to my dear Christian brother Erasmus Ritter, whether you know anything of these matters as the slanderer claims, or if you have no knowledge of Erasmus at all, whether there is another mayor in Memmingen who knows something about the matter for which Erasmus, as mentioned, is accused. For Erasmus informs me that he has never conducted any special business in Memmingen, only came there after the unrest in 1525 and stayed for not much more than fourteen days. He may have spoken with people who were suspected in the past rebellion, but he did not know it; he also did not speak to anyone at all about unrest, nor did he abduct anyone's daughter maliciously or dishonorably.</p>
      <p>Since I am then quite certain that such an accusation was invented by the aforementioned slanderer out of malice, envy, and opposition to the preacher of the truth, and that you or another mayor of Memmingen know nothing but good about the aforementioned preacher in Bern, or perhaps have no knowledge of him at all and know nothing about him, etc., I ask you once again for God's and the truth's sake, to inform me or him of your opinion or advise what you think is best. For Erasmus offers to travel to you and present himself before an honorable council in Memmingen or to show himself to you, should anyone understand, to take knowledge from you or anyone. He also desires to be given a free opportunity with you to defend himself honorably if he is now accused, etc. And for his sake and in service of the truth, also for the sake of God-loving people in Bern, I have sent this messenger to you, not without cost, solely for the sake of the matter. Therefore, my urgent request is that you would write me a response without delay (wherever it is in your power) by this messenger and thus assist and advise me and my dear brother in such a serious matter. If I can ever serve you in return, I will be entirely willing. Herewith, I commend you to God in His protection and grace, along with all yours.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, on the 29th day of September in the year of our Lord 1542. Your always willing</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
