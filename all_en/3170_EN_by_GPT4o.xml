      <p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father through Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
      <p>Our Marcus, the most vigilant pastor of the Altstätten church, venerable lord and father, after we learned that he had already set out on a journey to you with the impending Synod of Zürich, we convened our St. Gallen Synod earlier so that he could also attend, both because of the man's singular grace, pious learning, and ecclesiastical gravity, and so that through him we might ask for your opinion if any perplexity should come into our deliberation. For we have hitherto fled to your counsel as to the Sibylline leaves, as they say, which we now also suspected would be the case. Nor did our opinion deceive us, as you will hear more fully from Marcus, which I will now outline briefly. Romanshorn, a famous place and like a peninsula extending into Lake Constance, has a church of Christ established with such sincerity that, although it has a president residing there by the authority of the abbot, it has remained untainted by the profanation of the mass through the care of the pastor and his constant vigilance. However, it happened that when that faithful pastor, due to the weight of old age, fell into a stroke, the wife of the delirious old man made a pact for a fee with the minister of a neighboring church, into which he had recently crept, a man of the marketplace, illiterate and infamous for his scurrilous behavior, to also attach this church, as if deprived of a pastor, to his administration. Hence it came about that this man was put in charge of two churches, whom we did not consider worthy to be put in charge of even one. Finally, with the old pastor now dead, this man began to collude with the president of that place, a man extravagant, inflated, and a bankrupt, and, as they say, through gifts, promises, and slanders against our people, he proceeded to the point that the abbot, rejecting all others, placed the church in his hands, although not with the opposition, but with the reluctance and fear of the people. Now, relying on the friendship of the president, this man did not attend the synod to which he was summoned; he informed by letter that he could not come, concealed the reasons, and then, even when ordered, did not present testimonies of his former conduct nor, as far as we know, did he give an account of his doctrine in any examination. We, however, hesitate as to what means should be used to counter such sad examples, as we lack private authority and public magistracy, which would be a terror to the disobedient and contumacious, especially since we do not all act under the same magistracy but are gathered from four dominions, differing in religion to some extent.</p>
      <p>What has come to our mind here are these: lest the offense of this obstinate minister also reflect on us, it seemed to the synod that it would be appropriate to declare in writing to the church he presides over what we desire in its minister, and why we judge him unfit for the fellowship of our synod and cannot bear to be counted among us. Moreover, to advise authority and so that our churches might more attentively regard, cultivate, and observe their constitutions, we judge it not useless if each church were to send a man of senatorial order or another of proven integrity along with its minister to sit in the synod, hear, and at the same time give their counsel for the propagation and retention of doctrine and discipline. But we have decided to attempt none of these things before we hear your judgments. We have therefore enjoined Marcus, that, admitted to your synod with his diligence, he may reverently inquire about these things, nor do we doubt that we can easily obtain from you, whom we know to be most inclined to support the churches of Christ, as in a common shipwreck. I appeal to you, most prudent and learned Bullinger, beloved father, but briefly, lest I seem to distrust your piety, since your inexhaustible labor and nightly vigilance for the churches are celebrated throughout the world, that you may have us and our churches commended to your counsel. Meanwhile, it will be ours to persist in prayers to God, that he may guide all our counsels to the glory of his name and by his goodness deliver the churches, purchased with the precious blood of his Son, from such monsters and preserve them in the purity of doctrine and innocence of life. Farewell in the Lord, our honor, together with all the best and most learned men, brothers, and fellow ministers who are with you, where we greatly rejoice that the distinguished ornament of the church, Peter Martyr, whom you know and whose illustrious [Greek] monuments are well known, has recently joined this renowned choir.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the day after the calends of May, 57.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned doctor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord.</p>
