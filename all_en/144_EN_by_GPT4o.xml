      <p>Greetings. I do not doubt, most illustrious man, that you know the names of those who have gathered in Augsburg to settle the matter of religion, namely the commissioners in the name of the imperial majesty, the Elector of Mainz and Doctor Nikolaus Hass, the Archbishop of Mainz, Cologne's Philipp M端nch, Trier's Johann von Leyen, canon, Palatinate's Doctor Wolf von Affenstein, knight, Saxony's Doctor Fuchs, Brandenburg's Eustachius von Schleychen, the spiritual princes Heinrich Th端rm端g, the worldly princes Doctor Egg von Randegg, the prelates Abbot of Weingarten, the counts one of Montfort, the free and imperial cities Jacob Sturm of Strasbourg, Georgius Besserer of Ulm. It is surprising what kind of religion these men will invent and deliver to us, namely peaceful, tranquil, and most agreeable to the word of God; but behold, it is plainly different: diabolical, papistic; for, most humane man, in these attached papers you will have how excellently these men, the wisest in the world, have exercised the powers of their intellect, delivering nothing else than what was partly abolished and in some places, partly not. To this end, all these are governed by one man and a rogue, which is clear from these 20 chapters, not indeed the Pope or the Emperor, but the Bishop of Sidon, suffragan of Mainz, who has so persuaded everyone with his 15 sermons (which I have read), that they deliver to us nothing else than what is contained in his sermons, in almost the same order and manner and almost the same words.</p>
      <p>However, I thought you might not yet have this decree of the Augsburg assembly, because these days a certain Basel man, just returning from Augsburg and making his journey very quickly through our city, brought these with him and, by chance, while he was having lunch, I quickly copied them. I offered them to my fellow students, urging them to send them to you and also to write to you just once; but they instructed me to do the same. Therefore, most upright man, I send these to your humanity [beseeching], that you consider the poorly composed writing and even this uncomposed sheet favorably and always keep us all commended to your humanity. If there is anything new, may you deign to write to us; for I, and even the elders, are so negligent that no letters provoke you, so that your letters of humanity may be brought to us.</p>
      <p>But farewell, most excellent man, and in our name greet Theodor, Pellican, Gwalther, and all the others.</p>
      <p>Given the day after the calends of June in the year 1548. In Schaffhausen. Jakob R端eger, most devoted to your humanity.</p>
      <p>To the man outstanding in learning and virtue, D. M. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
