    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to illness, he has not written for a longer time, but more than the physical ailments, it pains him that the carnival was celebrated so excessively this time that even 70-year-olds cannot remember anything comparable; certain people are rejoicing that [Karlstadt] has broken the compulsion of the priests - Myconius and Markus [Bertschi]. In addition, Grynäus was requested by a council decision on February 21 to either accept the doctoral title or give up his teaching position. Meanwhile, Emperor [Charles V] is recording successes in the Netherlands: Ghent had to submit to him, he has taken away Maastricht's freedom, Duke [William] of Jülich will likely be handed over to him under the influence of his mother Geldern, and in Liège, which he already controls, he has installed a bishop whom he intends to inherit. Some doubt whether the Germans are ready to defend their equally threatened freedom; we will see what the upcoming Bundestag in Schmalkalden brings. To Elector Palatine [Frederick], the Emperor is said to have remarked that he will not leave the church schism in suspense; negotiations will likely be followed by war. Woe to us, who meanwhile occupy ourselves with papist trivialities and twist good and evil! The remarks about [Karlstadt] and Grynäus are confidential; Myconius asks for comfort. Greetings. As a sample, he sends Bullinger and Theodor [Bibliander] ridiculous disputation theses [from Karlstadt]. He asks for news from Constance and Augsburg.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am so miserable that, while waiting for news from Strasbourg to satisfy you, the Lord has confined me to bed again, and this is the reason why I have not written for a longer time.</p>
      <p>After I rise, I am so tormented by scabies that I can barely hold a pen in my hands. Meanwhile, the pain in my soul grows even heavier; for during the last carnival, the people began to act so outrageously that even seventy-year-old men said they had never seen anything like it. Everything that was forbidden since the beginning of the gospel was repeated so shamelessly during those days that you could easily see where the spirit of everyone was inclined. Some even did not hide their thoughts, saying: "The bow that has been held for so long has finally been released; praise God in the highest." Some attribute this change without dissimulation to the Saxon, saying: "If that good and learned man had not come here, see where those priests," referring to me and Markus, "would have driven us." Tell me, how can these things be overcome if the Lord does not grant patience?</p>
      <p>Additionally: Our Lord Grynaeus is compelled by a senate decree (which was made on the twenty-first of February) to become a doctor or to leave his theological lectureship.</p>
      <p>We are surrounded by these papist trifles, while it is certain that the Emperor is acting most successfully in the Lower Germany. For Ghent has surrendered to him; he entered with three thousand foot soldiers and two thousand horsemen, with great damage to the public treasury besides what has not yet been written. The citizens gave the public cannons to the Emperor's custody. The Emperor has taken away the freedom of the city of Maastricht, and now it is considered part of the House of Burgundy. Everyone believes that the Duke of Jülich will cede Gelderland to the Emperor; his mother has such influence over him, although he is otherwise an excellent young man. She is the lady of Jülich, etc., and is wonderfully opposed to the gospel. The Emperor truly possesses Liège; however, in name, a bishop appointed by him holds it, whom he keeps celibate to deprive his family of heirs and thus the rich territory, as they say, will come into the Emperor's right. With these strategies, he attempts to claim Germany for himself. Some dare to say that the Germans have almost no sense to defend their freedom, although others still hope. The princes and cities are meeting again in Schmalkalden; we await what will happen. The Emperor told the Elector Palatine last year in Spain that he wants to either remove the church's evil or make it worse and not allow it to remain in its current state. However, it is thought that the beginnings will be with negotiations and art, but the middle and end will be concluded with war.</p>
      <p>This last part is from the Chancellor of the Palatine. See in what situation we are; meanwhile, we play those papist games, meanwhile, we conceal crimes, meanwhile, we applaud sins, call evil good and good evil. Woe to us!</p>
      <p>I wrote to you alone about the Saxon and Grynaeus. Please console us more frequently; it is needed. I cannot write more about these things.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with all yours.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Basel, February 26, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Please, you and Theodor (Bibliander) examine the institution, argument, and art of the author of our disputations, and hold back your laughter.</p>
      <p>I would like to be informed by you briefly about the people of Constance and Augsburg, if leisure permits.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Zurichers, his venerable lord and brother.</p>
