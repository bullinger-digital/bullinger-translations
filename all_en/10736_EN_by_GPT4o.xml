    <p xml:id="regest1">Hoped, like Grynaeus, to meet Bullinger in Aarau, and now requests his opinion on the agreement reached there. Is prepared, under certain conditions, to attend the convention of Upper German churches proposed by Capito and advises holding such a meeting before Christmas, as tensions around Milan are increasing. Recommends the bearer of the letter, a brother of [Franz] Lambert. Capito has reported on an English embassy to France. In Schmalkalden, in the presence of envoys from England, Scotland, and Denmark, important issues such as the Frankfurt Reformation process are being negotiated. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. We, that is, Dr. Grynaeus and I, were expecting you, I say you, in Aarau, not because we were averse to the others, but because the whole matter for which we convened pertained to you not among the last. However, since things turned out differently, I am very eager to know what you think about the confession, which we have established in such brief, clear, and simple words. I see nothing here changed from the opinion we have held until now, except that we have shortened the words, yet this was not without reason, which you have seen explained. The adversaries are cunning, and it seemed to them that simplicity should be countered. The authors of concord are noted by some for inconsistency, and therefore we thought it necessary to deal with them through the clarity of truth, as long as God allows. Therefore, we were not permitted to establish anything better and truer. Indeed, the more I revisit the matter, the more it pleases me, and I begin to wonder whether it could displease anyone who has faith, whoever that may be.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Capito urges us about the common convention of the upper churches. I indeed see that the matter will be easily accomplished, provided you and the Bernese agree. It is not the Eucharist, but the common utility of the churches that should be the cause, and yet not exclude it. For laypeople will be present, if we convene, without a doubt, before whom nothing will not be discussed. Therefore, it must be considered from the beginning how to deal with them cautiously, so they are not made more agitated. They are, that is, fearful. If what is said about Milan is true, it would indeed be time to convene now. After the birth of the Lord, once the lightness of the air is perceived, soldiers will fly up and down, so that the roads will not be passable for everyone without danger. Therefore, it seems we must hurry. Soon we will also know from the magistrate what the matter is.</p>
      <p>The rest is: The one who delivers this to you says he was the brother of that Lambert. He seems to be a good man; whether he is, I do not know. I have arranged for him to be given two gold coins here. We have promised, however, if he returns to us, not to abandon the man for a time.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Capito writes in his latest letters to me that the Englishman is on this special mission, to compel the Frenchman (whom I hear has been horrendously visited by the Lord) into the evangelical net.</p>
      <p>In Schmalkalden, there are embassies from at least three kings: the English, the Scots, and the Danes, besides many princes favoring the gospel. They are said to be dealing with serious matters, among the first being the proscription of the Frankfurters. We must wait to see what the new year will bring us.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live long with yours and with our most esteemed Utinger. Greet all the brothers diligently.</p>
      <p>Basel, December 12, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, first ecclesiast of the Zurichers, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
