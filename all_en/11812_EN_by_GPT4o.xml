    <p xml:id="regest1">He learned too late that the Chief Guild Master of Zurich [...] had asked him to write to Bullinger; actually, he wanted to address Bullinger only indirectly with a letter to Vadian or [Ambrosius] Blarer, but he still owes him the return [of a document] that he wanted to use in the dispute over the doctrine of the Lord's Supper from [Georg Keller], a [Zwinglian] pastor in the service of Ludwig von Freyberg; since the visitation was interrupted due to the arrival of the Emperor [Charles V in Ulm], he still keeps it with him. Perhaps his letter to Vadian [from July 23] did not arrive, as he inquired about the rumor that Frecht had been a guest of the Emperor; in reality, the Archbishop of [Santiago de] Compostela [Gaspar de Ávalos] invited him to a conversation, which was attended by other Spanish clergy, including the Emperor's confessor [Pedro de Soto]; the Spaniards are said to have provided the Emperor with the most learned theologians for upcoming religious negotiations, but from them, only the usual accusations about deviating from the customs of the Roman Church are heard; some Italian laymen praised Bernardino [Ochino] and Peter Martyr [Vermigli], but from the other Spaniards and Italians, as well as from the Archbishop, nothing but complaints about the abolition of the Mass, images, and the cult of saints could be heard. It would be hoped that the renunciation of the invocation of saints during the homage indicated a change of mind by the Emperor; on July 21, he left Ulm, where he had arrived on July 18, and moved on via Göppingen and Esslingen; the passage of his troops caused great damage to the rural population. Vadian will provide further information. Frecht has not yet heard anything from the Diet in Schmalkalden, except that Philipp [Melanchthon] and Bucer continue to work in Bonn and that envoys were sent to Cologne to protest against a defamatory pamphlet from Cologne; the Protestants continue to make Turkish aid dependent on peace and justice. In Speyer, the visitation of the Imperial Chamber Court is now to take place; may the Reichstag convened for the end of November bring unity! The French troops are retreating to fortified cities; [Landgrave Philipp] is trying to negotiate a truce between the Emperor and [Duke Wilhelm of] Jülich; Pope [Paul III] leans towards the Franco-Turkish alliance but is also said to have provided King [Ferdinand] with troops against the Turks; they have captured Pécs and threaten Esztergom. Frecht has already informed Blarer of what students returning from Wittenberg [about a planned publication by Luther against the Zwinglians] told, and he tries to exert a moderating influence through letters to Hedio and Theobald [Nigri?]; he is pleased to hear that Philipp [Melanchthon] allegedly approves of Bullinger's sacramental doctrine, but urgently asks him to avoid further disputes and to exercise restraint in drafting his commentary on John; [Johannes] Brenz is to prepare homilies on John. Greetings, especially to Pellikan and Rudolf [Gwalther], to whom he has not yet replied. Greetings to the Chief Guild Master; he could not read through the letter again.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, most esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Today, after your people left, I was informed that the Chief Guild Master of Zurich had urged me to write something to you. My wife could only respond in my absence that the man from St. Gallen would soon return here from Nuremberg, with whom I might respond to the letters of Mr. Vadian received on July 29, and that these would also be shared with the people of Zurich. Until now, I have been lazy rather than busy, as they say, trying to kill two birds with one stone, that is, by writing to either the most illustrious Mr. Vadian or the esteemed Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, to also win your favor. Although I should have sent you many personal letters long ago, especially by returning those good things I once received from you in good faith, which are still carefully kept with me, so that as soon as the visitation of our churches is completed, they may return to you in full with thanks. However, the inspection of some of our churches has just begun, but it has been suspended due to the Emperor's arrival and other pressing matters, which I hope will be completed in the countryside after one or two weeks and then started anew in the city. You would not believe, my Bullinger, how after Schwenckfeld, that old man preaching at the noble patron Ludwig von Freyberg, either seduced by that chrestologus or driven mad by some delusion of his own, has begun to pour out things about the Eucharist more grossly than ever before, either written or spoken, which have caused and still cause us no small amount of trouble, until these matters are properly addressed in the visitation. For this very purpose, I still keep what you sent with me, as I have mentioned. Therefore, let this delay not be troublesome to you.</p>
      <p>Eight days ago, I wrote to Mr. Vadian about the Emperor's arrival to us, and I hope he has also informed you of this. In the meantime, he has sent me other letters, from which I could not ascertain whether my previous ones had been delivered to him; for he writes, as the rumor has it, that the Emperor invited me and some fellow ministers to a banquet, which was strange to hear in many ways. Perhaps it spread that I was invited to a conversation with the Archbishop of Compostela, which was misinterpreted as a banquet with the Emperor. I was indeed invited to a conversation with the aforementioned Archbishop of Compostela, and I brought along one or two brothers and friends. In that conversation, the old man calmly asked me about the foundations of our cause and listened to me as I responded to the best of my ability. Present at the discussion were another Spanish bishop, the Emperor's confessor with a colleague, and not a small crowd of Spanish priests. After the Emperor's departure, a good citizen told me that he had heard from Doctor Naves, whom the Emperor uses as a chancellor, that the Emperor was bringing along that crowd of bishops, monks, and priests because the Spaniards wanted to have the most learned among all the Spanish scholars in his entourage, so that in future imperial diets or other negotiations, they might use their services against the Lutherans. If these are the most learned, which I regret, Spain does not have very many learned men.</p>
      <p>For how far they are from solid and holy theology, I would rather have another's mouth than my own testify to that. Like all Spaniards, these archbishops, being the most superstitious, are as far removed from the true goal of piety and more sincere theology as possible. They insist on nothing more than the argument of centuries, the dignity and authority of the Roman Church, that we have rashly introduced novelties in the church, that images have been removed without serious reason, that vows are trampled underfoot, that we assert justification by faith alone in a way that is not very theological, and similar things that the minions of the Antichrist spew against us. I also spoke with some Italian nobles, laymen, who had a sounder mind than those Spanish priests. They greatly praised to me that Mr. Bernardino, whom I hear lives in Geneva with our Calvin, and another Mr. Peter, if I am not mistaken, Martyr, whom they thought was in Basel, although I had previously heard in Strasbourg that he was professing the sacred with great faith. The remaining Spaniards or Italians had nothing more frequently on their lips than that we Lutherans do not have masses, images, and the veneration of saints in our church. The aforementioned Archbishop pathetically twisted that prophecy into our empty temple, showing commiseration and Spanish laments, "like a booth in a vineyard and like a hut in a cucumber field" [Isaiah 1:8], etc. But I cease to trouble you with these things.</p>
      <p>The Emperor showed remarkable clemency towards our people. He allowed the form of homage or oath to be prescribed by our people; the papal clause "so help me all the saints" etc. was omitted. Hence some are upset, as if the Emperor has become Lutheran. I pray to the Lord, in whose hand is the heart of the king, that this clemency is not Spanish, but German, and that it remains steadfast in the Lord and for the Gospel. When the Emperor entered the city on the afternoon of July 18, he departed from here on the morning of July 21 and was received and treated with honor in Göppingen by the Duke of Württemberg. The next day he came to Esslingen, but scarcely stayed there for an hour, having given and received homage, as they call it. Duke Ulrich did not want to enter the city with the Emperor. May the people of Esslingen finally have a more favorable neighbor! On the aforementioned day before the Emperor's departure, an army of nearly 6000, consisting of Spaniards and Italians, passed by the city walls and preceded the Emperor. In these days, nearly 3000 Italians have passed through and caused considerable damage to the peasants with whom they stayed. About 4000 more Italians are expected to pass through here as well. May the Lord deliver us from such troublesome guests who are skilled in τὸ νοσϕίζειν (embezzling).</p>
      <p>I hope Mr. Vadian will write to you about the rest. In these days, our envoys have returned here from the Schmalkalden Diet. But it has not yet been possible to find out what was done there, except that a certain Hessian scribe wrote to me that Mr. Philipp and Bucer are still faithfully working in Bonn to promote the Gospel and have sent envoys from the Schmalkalden League to the dean and chapter of Cologne, as well as to the council and subjects, inquiring amicably why such infamous pamphlets against the doctrine and teachers, and indeed all Protestants, are allowed to be published and spread there.</p>
      <p>I hear, however, that a slanderous and infamous pamphlet was written and published against our people by them. They demand that nothing similar be published in the future; otherwise, they will do what is fitting and what they deserve. The Protestants still persist in their resolve that unless they have firm peace and equal rights, they will send no aid against the Turk.</p>
      <p>I hear that in Speyer, the reformation and visitation of the Imperial Chamber Court is now being celebrated. It is hoped that peace will soon be granted to our people by the Emperor. You know that the imperial diet is to be held in Speyer at the end of November. Oh, if only this diet would finally live up to its name, that is, that we might come together rightly in the Lord!</p>
      <p>The French are retreating and undoubtedly their army will withdraw to the most fortified cities. The indefatigable Cat is trying to establish either a truce or peace between the Emperor and the Duke of Jülich. May the God of peace bring it about that something is undertaken against this sacred triad of Rome, either by the Emperor or the princes of the Empire, namely against the Franco-Turkish and Turco-French and the Pope as a colluder. In Hungary, the Turk is raging. He has occupied Pécs and threatens to soon recapture the fortified town of Gran.</p>
      <p>The Pope is said to have sent several thousand Italians to the king as reinforcements. Thus, the Antichrist limps on both knees. I could not write more now, which I hope you will consider as poured out rather than written.</p>
      <p>I have lovingly informed Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer by letter of what some students returning from Wittenberg recently recounted here, which I received with sorrow. I immediately wrote to Mr. Hedio in Strasbourg, so that he might, with his prudence, take care with Mr. Philipp and Bucer, that the old Entellus does not provoke Dares. I have also enjoined the same to a certain Mr. Theobald, a faithful friend, who will greet Philipp and Bucer in Bonn, and I hope these things were more youthfully poured out by the aforementioned students than truly said, although they poured them out here after Philipp's departure. I suspect that this has already been reported to you. I am glad, if it is true, what some students from Zurich have spread, that Philipp approves of everything you have published about the sacraments. And I earnestly ask you, as I have always done, to maintain and cultivate this as most holy, namely the peace of the churches, and not to provoke Luther. If (God forbid) he should challenge you to the arena, show your well-known modesty and candid prudence to all. We have more than enough of fights and wars. We need syncretism and holy concord. We are vexed from the right and the left; why should our innards rage against each other? As soon as I receive the gospel about this matter, which I hope, I will write either to Mr. Vadian or to you. May the Lord preserve you with His spirit, so that in what you write about John, as well as other things, you temper it in such a way that he cannot interpret anything harshly against himself as having been issued by you. But why do I remind you? Brentius is now meditating on homilies on John as he did on Luke.</p>
      <p>I beg you to diligently commend me to your esteemed colleagues, my elders in the Lord, and to convey all my greetings and reverence, especially to the venerable old man Pellican and Rudolf (to whom I also apologize for not yet having responded to his learned letters). Farewell with your family, whom ours also sincerely wish well.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Ulm, August 2, 1543.</p>
      <p>Greet also that guild master of yours, such a diligent solicitor. I could not reread the hastily written letter.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Frecht from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the exceptionally pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich, to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
