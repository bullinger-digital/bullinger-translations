      <p>S. First, I congratulate you and your daughter Elisabeth very much on the new marriage, and to make the marriage happy and fortunate, I send her this little gift in the name of my goddaughter, whom she herself received, as a witness of our wishes for her happiness. As for other matters, there are many and various things to write about. I thank you for your advice given to the Zurich council regarding the proposal of the council. It has not yet been fully written down; otherwise, I would have sent it through this, but I will send it next time.</p>
      <p>Then, regarding your request to write about Adam Fry and Felkio, what they are doing here, you should know that Felkio, while he was here, changed his lodging four or five times; whether this was due to his own fault or that of the hosts, I do not know; I do know that he wandered around and was a very negligent listener of lectures. You know what kind of person he is otherwise, hence he is a laughingstock to all the students, and I see no hope for him of any position; for even if he were of sound mind and clear brain, his face still entirely resembles that of a fool. However, he left here a month ago, intending to go to Zurich for the civic festival of Felix and Regula; in the meantime, I have not seen him; perhaps he is with you, where I would like him to stay. The other, namely Fry, differs little from the former in terms of studies; however, since he lives on his own means and does not seek anything, he is of less concern. Nevertheless, I cannot speak of anything dishonorable about either of them.</p>
      <p>Two months ago, I lent Fry 2 florins, which he promised to return to me within a month; but he has not yet given anything, saying that he has received nothing from his father in the meantime, although his father met me in Zurich when I was there and promised to send him money soon.</p>
      <p>I wrote extensively about Eberhard's entire story to Frisius, who also requested this from me; you can ask him if you want more details.</p>
      <p>The Lord has inspected and arranged everything and prevented him from falling into worse, and at the same time clearly declared His judgment on him, since on October 4th he died of the plague at St. Urban, peacefully indeed, as I hear, but without any confession of faith.</p>
      <p>We have not yet heard anything from the Baths; I ask that when you have any news, you write quickly.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Longueville, Count of Neuchâtel, died in France, still a boy or adolescent of 16 years, as I hear. There are two heirs. The more prudent fear some disturbances from this, and that the Emperor will also covet the County of Neuchâtel, since it is a fief of the House of Burgundy and the Duke died without children. It is certain that a catalog of all the Lutheran or rather Christian nobles was presented to the King of France; he found there the leading nobles and some of the councilors, up to five hundred, so that he was very frightened and said: "What shall I do? Shall I burn them? I will never do it, especially since their services are so necessary to me at this time."</p>
      <p>I wrote recently about Negelin's son. Now about the son of another consul, namely from Wattenwyl, who was with the Emperor; it is reported that he too, following the imperial camp, was robbed by the French, with many of his companions killed, and that he barely escaped by flight; however, these things are not yet as certain as those about Negelin. Thus, on both sides, the Lord warns them, since our admonitions achieve nothing. Marvelous things are reported about the Emperor's preparations; they deny that he has left Augsburg, as many who come directly from there say, but that Mary came to him in Augsburg from Brabant with fast horses. It is reported that soldiers are being enlisted in Lauffenburg in our vicinity and everywhere in Germany, and that the siege of Magdeburg has been lifted. But you will have more certain information about these things.</p>
      <p>As for our Trahern, he is returning to you; for here he has no opportunity, and many are waiting. I hope that through you it can be arranged that he can settle either in Rhaetia, Glarus, Thurgau, or nearby, or that he can be supported by you for a while, as you gave him hope in your letters to me. The rest, although they have gone to Basel, will return to us; we will support them and ensure that they are provided for. We commend him to you; he is poor and has always been. You would do well if you could obtain for him even a small weekly stipend; he is content with little. Our people gave him two crowns for travel expenses; I had hoped for more; but such was the lot.</p>
      <p>I am sending further copies of Vergerius's work on avoiding the council, which I think will be more disturbed by the present war than by any writings. I am also sending the history of Alexander IV(?). Vergerius sent us a picture and at the same time a certain writing, which he wanted to be printed alongside the picture; but since it did not seem to be of great importance and very plausible, we preferred to append the pure history. Farewell with all the brothers, your wife, children, and household, whom you will greet very much from me and mine. Musculus greets you with his whole household, who also writes to you himself. Bern, October 8, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Ensure that these letters are delivered to our students or to the lord provost.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful antistes of the Zurich church, his lord and venerable compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
