    <p xml:id="regest1">Refers to the matter of Erasmus [Ritter] in the letter report from Mayor [Balthasar] Funk; has himself written to Ritter, and Funk's letter can also be forwarded to him. Bullinger, whose works adorn Schuler's library, should not doubt his friendship; rejoices over Bullinger's recovery. The death of Leo [Jud] is a severe loss for the Zurich church. Bullinger should take care of himself; Schuler eagerly awaits his [Matthew] commentary and welcomes the [included] statement on Schwenckfeld, which he intends to read critically if it comes into his hands. The army in Hungary has celebrated the Lord's Supper and then moved towards Pest. Has sent the letter [from Bullinger] to [Benedikt] Euander. Assurance of his friendship; greetings, also from Friedrich [Wagner] and Bartholomäus Bertlin.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I have advocated for Erasmus's cause together with Funck to the best of my ability. What I have discovered will be indicated word for word in the consul's letter, so there is no need for me to commend it again with the pen. I have written to Erasmus about the essence of the entire matter; you can send him our consul's letter. I grieve for the good man's situation, indeed for ours, whose cause is always odious to the world.</p>
      <p>I have not received any of your letters for more than a year, so do not believe that I am estranged from you, my dear Bullinger, with whom I spend day and night in my library, which your works adorn considerably. I am sorry that you were ill; I am even more glad that you have recovered.</p>
      <p>I do not envy our dearest Leo's passing to the Lord, but rather the Zurich church, which has suffered the greatest loss. May the Lord lead him to the heavenly realms with the reward of his body!</p>
      <p>Moderate your labors, my brother, not for us, who would wish for countless such labors, but for yourself, so that you may be able to benefit many for a longer time (they are better divided than mangled). I have not yet seen your commentary books, nor have they reached us yet; however, I eagerly await them, believe me. That you have specifically responded to the Schwenckfeldian nonsense is very pleasing to me and will be most welcome to many, not to mention extremely necessary. I will read it with the utmost diligence when the Lord places it in my hands, and I will freely inform you if, by any impossibility, I find anything unworthy of a man.</p>
      <p>We have no certain news about the affairs in Hungary, except that our people, seventy thousand strong, have solemnly celebrated the Lord's Supper in the entire camp and then moved towards Pest to engage the enemy; may the Lord grant grace!</p>
      <p>I have sent the letters to Euander, as you requested. Furthermore, my dear Bullinger, do not persuade yourself that your Gervasius has fallen away as an old friend and dearest brother in the Lord; I am the same as before, and I will not change, believe me. Greet your wife and dear children in my name and that of my wife. I am well with my family. Farewell to you and your entire family. Friedrich and Bartholomäus Bertlin send their greetings. May the Lord always be with you.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, October 2, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, much beloved lord and brother in Christ.</p>
