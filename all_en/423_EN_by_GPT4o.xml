      <p>Greetings. I send to you, my dearest father and lord Bullinger, through my sister's son, seven gold coins for the debt of good Hiachi, which I certainly would have sent to you long ago if I had had a faithful and certain messenger. This most severe harshness of the weather has also hindered both me and many others. Therefore, I beseech your kindness not to be angry with me as if I were a man of little faith and truth; I could not, but I hope even today to have fulfilled my promise in time, etc. We are well, and I wish the same for you. As for what is happening with us, I have nothing else to report except that we have labored thus far in great snows and almost Scythian cold. Pindus and Hemus are frozen.</p>
      <p>We await from you news of what has been done with you, who dwell in the Thessalian gardens, clothed in a milder sky and removed from such horrors of snow and icy conditions.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Hastily from Schwanden, February 3, 1549. We desire your holy family to be well in the Lord, along with all the pious and holy brothers. Fonteius, Paulus Schola, and D. Valentinus Tschudi Beldius, etc., greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours, Lorenz Meyer (Agricola).</p>
