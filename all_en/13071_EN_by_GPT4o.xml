    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Viret was asked by the Geneva councilor [Claude] Roset for a recommendation for his son [Michel], who is coming to Zurich for education and will be staying with the treasurer [Jakob Werdm√ºller]. Viret cannot refuse this request because he has been friends with Roset for a long time and because the church, his homeland, studies, and piety are close to his heart. He can promote these by supporting boys who, due to their education, will one day be helpful to the church and the fatherland. The young [Michel] gives hope for the best. It would be desirable for young people like him to make progress and not disappoint the expectations placed in them, especially since there is a danger that Viret's homeland will fall back into the old barbarism from which it has just freed itself. For in this region, the linguistic disciplines are greatly despised.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The churches and schools of his homeland have neither pastors nor teachers and would perish if God did not bring them learned, God-fearing men from abroad, especially from France, for church and school service. The fact that so many scholars flock there every day is due to the persecutions that have plagued all of France since the beginning of the spread of the evangelical doctrine (hopefully better times and different circumstances will come!). As long as it is possible, one should take advantage of the opportunity to promote studies.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] One must take care of the sciences, teaching, and education of young people, for they are the bearers of hope and will one day take the helm of the church when the current generation is called home by the Lord. Thanks be to God that the esteemed Bernese council does not disdain studies but takes care of them! Accordingly, Viret hopes for much good for the school in Lausanne, which is already provided with excellent scholars, to whom more are added daily. What has begun under such good auspices may continue to thrive with God's help! Bullinger should contribute by using his influence and reputation to endear the Bernese to the school of Lausanne. Would that the efforts of all good men lead to finally settling the communion disputes, which are so harmful to the church and studies, not only in Bern but also in the Bernese countryside and in the territory occupied by them! Bullinger and his like-minded people should contribute to concord as much as possible so that the whole church does not perish. This is Viret's request.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger should particularly recommend the young [Michel] to the teachers responsible for his education and training, so that Claude Roset (at whose request this letter is written) can see how effective Viret's recommendation is with Bullinger!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Everyone sends their regards. Also, the colleagues and especially Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and Konrad Gessner are greeted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [Farel's handwritten postscript:] Farel wishes Bullinger and his colleagues all the best. May the churches entrusted to them make good progress in the Lord!</p>

      <p>S. Roset, a senator of Geneva, asked me to recommend his son, whom he has placed there with your treasurer to receive an education, to you. I could not deny this request to a man who is a very dear friend to us for many reasons. For besides the rights of old friendship, which bind my services to him, there is also my love for the church and homeland, studies, and piety, whose welfare I do not doubt I am promoting when I take care of those who will be able to greatly assist both with their studies someday. Therefore, since this boy, on whose behalf I am now writing to you, seems to me to be of the best hope, I strongly desire that he and those like him make such progress in their studies that they do not disappoint our expectations, and all the more so because we are justly anxious lest my homeland relapse into that barbarism from which it has scarcely emerged. For there is a great contempt for letters everywhere.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Unless the Lord were to send us learned and pious men from foreign nations, especially from the French, to be placed over the churches and schools, almost all studies would be abandoned and perish for the pastors and leaders of the churches. Moreover, the daily influx of so many honorable and learned men here is due to the persecutions that have shaken all of France since the beginning of the public proclamation of the evangelical doctrine. But better times are to be hoped for, which will bring other changes in circumstances. Therefore, as long as it is possible, we must take care not to misuse this great opportunity for studies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Since our entire hope rests on those to whom we will leave the governance of the churches when the Lord calls us from here, we must diligently ensure and strive that the studies and education of the youth are well provided for. In this matter, we must rightly give thanks to the Lord, who has given such a spirit to the illustrious Bernese council that they do not disdain the study of letters, but take care that they are duly regarded. As a result, I hope for no small fruit from the school in Lausanne, which is now adorned with many honorable and learned men, to whom a greater number is added daily. May the Lord grant that what has been begun under such auspicious beginnings may continue and be completed with even happier outcomes. In this matter, we implore your help: that is, that you commend it to the Bernese by whatever means you can, with the authority and favor you have with them. And would that it could be achieved by the efforts of all good men that those deadly disputes over the Eucharist, which we feel today are most harmful to the church and studies, not only in the Bernese church but in their entire region and this province, could finally be resolved. Therefore, I beseech and implore you and those like you to diligently do whatever you can to contribute to concord, lest the whole church perish for us in the end. These are the things, most learned Bullinger, that I had to write to you now.</p>

      <p>As for the boy, on whose account I have written to you, I ask only this from you: that you recommend him to the schoolmasters to whose discipline he has been entrusted, and ensure that the good man, at whose request I write to you on this matter, understands that our recommendation has had some weight with you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>All of ours send their greetings to you. I wish the greatest health to your venerable colleagues and fellow ministers, especially to Mr. Pellikan, Mr. Theodor, and Mr. Gwalther, and Dr. Gesner.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 28th of September, 1547.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Viret.</p>

      <p>I also ask the same from you, desiring that you and the others are as well as possible and that the churches entrusted to you may prosper happily in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your Farel.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, my most esteemed brother and fellow minister. In Zurich.</p>
