      <p>I wrote to you through Herter three days ago.</p>
      <p>Now I am sending what I received yesterday during dinner; for by chance I met a good man, a fellow citizen of ours, who, I know, will deliver everything to you in good faith. Hoser sent me two copies of his booklet, which you receive here, so I am sending one to you. But if in the letters addressed to you, another matter of a different argument is perhaps suggested, please make sure to share it with me. Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother. January 3, 1561.</p>

      <p>Hoser writes absolutely nothing new, except what he usually does about those ubiquitous ones, etc.</p>
