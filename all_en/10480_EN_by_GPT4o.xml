    <p xml:id="regest1">Regarding the gift of a bath to Mayor Röist, Vadian sent a messenger to Jörg von Hewen, and he sent one to Duke Ulrich of Württemberg in Urach. The Duke replied that he would not forget the letter. Jörg von Hewen would have liked to send something to Röist, but he had no luck while hunting. Vogler told Peter Weber what he could expect from Röist in the Zürichberg matter. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of God be with us all. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dear lord and brother, regarding the matter of the gift for Mayor Röist, my lord Doctor Vadian has handled it faithfully, namely by giving 1 gulden to a citizen who would immediately ride to Jörg von Hewen, which he has given on behalf of him, me, and you. The messenger has reached von Hewen. He quickly sent his own messenger to the Duke. The Duke was found in Urach and was to return to Stuttgart on Friday. The Duke replied that he would not forget the letter. The messenger believes something might come to Zurich, and if it passes through Schaffhausen as game, it would be well out of the way. I do not know if anything has come to Zurich. Von Hewen, the messenger says, also hunted for two days; he would have liked to send something to Röist, but on those days he caught no game, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have informed and instructed Peter Weber regarding the Zürichberg matter, what he might find from my lord Röist, or any other hope. For I hoped Peter Weber would soon, as I was, if it were his duty.</p>
      <p>Greetings to your dear wife, children, father in Zürichberg, etc.</p>
      <p>Done in St. Gallen, Sunday before Michaelmas in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and benefactor M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
