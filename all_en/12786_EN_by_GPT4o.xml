      <p>Greetings. In great haste. The situation is good. Be brave and courageous! God will not abandon us! In eight days, a general assembly will take place in Baden. In the meantime, my lords are negotiating with the three cantons separately. When Master Georg returns, we will see what further actions to take. Praise be to God! Everyone is determined. However, we should only look to God, not to man, and submit ourselves to the cross, whether we are victorious or defeated. Let us pray to God faithfully and earnestly! God be with you and all of yours.</p>

      <p>In Bern, things are going very well. They want to end the dispute over the sacrament. They have been in agreement with us from the beginning. They are once again looking to disputation. Those who oppose it are sent out of the country. God be eternally with us!</p>
