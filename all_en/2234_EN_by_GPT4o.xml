      <p>My friendly and entirely willing service beforehand, worthy, highly learned, especially gracious lord and friend. A few days ago, I received two letters from you; one I found on the 23rd of November last, when I had been away on a journey on behalf of my lords of the honorable council here and had returned home, in my house; the other was handed to me by Mr. Froschauer at this fair.</p>
      <p>The reason I did not respond to you at first is no other than that shortly after the aforementioned journey, I had to undertake another one, which took me several weeks, and otherwise, in these unfortunate and troublesome times, I am so burdened with such affairs by my lords in truth, that I cannot always have the time to do what I would like, but must attend to the present and urgent matters. Since no letter has come to me from Mr. Baptista Ioanne Wysmaro, which I should have forwarded to you according to your request, I have refrained from writing to you amidst my many other occupations. Therefore, I ask you to kindly excuse this fault. As you then, in the aforementioned two letters, requested the commendation of Mr. Doctor Wolfgang Waydner, my acquaintance and friendship, although I am not the man, as the mentioned Mr. Doctor might have indicated to you, and if his acquaintance should be so important to you, I nevertheless thank you with all diligence for such friendly inclination that you have towards me, and I want to gladly have and recognize you as my gracious lord and friend, and also, according to my ability, show you all friendly and willing service in return and offer you the same hereby, with a friendly request to also accept and hold me as your friend in return, and to expect nothing else from me than all friendship and willing service.</p>
      <p>As much as concerns the aforementioned Mr. Doctor Waydner, the good, pious, old man is now so burdened with age and bodily weakness that I fear he cannot live much longer, although he wrote me a long letter at this fair regarding his affairs and intentions (of which you, I presume, are also well aware) and therein requested that I should not be burdened to undertake the effort he has resolved to impose on me in his last will as a testamentary. For after he, through the granting of the Almighty...</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the Holy Scriptures and preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich, my gracious, dear lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
