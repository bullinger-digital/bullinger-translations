    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to their letter, he had the two [scholars Abraham and Beat Steinegger] questioned and inquired about their behavior from Johannes Fries; although they still display a certain laziness and negligence, it would not be appropriate to exclude them from their studies, especially since they have promised improvement; however, he cannot imagine that the two will develop into outstanding scholars, but considers them capable of pastoral duties in the countryside; suggests keeping them in Zurich until the next examination around Easter.</p>

      <p>Pious, steadfast, honorable, prudent and wise, gracious, dear gentlemen, my willing service, friendly greetings and all good things be prepared for you. Regarding your letter about the two boys you have placed with M. Johannes Fries, I have faithfully presented it to my dear lords and brothers, who, out of love and honor for you, as they are willing to serve you in much greater matters, have immediately summoned the two boys and diligently questioned them about everything, and also inquired from M. Johannes Fries about their situation. We have found that they still exhibit some of their previously brought laziness and negligence, as you have also complained in your letter, and are not very eager or attentive in nature. However, they have shown themselves in their studies in such a way with their answers that we could not completely dismiss them, especially since they have recognized their lack of diligence and have seriously promised visible improvement, with a clear, open indication that they are entirely willing to remain in their studies. Therefore, we say in truth that we cannot imagine that they will become outstanding scholars, but nevertheless pious and decent ones who could manage a parish in the countryside. Therefore, it seemed good to us if you would leave them with us until the upcoming Easter, when they will be examined again 14 days before or after. If they then show no or little diligence, we will inform you thoroughly and further. However, we do not wish to prescribe anything to you in this matter, but rather to show our well-meaning opinion. We hereby ask that you understand this as our good intention; for if we could show you willing and agreeable service, we would be willing. May God protect you.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, January 23, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom's ever willing</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the pious, prudent, honorable and wise gentlemen mayor and council of the city of Biel, his gracious, dear lords.</p>
