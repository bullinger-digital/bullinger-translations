      <p>Greetings. Although I have not yet received any definite news from my son-in-law about the affairs in Lausanne, yesterday at dinner I learned from Mr. Steiger that the plague has already struck in Rotulus, where he governs, and has even spread to Lausanne. Therefore, I am still keeping Felix with me until I know something more certain from there or you decide otherwise. In the meantime, I ensure that he is diligent in public lectures and does not waste his time at home. I also learned from the same source and from Gravenriet that peace has been completely established in France; they affirm that this is being reported from all sides. However, the conditions are still unknown, except that they say the admiral has been restored to all his offices and dignities, and for the domains he holds in the Duchy of Burgundy, La Rochelle with the adjoining province has been given to him, so that he is now made twice or thrice as wealthy as he was before. In other matters, the king does not want everyone to know what he has promised or granted; time and the practice of things will reveal it. The king's marriage is said to be the main reason for the peace being accepted. Although I rejoice over these things, I still believe nothing until I see our Frenchmen departing in troops; I pray to the Lord that this happens soon.</p>
      <p>It is also reported that in Lower Germany, due to the king's new marriage, an amnesty has been granted to all who have sinned against the king until now, and that the queen is to be received there most splendidly. I have nothing else to add, except that those from whom I have this information send you many greetings; this includes my father-in-law, my wife, and Ludwig Zehender the elder, who has recently been made prefect of Interlaken, our great friend and relative.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 11, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
