      <p>When I was in London, I reproached my fellow countrymen who had been in Zurich for being forgetful of you and never writing to you: some were ashamed, others even regretted their deep silence.</p>
      <p>But I hope they have now written and will write more diligently in the future.</p>
      <p>Foxe has written a huge volume about the English martyrs, and it is in English: it was published four days before Easter.</p>
      <p>Even the papists are now beginning to detest the cruelty of the arch-papists.</p>
      <p>Six or seven were condemned around the beginning of Lent, charged with treason; but the queen's clemency still allows them to live in the Tower of London.</p>
      <p>Two of them were called Pole, namely relatives of Cardinal Pole.</p>
      <p>The Earl of Huntly, one of the chief nobles of Scotland and a notable papist, incited by the counsel of Guise, was planning to shed the blood of the pious in Scotland, as Guise did in France, and there was a great conspiracy of many seditious people; and undoubtedly the same tumult and indeed bloodshed would have occurred in Scotland as in France, had their attempts not been discovered in time by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>Some were killed in battle, among whom was one of Huntly's sons, another son was beheaded along with some others.</p>
      <p>Huntly himself was being led to prison; but on the way, he fell backward from his horse and died with a broken neck.</p>
      <p>It is uncertain whether this happened by accident or on purpose.</p>
      <p>I wrote to you about the cross, candles, and candlesticks taken from the queen's chapel; but shortly after, they were brought back, to the great sorrow of the pious.</p>
      <p>The candles, which were previously lit daily, are now not at all. Tepidity in some greatly hinders the course of the gospel.</p>
      <p>From the heart, I wish well to all the people of Zurich, whom you should greet in my name, and especially your excellent wife, sons, daughters, etc.</p>
      <p>Mine are all yours.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>In Ludham, April 26, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
