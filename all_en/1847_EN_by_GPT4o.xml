      <p>That you are surprised by the long silence, most illustrious man, I do not wonder at all, as I rarely miss an opportunity to write, if I can in any way. However, the reason you have not received any letters from me for a month is nothing other than poor health; it can hardly be said how much I have been troubled by the harshness of such a dreadful winter. I have suffered mainly from some unknown foot ailment contracted almost fifteen years ago from a dangerous journey, which has resulted in me rarely leaving my nest, from which I do not yet depart unless compelled by the greatest necessity.</p>
      <p>We have no news that is hidden from you. However, I hear that Margrave Albrecht has assembled a great army against the Bishop of Würzburg, who is said to have some sort of alliance with the neighboring Bishop of Bamberg and the Nurembergers. I am sending you a letter from the King of France to the state of the Roman Empire, printed here in recent days. I would have added a certain imperial speech to the German princes against the French, if I could have obtained it; for we received only one copy through Heinrich Petri from the Frankfurt fair. Functius' Chronographia has been reprinted, which he wrote from the founding of the world to our times and wanted to have printed in Prussia, at the end of which he promises a history of the life and death of Osiander written against his rivals, who have spread various lies about his death. I have not seen the rest, which will soon be shared with buyers by our booksellers. I wanted to write these things at present, so that the messenger would not return to you empty-handed. Farewell most happily with your wife and entire family. April 15, 1553.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
