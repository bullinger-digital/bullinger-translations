      <p>S. P. I have received your letters, and it is unbelievable how much pleasure I derived from reading them; therefore, continue, my Bullinger, and consider that you hold the place with me that you would most desire with a friend. I am sending this back to Mr. Vergerius and sending him money according to his requests through the same person; however, I do not know if it is safe, for I do not know the man nor his condition. But listen: you would not believe how pleasant it was for me to read your last letters; for you not only agree with me, but with all the states of Germany, for in short, the Emperor uses Margrave Albrecht like Catiline to destroy and completely overthrow Germany under the pretext of war against the bishops. You know the art: the Margrave will live off ecclesiastical goods and without the Emperor's money will gather soldiers, whom he will support for some time, until, having joined forces with the Emperor, he can compel other princes and bring them back to the former yoke. The Margrave wrote letters a few days ago to the Bishop of Arras, which were intercepted by our people near Luxembourg and a copy was sent to me translated into French, from which copy I extracted an article and ordered it to be made into German again, so that you could understand it. I am sending this and make sure to read it carefully; for unless I am mistaken, it is in the interest of the republic that all states know and see the nefarious conspiracy.</p>
      <p>All other things are joyful in France, and I foresee that the Emperor wants to start a war on our and your borders towards Burgundy and Savoy. Therefore, all good men must be especially vigilant and defend the union against such a fierce beast.</p>
      <p>Write, I beg you, about that Swabian league, if you hear anything, which I do not believe will happen, as you yourself do. For if ever, now the princes must learn from their own peril. Farewell excellently and love me.</p>
      <p>Given on the 10th of April, hastily.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassefontaneus.</p>
      <p>What was written to you about Hedin is false; for our men, who saw on the 12th day that it could not be defended, surrendered to the Emperor's forces without any loss; for they returned safely except for three captives, and seeing that the castle was poorly fortified, the Emperor himself left it.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
