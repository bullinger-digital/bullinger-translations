      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received the two sermons and treatises that you have had printed, as well as Walther's on the 12th of this month, but we had already been provided with your previous sermons; we read them during our stay at the baths and were very pleased with them, and they were very timely for this bath visit. We liked them so much that we intend to send them to the high-born prince, our friendly dear cousin Duke Christoph of Württemberg, etc., although we know that he is heavily burdened with many affairs and readings.</p>
      <p>Regarding recent news, you will undoubtedly already know what has been actively negotiated between France and the Netherlands. Both camps, the imperial around Landau and the margravial on the frontier of the land of Luxembourg, are positioned such that one expects every day that it will lead to active engagement. The priests of Mainz, Würzburg, and Bamberg are quite restless due to the dispatch of their money; may God give them their deserved reward and that it may come out of their own skin, etc. We want to inform Mayor Lavater and Haben of our gracious greetings with the gracious request that they now, with the good weather, set aside a small barrel of sweet must, so that when we come, as we would like to do if our business allows it, we may try it. We did not want to withhold this from you in response to your gracious letter. Dated Göppingen, the 15th of October, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Our gracious request is that you ensure this letter reaches your beloved brother Ambrosius Blaurer, as we do not know where he is now, so that it may come into his safe hands; for we have not written to him for a long time despite his humble request.</p>
      <p>As for the abolition of the mass here in the principality of Württemberg, we do not want to hide our gracious and good opinion from you, as follows: About two or now in the third month, upon some writing and request of our friendly dear cousin Duke Christoph, we were present at their appearance.</p>
      <p>There, a conversation was held with us about the papal mass, with long and many discussions. We said it would be good if it were completely abolished.</p>
      <p>This was delayed for several days before we both traveled to the Palatinate to the elector. But as it seemed to us that it would take too long and many worries and sophistries would arise, the emperor was in strong armor and sent large... (his dear self) danger thereupon, one could still delay with it (we asked) when it came to us and let all the world's clever talk fall, whether our friendly dear cousin was healthy with the confession they publicly submitted at Trent: It was said by Your Grace: yes. Thereupon we said: So you should also restore the same with action; for one should always look more to God's honor than to the whole world. Thus, to this day, the mass has been abolished in all offices throughout the principality. May God grant that it brings much fruit and may improve the entire landscape. We are hopeful that it will also be abolished in Montbéliard. We have now bathed in the sour springs for six weeks; the Urdorff bath has treated us so badly that we would have given 1000 crowns to have never seen it. So far, we have not had a single healthy day, the salt flies have increased greatly, but now we have had another bath visit (thanks be to the Lord), than we had before, with piping, singing, dancing, playing, and the like, none of which we had or saw, but a young noble boy in the chamber with us; he read to us every day the four Gospels and St. Paul's epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, and also read them to us, and truly the time (praise, honor, and thanks be to the dear God) seemed shorter and easier to us than with the aforementioned jester's tricks. It also happened in the meantime that our aforementioned cousin sought the emperor in passing through this land, who had done great damage with the war people, for the sake of 50,000 guilders, on our behalf for pardon. They let it be known and promised that we should be reconciled in all things, also in all status and dignity as before, nothing excepted, and that we may not in any way be forced to accept or promise anything, and as much more (praise be to the gracious God forever), that we may not accept a single thing that holds to the Interim or the lazy priests, but entirely free (if God wills) see, visit, and find our poor long-abandoned people again with peace, with recognition of the truth, as we left them. So good and gracious is the kind God to us and our poor people; to Him be praise, honor, and glory forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dear Bullinger, help us give God and your beloved brother great thanks for His wonderful grace and goodness. May the Lord be with you and all of us. Amen. Do not let the beginning of our current writing go far, destroy it after reading, we rely on you.</p>
      <p>To our dear special Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, in hand.</p>
