      <p>Greetings. Today is the eighth day, most kind Mr. Bullinger, since I received various writings from you, at the same time promising that I would complete and return them within eight days, which I now fulfill. In the meantime, not only I, but other colleagues also give and hold very great thanks, because you did not deny sharing them with us, and that for many reasons, especially because it could easily happen that their use would be very necessary for us, and there is nothing at all to fear here about them being disclosed either with your or our danger. If anything further is written to you, most learned Mr. Bullinger, even if it is more lengthy, please send it to us; you will always receive it back in good faith and shortly. If our Simpertus survives and adverse health does not hinder, he will come to you this spring, to see how and in what manner the brothers live. Regarding the colloquy to be held with the Lutherans, we can hope for nothing good, unless they retract those things to which they have subscribed with their own hands. But what if the ministers of the Swiss churches were convened and among them a colloquy was instituted about matters of religion? If they were mutually concordant among themselves (although there is a danger that those from Basel and Biel will not agree with us, and many from Bern as well), and the Lutherans heard this, perhaps better things could be hoped for at some point; for it greatly hinders that even the Swiss churches are heard to be less agreeable among themselves. However, we trust that you will neglect nothing in this cause.</p>
      <p>Please, my Mr. Bullinger, convey these things to Mr. Lavater.</p>
      <p>Altorfer has already for some time, indeed almost every day, planned a journey to you, hence it happened that he wrote nothing to Mr. Lavater.</p>
      <p>Then, since he had several writings of Mr. Oecolampadius in Basel, he went there for those and other reasons; there he found and received some other things, which, as soon as they have been brought from Basel, he will come to you with everything compiled. We have no news of new matters.</p>
      <p>A certain merchant from Schaffhausen returning from Strasbourg reports that Bolweiler has not yet completed his military service, but the payment is perhaps delayed for this and another month, then the soldiers will receive their money, so that he may have soldiers ready and more prepared again immediately. Then the Bernese are diligently preparing everything that pertains to the military, and daily.</p>
      <p>What will happen, the Lord knows, who preserves His word and His church. Farewell.</p>
      <p>All the colleagues greet you with all yours, whom you will also greet in our name. I wrote this hastily, as by chance I conveniently found a messenger before I had completed everything. Schaffhausen, January 20, 1558.</p>
      <p>Jakob Rüeger, most devoted to your kindness. To the Reverend, most excellent in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, much esteemed brother in Christ, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich. Zürich.</p>
