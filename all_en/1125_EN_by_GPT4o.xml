      <p>Worthy and highly learned, kind and highly trusted, dear sir. I wish you from God the Almighty once again a happy, good new year with friendly thanks for your recent news, which I found very displeasing, as the poor oppressed imperial estates are so very much under pressure. But I am confidently hopeful that it will all be of no help, because the matter is certainly His own cause. For I must not withhold from you the true news that two days ago a person was with me, who has just come from the camp, with the report that Herr Hans von Heideck and Count Vollrat von Mansfeld on the first of December had 5000 good selected landsknechts and 3500 horses together and in their arrangement, having completely taken the dioceses of Bremen and Verden up to the single house of Rottenberg, which is besieged and hopefully due to lack of wood may not hold out for many days. They have imposed a war tax on the land before Hedel and all surrounding enemy lands have had to let themselves be plundered and taxed.</p>
      <p>Duke Erich of Brunswick has raised some enemy territories against them; but when they saw their barns burning, the peasants ran home and no one wanted to stay any longer. The intention is to march without delay to Magdeburg and relieve it. This man says for sure that they may be 15000 strong by now until Christmas. The Almighty grant His grace and share with us poor oppressed His divine help and mercy. It is said that they are to receive 80000 thalers as a remainder. In my opinion, if they succeed in a strike, or as your news reports, if Duke Moritz has withdrawn from the city, they will neither lack money nor people, as I know the situation, and I know well that the lords of Brunswick, Duke Moritz, and the diocese of Magdeburg are crying out for help.</p>
      <p>Duke Erich himself has ridden post to Augsburg. This will be made known without delay elsewhere; I am sure it will be agreeable. All those who would certainly be attacked if this people were not to stand should act right now.</p>
      <p>It is said that 30 pieces of artillery have been transported from Milan via Alexandria and some from Brabant to Luxembourg and Diedenhofen, in my opinion for no other reason than to deceive the world. Your worthiness knows well that the upper Swiss Confederates have again opposed me in 8 places and the people of Basel have denied me their city. This comes to me just as well and to great honor in body, honor, and goods, and is called promoting God's cause and lovers of the same. But I am undaunted, relying on God; He will soon send me my calling and give such people recognition. May He grant us all His goodness. Amen. Dated Basel, December 30, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your worthy willing servant Sebastian Schertlin, knight, subscribes.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned Herr Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Minster in Zurich, etc., my kind lord, to hand.</p>
