      <p>May the grace of Christ be with you. Your letter was delivered on August 7th, when I had just gotten out of bed for the first time the day before, having lain there for a month and a half, gravely ill, to the point that the prince himself and two physicians thought my life was over. For the illness had made a mockery of all human efforts. Lady von Rappoltstein visited me twice and applied many remedies with her own efforts, but in vain.</p>
      <p>Finally, that gracious God looked upon me with His usual mercy and unexpectedly relieved the illness that had tormented me so harshly with His grace; I am now breathing somewhat easier, etc. May the Lord's will be done.</p>
      <p>My whole body was so inflamed that the doctors despaired of being able to extinguish the fire; I was burning all over, etc. The other brothers are well and today those who live nearby visited me and send you friendly greetings. You did well to call Martyr from Strasbourg; they were unworthy of such a man, nor could that arrogant Marckbachius, who acts imperiously there, have tolerated him any longer. Our prince left Montbéliard a month ago and came here with his pregnant wife for recreation, intending to return to the Montbéliard nest after a few days so that his wife could give birth there. But the woman miscalculated, thinking she still had a month left before giving birth, and while they were in Strasbourg, she was suddenly seized by labor pains and happily delivered a very handsome prince named Ulrich, who was baptized last week. For this celebration, the prince invited all the preachers and all the nobles of the dominion, the neighbors from Colmar, and the nearby nobility; the godfathers were Lord Philipp von Hanau and Count von Erbach, a very learned man in all disciplines, and the prefect of the imperial cities in Alsace; - he resides in Haguenau, - the godmother was the widow of Lord von Heideck, daughter of Lady von Rappoltstein, and she was, as they say, celebrated by all.</p>
      <p>I wished the prince well through Doctor Alexander the physician, instructing him to say these words: "I wish Your Grace luck and health for the young one and pray to God that he becomes more pious than his father and all the Württembergers." But he is said to have smiled, nevertheless thanked me, and wished the same. I will briefly explain why Molinaeus was imprisoned by the prince for some time.</p>
      <p>The prince is in dispute with the Prince of Burgundy or Ferdinand over the possession and dominion of a certain region not far from Montbéliard, which was once taken by force, and these matters are being handled in Dole.</p>
      <p>The prince used Molinaeus' counsel in this matter; but he, perhaps corrupted by money, revealed all the consultations to the judges in Dole. For his notes and autographs were intercepted. Therefore, on the advice of Duke Christoph, he was thrown into prison, yet after a few days, he was released and received back into favor, having sworn an oath of peace. His wife came to him from France with the children, and they were kindly received. Finally, when it was least expected, they all escaped in flight. Where in the world they are hiding is unknown. Certainly, he greatly inconvenienced the prince in the lawsuit, etc. These things briefly to you with a trembling hand. When I am better, I will write more.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for me, most esteemed brother in Christ, with your brothers. Greet Gualter, Bibliander, and the others, etc.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, August 7, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Erb, the sick one, under the rod of the gracious God. I could not write better.</p>
      <p>We will ensure that the letters to your son are delivered securely and certainly.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, especially in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the renowned city of the Swiss, Zürich, and theologian, his esteemed lord, etc.</p>
