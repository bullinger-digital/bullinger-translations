    <p xml:id="regest1">In terms of generosity and kindness, Blarer cannot compete with Bullinger; however, he does his best. - From recently received letters, Blarer gathers that all copies of Bullinger's ["True Confession"] [transmitted by him] have been well received; the Augsburg city clerk Georg Frölich considers it an honor to have been presented with a writing and a letter. - [Wolfgang] Musculus recently returned to [Augsburg]; he is very troubled that the people of Donauwörth senselessly want to introduce the Nuremberg [church order]. - The rumors about [Johannes Marbach] in Isny are unfounded; he is as good-natured and modest as one would not expect from a Wittenberger, which Blarer learned from [unreceived] letters from councilors and citizens. Blarer read to a guild master [...] from Isny from Bullinger's [unreceived appendix to] letter [No. 2123 or No. 2124], whereupon this person (who would never tolerate attacks against Bullinger or Blarer) became indignant about such lies and insisted that [Marbach] had never mentioned Zwingli, Zurich, or Sacramentarians from the pulpit. Nevertheless, Blarer was repeatedly informed by various people [...] that [Marbach] wanted to create a new papacy and was against the [Zwinglian church]; however, during his visit [to Isny on church matters] the previous year, he experienced Marbach as a peaceful person. Marbach's zealous but unwise deacon [Georg Denneler] seems to be fabricating this bad reputation for him; when Blarer travels to Isny soon, he will admonish the deacon not to spread such rumors and will then report to Bullinger. - [Konrad] Zwick thanks for the information about [Augustin Mellis, known as] Fries and sends greetings. Greetings also from the Englishman [John] Butler. - [Jakob] Metzler praises Bullinger's kindness in a letter to his father [Bartholomäus Metzler]. [Jakob Metzler] is not bad, but he needs discipline. - Blarer is surprised that the Baselers have dismissed Johannes [Gast]; he does not know him personally, but has heard that he is a pious and learned man, so his fate saddens him. God will take care of him, and Blarer will also look for a suitable position for him. - Bullinger wanted Blarer's opinion on the [Zurich] response ["True Confession"] to Luther's ["Short Confession"]. He knows that Blarer has always supported the [Zurichers] and their zeal for Christianity, so much so that he is even suspected of being an enthusiast and Sacramentarian. He hopes for divine assistance. - Greetings, also from [Thomas Blarer] and [Konrad] Zwick. - [P.S.:] Heinrich von Ulm told him the day before about the meeting with Bullinger and his restraint; since Bullinger did not want to further engage with the matter [Zwick's "Art of War"], Blarer would have tolerated von Ulm discussing it with others. However, he did not dare to do so without consulting Blarer. Blarer considers it important that the [Art of War] goes to the Confederation and is not used against it. - On Saturday, he travels to Isny.</p>

      <p>S. Indeed, there is no reason, my dear Bullinger, for me to argue with you about who surpasses the other in generosity and any act of friendship, since the matter itself teaches more clearly than light how you surpass me here in countless ways. However, when it comes to assessing the spirit of one towards the other, believe me, mine will in no way yield to yours. Therefore, I have this one wish above all, that I may have the opportunity to demonstrate this in reality through some convenient occasion.</p>
      <p>I received letters a few days ago, informing me that all your booklets have been delivered to those to whom they were addressed. Georg Frölich, the Augsburg city clerk, considers it a great honor that you have deemed him worthy of a booklet and a letter.</p>
      <p>Musculus recently returned to his people. He is very troubled that the people of Donauwörth want to build upon such a solid foundation, Christ, with the straw and hay of the coldest ceremonies, like those used in Nuremberg. May the Lord have mercy on them and on us, so that, having rejected these most trivial trifles, we may eagerly embrace and firmly hold onto the very truth.</p>
      <p>Regarding the doctor from Isny, know that the reports brought to you are as false as Christ is not false. He is a man of a naturally calm and very modest disposition, so much so that you would hardly believe him to be from Wittenberg: he is so averse to the common Wittenbergers' habit of slandering and speaking ill. I write the truth, my venerable brother, and what I have learned from the letters of the best senators and citizens there. And the guild master from Isny, a very good man, came to me the day after I received your letter; when I read to him what you had written, he was very upset by the intemperance of those busybodies who, driven by a passion for lying, spit out anything against anyone. "You will not find," he says, "any honest man in Isny who has ever mentioned Zwingli, Zurich, or Sacramentarians, or anything like that, from the pulpit with a single word. I am willing," he says, "to stake my head on it; for I miss no sermon." Moreover, this senator is such a man that he would not tolerate even the slightest slander against you or me. And yet, I have been informed more than once and not by one person alone that he is accused of wanting to create a new papacy and condemning ours. However, last year, when I dealt with the man in person, I found him to be sincere and very peace-loving. He has a deacon who is said to be zealous for God, but very imprudent; and he, if I am not mistaken, is the one who spreads such rumors about the good man among many. But since I am soon to travel to Isny for another reason, I will take care, as diligently as I can, to ensure that the deacon controls himself and does not burden the good man with such odious matters. Upon my return, I will write to you in detail about everything. Pray to the Lord that what I piously attempt, I may accomplish successfully.</p>
      <p>For what you wrote about your Fries, cousin Zwick sends you many thanks and wishes you all the best in the Lord, as does our Englishman Butler.</p>
      <p>Metzler, in his letters to his father, praises your kindness and most favorable disposition towards him beyond measure, so that for this reason too, you have greatly bound us to you. The young man is not bad, but he still needs discipline; see to it, I beg you, that he does not lack it. For such natures, if left to themselves, easily become insolent.</p>
      <p>We are very surprised that the people of Basel have dismissed the excellent man Johannes Gast, although he is not even known to me by face. Nevertheless, I hear that he is a pious and not ordinarily learned man, so I deeply regret his situation. The Lord will provide for him (I have no doubt) a more worthy ministry; where I too will gladly and faithfully keep watch, should any opportunity arise where he can serve the Lord.</p>
      <p>You wish to know what I think of your response to Martin Luther's slanders and insults, as if my judgment here mattered. You know, my brother, how candidly I have always thought and spoken of you and how strongly I have approved of your zeal for helping the Christian commonwealth, so much so that I am even called an enthusiast and Sacramentarian by many because I seem more devoted to you. May the Lord preserve and daily increase His gifts in you, so that through your ministry the boundaries of His kingdom may be greatly extended. We earnestly beg you to intercede for us as well, as we will need the most present and sober counsel in these turbulent times.</p>
      <p>May your whole household be well. My brother and cousin Zwick send you many greetings. Commend us to your fellow ministers in the Lord. Farewell, my very dear and excellent Bullinger. April 13, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Am. Bl. My dear brother-in-law Heinrich von Ulm was with me yesterday morning with a report of what he discussed with you and you with him. He was very upset that you are so reserved and silent; for you never wanted to speak out, as they say, until you saw the right opportunity. I would have liked it if he had spoken confidentially with some about the matter, since you did not want to burden yourself further with it, in which you did not do wrong. For since my cousin previously tolerated that you spoke with some trusted people about the matter, I think this should not have been different if it had happened through my brother-in-law. But he is so careful, also cautious and honest, that he did not want to act further than I allowed him; in which he is rightly to be praised. I think he might soon return to you for other reasons. Then he will know how to proceed further in this matter. I truly consider it a great thing that this matter awaited a confederation and that they are sure that this art will not be used against them. May the Lord direct it with grace for the best, etc.</p>
      <p>On the next Saturday, I will travel to Isny. To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and brother, very dear to me. Zurich.</p>
