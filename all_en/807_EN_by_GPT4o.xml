      <p>S. I received the money you sent to the young man, to whom I faithfully gave it. He may write to you, and he will soon be adorned with the degree of Master. I gave letters to Vergerio and Dryander, and Montio's letters were sent to Strasbourg today; do you wish anything else?</p>
      <p>As for me, regarding how Goliath's wife behaved: before he married the man's daughter, he knew the family was despised and worthless. Whether she behaved well with us in her husband's absence, I do not know. It is a lazy household. I hear the wife is in Zurich and living with Goliath; perhaps she is seeking grounds for divorce.</p>
      <p>The mother is detained in prison with us for many reasons, which cannot be enumerated until the matter is resolved with the magistrate. He wanted to have her despite all warnings; therefore, he has her; he is not deceived, although I know nothing bad about her. This to you; you can conveniently advise him to take his wife back and live honorably with her.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing at all from England. The Emperor is still lingering in the Low Countries. Without a doubt, something is being prepared either against the French or plots are being laid against the English.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am sending two booklets about the Jubilee year; you will have done a useful work if you spread the nonsense of the popes.</p>
      <p>I think you have already seen the Bull of the Devil and received it from Vergerio. I could not greet the good men because of the departure of the courier. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet Dr. Theodor in my name, to whom I will write shortly. Dr. Schertlin sends his regards and says the rumor about the capture of the camp at Boulogne is false, indeed the English are in great fear because of the siege, and he has this from someone who was in the French camp 15 days ago. January 13, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Myconius will write back to you and was displeased that you call him gouty and... since he struggles with his feet, so that he does not know how to walk, because he does not want to suffer from gout; he fears such a disease and thus consoles himself.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
