      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ Jesus, amen.</p>
      <p>With what heartfelt joy (venerable and highly learned lord and father) I, unworthy and unknown, have received your venerable letter, sent to me by Master Lorenz Agricola, only the dear God in heaven knows, etc. Beloved lord and father, I am greatly amazed at how God can endure such a long time watching the miserable and unchristian life. All spiritual goods are being seized by princes and lords: fields and meadows, woods, forests, and more, which were established by ancestors, are partly sold, partly given away out of favor, and are dealt with according to their whims. Meanwhile, there is complete displeasure and reluctance about what should be given to the servants; widows, orphans, and the poor man are harshly oppressed in all this, alongside which hardly any vices are punished, blasphemy, which is very common among us, unchristian drunkenness of the authorities, immorality, and other sins are so common and committed without any fear that they are not recognized as sins. A servant who teaches the truth simply, without boasting, is completely despised; however, one who shouts from the pulpit against Zwingli of blessed memory and disputes with other pious and honest people is held in high regard, but whoever does not do this or does not let it please him, and does not want to be involved, is recognized as a fanatic, because he cannot endure such things. The Lord is my witness that I do not pretend, but it is so and much worse in our place, so that either one who is a church servant in our lands must pretend or otherwise keep silent from others. But as soon as one has a little suspicion, one is so pressured that it is dangerous to speak with a good conscience and at the same time keep their favor. Therefore, I have been in these lands with a burdened conscience, as the dear God in heaven knows, and my heart and mind have always been in your land. Therefore, for the sake of Christ our common Savior, I ask your fatherly heart to give me some assurance of a position, however small and insignificant it may be; I would accept it with all gratitude and utmost joy, as God knows, regardless of the fact that I have 180 florins here. I would also be willing to commit myself to you, my Christian dear lords and fathers, for my entire life, and if any deficiency in my teaching and life is found, that is not appropriate, I would like to have leave at any time. I am also willing to provide references from Liechtenstein in the County of Toggenburg, where I have been a preacher, and also from all other places where I have been, so that one may have a report of my actions and conduct. I ask again for the sake of Christ that your fatherly heart may consider my mind more than the writing. I wish to commend your venerable self, along with all Christian fellow confessors of the bright truth, to God the Lord, for whom I, unworthy, do not cease to pray day and night. Your venerable self should, for God's sake, write no more than two lines in reply.</p>
      <p>Dated the 17th of March, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your venerable self's humble, obedient servant, Johannes Bechlin from Augsburg, pastor at Our Lady in Neuburg, etc.</p>
      <p>Remember your servant, Lord.</p>
      <p>Master Gregor Leuwerer has been in my house for eleven weeks until he received a position.</p>
