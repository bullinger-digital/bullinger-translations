      <p>S. Since I wrote the previous letter, I have just learned what has happened here, which has almost made me half deaf. My lords, along with the two cities, want to punish the pious people, yet they do not send any messengers. They fear that if justice is lost, the same situation might prevail in the other common dominions, although there is no need to worry about it, as there is a peace treaty established. In summary: the devil is playing his game. I was glad, thinking it was all right here; but it is as it is. Good people are greatly displeased about it. I have understood from several, not the least of them, that they think it would not be unserviceable if you offered the good people to send a delegation along with a supplication to Baden on the next day, which they could present to Zürich according to your instructions; then my lords and the other seven places would also intervene, to either suspend the matter or at least proceed with the punishment in a moderate manner. This has come to me. It is indeed a tangled affair; but still, if one cannot do better, one must nevertheless do something. Do, however, what seems good to you.</p>
      <p>I hear Zürich is handling things well; that pleases me. May God grant grace and support! Who knows, if they persist, what might still follow? I had always hoped that a delay would have at least brought some mitigation. Haec prioribus addere volui.</p>
      <p>Farewell. November 2, early morning, 1554. Yours, Hallerus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his dear lord and compatriot.</p>
