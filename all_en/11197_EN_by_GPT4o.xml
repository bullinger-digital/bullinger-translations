    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter with Luther's response [to the Swiss] on August 2; hopes to reciprocate Bullinger's goodwill. Writes briefly because the messenger is pressing and because he wrote shortly before [No. 1149] and wanted to convey more later through [Hans] Varnier. The clergy of Ulm are not offended by Luther's formula of receiving the body of Christ "in vel sub vel cum pane," as only a sacramental connection between bread and the body of Christ is assumed and because Luther does not impose a specific expression on their churches; would like to know from Bullinger whether the Swiss approve of this formulation. The [spiritualist] sectarians cause many to reject the church community. Although the pastors are accused of envy and resentment towards [Sebastian] Franck, who was able to secure a retrial of his case, and towards the unscrupulous [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld, they hope to prove their honor to the critics and hypocrites; Schwenckfeld wants to defend the new doctrine that the glorified Christ is not creaturely and supports the error of the Donatists. [Johannes] Sinapius, who was with [Matteo] Corti in Bologna, reported about an Augustinian who taught evangelical doctrine there and a Franciscan who publicly demonstrated that it is not the Lutherans but the Dominicans who are heretics; he sent a dialogue that is to be printed. Frecht knows nothing about the meeting of the Schmalkaldic League in Eisenach. The warlike [Charles of Egmont], Duke of Guelders, is said to have died; many will fight over the coveted duchy. Greetings to Bullinger's colleagues and a request for a statement on a possible appointment of Leo Jud to Ulm. Greetings to John [Butler?].</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Your letter with Luther's response was delivered on August 2nd, and truly nothing more pleasing and desirable could have been offered to me; for I clearly see that you love us and surpass us with outstanding kindnesses. If only it were possible to repay these services, which you bestow upon us, who are undeserving, in abundance. Certainly, we will lack nothing of good will and due respect towards you; may the Lord provide the means corresponding to our eager goodwill towards you.</p>
      <p>However, the reason I am writing back so briefly and carelessly now is partly due to this hurried messenger, who unexpectedly returns to you from here, and partly because I wrote to you a few days ago with a certain young Englishman and had planned to write again after a few days with our printer Varnier, who affirmed that he would be heading to Zurich these days. But in your kindness, you will consider it well and good that, as I have prefaced, I am writing back very briefly now.</p>
      <p>Regarding the form of speaking "in or under or with the bread the body of Christ is received," I believe it is still controversial among many and that some are sowing rather verbal disputes than necessary discussions on this topic. We, who preach Christ here, are not offended by these things, although those not very favorable to concord usually seize the opportunity to litigate; we know by God's grace that these forms of speaking are free and should serve the edification of the churches. Now there is no other union between the bread and the body of Christ than sacramental, and finally, even Luther admits that outside the use of the sacrament, the bread is a mere sign; ultimately, Luther does not bind our churches to such a mode of speaking. Therefore, we are not offended by these things; however, I would like to know from you how your people accept the aforementioned forms of speaking. Therefore, I congratulate your churches, which are doing well in the Lord. Our churches are also doing well if you consider the free and sincere doctrine, which is boldly preached and preserved in them.</p>
      <p>But Satan, alas, causes complacency to creep in, and it is the hypocrisy of the sectarians that those who are neither cold nor hot disdain the communion of the church. I call sectarians especially not the gross Anabaptists, but the subtle ones, who, while they do not want to be Zwinglians, Lutherans, open Catabaptists, or Papists, are nevertheless expecting another church, supposedly more spiritual.</p>
      <p>Among them are some here who favor Schwenckfeld and that remarkable paradoxist Franck, who, however, does not have many supporters. The senate has decreed that he should move elsewhere by the next Michaelmas. However, as he is a Christologist, he has again obtained from the senate that he be heard; he promises more impudently than prudently to prove his innocence fully and completely. I hardly think he will accomplish this rightly.</p>
      <p>Schwenckfeld also does not have many supporters, although he is no less harmful than Franck. He constantly wants to promote our ministry, and yet we have many serious suspicions against him that he does not do this candidly.</p>
      <p>You know that both Schwenckfeld and Franck were ordered to leave the city of Strasbourg; however, due to our unfortunate fate, we receive them into our republic. When the preachers resist, we are shouted at that we envy the learned and the good. But I hope the day will reveal our integrity and, lest we flatter ourselves, our sincerity, faith, and vigilance against the levity and hypocrisy of our Zoiluses. Schwenckfeld wants to defend a new doctrine, in which he asserts that the glorified Christ, as a man, has shed the nature of a creature; that the impious cannot minister the gospel and sacraments with the fruit of the listeners. You know this last one is of the Donatists. But about these things, more at another time. I briefly pour these things into your bosom, knowing that you also pity our lot, which causes us to be exercised by such hypocrites; but in the Lord, they do not break us.</p>
      <p>There would be other new things to write to you, especially if I were not to write briefly now. These days Sinapius, acting as a physician at the court of the Duke of Ferrara, well known to our Grynaeus, wrote to me from Bologna, where he greeted the most renowned physician Curtius, who is teaching there, about a certain Augustinian monk who taught Christ there, but was driven into exile by the wickedness of the Dominicans; however, he left behind a Franciscan disciple, who now publicly teaches Paul to the Romans in the church of Bologna and declares that he will prove to many that the Dominicans and their kind are heretics, not the Lutherans. He also sent an elegant and witty dialogue about various things, which, if possible, I will send to you once it is printed here.</p>
      <p>Nothing has yet been learned from the meetings of the Evangelical League in Eisenach. It is reported here that that son of Mars, the Duke of Guelders, has finally died, for whose duchy, like Helen, it is feared that many will fight. But I cease at last, so that I may write briefly.</p>
      <p>To your venerable colleagues in the Lord, Mr. Leo Jud, Pellican, Bibliander, and Megander, convey many greetings in the name of my colleagues and myself, and I beseech you, write back especially about Leo Jud, whom our people would have gladly called here in the past, whether it can be obtained from your church and from Leo himself that he would move to dry Swabia and serve the church of Ulm; a good supporter whispered to me that our people would easily attempt this if they knew Leo had a mind towards the people of Ulm. Farewell with the church, to whose prayers I especially desire to be commended.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Ulm, August 5, 1538.</p>
      <p>I wish John the Englishman well, if he has returned to you. Pardon the extemporaneous writing.</p>
      <p>Martin Frecht.</p>
      <p>To the exceptionally learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful and vigilant minister of the church of Zurich, esteemed lord and brother.</p>
