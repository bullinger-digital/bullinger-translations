    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius learned of the tensions among the Confederates regarding the renewal of the alliance oath. The Protestant cities, in contrast to the Inner Swiss, refuse to invoke the saints during the oath. Both parties would rather dissolve the alliance than concede on this matter. Since Zurich leads the Diet and highly values the alliance, it should particularly consult with the other Protestant cities and simultaneously convince the Inner Swiss to take the oath in the manner that all believers have always done. The people of Zurich should ensure that no one can accuse the [Protestant] cities of not acting in all matters as befits the pious. [Charles V.] can serve as an example: When he [in 1543] moved from Italy across the Adige to Swabia and demanded the oath from the [local] cities, he was satisfied with the Protestant cities swearing to him by God and the Holy Gospel. - Calvin wrote on March 27 [1545] about a conspiracy uncovered in recent days by men and women who spread the plague in Geneva over the last three years; and although 15 women have already been burned, some men [broken on the wheel], some committed suicide in prison, and 25 are still held captive, they do not stop smearing the door locks of houses with their ointments. - Myconius hopes that [Johannes] Gast will be reinstated in his office. - He will soon write to Theodor [Bibliander]. He thanks [Konrad] Pellikan and [Rudolf] Gwalther for the sent "Apologia".</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have scarcely found enough leisure to write this; for I could not remain silent. Today, news reached me about the contention among the Swiss regarding the renewal of the alliance oath, and how the cities supporting the Gospel plainly refuse to add the saints; hence, a discord has arisen between the Inner Swiss and the aforementioned cities, with the former threatening, with much agitation, to renounce the alliance agreements before they would yield on this matter. It is not just one or two individuals who are agitated, but entire cities.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I was greatly horrified, especially since at this time, concord is more necessary for us than ever before. This I know from foreign sources, for there are harsh and grave machinations against us. Therefore, while we are aiding ourselves with dissensions, it will not be difficult for the Swiss to perish. I think it is necessary to resist as much as possible, by prudent men, to prevent anything from being done to the detriment of the alliance, and indeed of religion. However, as it is difficult for the Inner Swiss to omit the saints, since their ancestors used them, it is equally impossible for us to add the saints, as we have learned for a long time from divine writings that all our matters should be ratified in God alone. What then? It seems to me and to good men, after the Lord has granted that your city holds the primacy among the Swiss and equally dreads the destruction of such a sacred alliance, that you should use the counsel of those especially who are endowed with the Gospel, and at the same time try to persuade the Inner Swiss as gently and Christianly as possible, that the oath be made in the manner it has always been made by the saints of God. However, you should apply yourself to this endeavor so that, even if you achieve nothing, no one can say that we did not act in all things as befits the pious. Caesar can be brought forth as an example, who, as I hear, does not use another form with his Spaniards. It is known that when he entered Swabia from Italy through the Adige, as they say, and required the cities to take an oath to him, he was content with the form by which they were accustomed to swear after receiving the Gospel, namely by God and the Holy Gospel. Therefore, to prefer the rupture of the Swiss alliance rather than to have it established in the Lord alone would not be the mind of a pious person. I write this not to teach, but to express my mind on that very grave matter, what it is, I say, and what it would wish to do, as far as it is able, to prevent the alliance from breaking apart. I indeed feel an affection here in my flesh. However, I do not think it is entirely against the Lord, since I am looking towards the tranquility of the fatherland, which itself is not displeasing to the Lord. May He mercifully grant us a sound mind.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Mr. Calvin wrote on March 27 of this year that a conspiracy of men and women was uncovered in recent days, who spread the plague in the city of Geneva over the past three years, by means of some unknown witchcraft. And although fifteen women have already been burned, several men have been punished more severely, some have committed suicide in prison, and 25 are still held captive, they do not cease to smear the door locks of houses with their ointments (for thus the poisoning was done, and hence many great men, especially in the Lord, have perished): "Thus far," he says, "the Lord has preserved our house untouched, although it has been frequently attacked." I write this so that, if you were previously unaware, you may more fully see and consider the machinations of the devil in men against Christ the Lord, and how great the enemies are at this time, who strive by force or fraud to remove and eradicate the doctrine of Christ.</p>
      <p>Lord Jesus, attend to our aid and turn your wrath away from us! More on other matters at another time.</p>
      <p>I hope that [Johannes] Gast, suspended from office, will soon be reinstated. Farewell in the Lord with Theodor, to whom I will write soon, and [Konrad] Pellikan and [Rudolf] Gwalther, to whom I will give thanks, when there is leisure, for the sent "Apologia".</p>
      <p>Basel, April 7, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most learned man, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his venerable lord in Christ.</p>
