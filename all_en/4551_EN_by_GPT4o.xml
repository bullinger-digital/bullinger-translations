      <p>Greetings. There was no need for you to give thanks for my journey to Baden; for nothing is more in my wishes than that the 13 Cantons remain in friendship and union, from which they have grown, and do not lend their ears to the seditious and enemies; in this matter, I will omit nothing in the future. At Payerne, nothing at all was accomplished, as the king's procurator appointed himself as the actor in the moderation of usury, and in this, the judges' opinions were diverse. Shortly, the Pope will convene a council in Trento, and in this, the Emperor and the Most Christian and Catholic Kings have yielded to him.</p>
      <p>In the coming month, the councils of France will take place in Orléans amidst arms; there is no mention of a national council. Cardinal de Tournon, after Lorraine, has much influence with the king.</p>
      <p>But very often, when human aid fails, the Lord exerts His power more. I have not yet understood what the Bernese have done in Neuchâtel with the envoys of Savoy.</p>
      <p>My wife and children send their greetings to you; greet all friends and love us. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 22nd of November. Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
