      <p>Greetings. I have now received rather unfortunate letters from you, most delightful and esteemed lord and godfather; for in the former you mention the death of Hyperius, and in the latter, our Rüger.</p>
      <p>Would that instead of them, that delirious Brentius had migrated to his heaven! But it seems thus to the Lord, to whose will it is right for us to submit. We too are sometimes afflicted by the death of good people; for yesterday, just before I received yours, the most beloved wife of Mr. Haller, the treasurer, an excellent godfather and neighbor, passed away, and it is astonishing how much that poor old man is afflicted by her death, who, although surrounded by a crown of grandchildren, has lost the best comfort he could have had in this life.</p>
      <p>He himself is also bedridden, unable to move his hands due to gout or his feet due to that perpetual stiffness; he only lifts his eyes to the Lord and entrusts his spirit to Him with sufficient patience.</p>
      <p>You would do well to console him with your letters. Concerning your consultation, I received its description from my brother, for which I thank you.</p>
      <p>I am very pleased with it; for it should not be allowed that we alone are thrown into a contest with the Lutherans, when such noble and illustrious kingdoms follow our doctrine, and would very reluctantly bear our prejudices if we were to decide anything without them. What our people will respond, I do not know; however, I do not doubt that everything will be very pleasing to them.</p>
      <p>As soon as I can, I will meet with Steiger about this matter. The messenger is now preparing to leave; therefore, I am forced to be brief.</p>
      <p>What I have written about our affairs, I have sent to my brother; he will communicate all of it to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Mr. von Mülinen, Grafenried, and Zehender, and finally friends and brothers, and my wife, who wishes all good things for you and yours, greet you again. May all the brothers and your entire household be safe.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 16, 1564.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and godfather, to be honored with perpetual respect.</p>
