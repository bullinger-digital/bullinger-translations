      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have nothing now, most esteemed lord, to respond to your letters, except to assure you regarding the transmission of the sermons, which your son Christophorus requested from you in my name. I do not wish for you, burdened with many other labors, to bear any troubles on my account. I am sending you a writing, whose author is Mr. Caspar Schwenckfeld.</p>
      <p>This indeed good, pious, and learned man, when I seemed to him to lean too much towards your side, reproached me. I copied it, yet I did not dare to send it to you.</p>
      <p>Now, trusting in your kindness, I am sending it.</p>
      <p>I hope you do not take it badly.</p>
      <p>If it is as this man says, to you people of Zurich, if I may say so with all due respect, it is not unjust if the Lutherans do the same to you, according to the saying: With what measure you measure, it will be measured to you. If not, I am amazed at the man's impudence, who dared to spread such things about you.</p>
      <p>Farewell and consider me yours.</p>
      <p>Augsburg, the last day of December 1557. There is no need to return the copy of Schwenckfeld. Your most observant Engelbert Milander.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
