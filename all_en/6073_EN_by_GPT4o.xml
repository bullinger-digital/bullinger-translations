      <p>Greetings. All your things, reverend father in Christ, have been delivered to us in good faith.</p>
      <p>I sent letters to Mr. Zanchi and Martinengo; but Mr. Martinengo has withdrawn to Morbegno with his widowed mother because of the plague.</p>
      <p>The city of Chiavenna is in disarray; they are so anxiously afraid for themselves. I know the consul was with you, from whom you learned everything related to Philipp's business.</p>
      <p>I am writing suddenly now.</p>
      <p>What you add about the old man Ochino, we have found to be too true.</p>
      <p>Here is the dialogue, which has now come out, in which he particularly attacked you. Take care to have it translated into Latin, so that the Nuremberg Senate can be promptly informed by yours. Mr. Balingketus procured it for me; he doubted whether it should be sent, but I thought it should definitely be sent. I ask you, reverend father, to continue to inform us about everything; for I hope that before the return of the Philippian envoy, we will have something certain to oppose. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Chur, suddenly, because of the messenger's haste, March 20, in the year of our Lord 1564. Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>The dialogue has not yet been printed, but in Valtellina it is passed among some by hand from a manuscript; Mr. Balingketus wanted it to be noted for your sake.</p>
