      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, as I was preparing to depart from the king's court at Saint-Germain, your letters were very conveniently delivered to me by the interpreter of the ambassador of your most esteemed republic. I cannot adequately express how delightful the news of your health was to me and how much I wished to demonstrate my spirit towards you and your republic to that most prudent man and to gratify him especially in such a just cause. I had previously greeted him, unknown to me, because in my presence they had met with the most reverend Cardinal of Lorraine, and I had recommended them to friends who have some influence at the royal majesty, not in an ordinary manner. With him and the ambassadors of other cities, when they return to this city, I hope to converse more familiarly and to receive them as they deserve. Meanwhile, due to many tasks assigned to me by the royal majesty, I am to return to Cambrai within eight days, where I left my wife and family for a while, until the storms that have been stirred up in these regions are calmed. It was not without reason that someone said solitude is pleasant to those who hate the wicked.</p>
      <p>Now certainly the gravest errors are rampant, and there is great contempt for the word of God in this delirious old age of the world, nor should it seem surprising if punishments increase and the periods of empires are at hand. Nevertheless, I do not cease to hope for the best from Him who has conquered Satan, the world, and death, and will not forsake His own. Since the enemy has departed from the borders of Savoy, I wrote to Master Ciconius to deliver my two chests to the carrier, so they can reach Geneva, where what was promised for the transport will be paid.</p>
      <p>I commend this business to you and pray that you love me in my absence and promise yourself everything from me, if I can do anything, and in my name greet Master Lelio and the friends who will inquire about me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Paris, November 5.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Matthieu Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, Pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, Zurich.</p>
