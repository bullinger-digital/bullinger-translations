      <p>Strasbourg, July 8, 1553.</p>
      <p>Greetings. The most unwelcome news has reached us, esteemed Bullinger, about our most Christian king (it will be permissible to attribute this title of "most Christian" to a truly Christian man rather than to another who falsely claims it for himself). This news initially terrified us greatly, and I would have almost believed it if our mutual friend, Mr. Montius, who was summoned to the court of the Emperor in Brussels by the English envoys at the king's command, had not written to us otherwise. He wrote to me and others on June 24 that the English envoys had arrived in Brussels, reporting that the king had been gravely ill but, by the grace of God, was recovering, so much so that there was no danger to his life. Therefore, God is to be praised and prayed to, that He may grant us this king to remain with us for as long as possible. The entire English church prays to the most good and great God with a common prayer, that he may be restored to health and preserved for a long time.</p>
      <p>We also ask you to commend both the king and our church to God with your constant prayers.</p>
      <p>Montius also writes that Turwan (Tournai) was captured through treachery. There were negotiations for peace between the citizens and the Emperor: envoys were sent to discuss the terms: arms were ordered to cease. Meanwhile, while these things were being negotiated, the Emperor's forces unexpectedly attacked the city and entered through the part where they had previously destroyed the walls with cannon fire, killed about 500 soldiers, set the city on fire, and captured the constable's son, so that now, rightly, Punic faith could be turned into Spanish. This is what I had, which I deemed worthy to write to you, dearest Bullinger. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours, I. B., Englishman. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
