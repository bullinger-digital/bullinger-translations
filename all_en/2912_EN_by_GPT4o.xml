      <p>To the ministers of the Church of Christ in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Greetings. As we have always been convinced, most illustrious men, that the Church of Christ which is among you was truly pious and, having cleansed itself of all the stains of the Antichrist, even if accused by some, strove for purity, so now this has been confirmed to us not lightly by the most illustrious man, Mr. Franz Lismaninus, a man according to our heart, to be respected by us in the Lord. For he recounted many of your excellent virtues, your merits towards the needy and the exiles, and finally your zeal for spreading the word even to foreigners, which you also clearly indicated in your letters, responding so faithfully and piously to our wishes and taking care of our church no less than if it had been entrusted to you. As for us, even if we could not hope so much for ourselves as we have been esteemed by you, what else should we wish for you in return for such a benefit, than that the Lord may always take care of you and bless your labors, so that you may be able to benefit both your church, which you have planted, and ours, which is taking root. We also have the greatest thanks for your labor and care, and we wish that we may achieve in our ministry the fruits which you favor us with willingly and from the heart. As you commend to us the care of the schools so diligently, we do not doubt that you will indeed provide your assistance by granting us for a time the most learned man, Mr. Sebastian, a professor of grammar.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest brothers, and as you remind us to pray for you, we also demand this from you by Christian right, and all the more anxiously, as we are besieged by the satellites of the Roman Antichrist, sitting almost in their jaws to be devoured.</p>
      <p>Given at Pińczów, May 3, in the year of our Lord 1556. Felix Cruciger Scebressinius, superintendent of the reborn Church of Christ in Lesser Poland, in the name of all ministers and nobles united in the faith of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men in learning and piety, pastors and readers of the Church of [Jesus] Christ in Zürich, most esteemed lords and brothers in Christ.</p>
