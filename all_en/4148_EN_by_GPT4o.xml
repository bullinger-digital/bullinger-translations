      <p>Greetings. I return the booklet (reverend father in Christ) that you sent to be read, and indeed I owe you thanks. I also send some news from the council chamber, which, if you do not yet have, I hope will not be unwelcome to you. But you should return all these things through a trusted person; for they belong to the lord orator, who shares these with us.</p>
      <p>Besides this, I have nothing new.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all your family, as happily as possible.</p>
      <p>All of ours wish you well.</p>
      <p>I am expecting letters from lord Heinrich, your son, whose long silence I wonder at. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 4, 1559.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>I ask you, reverend father, to ensure these letters are delivered to lord Pellicanus - he is mentioned in them -, and also to the widow of Leo, his relative, in which there is a thaler; therefore, I would like them to be delivered with care. As for the business of Quadrius, I hope divine mercy will provide for us.</p>
      <p>Certainly, many good men, whose minds we have explored, will vigorously oppose; but also the papists contradict this new institution; and our people will not do much to favor Ferdinand. You will hear other reasons.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and much esteemed patron.</p>
