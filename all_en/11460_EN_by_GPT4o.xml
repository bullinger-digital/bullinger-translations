    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not written for a long time, as he planned a trip to Zurich and would have preferred to report orally. Sebastian [Meyer], [Peter] Kunz, [Simon] Sulzer, and the deacons have presented their position to the council in writing, as has Erasmus [Ritter], but the council has forbidden both parties from returning to the dispute; Meyer could indeed threaten to resign, but his departure would be welcome to many anyway. Rümlang refrains from sending Bullinger the letter [Bucer's] to Comander. Bern unanimously adheres to the previous doctrine. The participation of Bern in the religious discussion [in Hagenau] desired by Basel was rejected. Sends the "Catalogus" by Valerius Anshelm; despite small errors, he appreciates this concise historical overview. Greetings to the colleagues. Asks to be excused by Binder and Fries, to whom he had promised an introduction to music theory; he wants to treat the subject in more depth and will explain his concept to them orally. Greetings to the family.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You may rightly wonder, most honorable and beloved Bullinger, what has happened that I have not written to you for so long, and perhaps, although I trust you better, suspect that I have somewhat relaxed from our former relationship. But indeed, no other fault is to be attributed than that I have often planned a journey to you, yet have been delayed either due to unexpected occupations or, as happened once, due to not so light health issues. Had these not impeded me, I would have discussed certain matters with you more safely in person than I would have entrusted to writing, since messengers are often negligent in delivering letters, so they cannot always be safely entrusted, and because in disputes, either party is reluctant to have their faults and offenses indicated and signified to the other.</p>
      <p>The dispute between Sebastian [Meyer], [Peter] Kunz, [Simon] Sulzer, and the two deacons on one side and Erasmus [Ritter] on the other, which they reported to the council in writing - for everything that one party desired from the other was encompassed in writing - has been resolved by the council in such a way that no further mention of it is to be made. For the council wanted this entire contention to be completely silenced; it had perceived the deacons to be agitated and, as it is eager for peace, it imposed concord and peace on both parties, so that now, whether they like it or not, Sebastian and his entire faction are forced to allow Erasmus to preach freely and in the usual manner about the Lord's Supper from the pulpit. I sense they are tormented; but they do not dare to express their bile. And if such a contention had to be resolved in the presence of the deacons, perhaps Sebastian - for some openly threatened in the tribal societies that they would do this - would have been dismissed and prohibited from delivering sermons here. But since disturbances are uncertain and slippery, and to prevent a great conflagration from starting from a spark, the council wanted this contention to be completely intercepted, so that not a word would be spoken about it anywhere. And if only one had resisted Erasmus, perhaps a different decision would have been made about him. But they anticipated this and therefore, what they conjectured would happen to one, they preempted and occupied with their crowd.</p>
      <p>The majority's inclination leans towards the usual formulas of speech. And since Sebastian now feels that he is not so well received and since they have played their part in the last danger and final assault, they gradually relent from their usual ferocity, and since Sebastian experiences his efforts as futile, he threatens to leave, which would be most welcome to many, and they openly say they wish it would happen. If he attempts this, he will see that he will escape with his cloak intact. But whatever he does, we will stand immovable from the truth we have perceived, like a rock.</p>
      <p>I did not want to send you the copy of the letter to Comander, which is now with Sulzer, because it is not of such great importance for you to have it - it is better for us to be fixed and firm in the Lord than to care about anyone's slanders - and because I believe you have already obtained it from others; for when you wrote, I did not have the opportunity to send it, as Sulzer was abroad. But if you have not yet seen it, I will not refuse to send it and comply with you. The council has granted me the opportunity to visit you after the grape harvest; then I will visit you and enjoy your presence and recount to you in person what you desire.</p>
      <p>Things are going well with us; for we are united and sufficiently inclined towards unanimity, eager to maintain the usual doctrine.</p>
      <p>The people of Basel had requested that we also send delegates to the Strasbourg assembly of princes and that we act together with them in matters and negotiations of faith; but we did not want to have any business with them nor occupy or involve ourselves with foreign patchworks, because our decrees of faith are pure, solidified by the scriptures, so there is no need to sew anything into them, which would immediately be undone by God’s displeasure, etc.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the "Catalogus" by Valerius, which you have long desired; in which you will find not the style or phrase, but the reckoning of times not so unhappily aligned with the biblical truth handed down. The printer compelled me to fill a quire from the beginning, so I occupied the paper with my trifles. Valerius reviewed the Catalogus, and our schoolmaster Telorus corrected and amended it for the press. But both of them overlooked some things, which I have now found in the printed book. I could not apply my polish due to business, while it was still whole, but there are not so many and they can be easily corrected by an attentive reader. Whatever it is, consider it favorably. I care little for the appended index of histories more than for the explanation; but what I value greatly is the orderly series of times, etc.</p>
      <p>I beg you greatly, in my name, to greet Leo, Megander, Pellican, Theodore, Collin, Binder, and Frisius, and do not also pass over Rellican and all who remember me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I beg you to excuse me before Binder and Frisius; for I had promised them to compile an introduction to the art of music, from which they could easily and concisely teach the best principles to others. And since this is most easy for me, as it pertains to the knowledge of tones, keys, notes, signs, pauses, times, prolations, augmentations, diminutions, ligatures, and proportions and other minute matters of this art, to produce, I am not satisfied unless I explain the quantities of proportions from the secrets of mathematics, from which consonances consist, and bring light to the system arranged according to Pythagorean dimension with other numerical proportions and quantities. Hence, those things also would not be left untouched, on which the most important part of the business would depend. For if I perceive that I will gratify them in this part as well, I will indicate in person which path I think should be taken for exact demonstrations - and that briefly - for I will be occupied only in the diatonic genus and will not mention anything of the enharmonic or chromatic genus, except as much as is necessary to illustrate the diatonic, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell most excellently together with your chaste wife and sweetest children and love me, which you do.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, on the 10th day before the Kalends of September in the year 1540. Entirely yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most upright and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, his always to be respected lord.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
