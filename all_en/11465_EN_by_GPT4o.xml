      <p>Grace and innocence of life from our Lord.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, pious and faithful, dear lords and fathers, we have learned that Benedikt Finsler has been provided with a more lucrative benefice and therefore the deaconate at Goßau has become vacant again. Since Wolfgang Meyer (who was once sent from Matt in the Sernftal) has now lived with us for many years in great poverty with his wife and children in utmost patience and has always conducted himself well and piously (as far as we know), thereby gaining favor and compassion not only from all of us and each individually, but also from the common people. Now, since we have several deacons in the Wetzikon chapter, so that a deacon in Goßau might not need to preach so much, we would like to be able to rely on the aforementioned brother Wolfgang at that place. Therefore, it is our friendly and dutiful request to you, our dear lords and fathers, that you kindly recommend this poor brother in the election and nomination for God's sake and for our request; so that with God's help he may once be lifted out of misery. We would gladly support him and strive to earn such from you both generally and individually. With this, we commend you to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Given at Bubikon, 23rd of September in the year 1540. Common servants of the Church of Christ in the office of Grüningen, Wetzikon chapter.</p>
