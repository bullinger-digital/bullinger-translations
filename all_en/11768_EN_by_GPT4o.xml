    <p xml:id="regest1">Heinrich Bullinger has taken from Lening's letter [No. 1710] with concern that Lening has involved himself in the unfortunate polygamy debate, which causes offense to the weak and brings the evangelical doctrine into disrepute; Bullinger would not have written about it himself if [the "Dialogus Neobuli"] had not given him cause to do so, which displeases the preachers - beyond Zurich and the Swiss Confederation - and has led to discussions; his conscience compelled him to publicly confess [in the Matthew commentary] what he and other servants of the church think of it. Since he expressed himself within the framework of a commentary, his presentation may have been too brief, but he is ready to elaborate on his position in detail should the situation of the church require it; conversely, Lening has not succeeded in convincingly justifying his opinion, even though he tried to rely on Bullinger's writings; Bullinger has nothing to retract and objects to his clear statements being given a foreign meaning; inconsistency and ambiguities have always been repugnant to him. The sophistic manner in which Lening, for example, disputes the probative force of a Malachi quote does not hold, but Bullinger does not want to go into details further due to time constraints. He has only found time with difficulty to at least respond this much, although he would have liked to have been more obliging to the waiting messenger of the prince [Philip of Hesse]. He welcomes that Lening has not attacked him publicly, for otherwise he would have responded publicly, and such a confrontation would harm the church. Despite Lening's admonition, he insists that God gave [Adam] one, not several wives; he never intended to add fuel to the fire, rather his wish is that the debate ignited by others would fall silent as soon as possible. He apologizes for his rough writing. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received and read your letter, Lening, dated January 16th, on February 16th through the public courier of your prince, and it indeed grieves me not a little that I understand you, a friend and brother whom I have known and loved for several years now, to be entangled in the utterly perplexing cause of polygamy. I would prefer that such causes remain entirely buried and dormant in our most ulcerated times. I would prefer that ministers of the word, for those desiring to take multiple wives, not indicate so much what is permissible, if indeed it is entirely permissible for a man professing the gospel, as they would inculcate the apostle's teaching: "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are beneficial. I have the right to do anything, but I will not be mastered by anything." I would prefer that nothing be spread in public writings about those things which offend the weak in faith, aid the enemies of the gospel, and provide everyone with an occasion to slander the doctrine of the gospel, as if it were a doctrine of license, not of holy liberty. Nor would I ever, Lening, believe me, have written anything against polygamy or about digamy, as you civilly call it, unless I had seen some German pamphlets published, almost preaching that it is not condemned by any laws of God or Caesar or any classical writer, and therefore permissible for Christians as just, holy, and good. That debate displeased me greatly and still displeases me vehemently today, not only to me but also to all other fellow ministers, not only in Zurich but also to the faithful ministers throughout Switzerland and neighboring churches. What is more, not infrequent disputes have arisen among brothers about polygamy, whether it is licit or illicit? And if licit, as it is not prohibited by any laws, nothing further stands in the way of anyone bringing certain reasons to take multiple wives. For they added that no one would lack certain or necessary reasons, except for him who loves coldly. Meanwhile, others shouted that evangelicals derive nothing else from the gospel than what affects the flesh. Once it was disputed whether a priest may take a wife, now it is debated whether he may be joined to many. Nor is there any end or limit to complaining even today.</p>
      <p>What should we do here, Lening, especially we to whom the faithful care and vigilance over the Lord's flock was entrusted? Certainly, it was not permissible to remain completely silent or to ignore everything, unless we wanted to act against our own conscience and to precipitate many entrusted to our faith into open danger, especially those who, being more prone to lust, seize anything as an occasion to fulfill their desires. Therefore, what I understood all other ministers of the churches to feel privately and to respond publicly when asked, what I also believed and learned from the scriptures, I wanted to testify in public writing. I did nothing here out of affection, nothing deceitfully, nothing for the favor or hatred of anyone, as the authors of that doctrine were entirely unknown to me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I simply professed what I believed, and that for the benefit of the churches, which I wanted to help, not harm. Nor am I ashamed or regretful of that deed and my counsel. For what I did, I did with a good conscience before God.</p>
      <p>But it seems to you and perhaps to your friends as well that my arguments, with which I opposed polygamy, are very weak, so much so that even my friends, who are themselves not very favorable to polygamy, wish that I had either not touched such an ulcer or had attacked it with stronger and more proven remedies.</p>
      <p>But, my friend, you should have remembered that I, acting as a commentator, barely touched upon or rather sketched the highest points of the arguments in passing. If I see it to be in the interest of truth, the churches, and the brothers, I will not hesitate, with the grace of the Lord inspiring me, to expand those brief and concise points more copiously, to complete what was sketched and begun to the best of my ability, to arrange what is confused and unorganized, to polish what is obscure, to explain more clearly what is involved, to strengthen and fortify what is weak or feeble, and finally to examine and refute contrary arguments. I did not want to write fully on that matter in the commentaries while engaged in other things; yet, since I neither should nor could completely refrain from saying anything about it, I wanted to briefly express my opinion, which many desired to hear, supported by some arguments. Thus, it may have happened that in this matter I have not satisfied you or others (although many good and learned men desire nothing more) in this debate. Indeed, what happened to me here is perhaps what happened to you due to the brevity of an otherwise lengthy letter. Although you have reviewed many arguments by which you wish digamy to appear asserted, none of them have such evidence, certainty, and firmness that, instructed by the open word of God and fully persuaded, I can safely rely on it. I speak freely what I feel and as I feel from the heart. And yet you wish to appear to have compiled what you presented from my writings, which I am either forced to retract or revoke or finally not acknowledge, or certainly to concede digamy as a permissible and divine matter to be allowed to Christians in certain or necessary cases. But I frankly acknowledge those writings of mine, nor will I retract or revoke any of them; however, I do not acknowledge or accept the conclusions and deductions that the proponents of polygamy draw and derive from them. While I was writing and publishing them, I never even dreamed of anything like what is now being elicited from them. And I am quite sure that no one sincerely, with all my writings compared and duly weighed, can gather such a thing. Moreover, I hope that this will be granted to me by all fair judges, which has not been denied to anyone so far, namely, that the same person who proposed the opinion is granted the explanation of it. I proposed in those writings of mine with a simple mind and without any deceit what I felt; I will explain this more significantly and expressly if anyone continues to attribute their own, that is, a foreign sense to my writings. Nor will I use any cunning here. I will not sit on two stools, as the saying goes, nor will I speak one thing standing and another sitting. For I have hated no vice more than inconsistency and slipperiness throughout my life.</p>
      <p>With sincere faith, present mind, and constant spirit, I will conduct the business of truth where the matter itself seems to demand it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you elude those arguments of mine scattered in the Matthew commentaries, to speak freely what I feel, you do not refute them; but you indulge your affection as much as is sufficient, nor do you entirely cover and restrain your teeth. For I cited Malachi (I will bring one of many); you refer to the deaf and blind. These things, I say with your permission, I would have expected not from a theologian, but from a sophist using cautions from Aristotle's Topics. For if you look more correctly and closely at the place of Malachi, you will find our matters to be intact, yours to be diseased. But I pass over and prudently do not touch upon many things of this kind. For I have not decided at present to respond to each point in order and fully. I am waiting for another time, which has more convenience and fewer disturbances and occupations.</p>
      <p>Certainly, I could hardly write this in reply due to the brevity of time and because of my private and public affairs. Indeed, the courier, a truly good and faithful man, stayed with me for two days as ordered and requested, whom I wish I could have gratified, and that for the sake of the most illustrious and excellent prince of the Chatti, from whose service he said he was; but in the meantime, I barely stole a few hours from my occupations, which I spent reading and considering yours and writing these of ours on paper.</p>
      <p>At the end of the letter, you add that you wrote these things privately, friend to friend, not indeed with the intention of contending or stirring up dissension in the churches, but to give me an occasion to think more soberly and deliberate about this matter, so that oil is not added to the fire and the matter almost dormant is not improperly stirred up again.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I recognize the mind of a friend in that free admonition of yours and I give thanks. Perhaps it is more prudent that you preferred to handle this matter with me privately rather than publicly before the church. For I do not know with what praise you would have acted publicly. Nor would I have concealed anything here and would have undoubtedly responded to you with a sufficiently copious writing. But you do not wish to contend nor to stir up new quarrels in the church. I approve of your candid and holy nature. My whole mind also abhors contentions, nor do I easily, unless drawn, descend into the arena knowing what harm constant or repeatedly renewed altercation has given to the church.</p>
      <p>Now, as you propose a certain end to all your matters for me, Lening, brother and friend, namely, that I think more soberly about digamy, so that I do not add oil to the fire or stir up a matter almost dormant again, I give thanks. For I cannot think more soberly about marriage than if I think, as I have done so far, that the Lord said from the beginning: "They will be two in one flesh" [Gen 2, 24] and therefore joined a wife, not wives, to a man, and that those are most sober who, content with one wife, strive to subjugate the desires of the flesh to the rule of the spirit. And in this matter, I have aimed to pour water on the fire rather than add oil to the fire. Those who first kindled this fire and spread a new and hitherto unused matter in public writings to a populace otherwise more than sufficiently prone to desires seem to have added oil to the fire more truly. I certainly do not wish to unhappily stir up a matter unhappily settled. Let us strive with all our might to promote and excite the glory of Christ, our king, and what is honorable and useful. If the cause of digamy or polygamy is almost dormant, it is well, I rejoice, I give thanks to our God, I desire and ask for nothing more, nor did I aim at anything else in those commentaries of mine than that it be happily settled and no longer used by anyone.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus be with your spirit and with all of yours. I wrote hastily, so take my rusticity in good part.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name, if you know any friends and brothers who favor me. Zurich, February 18th, 6 PM, in the year 1543.</p>
