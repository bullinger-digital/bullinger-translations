      <p>Greetings. If the rumors are true, most esteemed Calvin, these letters of mine are not being offered to you in Geneva, since you have long since departed for France. It is said that the king will not send anyone to the Council of Trent, and furthermore, he is about to hold a national council in France, to which he has summoned you along with some others. For many reasons, I believe all of this to be completely false, unless I am informed otherwise by you. Oh, how welcome the news would be if it were announced to be true. However, I see that there are few princes in this world who do not adhere to the Antichrist, and who do not wish for him to reign with Christ oppressed.</p>
      <p>It is written from Italy that the council is proceeding entirely and that the pope is hastening and is wholly engaged in this matter, so that, having held 7 sessions, he may soon convene others. Persecution is raging in Italy, as you will understand from this citizen of Cremona who has been recommended to me by our Vergerio. I would also recommend him to you if your charity and humanity were not already well known to me.</p>
      <p>We are being plotted against, brother. Let us therefore watch and pray. The Lord will not forsake us, provided that we steadfastly adhere to Him through His grace. I am sending you what I received from Mr. Vergerio, and I am sharing it with you as with my most intimate and closest brother. I do not understand Italian: however, I have retained another copy for myself. For he sent two. I wonder if you have received our fifth Decade. For I certainly sent it through a certain Italian.</p>
      <p>I have translated our agreement into German, a copy of which I am sending here, so that you lack nothing of ours. Farewell forever, most esteemed brother. Commend me to Mr. de Bourgogne and the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 29, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
