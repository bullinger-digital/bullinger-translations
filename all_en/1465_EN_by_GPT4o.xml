      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I wish to know what you think about the articles sent to you. The matter is clear, and even to the peasants who have heard little of the truth of the Gospel, it is evident that this council has approved many errors in the matter of the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>Perhaps these articles were brought forward, examined, and condemned because of our adversaries, to harass us and disturb our churches. For there is a rumor, although still uncertain, that the Pagans sent a legate to the council and that these articles were discussed because of his prayers. The children of this world are wise in these matters, and we almost sleep through everything, unwilling to spend anything on the Lord's business, while we lavish money on the novelties of vain men. We should be vigilant here, lest the adversaries do everything secretly without our knowledge and awareness. The Papists have conspired especially against our churches, which still retain the Word of the Lord purely, unmixed with any ceremonies. May the Lord have mercy on our churches. Strive to have your booklet translated into all languages and send some copies to the council, so they may be more certain of our religion, which is founded on the Holy Scriptures. The Papal legate has allowed everyone to read the writings of the heretics; let them read and reread and also weigh what they read in truth, and add prayers to the Lord, so they may understand the mind of Christ and be able to draw the genuine meaning for the concord of the church, not to sow discord. Many bishops have been received in Trent, unlearned men and not at all practiced in the Word of God; otherwise, they are good and honest men, especially the Germans; what I think of the rest, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Malvenda will triumph in this little council and the remaining monks, who care more for the saints than for Christ himself, than for his face, than for the tranquility of the church. But more on these matters another time, and I do not doubt that you will weigh the future calamities of the church better than I. The last times are at hand, full of dangers, in which Christ will reveal the hypocrisy of many. Farewell. The preacher Heltus greets you, a sincere soldier of Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, 9th of November, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, my kind lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
