      <p>Greetings. I give thanks to our merciful Lord God, who has singularly bestowed His grace upon you and other pious brothers in handling the rather difficult ecclesiastical matter.</p>
      <p>The good Lord has shown that He never abandons those who hope in Him and call upon the name of Jesus Christ; to Him be glory, praise, and thanksgiving. I gladly read the acts of your synod, and I am pleased with what you and other pious and learned men have faithfully accomplished. May the Lord be your reward and preserve you in the sincerity of pure faith and convert the Ganthners, Marios, and similar pitiable men. I return the acts and all entrusted to me and give the greatest thanks I can for these.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write now. A few days ago, I returned healthy and quite well from the baths at Vals, by God's grace.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deign to bless me and mine! The Baden assembly has concluded; but the dispute of the Schaffhausen people with the Cantons governing Thurgau is not yet resolved.</p>
      <p>Hail, the scourge of God, has damaged crops in many places and shaken the fruits from the trees. These are signs of famine and lack of charity, for charity has vanished and all iniquity abounds. I would rather hear from you about the affairs of Venice and Italy, what is happening. From Germany, I have nothing at present, nor from France; however, I hear that the affairs of France are not unfortunate. We must pray to the Lord for blessing.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently with your household and our brothers. Greet the honorable consuls, Campell, Pontisella, Gregor, Bonet, and others. July 13, in the year of our Lord 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Tobias Egli, the most faithful and vigilant pastor of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
