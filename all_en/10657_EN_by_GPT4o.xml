    <p xml:id="regest1">Asks Bullinger to act in the matter of [Matthias Bodmer], as his father-in-law [Heinrich Brennwald] is apparently indisposed. If he received Bullinger's description of the battle [at Gubel], the work would soon be completed. According to rumors, the Emperor has called upon the [Catholic] Confederates and the Zurichers for unity. Asks for indulgence for the shortcomings in his letter.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I have written several times to my father-in-law, dearest brother, but since I have not yet received any response, I suspect that perhaps the good father, hindered by ill health, has not yet met with you according to our agreement. Therefore, please inform me in a few words by letter of whatever has been done by you in our matter, whether with the consul or with others.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it would be pleasing if you could send the account of the mountain war that you have written. I am greatly desirous of it; for once it is completed, you would soon see our work completed as well.</p>
      <p>There is a common rumor among us that the Emperor has recently urged both the Swiss Confederates and the people of Zurich with very friendly letters to embrace mutual concord and civil peace. If this is the case, ensure that we have a copy of such letters in due time.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Bubikon, July 19, 1535.</p>
      <p>If you find any errors or anything less appropriate in this letter of mine, dearest brother, kindly mark it with a friendly sign, yet keeping the Zoiluses at bay.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Stumpf, from Brussels.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the city of Zurich, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
