    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer has returned but has not yet written; he is said to have lamented the lack of suitable [pastors] in a sermon. The Lorrainer is recruiting soldiers, presumably on behalf of the French [King Francis I]; in Schliengen, two noblemen are waiting for orders, and there are many like them. In view of the Turkish threat, which Bullinger writes about, the disunity among Christians is causing concern. Urgently needs information on how the Zurich Synod handles the censorship of pastors and the swearing-in of council delegates; [Karlstadt] wrongly claims the Zurich model as a precedent. Requests to examine the matter of Grynaeus; he has long been ready to be awarded the doctorate by laying on of hands, but it is questionable whether he will be allowed; the Zurichers should prevent him from leaving, as otherwise Karlstadt's rule will ruin the church. Greetings. Could only write briefly.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Bucer has indeed returned, but has not yet written to us. From another letter, I learned that he said from the pulpit that he has traveled through various regions and seen such a great harvest, that it is surprising, but there is such a scarcity of good reapers as he would not have believed. "One," he says, "serves the belly, another gathers, another is proud of the gifts granted; very few work for the Lord. Therefore, you will pray to the Lord to send reapers," etc.</p>
      <p>The Lorrainer is gathering soldiers; for what purpose, we do not know, except as conjecture suggests. He is a bad and impious man, favoring the French; there is no doubt, therefore, that he acts in favor of the French King, whatever he does. There is a town not far from Freiburg, Schliengen; there, two noblemen hired for this purpose are waiting for the signal to call those they have recruited. There are countless such noblemen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, what you write about the Turk greatly disturbs me. I seem to see Jerusalem surrounded by enemies and those inside waging war among themselves.</p>
      <p>Is peace given to him to build a city in the land of Christians? Truly, our affairs are in a bad state. It must be carefully seen that those to whom the grace of knowing Him is given, serve the Lord.</p>
      <p>Moreover, regarding your synod, which you celebrate twice a year, I need an explanation of how you celebrate it. Our adversary uses it as an example of the examination of faults. But I know that he does this wrongly. Yet unless I am taught by you how you conduct it, especially concerning the oath of the synod, which pertains to the appointed senators, I will not be able to oppose it. If you can spare me a little time, I ask you to comply. I can be content with a few words; but within fourteen days, a response will be needed.</p>
      <p>What Mr. Grynaeus now again requests regarding his doctorate, I ask you to consider carefully. He would have long since received the laying on of hands, and it seems to us to be entirely ecclesiastical. But because the learned men think the school is somewhat despised, I do not know whether they can agree to this. If you agree, he will not be easily removed by anyone; you have such authority with this man. Ensure that he remains with our church, unless you wish the rule of Karlstadt to go to submerge the church. Pray for us all together.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in the Lord. Greet Theodor and Pellicanus. I could barely write so little due to the brevity of time.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 12, 1540.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Zurichers, his most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
