    <p xml:id="regest1">Has often read Bullinger's pious lament about the dangers of the time with profit; it is indeed time to humble oneself before God and heed His admonitions. The kings [Charles V and Francis I] are forging deceptive wedding [plans]. [Francis I], like Moab at that time, proves to be arrogant; [Charles V] relies on daring and luck; both are tools of the Antichrist, while the foretold persecution of the faithful increases. Now a new stumbling block is added: the resurgent dispute over the Lord's Supper - the Zurichers may have seen Luther's "Short Confession" - whose terrible smoke is highly damaging to the eyes of faith; on both sides, there was an opportunity to discuss it and form an opinion; Christ alone [however] determines the victor, while Satan tries to entangle us in fatal disputes. Everyone knows that Luther seeks only one thing in this matter: to ensure the offering and reception of the true body and true blood of Christ; no impanation; no inclusion of the body of Christ; nothing that diminishes its human nature or its heavenly dignity; only that he be allowed to adhere to the exchange of properties between the two natures of Christ. Had the [Confederates] adhered to the phrases of the [First Helvetic] Confession, not reviled the [Lutherans], and not praised their own position so much and so often, this storm would not have arisen; Luther cannot tolerate being accused of tearing Christ from heaven and attributing something earthly to Him; equally intolerable for him is the fact that the [Confederates] diminish the corruption of human nature (which also characterizes the Antichrist); those who are against Luther - and among the true children of God, there are only a few such - do not dare to express their divergences, and if they do, they confuse rather than edify; therefore, and also because there is nothing better to do, Bucer sees his task in softening what is too harsh in Luther and clarifying what is unclear, especially since Luther can only be an imperfect tool chosen by Christ for him. If he wanted to correct Luther, he would only contribute to leading many away from sound doctrine and calling their enemies into action, where [children of God] should bear with one another. Whether in explaining the phrases used by Scripture or in correcting false interpretations of Scripture: he always strives to say only what others can bear, following the example of the Lord; he will never wage war against servants of the Lord. Should the [Confederates] respond to Luther, they should not forget that they are dealing with an important servant of God, that they should rather remember his view than his exuberant manner of speaking if they wish to correct something, that they should deal with the errors as with those of a father and not an enemy, that they should beware of judging Luther too harshly and present their opinion in a modest manner. Since Luther did not mention Bucer [in his writing], he wishes that [the Zurichers] do the same and not even mention him as a witness. If only the [Zurichers] could not be accused of a novelty, according to which Zwingli in heaven meets not only Abraham, Isaac, and the other saints but also Numa [Pompilius] and people like [P. Cornelius] Scipio [Africanus minor]! Bullinger should forgive the suffering and troubled Bucer and receive everything in love. He should also help Bucer fulfill his promise made shortly before in Baden[-Baden] to Ottheinrich [I of the Palatinate] by sending him the already printed parts of the "Bibliotheca [universalis]" by [Konrad] Gessner; Ottheinrich, who is moving to the Palatinate, plans to be useful to the church by establishing a library. Bucer regrets the satirical poem about [Andreas] Osiander; may he not attribute it to the [Confederates]! Greetings. As soon as the price of the "Bibliotheca" is known, the printer [Christoph Froschauer] will receive his money. Forgot the following: Luther's excommunication only applies to those who deny that Christ offers Himself in the Lord's Supper; since this is not the view of the [Confederates], they should not take the excommunication personally.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Your pious and true lamentation and mourning over the miseries we are in and the dangers that threaten us, which you wrote to me, venerable and dearest brother, has been read and pondered by me more than once, and not without my benefit, so that I might consider how greatly I ought to humble myself under the almighty hand of God and how diligently I should stand firm in every duty of piety, and thus also encourage others, whom I can, lest, if we persist in our tepidity and sloth with little amendment by these scourges, the Lord should continue to rouse us with heavier ones. For daily He applies more bitter scourges to us, and deservedly so, as we daily grow more sluggish in our security in sins, both public and private, and more lazily cease in every duty of piety towards God and charity towards our neighbors.</p>
      <p>The monarchs are now stirring up marriages, in the matter of the highest union - as they are perverse in all things - sowing the most atrocious and implacable wars. The Frenchman, like Moab, foolishly and ignobly boasts beyond his strength, not indeed of things, but of minds; the emperor compensates for what he lacks in strength in matters with audacity and fortune; not indeed to accomplish anything splendid, but to either devastate many things or dedicate them to the greed of his harpies. Both are vigorous satellites of the Antichrist and opponents of Christ. Daily, the cruelty, most savagely raging against the saints, increases; meanwhile, everything is filled with Epicureans.</p>
      <p>To these evils is now added the most pernicious scandal of the sacramentarian war, which has flared up again. Perhaps you have seen Luther's book "The Short Confession." Oh, how well this evil lay dormant; for although some evil smoke from it, not entirely extinguished, occasionally exhaled, yet it, being not widely spread, did not harm the eyes of many. Now the fire rages again clearly, and from it, the most foul smoke, most harmful to the eyes of faith, is driven into the faces of all. On both sides, it was sufficiently explained what the opinion of each side is, and the method of explaining even this mystery was pleasing; judgment could safely be left to those sitting; the triumphs are for Christ to decree.</p>
      <p>Satan tries to entangle and involve us in the snares of deadly disputes.</p>
      <p>It is known to all who are acquainted with his opinion that Luther contends for nothing more in this matter - however he may speak - than that the body and blood of the Lord are offered and received with the symbols. He imagines nothing of impanation, nothing of local inclusion; nothing that detracts even a little from the truth of human nature or heavenly glory. Meanwhile, he wishes to be free to use and speak of the communication of idioms as he does.</p>
      <p>If the form of speaking, which you gave in the Basel Confession, could have been retained and tolerated by you, which they use, and if there had been moderation both from the disparagement of these and from the sufficiently kind praises and so often repeated of yours, this storm would not have arisen. He cannot bear to be accused of placing the presence of the Lord, which drags Christ down from heaven or attaches something of this world to Him; then he will not accept the evil of our corrupted nature being minimized, except as proceeding from the spirit of the Antichrist, who tries to nullify the benefit of the incarnate and crucified Christ for us.</p>
      <p>These thousands of churches, persuaded about Luther, hold; those who think otherwise about him, believe me from experience, among those whom you would count among the children of God, are very few, although there are some here and there; but these either do not dare to speak among their own, or certainly, if they do not contain themselves, they only disturb, they do not edify. Since I had long known this and no reason remained to soften in Luther what is too harsh, and to explain what is obscure, I wholeheartedly wished and worked for this, that this man and servant of God (for I can judge nothing else about him) would not be provoked. Such a one Christ gave us; such a one He Himself uses and has used for His glory so splendidly, so widely, with all his infirmity and hardness tolerated.</p>
      <p>What then shall I do, I, a fellow servant, whom the Lord has placed at such a distance below him? For I know, if I attempt to correct in him what displeases, I will achieve nothing else than to provoke not only him but countless others with him, so that both their own and my ministry will be more grievously hindered, more will be alienated from sound doctrine, or certainly disturbed in it, and enemies will be more armed against us. The Lord has always exercised His own in this way, that they bear with the infirmity of others, nor has He given that all truths could be said everywhere and at all times. It can hardly be said how weak the faculty of judgment is in these matters even among the most learned in these things, as they seem.</p>
      <p>When indeed I use the forms of Scripture in explaining the mysteries of Christ and exclude absurd and false interpretations of the words of Scripture with clear interpretations, which they can bear, then, if I cannot correct something in others, I bear it, as the Lord Himself bears; I know I am engaged in my office with a safe conscience. Wherefore, let those fight who will not rest; I, with the ministers of the Lord, will never undertake any fight, with Christ helping me.</p>
      <p>To you, if you wish to respond to Luther, I pray to the Lord to grant you to recognize and in every writing religiously, consider that you are writing entirely to a great servant of God, and whom much more than you believe, those whom you would never doubt - if you knew them - count among true Christians, look up to and honor as the primary apostle and prophet of Germany, rather than the revoker of the Lord's flock to their shepherd Christ. Then, that you may estimate his hyperbolic words more from the meaning than the words, that you may prefer to have him - where he rightly thinks - as a supporter rather than an adversary. Then, that you may attempt to correct what must be corrected in him as the errors of a father rather than an enemy. You see all the antichrists attacking him first and most fiercely in the cause of Christ; may God avert that you would do with them. Finally, because you are hurt and human, may you consider that it is easy for you to judge Luther more harshly than is fitting!</p>
      <p>In commending your own, I hope likewise, and you will gladly maintain Christian modesty and prefer to seem to agree with the old and present church rather than to dissent.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I also pray and beseech you by Christ, do not touch our effort at reconciliation - because Luther did not touch it - nor do you touch it; for I would not wish even to be dragged into this dispute by the name of a witness, and that for many and just reasons. This fire must be contracted, not spread.</p>
      <p>Would that indeed that knot had not been objected to you, that Zwingli joined in heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and other saints, Numa, Scipios, etc.! From this and all new doctrines, I trust you will abstain.</p>
      <p>Forgive, forgive and pardon, my esteemed and truly dearest brother, that I have certainly been carried away in writing beyond my intention; certainly, I am not well with myself due to the torment and anxiety I am distracted by because of this revived sacramentarian fight, especially at this time so foreign to the church, which is otherwise endangered in so many ways. I love and honor you, otherwise, I would undoubtedly not be more troublesome to you with my letters; charity believes and bears all things; therefore, bear also this my writing.</p>
      <p>One thing I ask of you, my venerable brother, obtain for me from Dr. Gesner a part of his printed Library for Duke Ottheinrich, who has established a library, from which he wishes to know which books he should purchase; he will succeed here in the Palatinate electorate and is now wholly devoted to restoring the church, however much he has previously indulged his flesh in all things. I earnestly ask you to fulfill my promise here; for I promised him this of your kindness these days when I was with him in Baden.</p>
      <p>Would that the infamous and so impure poem against Osiander were neither written nor published by your people! Certainly, these things here contribute to all things of Christ being either despised or weakened on both sides. The reproof of sins, which is not also a confession of the glory of Christ and a remedy for brothers, is the work of the devil, not the spirit of Christ. But I know these things grieve you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ and hold us in the Lord as truly wishing you well and commend our ministry to the Lord in your prayers.</p>
      <p>I ask you to bid all known to me there to be well in my words. In Strasbourg, the day before the calends of November 1544.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>I will satisfy the printer for the Library as soon as the price is indicated. I had overlooked this: I understand Luther's anathema is only directed at those who stubbornly deny that Christ offers Himself in the sacred supper. I feel you are alien to this; therefore, in whomever he wishes to write it; then I know the just condemnation only adheres to those who are held guilty of the crime that is justly condemned.</p>
