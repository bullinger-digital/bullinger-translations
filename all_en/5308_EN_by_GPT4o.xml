      <p>S. D. The honorable lord and dearest brother, Mr. Coignet has ensured that your letters were delivered to me promptly and faithfully, to whom I am also sending these.</p>
      <p>Your last letter was written on April 25; I am writing this on May 3, in which I will briefly explain what happened at the Diet of Solothurn. Initially, royal letters were read requesting soldiers.</p>
      <p>The whole matter was presented, but in a way that seemed favorable to the Guise faction: they deny and strongly deny that the king is being held as if captured; they deny that Duke Guise brought foreign soldiers or came to Paris with hostile intent; they claim the king followed voluntarily.</p>
      <p>Then the delegates from Zurich and Bern were heard, who came to the Diet of their own accord, not having been invited; they requested that soldiers not be sent to France against France, but rather a delegation that would act not by force, but by persuasion and call the parties to concord. They thanked the two cities and promised to report the cities' requests to their lords, but would respond on May 18, unless the king pressed for soldiers in extreme necessity; then they would convene at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p>However, the more prudent believe that if Duke Guise insists, it will happen that they will send soldiers, both because they are very poor and greedy for money, and because they extremely hate the gospel and prefer war to peace. May the Lord restrain them and curb them with a bridle! The four cities wrote to the illustrious Prince of Condé and informed him of what was done at the Diet of Solothurn. They could not decide to send aid to Condé; for Basel and Schaffhausen are in alliance with the king.</p>
      <p>The other two free cities, Zurich and Bern, are in danger; for it is to be feared that from the common bailiwicks the greater part of the soldiers to be led into France must be sought, while the greater force of the Seven Cantons must be retained at home by the people of the mountains against us, as soon as soldiers from Italy join them, to be led out. You can hardly believe what plans have been pursued against us for several years, etc. The matter of Claron is not yet settled; but it is boiling very vehemently, and they are daily more fierce and furious. May the Lord restrain them and turn them to Himself by His grace! The four cities wrote to the Palatine, stating that such a great matter should be handled not by letters, but by delegations; they also informed him of what was obtained and done at the Diet of Solothurn; they further encouraged him to send a delegation. I write these things to your humanity a little more fully, so that you may not be ignorant of what was done at Solothurn and what the plans are. I hear from prudent men that they fear our people may neglect a just opportunity, delay too much, and give space to the adversaries to prepare and strengthen their affairs, and since our people are lacking money and perhaps provisions and are fighting at their own expense, the whole army may dissolve from weariness. They remember what happened to us in our unfortunate war, and what also happened to the Protestants in the German war.</p>
      <p>But if the Lord wills to have mercy on the churches, He will direct and prosper the plans. For which we continually pray to the Lord.</p>
      <p>It remains for me to explain to you, dearest brother, where the efforts of that noble man from Hallwyl have finally inclined. As soon as I heard that Duke Guise was in arms and was hastening to Paris even against the king's edict, I urged Hallwyl with very frequent messages and letters to provide for matters in time, so that if the princes requested cavalry and infantry to be sent to them, no delay would be introduced and cause harm. He did what he could faithfully and vigorously, not without his own expenses.</p>
      <p>Finally, however, not to weary you with many words, in a letter written to me on the last day of April, not without pain and indignation, he responds with frustrated expectation: "I find from the Alsatian Diet and the Zabernian conference, where the Guises conferred with the Duke of Württemberg, that the minds of the princes are completely alienated. Before this conference, those things were done with me which I requested, that you might inform the princes of France. I did not invent anything, but they were more vehement than I have recounted.</p>
      <p>Now, however, when I repeat these things and remind those whom they sent to me, they respond very coldly, completely changed." He sends a letter from a certain prominent person which is written in this sense: "I have been away for a long time on the prince's business, therefore I am only now responding. Louis of Bar, sent by Condé, did not come to Bruchsal to the princes, unless perhaps he secretly met with the Rhinegrave. Therefore, nothing was requested from the princes.</p>
      <p>Then it was indicated to my prince these days that the king is being held as if captive by the Guises. But with things standing thus and the king being in the hands of enemies, you understand that it would not be safe for my prince to gather an army or involve himself in a matter as if desperate, and with the head of the supporters of religion being so weak and destitute, and it not being possible to gather cavalry and infantry without sufficient money and pay. Therefore, to say it in one word, with things thus changed, I dare not promise you any aid." He writes this almost word for word from the court of a certain prince on April 26, to the nobleman from Hallwyl, who complains most grievously on this account, and cries out that the greatest injury is being done to him and his goods.</p>
      <p>He asks that I excuse him to you and the princes. He has done nothing here of his own accord or with malicious intent.</p>
      <p>In these difficulties, I do not think it advisable to reveal this treachery to the princes, but to indicate it on another occasion, unless you see it otherwise. I suspect, indeed I think I see, that these men do many unworthy things out of hatred for the purer doctrine. Which the Lord will require in His time.</p>
      <p>If we were to simply accept the Augsburg Confession, perhaps even then they would not faithfully help us.</p>
      <p>The Lord does not want us to depend on men, but on Himself alone. May He be present with us here and preserve us.</p>
      <p>These things trouble me greatly, but I pray the Lord to have mercy on us. I did not want you to be ignorant of these things.</p>
      <p>Use them well (if indeed there is any good use of them) according to your piety and prudence. I wrote this very hastily, so take it in good part.</p>
      <p>And if you receive any certain news about the affairs of France, continue to communicate it to us. For we are held here in great desire, we are anxious and troubled, praying the Lord not to forsake so many and such great churches, nor to deliver us into the hands of our enemies, who hate the Lord and want to trample the truth. Farewell, together with all the brothers and fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you together with yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 3, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, the one you know.</p>
      <p>Let me know, I beg you, whether these letters have been delivered to you promptly.</p>
      <p>I was not allowed to reread them.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, vigilant and faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his honorable and dearest lord and brother. [Geneva].</p>
