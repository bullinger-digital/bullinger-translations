    <p xml:id="regest1">Last summer, he had hoped to come to Zurich on his journey to [German-speaking Switzerland], but he was called back on the way; therefore, he now requests - encouraged by Grynaeus - a written response to his concern. He does not write about their situation, as the messenger, who is closely connected to him, will report on it verbally; he only wants to present one problem, which he also touched upon in his letter to Kaspar Megander: Together with many colleagues, he is deeply concerned about the widespread godlessness; although preaching has replaced the sacrificial system, the general disdain for religion means that the fruit is lacking, so that now God's wrath threatens even more. Why no improvement is achieved is unclear to him; in any case, church discipline should be reintroduced, but examples are lacking, and a return to the papist order is out of the question. Viret and his colleagues do not know how to proceed to introduce an order corresponding to the apostolic model, and therefore fear that their church could perish in indiscipline. He hopes for good advice, as similar thoughts are undoubtedly being considered in Zurich. Greetings to the Zurich pastors; his colleagues also send their regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I was glad that last summer I had the opportunity to travel to Germany, hoping that we would eventually reach you as well, where we had planned our journey, and that we might enjoy and delight in your presence and the delightful conversations with you and the many learned men who are there with you. But for some reason, we were called back midway, and thus our hope and desire were frustrated, which is why at present, since I was denied the chance to see and speak with you in person, I am compelled to make up for what I could not accomplish then, at least in some way, through letters. I write, not because I promise myself that you will derive any pleasure from such inept writings, or that any benefit will return to you from them, but because I am led by the hope that I might persuade myself to extract some letters from you by my importunity, which would refresh my spirit, and through the reading of which I might become more learned, and thus be affected so that I return to the study of piety more eager and ardent. I would undoubtedly be ashamed to so impudently interrupt and delay you, a man learned in every way, occupied with the most serious and weighty studies, with my trifles and nonsense, if they were not of some moment, and if they did not bring with them some serious matters. Therefore, relying on your humanity, which our mutual friend D. Grynaeus has commended to me with so many praises, and by whose impulse I have already begun to dare something with you, I will undertake to set forth those things about which I greatly desire to hear your opinion.</p>
      <p>I did not think it necessary to elaborate at length on the condition of our affairs, since the messenger, who I believe is unaware of nothing, will abundantly narrate it, as he is not only closely connected to me by the closest ties, but also conscious and participant of all our plans and thoughts. There is one thing in particular I would have liked to discuss with you: a matter I touched upon somewhat in my letters to D. Kaspar Megander.</p>
      <p>Most of us, and almost all who look deeper and consider more diligently how arduous this task is, which we lowly men perform, are held anxious and greatly disturbed by the great and grave cares, because the fruit of the gospel appears so rare, there is such contempt for the word and sacraments, such a lack of faith and charity, such security in sinning, no fear of God, no religion at all, so that we fear lest we gradually slip into a kind of atheism, once religion is erased from minds and all fear of God is cast off. For what has come to us from the overthrow of papism, we feel nothing else than that in place of that abominable slaughter of priests and execrable rites, we have sacred sermons, indeed a great and precious treasure, a happy exchange, unless the fruit we ought to have reaped from it is plucked and snatched away by the indolence of our people, and the impious and stubborn neglect of religion, so that I often think this light has shone upon us so that we may pay heavier penalties for our impiety and perfidy to an angry Lord. We all indeed wish for greater progress, greater growth and increase of piety: but we wish for nothing else. We deplore the iniquity of the times, but in the meantime, there is none of us who can remedy such great evils. I am quite uncertain whether this happens due to our fault, or the people's, or both, which I conclude is more probable. We were contemplating recalling some discipline into the church, which is so dissolved, for necessity compels us to do so: but what kind, we are not sufficiently certain. We do not sufficiently know which church's example we should propose to imitate: partly because it is not sufficiently clear by what institutions people live elsewhere, and by what discipline each is kept in duty, and partly because those churches are very rare in which the same diseases are not labored under and the same remedies are not needed. Furthermore, it is not easy to restore the old discipline, nor is it expedient, partly because it is not without its own faults, and contains many things which, as they somewhat depart from the purity of the apostles, cannot easily be brought back without danger to consciences and the appearance and suspicion of papism.</p>
      <p>We desire discipline, but as far as it can be done, the simplest, purest, and not deviating in any way from the apostolic model of truly apostolic men. But by what way we should approach this matter, where we should begin, whose labor, industry, faith, diligence, and favor we should use for this matter, what we should propose and deliberate, in such a storm of emotions, sinister suspicions, neglect of religion, is not sufficiently known to us.</p>
      <p>We feel and recognize the diseases, but the evil is stronger than the art and grows more and more every day, while no one applies a healing hand, no one is occupied in seeking antidotes, or if some do give their attention to it; they either delay too much or do not seem to act with the faith and diligence that the matter itself demands, and thus we always stick in the same mud and grow old, fearing nothing lest we leave the church to posterity entirely without discipline, wonderfully disturbed and scattered, which almost perishes before it is born. Therefore, I beseech you, relieve us of this trouble with some advice and admonition, and settle this disturbance.</p>
      <p>For there is no doubt that similar thoughts also exercise and agitate you, which is why I hope that I will receive no small assistance from your advice and admonitions. Please greet your colleagues and fellow ministers, brothers in the Lord, most esteemed by all of us, in my name. My colleagues and brothers who are with us greet you. Farewell excellently and take my loquacity in good part.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, February 20, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Peter Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished in piety and letters, D. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church. In Zurich.</p>
