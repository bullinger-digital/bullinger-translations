      <p>Greetings. Whatever I have, I wrote to my brother yesterday.</p>
      <p>He will communicate all of it to you, and I have nothing to add to it now, except that with these words of mine, I wanted to add confidence to those who carry them, to meet you more freely. For this they asked of me, although they are already known to you, the son of Robert Estienne and Engelbert Hess. Consul Steiger, Treasurer von Grafenried, Haller, Hagius, Pistorius, the Zehenders, my father-in-law, and finally my mother send you their greetings. May all of yours be well.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 6, 1562.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his honorable lord and most esteemed compatriot.</p>
