      <p>After offering my willing service, I inform you, dear Mr. Bullinger, that your letter dated September 23rd has reached me today. I have received the sent books with joy and find that the truth of Jesus Christ in the offering of the supper, that it is solely a nourishment for the soul, which is enjoyed through faith, is sufficiently declared before men with the use of bread and wine, praise be to God. Whoever does not want to believe in God the Lord and Christ himself, let them suffer the loss; we will gladly pray for them.</p>
      <p>Nothing more for now. Here we are satisfied with the open meal and words. May the Lord have mercy on us; pray; the axe is already at the tree.</p>
      <p>Be greeted from me, you and all yours, always entrusted to God the Lord; may He strengthen your faith and keep you until the end. Dated October 14, 1551. Augsburg.</p>
      <p>By your willing Hans Welser... to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger at hand.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
