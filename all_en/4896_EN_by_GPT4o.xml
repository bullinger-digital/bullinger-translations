      <p>Your letters, reverend father in Christ, have been delivered to me. As I was preparing to respond, behold, unexpectedly, Johannes Ziegler, your fellow citizen, arrived. Since I am dedicating all my efforts to him, I am compelled to be brief in my response. The news of your health was exceedingly pleasant to me; I pray to God that it remains perpetual and long-lasting. Regarding the council, I have nothing to write except that someone trustworthy from those neighboring parts reported to both consuls that about four bishops are already gathered in Trento, along with a papal legate in his sixties, but no other dignitaries. As for the Glarus matter, everything has been secretly written to our people; I have also read it. Good men complain about the seven arbitrating cantons, the seven Schiedorte, that they have written to the people of Glarus, wanting a governor who is agreeable and pleasing to the five cantons, thereby believing that the five cantons are strengthened in their misdeeds. God have mercy, that the matter is not understood.</p>
      <p>As for Milan, Hercules Gal from Constance arrives there these days; he says to the mayor and Gregorius Carli thus: King Philip sends six tons of gold to the Florentine, to pay the pledge of the lordship of Siena; for you know the same is Spanish. The Florentine is said to have lent the six tons of gold to Charles V, intending that he might thereby own them. But when Charles V passed away, he is said to have released them to his illegitimate son (known as Hans von Ã–sterreich).</p>
      <p>However, the Florentine is not willing to give up the lordship easily; therefore, King Philip sends 6000 Spaniards, so that if the Florentine does not wish to repay the sum, force may be used. Thus he says.</p>
      <p>But what if the five cantons had gained the upper hand and, since the Turk is not superior to Philip, there was some hope from there, and it was like a hidden feast? But I affirm nothing. I will advise our people to be vigilant, and indeed in a timely manner.</p>
      <p>This is written in haste; I have not reread it.</p>
      <p>Chur, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>We all wish you to be in good health.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, his lord and patron. In Zurich.</p>
