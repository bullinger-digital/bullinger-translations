      <p>S. The church of Locarno has written us truly mournful letters, to which we respond by encouraging them in the work of the Lord; we are sending these to you, asking that you forward them to someone known and faithful to you from that church. None of them are known to us by name; therefore, we could not address them to any of them specifically. Moreover, it was not very safe to send them to Baden to the envoys of our lords, lest by imprudence they fall into the hands of the impious and cause greater harm to good men. If you inform us who among them is of some renown, you will do us a favor; we will be able to write to him in the future. I do remember the schoolmaster of Locarno, I believe, a learned man who was once here with us; but his name has completely slipped my mind in the meantime.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the magnificent senate has temporarily received Mr. Emanuel Tremellius, a truly pious man of admirable learning; I think he is otherwise known to you. Having become a Christian from circumcision 12 years ago, he moved from Ferrara, where he was born, to Strasbourg; there, he taught the holy language for six years and later devoted himself to other disciplines. Afterwards, he followed Fagius to England and was appointed in his deceased place, teaching in Cambridge for the same number of years. Now, cast out by the common fate with others, he has come here recommended by Calvin, Viret, Beza, and others.</p>
      <p>The Lord, beyond our expectation, has moved the hearts of our princes to receive him for the use of our school; we therefore hope that great benefit will return to us all from him.</p>
      <p>He is most learned in Greek and Latin beyond the common custom of the Jews and is very practiced in every kind of grammar. Mr. Musculus cannot commend his learning enough. I inform you of this so that you may congratulate us on such progress in our school; for we now have not a few men of distinguished learning. All of mine are well and greet you and yours, whom I also wish to be safe. Bern, June 17, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Before I sealed this, I received yours dated June 12 and will take care of those you sent along with it.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his lord and venerable compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
