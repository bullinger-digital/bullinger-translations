      <p>S. Your letters and those of Mr. Beza have given me great pleasure, as they have given me hope that an opportunity has been provided to open the door to the kingdom of Christ. What our people will write back to your senate, I do not know, and I wish that we do not want to be too wise in this matter, in which the work of a faithful case can be of no use. Regarding the books written by the Italian, containing some prodigious things about the miracles of Christ, I know nothing at all, nor about the one said to be titled "On the Greatness of God's Grace," unless perhaps it is understood to be the one published by our Coelius Secundus, not here with us, but elsewhere, nor, as far as I know, is it available for sale here.</p>
      <p>We have long advised the printers not to publish anything not approved by the censors, and as you write, I greatly fear that if the senate receives any negative reports from our workshops, it will result in prejudice, which will also cut off the opportunity for printing other and even the best works. You happily report the pious benevolence of Prince Christoph and others towards our churches; whom I pray Christ the Lord may increase and grant peace in Him. I have diligently dealt with the matter of your wife's brother; but as yet no solid hope appears, and I am compelled to seek a way elsewhere as well, as much as I can, not to fail the good man. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 24, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
