    <p xml:id="regest1">Presumably, Bullinger has received Serin's letter from August 5 [No. 2527]. Since Bullinger's letter [from June 18; not received] was delivered by Wilhelm [Reublin], Serin has not received another one. This is no wonder given Bullinger's heavy workload! The current traveler [...] offers Serin the unexpected opportunity to write briefly and gives the bearer a good reason to meet Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The current reports are new and therefore not verified. Rarely are noteworthy, reliable news spread, and when they are, they are no longer new. Serin only has to report that a large army from the Netherlands is coming against the [Schmalkaldic League] and has allegedly already crossed the Rhine; furthermore, that Swiss and other soldiers are marching against this army, and that between Regensburg and Ingolstadt the [Schmalkaldic League] and the Imperial forces will soon clash.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Serin is surprised that the two Zurichers [Meinrat Oggenfu√ü and Hans Hug] did not bring a response for him upon their return from Moravia, contrary to their promise. Bullinger should inquire from them (especially from "Meyerath") the reasons for this and inform him. Perhaps they do have something to convey. One of the two is a glassmaker; the other is a day laborer in the butcher and cooper trades. The latter calls himself "Meyerath," a name not common in [Southern Germany], which Serin remembered when reading the letter of recommendation created by the Zurich council to those in Moravia.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings. Bullinger and his colleagues should pray for the [Schmalkaldic League]. The danger is great and imminent!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The letter bearer [...] said he has compatriots and a friend who is a doctor in Zurich. He will thus already be recommended to them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger should inform whether he has received the present letter and the one from August 5.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- One more thing, which perhaps is not to be shared with everyone: News has just come that Emperor [Charles V] is moving from Regensburg against the [Schmalkaldic League]. If some are frightened, it would indeed be appropriate if the Swiss finally fulfilled the following, almost sibylline oracle: "A cow will bellow on the Ulm Danube Bridge, and it will sound as if one were standing in the middle of Helvetia." This is currently spreading among the people. Through God's mediation, the [Schmalkaldic League] hopes for a great deal of help from the Swiss.</p>

      <p>S. On the fifth of this month, I also sent you a letter, most esteemed sir, and I assume you have already received it. However, since the letter brought by Wilhelm, I have not received any from you, which I do not find surprising considering your holy duties. Furthermore, since a suitable messenger happened to be available, and I wanted to do you a favor by writing through him, so that he might have a more convenient opportunity to visit you and be somewhat more recommended to you, I could not refrain from sending you my greetings in my dedication to you.</p>

      <p>Regarding the news, it is such that, while they are new, they are mostly uncertain. Those who are certain of matters worth writing about rarely share them with the public. However, what is already certain is no longer new. Therefore, nothing comes to mind now, as I write in haste, that I would consider not omitting, except that a large army from our Lower Germany is advancing against us, and it is said to have already crossed the Rhine. But your Swiss, along with others, are said to be going to meet them, and then our forces are expected to clash with the Imperial forces these days, perhaps between Regensburg and Ingolstadt. May the Lord confound the enemies of His church. But hey, Bullinger, these are indeed new developments!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am quite surprised that those two citizens of yours returned from Moravia and did not bring me any response, as they had promised to do so when I earnestly requested it. I therefore ask you to find out from them what prevented them from fulfilling this duty, especially the one named Meyerath, and then inform me, even if only briefly. Perhaps they still have something to convey to me through you. One is a glassmaker, the other a day laborer in the butcher and cooper trades, etc., and, if I am not mistaken, he is known among us by the unfamiliar name Meyerath; for I seem to have read such a name in the letters of recommendation to the Moravians, which he had from your council.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell with all the brothers, most learned and kind Bullinger, and diligently commend us, who face great dangers at our doors, to the Lord in prayer, and also urge the brothers to do the same.</p>

      <p>In Ulm, August 25, 1546. The messenger said he has some compatriots and a certain doctor friend in Zurich. If this is the case, he will undoubtedly be well recommended to them. If you are going to reply, let me know whether you have received both this letter and the one I sent on the fifth of this month. These matters may not be for everyone's ears.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>At this hour, news has come that the Emperor has left Regensburg and is advancing towards us with his army. And if fear seizes some, they consider it most advisable to become Swiss, so that finally a certain Sibylline oracle might be fulfilled: "A cow will bellow on the Danube Bridge in Ulm, and it will be heard in the middle of Helvetia." But I only hear this from the common people. Certainly, our people hope for great help from the Swiss through the mediation of the Lord of Hosts and place great trust in them as instruments of the Lord.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Yours,</p>
      <p>Leonhard Serin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the Zurich church and beloved brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
