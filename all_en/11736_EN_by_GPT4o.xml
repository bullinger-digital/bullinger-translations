      <p>Dear godfather, I am sending you herewith the document you requested; however, it is not as clear as you desired. You only have the year in which the monastery was handed over to my lords, but not the month. We did not record it at the beginning, but simply dealt with our lords in good faith. If you need anything further, let me know; what is superfluous, discard.</p>
      <p>With that, may God protect you.</p>
      <p>Dated November 18, 1542.</p>
