      <p>Grace of Christ be with you. In the month of October, I had sent a letter to you, most learned Bullinger, informing you of what transpired at the wedding of our illustrious prince. But since the person I entrusted it to, a citizen of Colmar, had promised to deliver it to Basel within eight days, he changed his mind: he returned the letter and the things I now send. Nor could I immediately send it through another, due to prolonged illness and the inconveniences of old age, which have severely burdened me throughout the winter months. But now I am breathing a little easier, and on the first day of this month, I ascended the pulpit as usual and barely fulfilled my duty. Pray for me to the Son of God, my Bullinger, that in His usual mercy, He may free me, now sufficiently mature in age, from this present wicked world. It is enough for me. However, I do not wish to stubbornly resist the divine will, to which all things are subject. I desire to depart and be with Christ. A good cool earth would be my best medicine, etc.</p>
      <p>Your son Wilhelm, along with Dasypodius and Master Prothasius Sopher, and other young men, greeted me on the day of the prince's wedding, namely the 11th of September, before the church when I was about to preach. I instructed them to meet me after the sermon. They neglected to do so, and while we were going to the banquet, the master of the court, whom I had informed that there were students from Strasbourg present, had ordered them to be invited to lunch. I sent one or two of the brothers to look for them; for we ministers were all present from the countryside; but they were nowhere to be found. The next day, by chance, I ran into your son, who was in the court, watching a foot tournament of lancers and swordsmen. I asked them to come to my house, so they would not be harmed in the noise of the horsemen. All the brothers were present in my house. Otherwise, besides them, no foreigner had been imposed on me. Then your son said that he was ready to leave with the others, and after the tournament, he would immediately depart with the company to SÃ©lestat. After that, I did not see him. I now send you through this Jacob the names and gifts of the nobles, with which they enriched the poor prince; when there is time, about the rest, etc. The state of the church is quite peaceful, except that the people of Ensisheim, driven by fury, have prohibited the Senn market, where our butchers have hitherto bought cattle and livestock to feed us, during these so-called days of Lent; we survive on fish, sparrows, salted herrings, and other salted foods.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a certain good preacher, Jacob Spaler from Freiburg, who, having left his mistress and bidding farewell to the mass in November, married a virgin in February, on the last night of the same month under the shining moon, with thirty horsemen and some foot soldiers surrounding the house, they took the good man along with his wife with great insults to Ensisheim into a very dark prison. After a few days, they released the wife, calling her a mistress, divorced her from the man, and banished him from the dominion of King Ferdinand without the house - as they call it - of Austria.</p>
      <p>They led Master Jacob, bound in chains, in a carriage to the great terror of the spectators to Caiaphas of Basel, Bruntrut. There he is kept in prison. The village where he was captured is under the dominion of Rappoltstein, proper, not a fief, called Heitersheim, adjacent and bordering us, etc. Therefore, the adversaries threaten us with great things. We pray continually for the liberation of the good man, or that he may become a witness to the truth with a steadfast martyrdom. Pray for us as well. We hear that Satan is becoming more aggressive and that the papists around us are again raising their crests; they seem to be nurturing a monster.</p>
      <p>They said there was a truce between the Emperor and the French. Yet the French centurions are again recruiting an army and daily large numbers cross the Vosges freely. What will happen, time will tell, etc. Perhaps I will give you more detailed information through our Heinius, who will visit you while digging with us during the Easter holidays, etc. - I received your booklets, and I give great thanks, about which through Heinius, kindly consider my immodest talkativeness. If I have committed a barbarism, you correct it. For by the evening lamp, when I returned from Nicholas Regius, who is lying mortally ill; may the Lord restore him to us. Pray for us, etc. - Our people greet you.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, March 22, around the tenth hour of the night, 1556. Yours sincerely, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in doctrine and piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zurich in the primary city of the Swiss, his lord and patron to be respected.</p>
