      <p>I received your letter, noble and esteemed sir, written on the 27th of October of the past year, only at the end of February this year, along with several German booklets by Schwenckfeld and some Latin ones by Cratoald. Where they have been hiding in the meantime for such a long time, I do not know at all.</p>
      <p>However, I thank you for the booklets and the image of Schwenckfeld that you sent, and as a token of gratitude, I am sending back this booklet of mine, which I published a few days ago. You ask that I read and examine all those booklets.</p>
      <p>But I am so overwhelmed with private and public affairs that I can promise nothing here.</p>
      <p>Books are sent from elsewhere, and indeed daily, more than enough for many to read, let alone me, already worn out by long labors, who cannot fulfill the requests without compromising my function, to which I am called. I do not think I am sinning against God or against charity. I am certain that the most illustrious man, Mr. Vadian of blessed memory, has not changed his opinion against Schwenckfeld, as I have been more familiar with him than you, if I may say so with your permission, or anyone else. All who can rightly distinguish between theology and philosophy agree with me that his books, written for this reason, both in Latin and German (for we have not written any here, as is falsely reported about us), are not philosophical but truly theological. I could hardly respond to this through my affairs; however, so that I would not respond with nothing, I wanted to write these few things. I pray that you consider them kindly; I also pray to the Lord to open your eyes and those of the whole world to see and do what is His will, and to have mercy on us all.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zürich, March 3, 1559.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich. To the noble man Mr. Johannes Wilhelm von Laubenberg residing in Wagegg, his esteemed lord, greetings and respects.</p>
