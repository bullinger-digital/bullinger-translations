      <p> Greetings. I easily recognize (reverend father in Christ) that you do not share your letters and especially those of such a subject with just anyone, and I indeed take it in that direction and understand well enough how much I owe to you and yours, and for how many reasons. I have noted what I deemed should be published; I return each item with utmost faith. I have solemnly entreated Johannes Heinrich, the son of Konrad Clauser, who stayed with me for two days and used my hospitality, to deliver this packet to you personally. He seems to be a modest young man and endowed with such judgment that such things can be safely entrusted to him. I will take the utmost care to send letters to the illustrious man, Mr. Martinengo, as soon as I find trustworthy people, and I will also add what I have noted from the letters; for I understand that you wish it so, those things indeed that are to be made public. The letters of that noble lady brought tears to my eyes. I congratulate my homeland on having such a woman; for Rapperswil, my homeland, is as far from Wädenswil as it is from Zürich, or perhaps a bit more; it is certainly a half-hour journey. I knew they were deprived of the male sex; I know that from this family, they presided over the Ensisheim council, not sufficiently favorable to our religion; thus, I fully understood the subject of the letter. It was also pleasing to inspect the letters of our excellent old man Erbius, whom I truly did not know was still alive. I have written a few things to him, informing him of my condition, and since I have no other to whom I can give them, I send them to you. If you ever include them in yours to him, you will have added to your other benefits towards me. Bolviler is indeed found to have not even a crumb of brains. Thus, what Athanasius predicted about Julian, I can repeat here, that this tyrant is a little cloud that will soon pass. But I have not yet sufficiently understood to which jurisdiction the little town of St. George belongs. Now I have received nothing at all from Mr. Martinengo. Clauser's son came directly from Trento; you can inquire from him if he has anything. But he seems to have nothing beyond hearsay. The head of this college has passed away, with whom many practices and tricks are buried together. Because I foresaw his death, for I had learned from the doctors that he could not survive long, I took the opportunity to admonish our people in a sermon that it is not permissible for a Christian to attend papal funerals, because in them, as in a cesspool, papal superstitions converge, and then especially the saying of Christ applies: "Let the dead bury their own dead." These and other things. But nonetheless, Consul Ambrosius and some other members of the senatorial order attended the funeral in his favor, etc. These are the things, reverend father in Christ, that I have now deemed should be written. I am glad that you and yours are well, and I pray to God that He may keep you safe for us for a long time. Farewell. </p>
      <p> Chur, August 30, 1563. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most reverend father in Christ. Zürich. </p>
