    <p xml:id="regest1">The messenger as well as Bullinger's preceding letter give him reason to trouble him with this writing. Thanks for the book ["The Christian Marriage"]. Quotes a section about the eating of the body of Christ in the Lord's Supper from an earlier letter of Bullinger's and praises again the clarity of his statement. Has heard of a letter from Bucer to Comander, in which Bullinger is sharply attacked; is willing to provide him with a copy so that he can defend himself against it, but asks him to do so with restraint. Hopes for a change of mind of the Bernese pastors [Peter Kunz and Sebastian Meyer], after he was able to speak with them, and will soon report whether their attitude has really changed.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, most honorable man.</p>
      <p>After dinner, the public notary came to me and asked if I had anything to write to you, that I might give it to him to deliver. Therefore, I did not want to refuse his kind invitation, even though I know you are occupied with very serious matters, so that I would consider it uncivil to interrupt you and bother you with my trifles, especially since your letter has encouraged me to respond, so that if my letter reaches you at an inopportune time, it would be your fault, not mine.</p>
      <p>I give you immense thanks for the booklet you sent me. It is not possible for me to repay such generous munificence, nor to return the favor, as nothing has ever been more pleasing to me than such a paper gift, elaborated from the treasury of more profound theology, etc.</p>
      <p>The words about the Lord's Supper, which you wrote to me in your previous letters, are these: "I am indeed sorry that N. refers everything to some substantial use, when they could have been content with the commendation of the eating of the true body of Christ. We eat the body of the Lord not fictitious or painted, fantastic or poetic, but true, as it was truly born of the Virgin, suffered, resurrected, and ascended into heaven; but to eat is to believe, to believe is not merely to think or imagine, but to enjoy the present reality, to be affected, to be satisfied.</p>
      <p>The centurion in the Gospel believed and felt the healing present in the boy, although Christ never physically entered his house. Those who believe in Christ, true God and man, truly eat the whole Christ, they transfer him entirely into themselves so that he lives in them and they in him, not only bodily, but by divine power and operation. Therefore, the pious feel security, and that security is satisfaction. This is the true eating of Christ; the external supper is a symbol of this, a remembrance of the Lord's death, an exercise and refreshment of this faith, a thanksgiving for the gifts of God received. Why then is there a need to involve the minds of the pious so that they finally do not know what the supper is or what it is to eat Christ? And the ancients, for the evidence of holy truth, used the terms 'sign', 'signify', 'sacraments are mysteries and symbols', etc." These are the commendable things in your letters, which I cannot sufficiently extol with praises, so weighty are they in the substance of things and so charming and fluent in the elegance and readiness of words, etc.</p>
      <p>I have heard, dearest brother in Christ, about a certain letter to Comander, in which Bucer lightly attacks and gnaws at you. If you have a copy of it, well, then you can look after yourself and clear your name; if not, I will ensure that a copy is transcribed for me, which I will send to you. It pains me that the spirit of some is so impotent and suspicious that they seize upon everything in the worst light.</p>
      <p>I wish that learning and eloquence were applied to something other than the destruction and ruin of a brother. I cannot sufficiently lament such malice, which desires that brothers who have deserved so well of the Christian cause, lest anything of their own fame should perish, even if it is deservedly so, be almost crushed and exterminated or at least convicted of error in open and exposed truth. But it befits a Christian, however the world may tumult, to stand unshaken and not be moved, and so a just and steadfast man of purpose is not shaken in mind by any heat, committing his business to God and hoping that we, harassed under the cross by calumnies however virulent, will finally escape in the humility of patience to a joyful and desired success. If you wish to clear your name, be careful not to depart from your usual gentleness of words; this will be most pleasing to the reader, who is led by no affections, and will be seen as worthy of praise by posterity, etc.</p>
      <p>I hope here among our local preachers and feel a better spirit than they have hitherto displayed; friends have conferred with me more than once, and as much as I can, I soften and decline the conceived opinion. But in these days I will try and hear, God willing, what they have brought forth and whether my hope will not be disappointed, and whatever happens, I will write to you soon.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily. Greet, I pray, the entire college of doctors. Given in Bern, late at night, Palm Sunday in the year 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours, Eb. von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother in Christ and always to be respected master. Master Heinrich Bullinger, Zürich, preacher.</p>
