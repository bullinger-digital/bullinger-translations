    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians has satisfied him. With God's help, may Bullinger also complete the commentary on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians and continue his work with further writings, which are eagerly awaited. Mutual encouragement is beneficial. Melander fears the ruthlessness of the Lutherans. The Reformation has been introduced in Augsburg. Melander wanted to thank Bullinger with a gift, but Christoph Froschauer refused to take it. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ.</p>
      <p>By the gift of the most good and great God, you have satisfied both me and all the pious and studious, most learned Bullinger, with your most learned interpretation of the Corinthians. We will pray with common vows to the Lord, that you may also happily complete the other and remaining works, which you promise for the progress of the church, with the spirit of Christ. For as your writings are approved by the learned, so what you meditate on is eagerly awaited. Therefore, proceed bravely. Christ, whom you serve, will one day reward your labors. But why do I urge one who is already running? I do not at all doubt that you will continue to do what you are doing. However, I do not consider it useless that we encourage each other with mutual letters, so that our fervor in the work of the Lord may grow and our spirit may revive in affliction. For the kingdom of Satan, dearest brother, as you know, is not yet defeated. Therefore, some efforts of our labors must still be added for a while, until he who has hitherto persecuted us is forced to depart without feathers. May the Lord grant peace to His church and a stable course in known truth. I fear the stubborn wickedness of the Lutherans. They want to be the rulers of our faith.</p>
      <p>They seek security for themselves from the princes of this world, even if it is with the complete destruction of others. But it is well. There is a God in heaven, who providently cares for all things. Whether all adversaries wish it or not, nothing else will ultimately happen than what the infallible divine judgment will one day expose to the eyes of mortals as the most certain disposition of things. Meanwhile, let us care for the will of the Lord. Let us seek the one kingdom of Christ, fearless and tireless, certain that the divine power of truth will surpass everything.</p>
      <p>The people of Augsburg, thanks be to Christ, have finally obtained at least some divine inspiration and the splendor of better things through the uniform delivery of sermons and the closure of private sacred buildings. Everything could have been removed altogether, which all good people would have wanted removed, if it had not been for the excessively timid cowardice of the leaders.</p>
      <p>The judgment, which they call, of the imperial chamber continues to vigorously attempt everything against us because of the abolished papism, so that matters may again come to restitution. In this, the emperor is appealed to, the princes are invoked, the loss of privileges is threatened to the city: In sum, the evil enemy does not cease today to exert his strength. Therefore, only constancy is needed, without which all virtue will be vain and fleeting. Therefore, I urge you and yours in the Lord, that you may obtain for your church the presence of God the Father through your prayers according to His promise to us.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I wanted to express my gratitude towards you or your wife with some small gift. But Christoph Froschauer refused to deliver it to you by all means. Therefore, if you desire anything from me, command boldly and you will find me most obedient. Therefore, most excellent and beloved Bullinger, farewell very well in the Lord with your whole household, and greet your brothers and all your fellow ministers, especially the venerable Pellican and the most learned Bibliander, most dutifully in my name. May the Lord be present to your ministry with His Holy Spirit. Pray for us and our church, which we also diligently do for you.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, 17th of September, in the year of salvation 1534.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness,</p>
      <p>Dionysius Melander.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, most esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
