      <p>Greetings. At this very moment, most esteemed father, as I receive your letters, a former fellow citizen of your city, who is now one of ours, comes to me and inquires if I were to write any letters. I quickly seize the pen and write these brief words, and I cannot quite marvel enough that my lengthy letters to the most distinguished treasurer have not been delivered. I bundled them all into one package, and I do not know what the cause of this loss is, which, however, can hardly be called a loss. I do not wish to write anything more about our current affairs now. You have received a response from the Thusis judgment and our communities, which our messenger Johannes Mösle brings to the Swiss envoys. I hope this is acceptable to all of you! I saw no fragments inserted in your letters. But that matters little; for I fully intend to extricate myself and find peace, as I see no greater favor.</p>
      <p>I know who that obscure preacher is; he is a man of integrity and moderate learning. They would not have tolerated the man's peevishness for long if he had been the author of some evil. You do not know the customs and characters of our people. Most communities lack the service of ministers, which is not at all necessary for us. More on other matters another time. 1573, the last day of May.</p>
      <p>Most submissive to your eminence, Tobias Egli. To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord.</p>
