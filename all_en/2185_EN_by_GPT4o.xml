      <p>Greetings. I received your letters along with your book, which I read immediately.</p>
      <p>Although many have written on the same subject, you seem to me to have explained the abundance of faith, as you call it, in good works more thoroughly and clearly than all the others. This matter, when well understood, removes not only all controversy but also the eagerness for disputing. You know that these arguments are always on the lips of those who dispute: "Therefore, it is in vain to do good, in vain to follow the commandments, the promise of reward and merit is empty," etc. See how much I value making it known even in Rome that you not only encourage good works but also teach the inseparable connection of them with faith and the justice that comes from it: I sent your book to Cardinal Bellay. I have some business there.</p>
      <p>You will see what I have replied, and yet I am ashamed. Oh, the times! But more marvelous is the counsel of God, who allows us to be sifted (to use the word of Scripture) more and more. If you write to Vergerio, give him my regards. I will not burden you with letters or anything else in the future; I know your occupations, and there is no need to trouble you. Many in the king's cause think ill of the pope.</p>
      <p>I believe you have heard that part of England is already in turmoil. If there is anything new, I will inform you. Things are still very well in Corsica. Farewell. Chur, February 11.</p>
      <p>Your Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, dearest friend.</p>
