      <p>Furthermore, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, regarding what you write about me diligently recommending to you the case of our very reverend Lord Bartholomäus von Salis, indeed I did what I ought to have done, and now also, as much as I can, I recommend him, since that good man, in my judgment, has been harassed and provoked in unworthy ways, as you have perhaps heard more extensively from me and from others.</p>
      <p>What I hinted at in my last letter has indeed happened. For Bishop Beatus and his three commissioners, elected from among our people to resolve the bishops' differences, have sent the entire process of the case to the most illustrious council of Zürich, urging and even demanding with the bishop himself that a decisive judgment be made by the Swiss Cantons, and this has been communicated by the aforementioned Lord Consul to the other three commissioners elected by Lord Bartholomäus von Salis, requesting that they also put in writing what they think should be judged in the case and send it to him, so that once this is done, the same illustrious Lord Consul may consult all the other Swiss Cantons, so that an end may be put to the case.</p>
      <p>I absolutely believe that Lord Bartholomäus will respond to these matters, and no less also his elected arbitrators; for the reason they have not sent the process of the case or what they further think should be judged, as I wrote before, is that the arbitrators elected by Bishop Beatus did not want to use the authority given to them to judge, but refused to pass judgment, whereas those elected by Lord Bartholomäus, eager to settle all disputes, offered themselves to judge what was just. Therefore, when these same six commissioners were about to leave with the matter unresolved, some magistrates and certain distinguished men of the League of God's House, who were then found in Chur, after holding a council on the matter, decreed and also informed the parties that they should not further promote the case under oath until it is declared at the next assembly by God's House what authority those six commissioners have in proceeding and judging the said case. Therefore, neither the reverend Lord Bartholomäus nor his elected arbitrators, given the prohibition made to them by God's House, could or should have written anything to Zürich; for Lord Bartholomäus has always acquiesced to the counsels of God's House in this matter, nor is it permissible to depart from them now without his singular loss or the offense of God's House, although I have no doubt that even after the assembly of God's House and all its efforts, which will aim to have the commissioners gather again and decide the case, it will eventually happen that the Swiss Lords will pass their judgment, from which Lord Bartholomäus does not at all shrink; but it will be done at least in such a way that Lord Bartholomäus does not incur the indignation of God's House nor appear to oppose its mandates. These things, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, if you ever meet the most illustrious Lord Consul of Cham, I would like you to report to his eminence and recommend Lord Bartholomäus to him, especially to extend the case until God's House convenes, so that the whole matter may be settled at last without the offense of God's House, and indeed I trust that this can be easily obtained from him through your intercession.</p>
      <p>It has been rumored that the King of France still wants to recruit soldiers among us. However, I think this is fictitious; indeed, I wish our people to be exempt from such military service, since they say the king wants to use the service of our soldiers (which I do not entirely believe) to provoke the religion they call Lutheran.</p>
      <p>In Samaden, on the first day of September 1567.</p>
