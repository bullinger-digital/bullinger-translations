      <p>Greetings. After thoroughly reading your letter from the day before yesterday in our assembly, most esteemed brothers, there was no one among us who did not agree with your serious and prudent advice regarding the meeting of the three churches. And when we reported to our most honorable council yesterday what you thought, the response was that your opinion was so pleasing that nothing could be added. Therefore, it remains that as little delay as possible is interposed, since, even if we hurry as much as possible, the deliberation still seems to be late. Farewell, most esteemed brothers, may the Lord Jesus confirm and preserve us all in His work! Geneva, January 8, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Beza, in the name and by the mandate of the entire assembly of brothers. So that time is not wasted by sending messages back and forth, we have written to the Bernese brothers, so that, unless they have taken a different decision, they may set a day for both parties on which we may meet them.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servants of Christ, the faithful pastors and teachers of the Zürich church, brothers most esteemed by us in the Lord. Zürich.</p>
