      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear and special one. We have received your letter along with the enclosed news, which we hereby return to you, for which we also express our gracious thanks for your and both mayors' wishes for a new, prosperous year; may the Almighty graciously and successfully grant us all such.</p>
      <p>We have especially gladly received the little book and treatise, if only we had enough time to read through it, and we would very much like to have two more of them.</p>
      <p>The other news you wrote to us, we have graciously and gladly heard (even though we had it before). We hereby send you a little new news, which we received eight days ago, which we do not want to withhold from you out of [gracious] intention. Dated Schaffhausen, January 9th, in the year etc. 52.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] o[f] Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear special Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
