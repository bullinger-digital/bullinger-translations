      <p>Praise to God alone! Straßburg, 29th October 1548. Greetings and peace in Christ Jesus our Savior!</p>
      <p>Your letter dated the 20th of this month partly cheered me and partly caused me sorrow. That you and yours are well, dearest Bullinger, was a great cause of joy: however, the fact that the people of Konstanz have acted so unjustly towards themselves and God Almighty is a source of great sadness. The state of our England is such that I can neither greatly praise nor greatly criticize it. The opinion of a more sincere and purer religion has begun to flourish happily; but Satan, who is hostile to this, has tried to disturb everything with dissension.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Canterbury, undoubtedly moved by the counsel of Peter Martyr and other Lutherans, ordered a catechism of some Lutheran opinion to be translated into our language and published. This booklet has caused no small amount of dissension; so much so that among the common people, there have often been fights over differing opinions, even during the sermons themselves.</p>
      <p>Moved by this dissension, the nobles have convened a synod of bishops to deliberate on religion. May God grant that they do not produce some monstrosity! So much for religion.</p>
      <p>An English army of about thirty thousand men set out for Scotland last month, at whose arrival the French fled back to their France. In our strait, several of our ships encountered them and captured a galley from the French, today called a galley, equipped with three hundred soldiers, as well as several other ships, which they brought into the port of Calais. There is a rumor here that the French have taken away the Queen of Scotland; but I have nothing certain about this from England. The French threaten war against the English; what will happen is unknown. If any nation is treacherous, it is France, which will someday receive the reward for its treachery; I have no doubt.</p>
      <p>Straßburg remains in the same state as before and is not changed in any way. If bad morals can be changed into good ones, there is no doubt that we would have a gracious God and Father in heaven. The preachers cry out most vehemently; but, although they shout until they are hoarse, they achieve little purity.</p>
      <p>However, we have many good and honest people. In one respect, Straßburg is certainly most fortunate, that the nobles and the wealthier have mostly left it. May the Lord God be gracious to us! Pray for this our church; for we need your constant prayers and those of your entire church. I will faithfully ensure that the letters you sent are conveyed to England. May the Lord preserve you and your city!</p>
      <p>Endeavor, as you are accustomed, to root out vices, so that we may have a gracious God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. My wife sends her most dutiful greetings to you and your entire family. You will pray for all things holy and happy for them in my name. Greet all the faithful. Farewell. Given as above. Johannes a Lasco, very similar to you, a man endowed with all learning and piety, is in England.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Burcher.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a prudent and learned man, a much-esteemed friend.</p>
