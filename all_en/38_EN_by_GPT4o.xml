    <p xml:id="regest1">There will be no general council, not even a national one! The negotiations undertaken by Emperor Charles V in this regard can be found in the enclosure [not preserved]. The discord [between the Emperor and Pope Paul III] is welcome to Vadian because God has thereby snatched the general council from this Roman monster [the papacy], so that the Gospel cannot be further harmed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">There is a rumor circulating that [the imprisoned] Landgrave Philip of Hesse has been taken to Spain, while negotiations are still ongoing at the imperial court on how to proceed with [the also imprisoned] Duke Johann Friedrich I of Saxony. Charles V holds the status of such great princes in such low regard compared to his own! What kind of appreciation will then be given to the Swiss Confederates, after he has once again subjugated them (for which he has already cleared a stone from the path)!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Vadian is sending along letters for the [former] bailiff [of the Rheintal Four Courts] Hans Vogler the Elder and for Francisco de Enzinas, which have been entrusted to him for forwarding. Bullinger is asked to take care of this. The letter to Enzinas should be sent with a trustworthy messenger to Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Vadian is eagerly awaiting news from the Baden Diet, provided there is something that can be entrusted to friends. In St. Gallen, there is talk of a dispute between King Henry II of France and the Swiss Confederates, which Vadian does not find credible. For neither can the French king do without the protection of the Swiss soldiers, nor can the Swiss Confederates enter into a more reliable alliance with another king. Bullinger should share verified news [from the Diet]. Vadian will discuss this only with the St. Gallen council, but with no one else, no matter how trustworthy! Bullinger will also learn some things from the Zurich mayor [Johannes Haab] that cannot be entrusted to everyone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. There has been a decision regarding the general council. For not even a national one can be hoped for amidst such upheavals. I am sending you an example of the matters conducted by the Emperor in this cause. And the discord is very pleasing to me, by which the Lord has snatched this Roman monster away, so that greater fires of persecution against the Gospel do not threaten than before.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>There is a rumor that the Landgrave of Hesse has been taken to Spain and is being debated at the Emperor's court, to determine where the Saxon should be sent. He holds the authority of such great princes in such contempt compared to his own. What place do you think he will hold us in, if (as one stone is already being rolled!) all our freedom is taken away and we are finally sent under the yoke?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am sending letters to Hans Vogler the Elder, one to Francisco de Enzinas, entrusted to me to ensure they are delivered as diligently as possible. Therefore, make sure, excellent man, that Vogler receives his and that the others, which are addressed to Mr. Dryander, are carried to Basel by a trustworthy messenger.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I would like you, if you have received anything from the Baden Diet that can be entrusted to friends, to inform me in your letters, which I eagerly await. Various rumors are spread among us about some dispute that has arisen between the French and the Swiss Confederates, which I consider unworthy of belief. For the French have no other firm support if they are deprived of the Swiss soldiers, nor do the Swiss have any king to whom they can join with greater confidence. But you will write better about those things that are certain. I will communicate them in good faith only to the council and to no other person. But you will also learn something from your consul that should not or cannot be safely entrusted to everyone.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, 6th day of February, in the year of our Lord 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Zurichers, my lord and greatest friend.</p>
