    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger writes only very little because Myconius has not responded to his letter [No. 2345] and writes only rarely, and because the bearer [Rudolf] Gwalther will report on the [Zürich] affairs, about the death of Erasmus Schmid and the execution of the notorious witch Agathe Studler, the wife of Adam Frey.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- What news is there from Frankfurt and Regensburg, and why does Myconius write so rarely, even though there is so much to report?</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I write these few words to you, most esteemed man and dearest brother in the Lord, because you have not yet responded to my letters and write so rarely, and especially because you have here a living letter, the dearest son and fellow student, Rudolf Gwalther, whom I commend to your kindness as if he were myself. He will report to you about our affairs, the passing of Erasmus Schmid, a most excellent and faithful minister of Christ, and some other matters, among which is the execution of Agathe Studler, the most notorious witch. She was the wife of Adam Frey.</p>

      <p>What, I ask, do you have from Frankfurt and Regensburg? How is it that with so many and such fruitful topics arising, you write so rarely?</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant pastor of the Basel church, his beloved brother in the Lord.</p>
