      <p>Most illustrious man, when I came to the synod, one of the brothers was present who delivered two of your letters to me, and I am responding to them. I have not yet been thrown into chains; but it was a close call. Meanwhile, the papists slander me as much as they possibly can. Good God, how many lies they accumulate! Among other things, they spread the rumor that I was not expelled from Italy for the sake of the Gospel, but because of heinous crimes. There are those who urge me to bring these liars to court, which I will not do; for I do not think it fitting for a man professing what I profess here to do so.</p>
      <p>However, I will not neglect the honor of my ministry in the meantime, but will approach it by another way, not through judicial means. I would have come straight to you; but great and serious matters still hold me back, from which I will soon free myself. Recently, another good brother fled from the cesspool of papism, distinguished not only by piety and doctrine but also by the splendor of his family, namely from the counts of Martinengo. I hear that the celebration of the council has been postponed to the first of September, and I hope even to the Greek calends. Many suspect a great war will arise over Parma. I ask you: inform Mr. Michael the bookseller in my name to send me the German Bible bound in large format as soon as possible. I will bring him the payment. When he has found a reliable messenger, let him send it to Mr. Galitius, who will ensure it reaches Vicosoprano. I greet all the brothers from the heart.</p>
      <p>Chur, on the first of June 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
