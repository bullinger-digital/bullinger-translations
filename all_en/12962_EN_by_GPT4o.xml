    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] May Christ grant that Bullinger's and Konrad Pellikan's stay at the baths was restful!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The people of Zurich will hardly be able to secure the release of Johannes Haller from the Augsburgers, especially since it could cause great harm to the church there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Rightly, Bullinger urges the people of Konstanz to remain steadfast. As long as [Blarer and like-minded individuals] are not driven out of the city, Konstanz will not yield. If they are expelled, God knows what will happen then. The people are so fickle, especially when they have to endure setbacks. Many people of Konstanz are already insulting [Blarer and his followers]: You will not be able to stand against Emperor Charles V alone or govern on your own! But [Blarer and his followers] never intended such a thing! They hope instead that God will enable them to reconcile with the Emperor without [faith-related] disadvantages. However, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that this will actually happen, as the people of Konstanz are proving more and more ungrateful. In the [front Austrian] territories of King Ferdinand, their interests and other assets are being confiscated, and thus the discontent grows. Bullinger should pray for the people of Konstanz.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer is now trying to find out how to successfully negotiate with the Augsburg council in Hans Schöner's matter. As soon as he knows, he will advance the matter together with Bullinger, so that this unfortunate person can be helped.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] There is hardly any news. One is almost buried under the usual lies! Blarer has never experienced anything like it! From the same city, completely contradictory news can arrive from trustworthy people, so that no one can make sense of it. Christoph Froschauer will tell more about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Yesterday, late in the evening, a letter arrived from Jakob Herbrot and Georg Frölich. The Augsburg envoys have reported from the Emperor's camp about his reconciliation with Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. However, there was no mention of the conditions. Some claim to know that these are just and acceptable.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, also to the family and colleagues. Thomas Blarer and Konrad Zwick send their regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings in our Redeemer and Savior Christ, who may grant that you and the most pious and excellent Konrad Pellikan have bathed happily!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I fear that you will hardly be able to secure the release of Johannes Haller from the Augsburgers without great difficulty and significant harm to the church there.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>What you urge us to do, my venerable and dearest brother, to remain steadfast, you do rightly and in a Christian manner. We will stand firm as long as we are not driven out. After that, God knows what will happen. You are not unaware of the fickle nature of the people, especially when fortune is at risk. Many threats are heard daily: We will not only defend ourselves against the Emperor but also govern ourselves without a superior! This has never crossed our minds! But the Lord will show us the way and means by which we can be reconciled to the Emperor with as little inconvenience as possible, unless our ingratitude, which I greatly abhor and see, alas, growing more and more, deserves otherwise. May the Lord have mercy on us through Christ! Our taxes and other interests are being seized everywhere in the territories of King Ferdinand. It will become unbearable, etc. Pray for us (as you do, I know), that no one may snatch us from His hand, no matter what happens.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In the matter of our Schöner, I am now trying in Augsburg to see how it can be handled with some success before the council. As soon as I find out, you and I will also do our duty, if perhaps the Lord, having mercy on the afflicted and most miserable man, deigns to bless our efforts.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There is absolutely no news here, except that we are almost buried under new lies again and again. I have never heard such terrible, wonderful lies in all my days! From the same city, three kinds of contradictory writings are supposed to come from credible people, so that I can no longer accomplish anything from it. Christoph Froschauer will tell you what rumors are circulating among us, in good faith.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Yesterday, late in the evening, I received letters from Jakob Herbrot and Georg Frölich, who write that the envoys of their city have reported from the Emperor's camp that he has reconciled with Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony. They do not mention the conditions under which this was done, but some others affirm that they are very fair and acceptable.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell, my esteemed and dearest Bullinger, with your entire household and all your ministers in the Lord, and the other brothers and friends, whom you will greet much in the Lord in our words, diligently commending us to their pious prayers. All of ours greet you, my brother Thomas Blarer with Konrad Zwick. May 26, 1547. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the man of incomparable doctrine and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, my venerable and dearest brother. In Zurich.</p>
