    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Bullinger's exhortation to the Memmingen clergy to encourage the people to recognize their sins and lead a better life aligns with Schuler's view. He is convinced that God wants to make people aware of their sins through this war to call them to repentance. It is probably for this reason that the Lord did not allow the enemy [Emperor Charles V] to destroy the [Schmalkaldic League]. Bullinger certainly knows about the threatening alliance between the Antichrist [Pope Paul III] and the Ghent native [Charles V]. However, the long-suffering and chastising God has preserved a remnant so that they may turn to Him with all their hearts. With God's help, Schuler intends to fulfill his task. Bullinger should support the efforts of Schuler and his colleagues with his prayers! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] The mutual friend [Balthasar] Funk will faithfully carry out the matter of interest to the people of Zurich. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] There is a persistent rumor that the Emperor has died. The people of Augsburg report this as well. Ambrosius Blarer also wrote about this from Constance to the Memmingen city clerk [Georg Maurer] and to Johannes Schnell, who is preaching with great success in Leutkirch. If this is indeed true, it is to be expected that God will soon reform His afflicted Church according to His will! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] The letter that Bullinger sent for forwarding to the Zurich citizen Fridli Wirth is being returned sealed by Schuler, along with other letters also intended for Wirth. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Schuler is aware of Jakob Reinhart's deceit, which has harmed some captains. He was punished with imprisonment by the Ulm council. May the Lord cleanse the hearts of people so that everyone may honestly fulfill their calling! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] Greetings, also from the physician Ulrich [Wolfhart], from [Johannes Rembold] Funck, [Bartholomäus] Bertlin, and Johannes Schmid, as well as from Schuler's wife [..., née Lübegger] and daughter Rahel. </p>

      <p>You admonish us well and holy, that by teaching the people we may purify them, so that being conscious of their sins, they may amend their lives, which have provoked the Lord, for the better. For I am not otherwise persuaded than that the Lord, through this warlike tumult, wanted to remind us of our sins and exhort us to repentance. For this reason, He did not allow the enemy, according to what he had planned, to rage against us. For the alliance of the Antichrist with his executor from Ghent, what it has carried before itself and how atrocious it has threatened to be, you yourself know. But the long-suffering Lord wanted a remnant to remain for us even now, so that we may turn to Him with all our hearts and return to Him who strikes us. As long as the Lord assists me with His spirit, I will not fail in the duty entrusted to me. Help, dearest brother, these my efforts and those of my colleagues with your prayers as faithfully as possible!</p>

      <p>Our mutual friend Funck, the common friend of ours, has faithfully revealed the matter concerning the people of Zurich.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>There is a persistent rumor among us that the Emperor has passed away. The people of Augsburg write the same with great certainty. Ambrosius Blarer, the most faithful minister of the church of Constance, wrote the same to the city clerk of our city and to Johannes Schnell, who now preaches Christ with great success in Leutkirch. If this is true, I hope the Lord will soon bring help to His afflicted Church and reform it according to His will.</p>

      <p>The letters you sent to be delivered to Fridli Wirth, a citizen of Zurich, I am returning sealed along with others to be delivered to that good man.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am aware of Reinhart's deceptions, which he has plotted against some military captains. He was punished with imprisonment by the council of Ulm. May the Lord Jesus cleanse the hearts of men with His spirit, so that, with hypocrisy excluded, everyone may serve their calling with a sincere heart. For the world is full of deceit, tricks, and impostures. Faith and truth have perished. We are almost all impatient of paternal correction, etc.</p>

      <p>Farewell, incomparable friend. Ulrich the physician, Funck, Berthlin, and Johannes Fabri, my wife, and my daughter Rachel greet you. Given in Memmingen, December 7, 1546. May the Lord Jesus keep you. Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>To his friendly, dear lord and brother Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
