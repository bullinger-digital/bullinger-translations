      <p>Greetings. Today at the eighth hour before noon, the consul ordered the letters recently brought from Augsburg and written to our senate to be read aloud. Then it pleased the senate that, since I had written to you and had certainly indicated that I would now send my letters, I was asked to include the sense of those letters, however extracted by the scribe, in mine and likewise to ensure they were delivered to you in a note. The envoys from Lindau have returned, bringing the dire will of the Emperor combined with a harsh mandate; but it is like telling a story to a deaf man. For they persist, and in order that the consensus of minds might be more united, they dedicated themselves to the Lord at the celebrated feast of the Lord's Supper. May the Lord deign to help them; for we hear that the greater part of the cities is succumbing to weakness. So fiercely do the threats and punishments of the German Pope rage. For we have many, among whom the most notable are Granvelle, the Bishop of Trent, and the head of abomination, the Cardinal of Augsburg, to whom they say anything they please is permitted. We must indeed be vigilant, lest some sudden Typhon overwhelm us while we suspect nothing. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the 3rd day of July, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the city of ZÃ¼rich, his own.</p>
