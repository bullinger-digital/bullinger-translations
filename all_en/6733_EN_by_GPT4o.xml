      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I was very delighted with some of your books, most illustrious man, most esteemed lord and likewise dearest brother, which the diligent printer Ernst Vigilius sent to me, and I give thanks to our Lord God, who has bestowed so many and such great gifts upon you, and I earnestly pray that He may continue to bless you, so that you may be of great benefit to His church. From your books, furthermore, I seem to see that your mind is not inclined to quarrels and disputes, but to the peace and pious concord of the churches. Therefore, I have dared to write these brief letters to you, and at the same time to send the Confession of the Swiss churches, which I hope will not displease you. Last year, the people of Basel published their confession, which agrees with this one, and thus they have not added their names to this one now. I beg you, most learned and kind Victorinus, to read ours, and also to love us who are very fond of you. Commend me to pious and learned men and pray to the Lord for me. Farewell, dearest brother. May the Lord bless you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 20, 1566.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich, yours entirely from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Victorinus Strigel, professor of the renowned Leipzig academy, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
