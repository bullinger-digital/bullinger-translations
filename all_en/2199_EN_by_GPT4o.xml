      <p>S. D. You have already written to me, most illustrious man, that if I had any news about the excellent man and dearest brother in Christ, Lord a Lasco, I should inform you immediately, and not let you remain unaware of what is being reported to us about English affairs. Therefore, since I have news to report, I did not think it should be delayed to write to you about it now. Our a Lasco had gone, as I had indicated, with his fellow foreigners to Denmark; but there he was received rather poorly, to put it mildly; not, I believe, due to the king's fault, but because of the doctors and ministers of the church, by whose sermons and influence he was finally expelled from that kingdom with his followers. Do not doubt that those people regard us as worse than the papists because of the sacramentarian matter. However, God, who never abandons His own, ensured that this man of God was received with the highest honor in Friesland with all his followers; where the prince came to meet them, refreshed them with very generous alms, and arranged for two churches for the foreigners to be held, one indeed English, the other French. But there, in almost all places, the error of Suencheldius is spreading most cruelly.</p>
      <p>This about our brother Lord a Lasco: now about England. The people are so hostile to the queen, especially because of the Spanish marriage, that it has erupted into a strong conspiracy. An army of twenty thousand, excluding horsemen, has already been gathered; they have occupied all of Kent along with the ports of that region, and have equipped the ships with war artillery, which they now use in the camps. Moreover, they have chosen a leader for themselves, not only brave but very skilled in military matters: they have already advanced as far as London: they hold the house of the Bishop of Winchester, and are not far from the residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, which is at Lambeth.</p>
      <p>When they came to the bridge, they found the gates of London closed; not indeed because the Londoners abhor the sense of these arms, but they feared being plundered either by the queen or by the army of conspirators. Those in the camps demand three things from the queen: first, that a king of English blood be chosen: second, that the religion which flourished under Edward may also prevail now: third, that the common pastures which have already been usurped by the more powerful be restored. And they demand hostages, that these things be observed, namely the Bishop of Winchester and Lord Paget.</p>
      <p>And in this expedition of theirs, they have hanged a great number of priests. The city of London is in great danger: if it were plundered, which may the Lord avert, those merchants could not suffer shipwreck without dragging with them a calamity of almost infinite extent. It is also written that the emperor has prohibited all goods of English merchants in Antwerp from being sold or transferred elsewhere. Many young Englishmen have come to us here in recent days, partly from Oxford, partly from Cambridge, whom many pious merchants here support in their studies, so that if God should ever deign to restore the former state of religion to that kingdom, they may be of use to the English church. This is what I had to write.</p>
      <p>May God keep you safe for a very long time! Mr. Zancus greets you. I, in my own name, wish to send greetings to all your fellow ministers. February 24, 1554. Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>There are other things we have received later about English affairs, which I do not think it is necessary to write, since you will be able to learn everything from this good man who will deliver my letter to you.</p>
      <p>Know that he is an Englishman most devoted to our doctrine, who defended and advocated it with great efforts and utmost diligence in his preaching. Now, however, since such difficult times have arisen, to ease the trouble of his mind, as you see, he is traveling, visiting churches which he considers to be well established above others: therefore, I commend him to you again and again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church of Zurich and to be respected by me for many reasons. Zurich.</p>
