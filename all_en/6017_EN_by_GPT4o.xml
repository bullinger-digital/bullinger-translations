      <p>S. Here you have Paul Knippe, a Fleming, returning from Geneva and Lyon.</p>
      <p>Besides bringing you many letters from Beza and others, he can also serve as a living letter and narrate whatever he saw and heard in Geneva or Lyon.</p>
      <p>For me to add anything to this would not be worthwhile. Beza also wrote to me through the same messenger, which I would share with you, except I know he writes the same to you as well. The situation in France is still quite inflamed; therefore, we must pray that the Lord will help them and us.</p>
      <p>We have nothing yet from Baden.</p>
      <p>I had hoped that the matters of the people of Glarus would be settled; but now that the council is over, I do not know what to hope for.</p>
      <p>I fear that this will be the occasion for great turmoil among us in Switzerland; because everything has been played out so far. But if they (the others) are wise, they will leave us in peace; for our downfall cannot happen without their great harm. Our neighbors from Freiburg and Solothurn are very touchy; I do not know what is in them; perhaps they are biting their lips.</p>
      <p>May God protect us from disaster! The situation in Geneva is such that it is almost not worth writing or speaking about.</p>
      <p>The exiles had fled from the domain of our lords; now I do not know what light shines on them again: they return in droves, as I hear, insult the Genevans, excuse themselves, fill everything with slanders and lies, although it is certainly known that they are lost scoundrels. But those deep-seated hatreds make them find ears where they should not find them.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Savoy also excuses himself, so I do not know where the matter will end up. We are now expecting the meeting to be held next month in Neuchâtel; but they will deliberate until it is night again.</p>
      <p>I expect you to write much.</p>
      <p>All friends are well and greet you, especially Steiger, Nägelin, Grafenried, my father-in-law, Zehender, and many others. Give greetings to all yours in my and my wife's name.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 16, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
