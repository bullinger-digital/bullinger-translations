      <p>Greetings. Most learned Bullinger and dearest brother, I received your letter sent to me in June, in which you congratulate me on my recent marriage, for which I give you the greatest thanks, praying to the Lord Jesus that He may preserve you and yours in good health and in the analogy of faith for as long as possible. We read with incredible joy what you mention about the firm tranquility of the Swiss and other peoples, denouncing the utmost hatred towards us and all pious brothers in return. The Landgrave and the Elector Palatine agree with us; this grieves their subjects and the lower magistracy, who are hedonistic and carnal, not understanding what pertains to human salvation. I do not take any position in Wesel due to severe dangers; for our preachers do not begin to investigate the matter as the truth of the scriptures and your most holy writings demand. However, our pastor, whose name is Nikolaus Roll, understands the matter more rightly than the others, and he will transcribe to you at his convenience through me. When this happens, encourage him with very kind letters, but in such a way that he does not understand that anything about him has been written to you by me. It is necessary to walk circumspectly now.</p>
      <p>I have not seen Cassander; otherwise, I would not have forgotten the mandate; they say he is defecting from us and has somewhat departed. I greeted the noble Adolf von Bars in your name, who sends his greetings to you with this letter.</p>
      <p>If you respond to these, as he hopes, please respond to us. I wrote this at the Frankfurt fair amidst the great turmoil of my affairs.</p>
      <p>At this fair, your letters will always be demanded from Froschauer, our mutual friend; if we are deprived of your letters and those of Mylius, we will bear it most grievously because of our singular love for you and yours. Now farewell with the elect and greet Mylius.</p>
      <p>Suddenly in Frankfurt, September 13, 1561. Yours sincerely, Karl Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his esteemed lord and father.</p>
