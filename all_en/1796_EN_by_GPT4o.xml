      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. We give immense thanks to God, the best and greatest, for restoring you to us; take care to be well, as you are entirely necessary to your church, your family, and all of us. Pontresina has informed us of everything.</p>
      <p>With us, everything remains in the same state. We will deal with Camillo and Paravicino at the Paulinian fairs, when our leaders meet, with whom the power lies; for without them we can do nothing. From Italy, we have almost nothing, except that soldiers (as it is said) are being enlisted in Mirandola; surely against Parma and Siena, Caesar will undertake something. Farewell. From Chur, January 21, 1552. Vergerius sends two letters. He has been called by the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg; it seems to us that he neglects this calling; for what reason, we do not know.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man in piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
