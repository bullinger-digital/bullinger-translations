      <p>S. D. May our Lord God resolve these disturbances in France to the glory of His name and the advancement of the holy gospel! The enemies of the truth of the gospel are planning many cruel things, but they will not succeed beyond what the Lord allows. Let us pray diligently that He does not grant them joy, but rather overturns their bloody plans. If ever our beloved brother Beza writes to you from France with certain news about what is happening there, you would do us a great favor by sharing it with us. I have gladly served you, brother, and especially the most honorable council in the matter you entrusted to me. For I read with joy the decree of the most honorable council, and if my family were not so large that I could not accommodate anyone, I would have personally provided lodging for one of them. I am so eager to serve the most honorable council and you, my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>We have found suitable hosts for them: Dr. Georg Keller, a physician, Dr. Johann Jakob Wick, a preacher in our church, Huldrych Zwingli, my son-in-law, and Dr. Johann Herter, a schoolmaster. Additionally, other good men offer their services.</p>
      <p>The price will be twenty crowns.</p>
      <p>I wrote a few days ago about all our affairs through a certain Belgian.</p>
      <p>I hope those letters have been delivered to you.</p>
      <p>For I would not want them to be lost or intercepted.</p>
      <p>We also deeply mourn that you have been deprived of such a wise and faithful colleague. But the Lord, the guardian and protector of His church, has taken him away.</p>
      <p>He knows what His church needs. And He frees His faithful ministers from present troubles.</p>
      <p>Let us pray that He sends other faithful workers into His harvest. All our brothers, especially Gwalther, Wolf, Martyr, Simler, and the others, send you and yours honorable greetings.</p>
      <p>You have no doubt seen that Latin book which Tilemann Hesshus wrote against you, especially about the presence of the body of Christ in the supper, etc. More on these matters later.</p>
      <p>Farewell eternally with all yours, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. May the Lord bless you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 11, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church in Geneva, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
