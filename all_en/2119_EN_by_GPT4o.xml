      <p>Greetings. Gallitius himself voluntarily told me that he had become Rizius's interpreter. Therefore, in my recent letters, I advised the man to consider what he is doing, and I wish he had shown you my letter! Indeed, not to hide anything from you, I advised the Rhaetians that it would have been wiser if they had refrained from the king's alliance from the beginning and thus retained their freedom whole and unblemished, which I diligently advised at the time when it was still under discussion whether it was appropriate to form an alliance with the king or not. However, since they have pledged to the king with an oath, it would be most unjust to violate the faith confirmed by oath, unless perhaps they can reach their ancestral freedom by some convenient and honorable means and with the king's good grace. But Rizius does not seek this, who rather thinks of making the Rhaetians treacherous and involving them in new and equally dangerous or even worse entanglements, or certainly seeking the safety of his master to the great harm of the Rhaetians by stirring up dissension among them, and in this matter, as a courtier and true turncoat, he most stubbornly pursues his master's business, not the peace and safety of the Rhaetians, etc. To this, he responds in his latest letter dated the 18th of this month that he has ceased to act as an interpreter and therefore returned his letters as usual, etc. Although I have never discussed such matters with you in my letters, because I see that you are very disturbed by Gallitius's actions, I have written this to you for your peace of mind. - As for the rest, I remember well what the blessed apostle Paul calls λογεῖαν εἰς τοὺς ἁγίους, a collection and contribution for the saints, namely exiles and outcasts for the sake of the gospel, finally stripped of all resources by the cruelty of persecutors and now perishing from hunger and starvation. For the insuperable cruelty of the Jews, inflamed with hatred for Christ the Savior, was raging almost against the confessors of the name of Christ, especially in Syria and in the city of Jerusalem itself, where they almost held power.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Judea at that time gave more exiles to the churches than Rome itself. For this reason, Christ's apostle Paul, as can be seen in chapter 15 of Romans, was asking for aid from the Romans for the miserable and oppressed by persecution. He was also asking the church of the Corinthians for this very thing, as we read in 1 Corinthians 16 and 2 Corinthians 8 and 9. There, I say, he explicitly mentions collections for the saints. Here, however, I will not take away praise from you, my lord, nor from anyone. Those who help the exiles for Christ with their resources deserve praise before God and men, and it is entirely permissible to hope for a reward, and indeed a bountiful one, from beneficence and liberality, as our Savior himself says: "He who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward" and "Whoever gives one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward." Therefore, even if you have given nothing, but have been entirely devoted to ensuring that those who truly believe in Christ in France are not deprived of their wealth and exiled, I will consider you to have given more than if you had shared many myriads of sesterces with the exiled. I write this to you, my esteemed lord, with a sincere heart, to anticipate your response and relieve you of that burden. For you will not think that I am asking for lengthy letters from your kindness.</p>
      <p>It will be enough for me if you only note the main points of matters, as you say you will do in the future. Farewell in our Lord and Savior, who I pray will make this year begin most happily for you and end with much greater happiness. Zurich, December 21, 1553.</p>
      <p>Devoted to your excellence, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
