    <p xml:id="regest1">On September 19, received Bullinger's letter through [Wolfgang] Musculusâ€™ little son [Abraham or Elias], in which Bullinger unnecessarily apologizes for his late response [to No. 1901]; meanwhile, Birck asks Bullinger and his colleagues to share their opinions on dramas with him, as these are disapproved of by some because they distract students from their studies and corrupt good morals. Birck does not wish to impose his "Judith" on the people of Zurich, unless Christoph [Froschauer] considers the [reprint] to be useful; with his dispatch, Birck mainly wanted to recommend himself to the people of Zurich; hence his joy [upon reading Bullinger's letter] over the long list of those sending greetings to him; Birck sends his greetings back.</p>

      <p>Greetings. On the nineteenth of September, our Musculus sent me your letters through his little son, which were as pious as they were friendly. You unnecessarily apologize for the delay in your very religious response, as if I were someone who needs to be answered in matters not very arduous by such great men overwhelmed by such a heap of ecclesiastical affairs. However, I would very much like you to respond to me in the meantime.</p>
      <p>To what question, you ask? There is one and another who disapprove of dramas, like our "Judith," on the grounds that they hinder the studies of youth and public morals. I am eager to hear the judgment of the Church of Zurich on this matter. Therefore, I ask you, for the sake of the studies and the piety with which you embrace the scholars, to gather the votes of the learned on the question proposed in your assembly; which certainly will hold great authority with me. Never, believe me, have I intended to hinder either morals or studies, which I am publicly employed to cultivate.</p>
      <p>Regarding the printing of "Judith" with you, I neither insist nor desire it, unless convenience itself persuades Christoph, nor did I send it for this purpose, but rather to seek an opportunity to introduce Xystus to you, who desires to make his name known among learned and pious men. For this reason, I was greatly pleased by that long list of learned men sending greetings to Xystus through you. Please convey my greetings to them in return on my behalf and ask them in my name to give their opinion on those dramas for my sake. If they do so, I will interpret it as an extraordinary favor.</p>
      <p>Farewell. From Augsburg, the day before the calends of October 44. Most devoted to your kindness, Xystus Betul.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the foremost preacher of the divine word in Zurich, my lord and father, to be especially honored.</p>
