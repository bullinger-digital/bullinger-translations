      <p>It happened approximately on the 10th night before Martinmas in the year 1534, that the watchman in Uri around the 10th hour had sat down on Hans Scheittler's cellar door. And as he sat for a while, suddenly a bright light shone in his face, so that at first he had to lower his eyes; then he lifted his head again and looked around to see where such a light was coming from. And then he saw on the little tower, on top of the knob, a beautiful, well-grown child sitting and shining like the sun. The child had in its hand a rod with three branches or shoots, and the child took one shoot and bent it towards the watchman and said: "With this, I will punish the pride and arrogance of your people." Then it took the second shoot, did the same as before, and said: "With this, I will punish the adultery and fornication of your people."</p>
      <p>Likewise, it also took the third shoot and said: "With this, I will punish the grievous swearing, gluttony, and drunkenness of your people." With that, the child disappeared, so that the watchman did not know where it had gone. The watchman is appointed for counsel and has confirmed this under sworn oath for the second time. And so it was presented on the day in Lucerne to the seven places in all farewell, and I have thus copied it from the Zug farewell.</p>
      <p>Rudolf Weingartner, pastor in Zug.</p>
