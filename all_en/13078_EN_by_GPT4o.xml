    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frölich received Bullinger's comforting letter [not preserved] with his congratulations [for surviving the life-threatening ulcer]. He also received the Apology [„Contra scandala ex bello infeliciter gesto oborta Apologia“], with which Bullinger [addresses the doubts of the faithful], who were offended by the unfortunate outcome of the [Schmalkaldic] War. This writing has even partially improved Frölich's health! May God preserve and strengthen its author in the numerous sufferings he endures for Christendom, so that he can continue to protect the truth from the attacks of the now arrogant enemies of Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Frölich entrusts himself entirely to God. He is not truly afraid of human decisions. Should he have to die, he asks God to allow him to do so with a joyful heart, as one who breaks out of prison to enter a beautiful garden for eternity. Everywhere [in Germany], the pious have incredible hardships to endure. Therefore, anyone who tries with all their might to remain in this vain world is rightly considered a fool.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Frölich is not yet completely healthy. The complete healing of the wound caused by the large ulcer will probably require more than a month. He also suffers from fever and constrictive chest pains. Yet he takes all this as a fatherly admonition from God. Bullinger should pray for him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] That's all for today. Johannes Haller will report in person. Greetings to the mayors Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater, to the city clerk Hans Escher vom Luchs, to the dear Rudolf Gwalther, to Konrad Pellikan, Konrad Gessner, Johannes Fries, and to all the faithful. Frölich intends to thoroughly read the “Apology” and reciprocate all of Bullinger's kindnesses. Greetings also to the family.</p>

      <p>I have received your comforting and indeed congratulatory letters, most esteemed brother. I have also received your Apology against the offenses arising from the war unfortunately waged, which delighted me so much that I believe part of my illness has been alleviated by it. May the Lord in turn comfort and preserve you in all the afflictions, which I know you endure not insignificantly for the Christian republic, preserve you, I say, to retain and defend the truth against the most cruel enemies of Christ, whose crests are now almost raised to the middle of the air!</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have commended myself and all my affairs uniquely to the Father of all things, to whom I shall live and die, and I have not greatly feared the dissolution of human flesh in my most perilous infirmity, but I have prayed to the Lord that, if it should happen that I migrate from here, it may be done with a joyful spirit as if to one who is about to go from a prison to a most pleasant garden and from transitory troubles to the eternal kingdoms of the almighty God. You do not know and can hardly believe, indeed, with what calamities and miseries the best of the pious are oppressed here and there among many! Therefore, he is rightly to be considered a fool who desires with much effort to remain long in this most vain world.</p>

      <p>Therefore, do not cease to pray to the Lord for me, that He may deign to direct my ways to His glory. I have not yet fully recovered. For I have received such a wound from the ulcer that it can scarcely be healed in a month. Moreover, febrile conditions have come upon me, as well as constrictions around the chest, so that I am still gravely afflicted. But it is well: In this way, I see myself to be a son of the most benevolent Father, who chastises me paternally.</p>

      <p>I can write no more now. Haller, our perpetual brother, will be a living letter. I wish the lords mayors, the city clerk, Gwalther, my heart, Pellikan, Gessner, Fries, and each of the faithful among you to be well. I will diligently read your Apology, for which and for all your kindness, I will respond if I can. Farewell with your most honorable household. October 3, 1547. Yours, Georg Frölich from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man and friend, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes among the Zurichers. Zurich.</p>
