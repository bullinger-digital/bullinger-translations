    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for [No. 1401]. Understands Vadian's decision to temporarily withhold the book about the monasteries, but he should not delay the publication too much. In Zurich, the pastors proclaim the Gospel in freedom, and they are well protected; may God strengthen His own! Has read the records of the Schmalkaldic League and will send him an excerpt of the opinions on the possibilities of reconciliation with Rome; never before have the [Lutheran] theologians come so close to the stance of the [Confederates]. Fears that Suleiman, the Turkish tyrant, is destined by God to punish the Christians for their faithlessness. Basel's request to the Zurich council to send some scholars [to the planned religious discussion] in Strasbourg was kindly declined - Vadian will surely have been invited as well -; there would have been no prospects of success anyway. In the [Zurich] Niederdorf, the plague is noticeable, and Bullinger himself suffers from dizziness and headaches, so that he cannot work. Asks to forward letters to Augsburg and Memmingen. [Walter] Klarer will tell what Bullinger advised him. Asks for indulgence, as he writes with severe headaches.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I thank you, most esteemed man, for that accurate and copious letter. For your letters always not only delight me but also teach me, and a good and wise man would not easily disregard your reasons for not thinking it appropriate to publish your book on monasteries at present. Therefore, with my peace, you may wait for a more opportune occasion, provided you also remember this: nothing in excess, nothing too long. - We who preach Christ in ZÃ¼rich are indeed free; but we are surrounded, as you rightly warn, by a notable and firm protection and crown. May the Lord continually encourage His own to promote what is for His glory and the benefit of the church. I have read the Schmalkaldic records in full. The codex is almost just, to speak hyperbolically, which seems to be sufficiently copious. I have condensed an epitome of the counsel written by the learned on what they are willing to negotiate with the papists and what they are not. If you have not yet seen the records, I will share the epitome with you. Never, however, have the counsels of those men pleased me better, nor have they ever come closer to us. Praise and glory to God, who must be prayed to by us, that He may confirm in them what He has begun. - I have always feared and even today fear Suleiman, that tyrant of the Turks, as being destined by God to be a Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, and Antiochus, who punishes the remnants of Christians for that faithlessness and heinous crimes. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us a repentant heart. Amen. - The people of Basel wrote to our council these days and requested that some learned men be sent to Strasbourg. But this was denied to them for many reasons; although it was denied amicably and gently. I do not doubt that you too have been requested. But I do not see how more harm than benefit could be expected from it for you and others. - The plague has indeed begun to exert its strength and to play with a skirmish in the Niederdorf. We await what the Lord will do with us; our fates are in His hand. Dizziness and almost paralytic pain so torment my head and induce such numbness in my body that for several days I have been not only useless to myself and others but also a burden. I abstain entirely from the study of letters, may the Lord restore me to my former health. - Please ensure these letters are delivered to Augsburg and Memmingen. Farewell. June 2, 1540. Klarer will explain what I advised him.</p>
      <p>I write this with the greatest pain in my head; therefore, consider kindly what is poorly written and said.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Joachim Vadian, the consul of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord.</p>
