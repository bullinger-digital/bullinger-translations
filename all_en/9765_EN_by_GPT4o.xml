      <p>Salvation and consolation from the most powerful Lord and Father of mercies through Jesus our Savior!</p>
      <p>With my greatest sorrow, I read the most disastrous story written by you, beloved brother, about the conflagration of your city. Meanwhile, however, I am always compelled to exclaim with the divine prophet: "The Lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works." I continually pray to Him to grant other cities repentance, that is, to use the example of your city beneficially; I also ask Him to protect us and all people and to avert such dreadful fires from us and to have mercy on all of us. As soon as I understood this visitation of the Lord, I urged the most honorable councilors to send a delegation to you, which would console and offer aid for the miserable citizens, and I found them willing. The matter was reported to the most honorable senate. You would have seen and heard here a wonderful compassion and readiness to help. A legate, the treasurer, was sent; aid of 200 bushels of wheat was decreed; for nothing now seemed more necessary to be contributed to you, especially in this scarcity of grain. However, I hope that other Swiss republics will be encouraged by the example of our people to contribute. And it is certain that more would have been done if our country folk had not been so badly struck by hail in some places, where my lords must help greatly; likewise, there is great poverty, so we have enough to do and to help. But I hope that yours will be satisfied and content.</p>
      <p>Greet for me the mayors and especially convey my condolences to Mr. Ambrosius Martin. May God comfort him. Also greet Mr. Gregor and our other dear lords and friends. I wrote this letter with our Franz Bonet; let him also be commended to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your household, Campello, and all the others. Zurich, August 6, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I also received news from Mr. Lentulus yesterday, for which I give thanks.</p>
