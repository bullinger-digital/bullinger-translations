    <p xml:id="regest1">The bearer of the letter will report on Schnyder's negotiations regarding the mercenaries staying in Biel, particularly about [Wilhelm] Frölich on March 1 before the council; the pension recipients are self-assured. Bullinger should write something against the frivolous swearing of oaths, otherwise, one acts more disgracefully towards God as a Christian than the Romans did towards Jupiter. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Faithful and beloved lord and brother. I wanted to write to you about what I, together with my fellow brother, have negotiated regarding the mercenaries who are staying with us, after Christmas, and then what I have negotiated for myself on March 1st on behalf of my lord Frölich and others, and what decision was given to me, likewise to Frölich. The bearer of this letter will report all this to you for the sake of brevity. The pensioners (the profiteers of military service) are strongly resisting. With God's help, they must yield.</p>
      <p>Regarding the oath, I have spoken with Johann and ask you, if possible, that the oath is not given so easily and frivolously, as it is held in our religion, acting more disgracefully towards our God than the Romans did towards Jupiter, to whom they next pledged their faith, as Cicero speaks of Ennius in the third book of "De Officiis".</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I commend myself to your faith and charity. Greet your wife, mother, and all brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>From Biel, March 23.</p>
      <p>Your Peter.</p>
      <p>To my beloved lord and brother Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
