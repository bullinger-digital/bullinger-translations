    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the news about Emperor [Charles V] and reports on the conflict concerning Geneva: Bern intends to terminate the alliances with Duke [Charles III] of Savoy, as he does not keep his promises and continues to harass Geneva. The stance of Bern received approval at the community assemblies held throughout the country; now steps will likely follow to liberate Geneva. According to rumors, the Savoyards are said to have defeated a cavalry troop sent by King [Francis I] or by his sister, Queen [Margaret] of Navarre; the King is said to be planning a campaign of revenge. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My friendly, good-willed service is always ready.</p>
      <p>Especially gracious Master Heinrich, I have well understood your letter, indicating the new news about the Emperor, and yet regarding the matter of Geneva, the reason I have not written to you until now is that I myself have not been able to be properly informed. However, the situation is now such that my lords of Bern intend to terminate and send back the alliance letters to the Duke of Savoy and want to have nothing more to do with him. The reason for this is that he has given us many smooth words and promises, but has kept little of them, and my gracious lords have found nothing in him but deceit, and meanwhile, he oppresses and harasses the good people of Geneva, so that none of them dare to leave the city without risking their life and limb; not to mention the plundering of their goods, the land, and the roads, etc.</p>
      <p>And so that my gracious lords may more boldly deal with the Duke, having informed the people in the city and land of their opinion and will, they have informed them of this, and it has been unanimously agreed in the entire territory, also here in the entire Aargau, that we entrust our gracious lords to carry out these matters according to their wisdom and pleasure, and have promised to commit life and goods to them. Now you also report in your writing that they intend to send back such alliance letters and then deliberate, act, and do so that their written agreements against the people of Geneva regarding the citizenship rights will be honored and respected as is due. This is all I know at the moment. Whether my gracious lords will send out such letters, or what they intend, I do not yet know, but I believe they will try once and, with God's help, liberate Geneva.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have also been informed by the land steward that the King of France - some say his sister, the Queen of Navarre, did it - is said to have sent 200 cavalry horses over the mountain to Geneva, which the Savoyards unexpectedly encountered, as they had dismounted and led the horses by the reins down the mountain. They captured and killed about 50 of the French; the others are said to have escaped and some reached Geneva. And yet the Savoyards also hanged the captives, which now greatly displeases the King, who has mustered a large force and intends to avenge such disgrace and damage, etc.</p>
      <p>I wanted to inform you of this in good faith. If I receive any further truthful reports, I will not withhold them from you. I trust you will do the same for me, etc. And with this, we are always entrusted to God, our only savior.</p>
      <p>Given on the 13th of January in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Your always good supporter, Sulpitius Haller, bailiff of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>Greet Master Lew and the bailiff of Kyburg along with other good gentlemen and companions.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of God and the church in greater Zurich, my gracious, dear lord.</p>
