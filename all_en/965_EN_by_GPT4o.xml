      <p>Friendly and dearly beloved lord and Christian brother, from the recent letter of Hans Tscharner, I have clearly understood your and his opinion regarding my son Titus and thank you both most sincerely, and I am pleased with your opinion. Therefore, I am sending the boy to you once again, with an earnest request, wishing to deal with him according to your advice and as I trust you. However, how you accommodate the boy and what I am required to give until Christmas, please inform me, so that I can prepare and keep faith at the right time; for although many crowns are said to be here with us, few have come to me, etc. So I am sending here 1 ducat; from which you should take the 6 batzen, likewise, along with the expenses, the rest for his needs, whether it be a little coat or a pair of linen trousers, and do so especially for God's sake, etc. In Chur, on July 8, 1550.</p>
      <p>Johannes Blasius, your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Bullinger, his most respected brother and lord.</p>
      <p>These are the last words he wrote; for soon after, he was seized by the plague and passed away.</p>
