      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>They write from Augsburg on September 28th that Maximilian has allowed his Austrians to reform according to the Augsburg Confession, and therefore Jacob Andreae and some other Lutherans, whom I do not know, are called to make proselytes, etc. Jacob Andreae, the rattle of Archytas, does not cease to criticize the Zwinglians with published German sermons, etc. Illyricus continues to be similar to himself. And lest there be too much agreement among the brothers, an Englishman named Withers came to Heidelberg, who there (with their permission) disputed about excommunication, that is, sowed the seeds of great dissensions. Do you think it is wise, in such a disturbance of all things, to stir up quarrels and disputes? I am warned by faithful ones through letters to be very careful; for there are those who have conspired against my life. However, I know that my life is quite safe in God's hands; I also desire in every way to be dissolved and to be with Christ, our Savior, so that here by God's grace I fear nothing.</p>
