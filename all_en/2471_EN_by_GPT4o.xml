      <p>Greetings. I would have written long ago about the outcome of the Frankfurt assembly if I had been able to ascertain anything certain; however, I understand that the princes have given the request of the Emperor not the least place in their deliberation. Under the pretext of supporting the cavalry in Alsace, he was demanding an immense sum of money, ostensibly to use it against the French, as Albert the Margrave was pressing heavily on that part of Germany. Indeed, some bishops have already agreed, as they are almost ready to fulfill his wishes. But the Saxon and Swabian circles, as they are called, have refused this contribution because they have been greatly afflicted by the calamities of the recent war. Therefore, the entire matter has been referred to the consultation of the current Diet of Augsburg. The French have thrown a wrench into the Emperor's plans, having learned of the situation through letters, by appealing to the imperial estates regarding the reception of Albert. They argue that he should not be given a place within the borders of their kingdom to harass the empire with incursions, preferring instead that he live in peace among them, but to provide refuge once he is defeated, as the kings of France have customarily done for exiled German princes. They assure that he will not harm anyone from the empire but will use his services against the Emperor, the enemy of both, and against the Emperor's own domain. In other respects, they seriously urge that the Emperor's forces not be supported against them with their expenses and aid, reminding them how this was done in 1544 to their clear disadvantage. They do this in their usual manner and have some supporters; however, to bring everything together for the common good of the fatherland, we can hardly hope, as the freedom of opinions has long been suppressed by corrupt passions and the discord of the orders. But the Lord is the one who holds the hearts of kings in His hand; let us not cease to implore His mercy. Our people do not entirely despair of somehow preserving the state of the Locarnese; but I do not fully understand the means and causes. However, the outcome of the Baden assembly will soon reveal everything. I commend to you this young man from Lausanne, Johann Perrin, who has distinguished himself here with his piety and diligence in letters to all his teachers.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus, to whose grace I especially commend you. Basel, November 20, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
