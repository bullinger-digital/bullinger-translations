      <p>Since I found this messenger in Winterthur, I wanted to send you this letter from my dear cousin Konrad Zwick in the utmost haste; I wrote to you on Monday through Hieronymus Empor and before that on Tuesday, also in Winterthur. Praying to God for us faithfully. August 7, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in his hand.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
