      <p>Greetings. Celsus von Martinengo, a pious and brave count, has diligently recommended these brothers to me, beseeching that I, in turn, commend them to you, my honored and dear lord and brother. However, since I can testify nothing about them, as I have never seen them until now, but knowing that Lord Celsus is a truthful man, I beseech your piety, to assist these foreign men who, as I understand, are fleeing to you.</p>
      <p>We are doing quite well here. The war declared between the Emperor and the French understandably makes wise men anxious and also torments me. I fear for the French, especially since it is written that the king is once again raging against the faithful of Christ; I would have more hope if the king were more closely united with Christ. I am writing a booklet to the king, in which I show that the fullness of all the faithful is in Christ alone; it is currently being printed here.</p>
      <p>The bishops and electors have set out for the council; they have departed with the Cologne Ruardus of Leuven, Gropper, and Billik. The business of iniquity proceeds strongly. Let us watch and pray, brother, that our Lord does not forsake his church and us, the ministers. Farewell with all yours. In great haste, ZÃ¼rich, October 12, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most honored lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>In Geneva.</p>
