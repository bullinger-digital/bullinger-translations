      <p>Greetings. Our assembly, most excellent Bullinger, I wish may not give birth to great disturbances; for I am convinced that they will be in vain, and the process observed so far seems to indicate this. The Catholics have never been so arrogant, obstinate, and haughty as they are today; they establish everything according to their own will, and nothing makes them more boastful than our discord and the peace they claim has been made between the French and the Spanish. They think that... our people should follow the example of the Diet of Worms in those assemblies, worthy of the Worms colloquy, so that they may be expelled from Germany with clubs and lictors. Therefore, I think everything will be laid out; a part of the sacrifices exhibited at Worms has been read, lest another be read, they devise a thousand ways, tricks, and snares. Moreover, I find much lacking in our people, sobriety, constancy, zeal, and many other things. I am not allowed to say more now.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly. April 4th, etc. 59.</p>
      <p>Your Gereon Sailer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and most sincere friend.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
