      <p> Greetings. It is far from being a burden, dearest lord and godfather, what you write about my preface; rather, I give you the greatest thanks and highly praise your candor and dedication towards me, and I congratulate myself on it. Certainly, I thought about all the same things you write and think about while writing, especially after I had already sent it off; because you urged me to hasten it, I wrote hastily and therefore also thoughtlessly and imprudently, and I am glad that it has been returned to me; if I had pressed it for even the ninth day, which he nevertheless speaks of years, I would have changed many things. I am now sending the abbreviation, in which I also spent only a few hours, so as not to cause any delay. You see that I have cut it down so much that barely a third or fourth part remains; however, I submit it to you, so that you may remove and eliminate whatever still seems superfluous to you. This seems less odious, and perhaps I would have cut down even more, if the former had not been read by them. Therefore, I kept the same order and the same arguments; I only cut out the superfluous. And if they did not already know my intention of dedicating the booklet to them, I would cut out the entire dedication and attach nothing but a preface to the reader. But I can no longer withdraw from the dedication. Therefore, make sure that it is not entirely inconvenient. Impose on me, in turn, whatever you wish, and I will fulfill it for you. I have added nothing to the dedication: if you wish to add something, please do so from your own. I am sending 12 copies of Musculus' booklets, 6 of each, and there is nothing for you to pay. If I can do anything more for you, I will do it. </p>
      <p> There is nothing new with us, except that there is much and varied talk about the exhausted runner in Milan; I fear we will still be troubled and suffer because of the matter. Here is a shoemaker who is said to have boasted: he bet that if the race did not harm the great Hans as it did the son of the mayor Negerli and other poor fellows who had to be put in chains because of it, then the mayor himself and all who took up the matter would hang by him. The talk is against the mayor; he has rightly taken it up; the matter is in the right, and it is a wild affair. God knows, it would be better if everything were reconciled! </p>
      <p> I have not yet heard from Geneva how things are going with Hieronymus. I am sending your writings back to you here and ours with it; I do not have the Latin copy at hand at the moment; therefore, I am sending the German one, as it was translated by Musculus; for we first presented it to our senate to read. I do not yet have what the senate has written; however, it has confirmed ours. The people of Lausanne are already restless about the matter. My lords have forbidden them to get involved in the matter; this displeases them, thinking that without their help it cannot be extinguished. They are also otherwise restless because my lords have the local children's sermons translated into French and ordered them to be held in the new language. They would prefer to use Calvin's or more intricate ones. </p>
      <p> That's all for now. When the booklet is out, send me as many copies as Froschauer will allow, and have two bound for me. Be truly entrusted to God, and please, take care of my foolishness; I am more foolish than one who should publish anything; but since the booklet itself pleased you and you entrusted it to the press before I knew it was done, do also what remains, so that the preface somehow fits the matter. Certainly, I could not reread it more often due to the brevity of time. Farewell, farewell. May all yours be safe. All of ours greet you. Bern, December 15, 1551. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> Do with the title of the book as you see fit. I like the formula which I am sending back here. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and dearest godfather. </p>
      <p> Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. </p>
