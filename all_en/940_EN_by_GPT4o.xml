      <p>S. D. I sent to you, most learned man, during the week of Pentecost a very brief letter, in which I enclosed another to be sent to Johann Haller. I wish to know whether you have received it; if you have, please ensure that the other letter reaches Bern as quickly as possible, as it would be very beneficial for me and I would be most grateful. I have remarried due to the pressing needs of my family and the respectability of my position, and this before the next Christmas. Therefore, I have not yet experienced any disturbances, although previously many wagons of threats were being carried by the Papists. Everything else here is quite peaceful.</p>
      <p>Some dreadful things are expected from the upcoming imperial assembly, but even these things lie in the lap of God, as Homer says, who also (as he says) does not fulfill all the plans of men.</p>
      <p>We will earnestly pray that the same God, for the glory of His name, preserves the pure doctrine and destroys those wicked men who desire war and strive to overthrow both divine and human matters. The people of Magdeburg are still defending themselves quite courageously. May the Lord preserve them. If only the Emperor would become more gentle and not impose the deceitful and impious Interim on those imbued with sounder doctrines; he would have God more favorable and would reign more widely. I would write more, but these things are written hastily as other matters call me away. Write back about the letters and greet the brothers and lords ministering in the church there in my name. Farewell. Given at Kempten on June 18, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Thomas Naogeorgus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and kind man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, doctor of the church in Zürich, his friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
