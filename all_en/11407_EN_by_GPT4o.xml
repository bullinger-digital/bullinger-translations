    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a letter with news about Bullinger, the other friends, and the Zurich church; would like to report equally pleasant things about his own situation; Bullinger will certainly learn more details from the merchants. In England, the monastic order was abolished, and three abbots [Richard Whiting, Hugh Cooke, known as Farringdon, and Thomas Beech, known as Marshall], who conspired to reintroduce papism, were punished; the Gospel is freely preached, and King [Henry VIII], who wants to promote the true doctrine, plans to convert twelve monasteries into schools; Parliament was convened for April 8. Partridge lives as a tutor with Anthony Aucher, paymaster in Dover; he sends his regards. Can only send the gloves next time, as Bullinger's letter from August 30 only arrived on February 26. Will send Bullinger an Angelot [gold coin] through Reyner [Wolfe], with which Christian [...] can be paid. Waiting for [Theodor] Bibliander's [lecture notes] on Proverbs and Job; also wishes for Bullinger's [sermons] on the Gospel of John and what he is currently preaching on the [1st] Epistle of John. Greetings; there is not enough time for a letter to Rudolf Gwalther, but he is surprised that Gwalther did not write to him regarding the [Frankfurt] fair. Sends a Stoter [a silver coin] each for Gwalther, Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], and mother [Anna, née Wiederkehr]. Thanks for the gifted books, which Reyner [Wolfe] will receive from Froschauer, and in exchange, he will send the gloves from Oxford, which are actually a gift from his employer to Bullinger. Further greetings.</p>

      <p>I am very grateful, most kind teacher and deservedly my dearest, for you have deigned to write to me not only about yourself and the other friends, but also about the very happy state of your church. Everything was indeed most pleasing and delightful to me. And I wish we could report equally happy things about ourselves to you: not that we are not in good health, but because not everything is yet succeeding according to our wishes. I do not doubt that you have learned everything from the merchants. However, since you have told so many excellent things about your church, we will also report some things that perhaps are not to be despised. There is no monk here even in name. Recently, three principal abbots were punished, who had set aside a great treasure and conspired in various ways to reintroduce papism. Good pastors freely preach the truth, and no one has yet been punished for the articles you write about. The king, wonderfully merciful, would gladly see the truth promoted; and to achieve this, he wanted to consult some bishops about selecting twelve monasteries where boys would be piously and holily educated in all kinds of good letters. This is all we have at present about these matters. A meeting of the nobles, or as we call it, a parliament, is announced for the eighth day of April.</p>
      <p>As for me, I live with the most distinguished and honorable man, Mr. Anthony Aucher, the paymaster of Dover, whose children I educate in humanity. He instructed me to greet you most warmly in his name. I would have gladly sent the gloves, had your letters not reached me late; for the ones you wrote on August 30, I received on February 26. I will send them, however, as soon as the opportunity arises. You will receive from me at this fair through Rayner a golden angelot, to be counted to Christian as you see fit, for his labor. I am now also expecting Bibliander's annotations on Proverbs and Job: I would also like those of yours that remain on the Gospel of John, and those you are now preaching on his epistle. Please greet on my behalf your most chaste wife, dearest mother, sons and daughters, also Rudolf Gwalther, to whom I would have gladly written now, if time had allowed. I am surprised, however, that he did not write to me at this fair; which I would not easily believe, but rather that they were intercepted by some chance on the way. You will give him from me an English shilling, one also to your mother and one to your wife, as a token of our old and perpetual friendship. For your most welcome gift, namely the books sent through Froschauer, we give great thanks: we expect them at this fair through Rayner, who will give Froschauer a pair of Oxford gloves for you. This is rather my employer's little gift than mine: for he gave it to me for this purpose a little before I wrote this. Live well. Farewell most happily. February 26. Yours entirely, NICHOLAS PARTRIDGE.</p>
      <p>Please also greet on my behalf that distinguished assembly of most learned men, those venerable elders, Mr. Pellican and Mr. Leo, the most learned Bibliander, Mr. Megander, Mr. Ammianus, Mr. Binder, etc. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, let these be delivered, in Zurich.</p>
