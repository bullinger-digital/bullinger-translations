      <p>S. I have received your letter written on the 14th of this month.</p>
      <p>I did not see the envoys of the Duke of Savoy passing through here. From them, I suppose you have understood what they have decided to request from the Swiss; if they refer everything to legitimate judgment, all controversies will be easily settled among good and prudent men. It is certain that the Emperor has obtained five hundred thousand florins; but he asks that everyone obligate themselves in full and one for another, which they will very reluctantly concede. This should have been concluded on the 20th of this month.</p>
      <p>A hundred thousand are contributed against the Muscovite, to whom a delegation is sent.</p>
      <p>Augustus has settled the controversy raised between the Palatine and the Bavarian by burning their instruments. I have also sent your writing translated into French and both the Latin and French versions are excellently illustrated; how much it will have benefited we will understand later, when the opportunity and convenient time present themselves. Since you wish me to share my trifles with you, I am sending them to Fulgon to interpret for you; for if I had had leisure, I would have translated them somehow; I have not yet put the final touch on them, waiting for leisure. You can add or diminish what seems appropriate; for I greatly desire your judgment in this matter before I share it with friends.</p>
      <p>I had intended to send it to you when I had more leisure and had reviewed it; but for your kindness and friendship, you will excuse everything. What you write about England and Scotland, I have received from others to be very true; I think there are no disturbances or defections in France, nor are the leaders alien to peaceful counsels. We must pray to God that he may turn everything to the glory of his name and to the salvation of his people and the propagation of his word. I wish to understand what the Savoyards have obtained from yours. Greet Mr. Martyr and Mr. Gualter and friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, August 25th.</p>
      <p>The people of Basel have judged against the Bernese in favor of the Genevans. Philip has set out for Spain.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, if his own.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
