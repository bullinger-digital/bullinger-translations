      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I received your letters, most honorable and learned man, almost at the same time; and as they greatly delighted me, they also made me more and more obliged to you. For not only did you recommend my book to the printer for publication, but you also chose a man to oversee the work in whom I recognize utmost fidelity, remarkable learning, and uncommon affection towards me. May God Himself abundantly repay you, for I cannot do so. I also thank you because, although the characters are confused and difficult to read, and perhaps somewhere the writing is found to be erroneous, and there is more labor in the work than I thought, you nevertheless did not refuse to undertake such a difficult task. Therefore, again I pray to God that He Himself may reward such great labors, since I cannot even give thanks worthy of them.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you sent a gift, namely the fifth decade of your pious prayers, and the agreement on the sacramental matter between you and Calvin. I have not yet received the decade; therefore, since I have not been able to read it, I have nothing certain to write back about it: but I can promise myself nothing else about it, except that it is pious, learned, erudite, and greatly useful for edification.</p>
      <p>What you have established among yourselves concerning the sacrament of the Eucharist is indeed very pleasing to me; and I wish for nothing more than that there be clear and explained doctrine on this matter in the Church of Christ; as far as I am concerned, I go with hands and feet into this same opinion, and I teach almost nothing else here when the Lord's Supper is either discussed or disputed. However, you could not believe how sharply, obstinately, persistently, and with a determined mind the adversaries resist, especially on this point.</p>
      <p>The devil cannot endure that these seals of God's promises be cleansed; for he sees clearly that, once they are recalled to their native chastity and sincerity, a great part of superstitions will be overthrown. I spare no dangers or labors to defend this sound doctrine: and unless God Himself were present, who strengthens me, I sometimes do not know how I could stand; but as I greatly trust in your prayers, so I also do not doubt that I am greatly helped by them.</p>
      <p>I believe you have been informed by others about the case of our mutual friend, the Bishop of Gloucester: I never failed him at that time with whatever means I could, which he felt and saw; hence he is now well, and has returned to his bishopric: which I sufficiently foresaw would happen, and therefore I gave you good hope of his liberation in my letters.</p>
      <p>He now diligently preaches to the sheep entrusted to him by the Lord; and it is hoped that this will not be without fruit, because he has an attentive, frequent, and diligent audience for his sermons. Therefore, be free from all fear concerning him, and, as I believe you do, help him with your prayers. A little before Easter, he was here with me in Oxford for three days, together with Michael Coverdale, a diligent preacher and well-deserving of the evangelical cause. Both preached to our people in Oxford, and attended my public interpretations of the Epistle to the Romans: we mutually encouraged each other in the Lord as friends, and pursue each other with the greatest charity and union.</p>
      <p>I believe you are not unaware of a certain quarrelsome doctor from Oxford, who left England, having already recanted his superstitions more than once, now having written against the most reverend Archbishop of Canterbury about the sacrament of the Eucharist; also against me, both concerning the celibacy of the clergy and justification. The Lord Archbishop is now responding to him; I will write an apology on both heads for the next autumn holidays. I say this so that you may understand the reason why I do not have time to respond to him now with frankness about traditions: otherwise, I would have been eager to do so promptly, as you kindly advised.</p>
      <p>I will assist the young men you sent to us with all the favor and charity I can: I pray to the immortal God that their progress may meet your expectations and our wishes.</p>
      <p>Lord Cox has discussed them with me, and he will see to it that they are properly cared for. I write nothing about your others who were here before; for I think they will write more about themselves. They are good, in good health, and my help is always available and ready for them.</p>
      <p>I think you heard about the death of Mr. Bucer long before: on the day before the Kalends of March, he departed to God, whom he had long served diligently. Thus the church is disarmed of its most learned ministers and veteran soldiers. This is easily apparent from the recruits who fill the place in the battle line. Nothing troubles me more than that the church suffers such a shortage of ministers. Very few are willing to face dangers and undertake the defense of Christ's cause. The University of Cambridge must be helped promptly; but how easy it is to devise a good plan, I cannot yet perceive. Would that what is sought could be obtained from you! May God keep you safe for the church for a long time! I wish all your fellow ministers to be greeted in the Lord. Farewell and love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>Oxford, April 25, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor and most vigilant bishop of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and dearest brother.</p>
