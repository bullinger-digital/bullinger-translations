      <p>When we had intended to write to your paternity much earlier, we were hindered by frequent and almost infinite business, as is usual for those (as you know) who make more frequent changes of places: but thus God willed to exercise us, and this very necessity of our church demanded, that we who previously enjoyed the greatest freedom with you with no small literary quiet, now in turn through the magnitude of business can scarcely obtain the leisure to write a single letter. Therefore, we will not doubt that you will bear our tardiness in writing with an even mind, after you have weighed the gravity of our necessities, and have recognized our affection, love, and charity towards you, according to our small means: which, because we could not signify to you in any other way, we preferred to do so at least by letters, and indeed those given to you, late rather than never. But if we were to attempt here to recount all the benefits you have bestowed upon us, it would perhaps be too ungrateful for you, who prefer to be active in doing good rather than to be considered famous, and more than enough troublesome for us. For what counsels, what great consolations, how many aids would have to be recounted here! You are the one who has reconciled the minds of your people to us, who have made the munificence of the magistrates towards us to be extended. Not content with helping us with domestic and native offices in Zürich, you also took care to spread the liberality of others unknown to us towards us everywhere by letters sent from afar. What is more, you also wished to reach our homeland with your writings, even to our patrons, by whose work we were assisted, so that you would not be lacking as an instigator to them in such a pious purpose, nor to us, so that we would not be deprived of their work, you would not be an assistant? Indeed, we can more easily recount these things than respond to you in any part. Therefore, we commend you and your ministry to God, who will repay you on that day.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we beg this work from you to be granted to us, that you take care to give thanks to the whole senate, worthy and greater than those which we could comprehend in a small letter in exile, and act with them most diligently in our name, (for we do not hope here for such great and so continued peace, by which there can be any change of things, before we are given the free power to return to our homeland,) so that if by chance such a change occurs, by which we are expelled from these seats, it may be allowed and possible to freely seek and obtain a quiet seat with you. But neither do we fear about you nor about those good men, that you will be ready to provide this. Meanwhile, in the name of all of us, you will greet your most holy wife, and all the ministers of the word with you, our revered teachers, Lords Pellicanus, Bibliander, Gualther, Lavater, Simler, Zwingli, Haller, Frisius, Johannes ab Ulmis, Stumphius, and others, as you can through business. We do not think Lord Gesner, whose benefits towards us were infinite, should be passed over; both Froschauer, and their wives, whose offices towards us rather require our letters than greetings, we thought should be greeted at this time only, because we could not write more through business. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen.</p>
      <p>Feb. 3, in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours, most devoted, Robert Horne, Richard Chamber, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend Father Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a man of utmost piety and learning, let these letters be delivered. Zürich.</p>
