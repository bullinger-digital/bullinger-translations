      <p>I have been away from home for a while, occupied with the visitation of the churches in our jurisdiction, which is why I am writing later. I have already discussed the matter of the people of Lucerne with the leaders of the city, with the utmost faithfulness I could, and I am glad to see that our senate is also interposing its efforts and authority, which I hope will be effective enough, especially with the support of the other evangelical orders, to at least obtain some mitigation of the fury. I have received the money in good faith, and I have willingly performed my duty, ready to do more, as I should, if the opportunity arises. I have not yet seen your relative, whom, as soon as he arrives, I will not allow to lack my assistance. There is no news here now, because there is complete silence about Albert's expedition, although they say that the fortress of Hohen-Landenberg has been occupied by the confederate enemies and that 50 war cannons were found in it, and now the siege of Schweinfurt is being prepared again.</p>
      <p>Count Palatine Otto indicates that the diet will proceed and is contemplating the use of the baths this summer; however, he is acquiring cattle and shepherds from Switzerland, which suggests that he predicts and expects some peace in Germany this year. Let us pray to the Lord that it may be intact and long-lasting. If you have any news from elsewhere, I ask you to inform me. Live and farewell with your wife, children, and all your household. Basel, April 26, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>My colleagues greet you respectfully.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
