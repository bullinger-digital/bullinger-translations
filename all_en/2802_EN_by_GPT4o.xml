      <p>S. Regarding our Vergerio, the situation is as I wrote, about which you should have no doubt. Here are his own words from the last letter he sent me in Italian on August 20th when he was in Reutlingen:</p>
      <p>Your letter came to me as if by chance, a friend of mine found it alone, alone in the hands of I don't know who in Schaffhausen, and what a scandal it would have been if it had fallen into the hands of one of the adversaries? What opinion would they have formed of the Jurisconsult (Gribaldo) and of me? etc.</p>
      <p>I therefore suspect the letters went astray, which, since it happened without any fault of yours, I think there is no reason to complain to Vergerio about it.</p>
      <p>As for Gribaldo, to fully understand what the controversy here was, not so much with Calvin, whom he only spoke to once during his last departure, but with the Italian church or rather with all good people, I am sending you his profession of faith regarding God, the persons of the Trinity, and both natures of Christ. If anyone had also inquired about the Holy Spirit, it is easy to guess what monstrous things he would have answered.</p>
      <p>From these, you will understand how he confesses God as one and triune, Christ as God and man: you will also understand how sincerely he detests the errors of Servetus in his heart. As far as I know, I have never seen the man. But since he wrote these things with his own hand, of which I am sending you a copy, I cannot but execrate his abominable errors as much as the devil himself(?). If I seriously learn that he has repented, I will certainly rejoice from the heart, but if not, I wish this pestilence and all supporters of his errors to be known to all the churches of God, so that they do not deceive good men, and I will diligently work to ensure this happens. However, I will write to Vergerio first and send these same things to him to understand what can be hoped for from him. Patience is indeed needed, I admit. But these things seem to me to be clearer and more evident than that anyone, even once warned, could err in them out of simplicity. You also see from what is reported from Poland that Satan has already gathered his forces for the restoration of these heresies. Hence those axioms, which the excellent man Franciscus Lismaninus shared with us, agree so much with Gribaldo's confession that they could almost seem to have been copied by him: Satan is so consistent with himself whenever he pleases.</p>
      <p>Therefore, not only great prudence but also diligence is needed to counteract the emerging evils. However, you will understand what we think about these matters from our common writing, which we are sending to Lismaninus to be delivered to our brothers in Poland, and we do not doubt that we have this profession of our faith in common with you and with all the faithful.</p>
      <p>About the Genevans, I believe our D. Calvin has written to you extensively. We here are also diligently engaged, especially D. Viret, whom those exiles(?) do not hesitate to openly accuse as a scoundrel and traitor. They also add that he went to Geneva at Calvin's instigation to extort accusations against the exiles from the captives through flattery. Thus Viret was forced to set a date for them. The case is being publicly tried, and Viret is not given more consideration than if he were an unknown man and of such a kind that suspicions of such great crimes could fall on him. But the Lord, I hope, will eventually remedy these stumbling blocks. We indeed must strive towards the goal through good and bad reputation.</p>
      <p>In France, the churches continue with truly admirable zeal. The Parisians are requesting a new minister, whom we hope to send shortly. But see to it that this is not spread. For among the faithful, many sin daily out of simplicity by indiscreetly blurting out such things, and there are also many notable hypocrites, of which we experience many here daily. Whatever you learn about that noble boy, write to us. Our Berald, although still unknown to you, but truly worthy of your love, sends you many greetings along with our entire church. Farewell, my best brother. I sincerely pray to the Lord Jesus to keep you safe and bless you more and more each day. I ask you to greet all colleagues accurately in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, on the first of January.</p>
      <p>Th. Beza, your most devoted son in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of God, D. Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered father and the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
