      <p>S. A monk came to us here from France; he spoke with Viret and others in Lausanne, but he did not bring any testimony from them or others. He stayed with us for a few days, during which he seemed to us to be very eager for the truth; for although he still hesitates in some matters, he desires to be educated, so it does not seem that we should have a completely bad hope for him. We recommended him to our senate, but apart from travel expenses, we obtained nothing for him. Therefore, it seemed to him to go to Zürich. He asked me to recommend him to you; therefore, do what seems right to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family. Bern, the day before the calends of December 1551. We await your advice on the Geneva matter.</p>
      <p>The city of Geneva also sent its own messenger on this matter, whom I believe has already reached you. We will decide nothing until we understand what pleases you. The day before yesterday, the wives of Mecardi and Dachseri arrived here, who all, together with Musculus, send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his venerable lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
