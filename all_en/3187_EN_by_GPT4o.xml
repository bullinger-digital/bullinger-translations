      <p>Greetings in the Lord. With great joy of heart, I received your letter, my venerable and dearest brother, and I am even more overwhelmed by this as a happy omen, that I have found both the opportunity and the courage to write to you, such a great man, but a most humane brother, more often in the future. Now, furthermore, I want you to know that I have seriously and diligently dealt with the nobleman from Habsburg these days about your relative, to see if he can be provided for anywhere through the marquisate.</p>
      <p>This Habsburgian indeed promises all his efforts to us and orders us to expect his advice and response soon.</p>
      <p>The matter of receiving the English exiles was discussed by the brothers before I returned from Konstanz; but they suffered rejection at our magistrate, certainly to the great groan and lament of the brothers and all the pious. Finally, upon my return, I attempted the matter again with the advice of the brothers before the senate, so that at least a place might be given to those who were already on their journey; for it would be cruel inhumanity if they were cast out, and that scandal would be placed before all Christians. But in vain we rolled this stone: for they were given no more than what is permitted to the most disgraceful rabble of people flocking here; namely, that they should not be barred from public inns. O my brother! How blind and how impious they must be, who so rashly, so irreligiously (not to add anything else), repel from themselves and their own such a great blessing of the Lord offered to them, with such grave offense to the churches of God! Indeed, what has returned to the Bernese, we rejoice as much for them and the exiles as we rightfully deplore our own miseries. Pray to God for us: for unless He helps our afflicted affairs, I see all our matters rushing to worse. Farewell well, esteemed brother, and may the Lord repay you abundantly for the honor and benefits recently bestowed upon me: may He strengthen both your church and your republic in all good. Amen.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 17, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours in all things in Christ, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in both piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and very dear brother.</p>
