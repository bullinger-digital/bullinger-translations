      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Once again we see how the Lord does not wish His work to be advanced by extraordinary means. But may the Lord drive away that Satan from among you, who persuades you to so greatly abhor the fellowship of the saints, with whom you wish to be united in the Lord. He sees that he cannot break those who are united. Therefore, he strives to separate them. Oh, your council does not seem to be like itself. But even if all the Bernese were to desert, I see that the Lord has given them at least one true consul, a true David, a true Hezekiah, so that I do not doubt the Lord will be remarkably present with them. Let us pray to the Lord to be with everyone!</p>
      <p>I have the best hopes for Leo Jud. He is now in temptation. He will recover.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>The whole of Dinkelsbühl has turned to the gospel, even if in a Lutheran way. Münster is in miserable turmoil. We advise them with great effort.</p>
      <p>Greet the excellent Pelican, to whom I will write back another time. Now it is truly not possible. Nothing about the emperor's arrival. What the pope is doing with the French has not yet erupted. Christ is our king. In Him, we will eternally conquer.</p>
      <p>The day before the calends of December.</p>
      <p>Your M. B.</p>
      <p>To the most pious Heinrich Bullinger, Evangelist of Zurich, esteemed brother. Zürich.</p>
