      <p>Greetings. I could not have the news sooner; otherwise, I would have responded to yours earlier, especially regarding that matter about which I write in the enclosed. As for the rest, I am expecting our copies daily. I have learned how you have agreed with Froschauer, and I thank you for your efforts. Indeed, I do not desire so many copies; how could I distribute them all here? However, whatever pleases you will also please me. If I had 50 copies or at least 25 of the first edition and as many of the second, 5 in the Swiss dialect and 20 in Latin, I would be content. If Froschauer had been willing to give something for the rest, I would have asked for nothing except perhaps a larger format German Bible, since I have greatly soiled my Bible in collecting these proofs. However, since you have agreed with him in this way, I am very content, and if anything else seems appropriate to you, act according to your judgment. I ask that through this messenger, if you have not sent them through another in the meantime, I may receive the copies; for he will undertake to carry them if they are handed over to him. As for other matters, we have nothing new from France, except that they say the son of the captive elector, along with two other German princes, is in France and has obtained a large sum of money from the king for undertaking a war against the Emperor, and that this war is already in preparation in Saxony. Meanwhile, it is written from Augsburg that Johann Friedrich is mortally ill, and not without suspicion of poison. Schertlius still remains in France. Myconius or Gastius can inform you about the captive from Basel. Here, there is nothing new, except that Treasurer Haller has resigned his office; he was succeeded by Pandereta Dilger, a man outstanding in body and mind. From Geneva, I have nothing certain yet about what is happening in the case of Hieronymus. Farel was here a few days ago, but he himself has not yet learned anything. Our people, Musculus, Wittenbach, etc., send their greetings to you. Greet all yours in my name, as well as the lords and brothers, Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther, and... I, my wife, and children wish you and all your people a happy and prosperous year. Given in Bern, January 7, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
