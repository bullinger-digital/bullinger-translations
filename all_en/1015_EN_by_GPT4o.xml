      <p>S. I am quite satisfied with the matter of WÃ¤denswil. I thank you for informing me about it; it was indeed troublesome that a dispute had arisen; I did not hope that it would come to such an end.</p>
      <p>From Gast's letters, we have learned almost nothing new, although you have more fully.</p>
      <p>We had heard about the parish of St. George, in which fourteen hundred people took communion. The treasurer known to you had told about the Spanish tumult. You said nothing about the Bishop of Augsburg: he preached; the argument was: a return to the Catholic Church and the Interim should be more fully accepted and observed; for the holy martyrs shed their blood for it. The latter is said to have been received with great laughter by the listeners.</p>
      <p>The last thing you wrote about Lumpenberg was immediately read to the old consul (with whom that reading provided me lunch). He understood well, as he himself attended the most recent assembly. He whispered certain things about the whole business, from which it seemed that the established plan should not be departed from, as it is from the advice of the confederates in an action quite similar to when Faber, the late Bishop of Vienna, had invaded the same provostship. For then all the confederates took the matter upon themselves as if it were their own, wrote to the Emperor about it, and everything found tranquility.</p>
      <p>The envoys also approved at the recent assembly before the last; I do not know what has happened, that the new envoys are preparing something quite different. In my view, they have no cause except religion. Therefore, we resolve to commit the whole matter to God, just as we commit ourselves along with all our actions to Him.</p>
      <p>However, the matter has not yet reached the council; perhaps they will deliberate otherwise, etc.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the Emperor and the Pope have found a council, by which they attempt to eradicate the Gospel of Christ. Let it be as it seems to the Lord; only may He grant us constancy in His word. Letters have finally arrived here from Italy: everything that can bear arms is being stirred up towards Genoa; for a great loss was suffered by the Emperor's fleet and the leader was driven into a certain corner, where he would be captured unless help is provided.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ with your family and all of mine. Basel, on the first of September, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
