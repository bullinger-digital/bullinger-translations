    <p xml:id="regest1">Two questions: 1. What is Bullinger's opinion on the practice of communion for the sick introduced by Oecolampadius in Basel, but rather disapproved by the people of Bern? 2. Is it true that in Zurich the previous regulation on grain sales was repealed at the request of the farmers? And following that: What does Bullinger think about the interest rate issue? In Strasbourg, the synod attempted to cleanse the church of Anabaptists and other sectarian groups. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I ask two things of you. First, that you write what you think, whether we rightly or wrongly follow the practice of Oecolampadius in administering the bread and cup of the Lord to the dying or sick. For I see that this displeases the people of Bern. The reason for this practice does not seem objectionable to me. It provides comfort to the living about the deceased, that he will die happily, having testified his faith with such a sign at the end of life. Second, whether the regulation on grain revenues purchased with money has been abolished. For it has been entirely reported to us with the reason added that the farmers have requested it. If you add your judgment on the issue of interest, you will do me a favor. For in recent days we have dealt with our deputies on this matter. I love to know the opinions of many on such causes. Nothing seems more difficult today than dealing with money and wealth, although nothing is easier for me, according to the precept of charity, but I do not easily express it until I hear someone agreeing.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the people of Strasbourg, having held a synod, attempted to cleanse their church. Scarcely anywhere else is there a greater force of weeds. They had many Anabaptists, also those denying the divinity of Christ, that there are no demons, that the body of Christ buried is cursed just like our bodies, and countless such things. I hope that once that city is cleansed, it will be of greater use to the republic of Christ than it has been so far.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family, Utinger, Leo, and all.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 19, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your O. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, his very dear friend and lord.</p>
