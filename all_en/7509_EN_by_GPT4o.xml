      <p>Regarding the new matters of France that you wrote about, I have understood. However, I grieve for the so perverse changes of the wealthy kingdom... After I sent my last letter to you, this new event occurred, as follows: A synod was held in S-chanf (this place is in our Upper Engadine valley, where I reside) by the ministers of our religion. And so, when they were returning home, a certain Franz Keller, a man of mature age and fearless spirit, who therefore dared to profess the gospel especially in Morbegno, where the evangelical doctrine is more attacked than elsewhere in our entire Rhaetia, was, I say, captured by some who had laid traps for him as he was about to descend from the borders of the Clavenna jurisdiction into the territory of Traona, and was taken to Milan (as we now learn) and designated to the inquisitor of malignant depravity, etc. Indeed, this detestable act, more than sufficiently hostile and violent, was greatly displeasing to our regions, and indeed some monks of Morbegno, who are thought to be accomplices in the deed (although it is not certain), would have been severely treated, had not the senior calmed the people's impulse with counsel. Therefore, it has been decreed that a distinguished delegation is to be sent to Milan to demand the detained, and my son-in-law, Lord Baptista von Salis, the judge and landamman, has been elected. These three will immediately prepare for the journey, as it has been entrusted to them. Meanwhile, the officials have been ordered to take a pledge from the monks, so that they do not absent themselves under severe penalty. We are therefore waiting to see what response our delegation will bring. If they do not return the captive, I truly fear our countrymen will become more restless.</p>
      <p>In Chur, Rhaetia, at midnight, on the 22nd of June, 1568.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it has been concluded in these assemblies that, if that captive is not given to our delegates, as soon as they return, a general diet of all Rhaetia will be convened.</p>
