      <p>S. D. I have received your sermons on the Apocalypse, my honorable lord and compater, and I am now engaged in reading them; I have now completed three parts, the fourth remains. Musculus follows me in reading. After we have read them, we will write to you. I truly give thanks to the Lord, for besides other benefits, which he daily provides in various ways to his church, he has also added this, that he deigns to reveal those marvelous and fateful mysteries to you, and also that he deigns to do this through you and has bestowed such gifts upon you, that you have been able to handle these otherwise obscure matters, which have caused much trouble to great men, with such ease, clarity, and perspicuity.</p>
      <p>Indeed, you have inflicted an immense wound on the antichristian church with this work. However, I do not know what to write about the printer: he wants and does not want; he fears something, and Froschauer seems to be pursuing his own affairs with many, as he urges so diligently that it should not be printed under his or the name of the city of Zürich. I do not doubt that all the papists will take this writing very badly; they will gnash their teeth in a remarkable way. For they will see their filth in this mirror. But also the description of the Roman Empire will bite many. Meanwhile, however, the truth cannot be silenced or suppressed. Therefore, whether it is published here or in Zürich, it matters little; as long as it is with the promotion of the truth. Meanwhile, if there were any deceit involved, I would not want any trouble for our people; for I know well enough that among our people this would all have to be endured. You will therefore decide about it. Otherwise, it pleases me that you dedicate it to our people. If you wish to write to the school authorities, you can, since the reading of the books has been entrusted to them. However, there is something I should remind you of: in the number of sermons, something has been neglected by you, which, however, is of no consequence in itself and can be easily corrected; for the first part contains 22 sermons, the second begins with 23 and ends with 50; the third now begins with 52, and thus one number has been omitted, and the following numbers will have to be corrected in this manner. I only wanted to remind you of this, since you write that the number of sermons will be 100 or 101, so that you can divide it into the number 99 or complete it to the hundredth, if it seems so.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I am returning the letters of the Count of Württemberg; they will deal with Sultzer, and I fear that he, a disciple of Bucer, may eventually introduce a new Buceranism to the churches. Therefore, caution must be exercised in time and prudence must be used. They say much about the assembly of the learned; but unless everything is well considered beforehand, nothing will be accomplished. I know the stubbornness of the Lutherans, as I have also been among them. May the Lord help his church and keep us from evil! We have nothing new.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you. I will take care to have the other letters you sent delivered to Geneva.</p>
      <p>Bern, November 28, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compater. Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>November 28, 1556.</p>
