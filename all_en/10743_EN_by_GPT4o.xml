    <p xml:id="regest1">His inquiry about new works by Pellican was prompted by a remark from Nikolaus Pfister. [Antoni] Bischoff has been unexpectedly pardoned, while other rebels have since left the city. Haller hopes for agreement on matters of faith from the upcoming meeting [of representatives of Swiss churches]. He has requested the Apology [by Bibliander] because he is not gifted in writing himself. He approves the outcome of the Aarau theologians' convention but advocates for clarity and simplicity and again criticizes the Formula of Concord [discussed in Aarau]. Bullinger is more capable than others to take on the matter. Vadian should also be involved. The exiled [Solothurners] have published a defense document. He requests the forwarding of a letter to Vadian and information about the Zurich surgeon. The Bernese envoys have broken off negotiations with the Duke [of Savoy] because he was not willing to allow the Genevans to keep their faith. Bern has rejected the standstill agreement desired by the Duke and, after consulting with Geneva and Basel, has terminated the alliances with Savoy. Bernese mercenaries participated in a sortie in Geneva. The Baron of La Sarra ambushed about a hundred French riders advancing to support Geneva; two captains who escaped to Geneva were mistreated there because they were not recognized. Further [French] reinforcements are said to be on the way.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You respond to everything and omit nothing that could serve me, dearest brother. I will now respond to yours, so that there may never be an end to writing, since there is nothing that more relieves the mind burdened by the weight of the body than when I receive friendly consolation from you.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus Balingius had already reported that Pellican's register and his annotations on the New Testament were to be prepared for the press. I did not want to keep it from you, especially since I know Pellican is so closely connected to you that all plans are shared between you both. No one who reads with judgment fails to appreciate your work, which you have begun to meditate on in Paul. If anyone desires the judgments of the ancients, the variation of languages, the property and scheme of even the most obscure places, coherence, the state of arguments, the just occasion of teaching and reproving that the context provides, certainly, where they pay attention, they will find it with you. For I see that you have diligently reviewed both ancient and modern writers. You will be relieved of this burden when you have completed it. I regret, for my part, that everything is being printed in one volume, but I will take care in the meantime to remove that regret.</p>
      <p>You will expect nothing more from me about the Bishopric. I see that letters are not safe. He has been released and freed from death by many prayers, whose death the public expected to be announced by sentence for two days, but in vain. True Catilines voluntarily exile themselves from the city. Their oligarchy was so powerful that they were not immediately apprehended while present. They can no longer be captured, but they can still harm greatly.</p>
      <p>I am glad that a meeting is to be held. I wish it would produce as much benefit as I desire! Nor would I wish to be more anxious than necessary about ceremonies, but rather about the conformity of doctrines, although I know our magistrates will miss it greatly.</p>
      <p>I had written about this apology, for which you once promised to come to Bern, namely of all the doctrines and rites of your church. You know yourself how limited my resources are in writing. The Lord has given the spirit, but I lack many gifts. For this reason, I always wish to see yours and others' work, so that, aided by their efforts, I neglect nothing for my church.</p>
      <p>You ask for my judgment on what your people and the Baselers wrote from Aarau. Will a pig judge Minerva? They seem pious, learned, and true enough; I understood Grynaeus' style and spirit even while lying down reading, as Megander lectured. I do not doubt that the learned of this age can write most learnedly on this matter, yet I wish, for my modesty, that everything would be directed so clearly, simply, and openly, so that our mind, faith, and doctrine could be grasped by all, as we believe it in our hearts and confess it with our mouths. I fear we confuse ourselves too much and strive too much in explaining the eating of the body of Christ and the sacrament, I fear we obscure the matter with the variety of certain words, so that in the end no one knows what we mean. In the third article of the Lutheran Concord they say: "The body and blood of the Lord, with bread and wine, are truly and substantially handed over, yet in a heavenly and divine manner." If you understand this in a supernatural and ineffable way, where will it be proven by scriptures? But if by faith, why is it not written more clearly for the unknown? In short: How can this amphibological obscurity in such an open matter ever be commended by lovers of truth? Cursed be the charity that detracts from truth and faith! The third article is such that I would rather believe it to be a monster than the foundation of concord, unless I have misunderstood it, as I always fear. Hence I write to you alone. If we confess that Christ is present to us and given and exhibited in the supper of the faithful, why do we not explain the mode of presence, giving, and exhibition with express words and not suspend the reader with amphibology? They will say the second article is the explanation of the first, but it explains in such a way that I rather entangle myself. The learned perhaps are accustomed to speak thus, I, always having been behind my furnace, sometimes do not understand myself. But you, to whom a special grace has been given by the Lord above others to propose everything most clearly, will also now apply yourself to this, so that you may lend your talent entrusted to you to us, who are in the Helvetians. I would not want Vadian to be absent at all.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, as I am always in poor health, may you fare most happily with your wife, children, family, and colleagues.</p>
      <p>On the very day of birth.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. Hall.</p>
      <p>A certain German apology has been published in print in the name of the exiles, which, unless I certainly believed it to be with you for a long time, I would have sent it. But if you lack it, I will send it with the next messenger.</p>
      <p>Ensure that these my letters are delivered to Vadian by a certain messenger. I seek his advice on my hernia. Describe to me your surgeon; for I dare not trust our Rudolf.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, his dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Genevans, the situation is as follows: As our envoys had orders, before revealing their instructions to the Duke, the Genevans, who want to remain a free imperial city, by their faith, he, along with his councilors and the Emperor's envoy, rejected it politely and requested that our envoys give their faith in writing, which our envoys refused and replied that our faith is contained in the divine biblical writings of the Old and New Testaments; considering well, there are enough Bibles in Savoy, Piedmont, etc. In short: Our envoys, who had no other orders than to have an answer regarding the faith and then to reveal further, the Duke wanted to know the entire instruction and finally to speak about the faith, which our envoys refused, returned home.</p>
      <p>With them, the Duke sent his envoy back to Bern, requesting a standstill for 6 months, which my lords did not grant, but wrote to the Genevans politely, and how it went at the meeting in Aigle, and informed them that in this dangerous time, for many reasons, they would not be willing to help and draw them with any military force, they may accept or act on this standstill as they please. To which they replied, they could well recognize that they could not compel the Bernese according to the rights of the city, as it is not in their power. However, they would make many friendly promises to them, if they accepted God's word, and they accepted that, here with Freiburg and other friends, they must let go, urging my lords by Christian love not to abandon them. For this, my lords sent an envoy to Basel, requesting their report on all matters and their advice. What was advised or answered to my lords, I do not know. But all alliance letters, which the city of Bern had with the Duke and the house of Savoy for 200 years, were canceled, handed over to his envoys before the councilors and citizens, annulled and given out. And although the envoy did not want to take them, I think they will be sent to the Duke by a riding messenger. What will come of it, I commend to God. How the Genevans were answered, I have not understood (heard). But I know this, how the Duke had some troops lying near the city of Geneva, who dealt badly with poor people, cutting off the women's clothes, sending them home in all the cold.</p>
      <p>Then there are 45 soldiers, Bernese and others, in Geneva, paid by them, who, along with others, have fallen out and do so daily, having skirmished for two hours with 500 Savoyards, killing nine of them, but not one of theirs was injured, despite being shot at a lot. There is great misery and distress not only among the Genevans but also among the Duke's poor people, who are also being ruined here.</p>
      <p>Then some Frenchmen on horseback, I think about 100, wanted to move to Geneva to help them, the Lord of La Sarra, a Savoyard and daring warrior, caught them in the mountains, surrounded them from front and back, captured about fifty of them, as their horses were exhausted, having not been fed for 16 miles. In this group of Frenchmen are 2 captains, both themselves 12, from the others separated, came to the city of Geneva, not recognized by the soldiers and badly beaten, until they revealed their intentions; they are now also in the city of Geneva, well provided with money. There is a rumor that 4,000 foot soldiers are to follow them, but I know nothing certain. I have no more news to know from these times. Do not wish to spread them dangerously.</p>
      <p>Given on December 28th.</p>
