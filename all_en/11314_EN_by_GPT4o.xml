    <p xml:id="regest1">Praises Bullinger's benevolence, of which all his writings testify, especially his letter from the previous year. Bertlin's opponent, who slandered him to the council and Bishop [Christoph von Stadion], received the parish of Waltenhofen; he himself was appointed as a deacon in F체ssen, where he was able to begin promising work alongside Pastor [Johannes Schallheimer] and Schoolmaster [Benedikt Negelin]. He relies on the writings of the Zurichers; wishes for Bullinger's commentaries on the Gospels and Paul's letters as well as his book "De origine erroris" and inquires about further works. Asks for a favorable reception of his letter. Greetings. Several like-minded individuals urge him to convey greetings. The exegetical writings of Zwingli and Oecolampadius should be fully published, which would benefit not only the printers but also the church.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your kindness and benevolence, most learned Bullinger, towards all who are devoted to true piety is such that you have not disdained even me, the least of all and a man of no account, but have diligently urged me through writing, exhorting, and pressing, that I may not only persist in the truth I have recognized but also continue in it.</p>
      <p>This is evident both from your public writings, published for the glory of the highest God and the advancement of His holy church, briefly for the benefit and most present peace of the Christian world, and from the letters you have sent to others and to me, especially this one, which you gave last year to our Peter, full of Christian consolation and encouragement (as I was laboring under the cross). Good God, how I received it with a rejoicing heart, read it, reread it, and read it again a hundred times, until at last I exclaimed with Paul: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction" [2 Corinthians 1:3-4] etc.</p>
      <p>But, excellent Bullinger, see in the meantime the wondrous disposition of God the Father and His most merciful hand upon me. That impostor, with his accomplices, denouncing me not only to the magistrate but also to the bishop, who was then present, and to his prefects, wanted me to be banned from water and fire and utterly removed from the world and the number of the living. He, I say, for reasons which neither place nor time allow me to write, was deposed from the parish, which he had seized with the antichristian bull against the protests of all good and pious people, and took up the care of the church in Waltenhofen, which I had presided over in the Lord for nine years, not to restore it, but to destroy it. May God the Father convert the man to His knowledge! I was soon called by the senate of our town and appointed as a deacon of the church, ministering the sacrament and the word. The senate called a young man, indeed in age, but praised for his life, morals, and entire conduct, and most devoted to sacred literature, as pastor. A few days ago, they called a schoolmaster, a native of ours, well-versed in letters, happily studying languages, from Ulm. See the prelude to the story; the Lord will give and soon impose the catastrophe in due time. We earnestly seek, indeed publicly pray for, the purification and restoration of the holy church defiled by the profane Babylonians of Rome.</p>
      <p>For this work, your writings and those of your colleagues in sacred literature will be extremely necessary. Therefore, I have instructed Peter to bring six copies of your commentaries on the Gospels and four on Paul. I have not seen any of the books you wrote on the origin of errors, nor have I been able to obtain any so far. Ah, my Bullinger, how I long to have these, not one, but four copies. You always reply that all are sold out; why do you not press for a second edition? Let me know about Bibliander's commentaries on the prophets, which are available. Regarding weights, measures, studies, etc., about which he promises to write on the last chapters of Ezekiel, if anything has been published, I wish to have it. What you, a man given by God for the restoration of His church, are now laboring on after completing the entire New Testament, and have under the anvil, I wish to know, and not only to know but also to acquire, read, and live by.</p>
      <p>Forgive, I pray, most humane Bullinger, the importunate, unlearned interrupter and thus disturber of your holy vigils. Whatever I write, say, or bring, I do with a sincere, candid, briefly Christian spirit. You, as your candor is towards those devoted to Christ, will receive this my infancy and barbarism with such a spirit and take it in good part.</p>
      <p>I wish you, your household, and especially the entire church of Christ among you to flourish and grow in the peace and faith of the Lord. We pray for the safety of all your colleagues, through whom the Lord wished to rebuild His temple, destroyed, plundered, and burned by the impious Romans, both in spirit and body. May Christ preserve you in His work, increase you, and finally perfect you. Farewell, uniquely beloved among mortals.</p>
      <p>From F체ssen, on the Ides of May, in the year etc. 39.</p>
      <p>Bartholom채us Bertlin, deacon of the church in F체ssen, your disciple at your feet.</p>
      <p>See the threats of the importunate: They wish, indeed urge among us, the most devoted lovers of evangelical truth, that in the name of all these, I may pray for you and all yours, especially for your holy studies, leisure, and advancement as hitherto, among whom especially Mr. Johannes Schallheimer, our upright pastor, mentioned above, Johannes Freiberger, our most praiseworthy consul, Benedikt Negelin, the learned schoolmaster, Gothard Schock, the most faithful defender of the Christian cause, and many others, etc., who have given their names to Christ, having rejected the antichrist. We hope the Lord will increase this number daily.</p>
      <p>It will be our task to labor diligently, plant, and water; the Lord will give the increase. But to what end is my babbling? Farewell and live in Christ perpetually happy as above.</p>
      <p>My lord will not be angry if I add a word: My Bullinger, how is it that you do not have all the canonical books and the vigils and lucubrations of Zwingli and Oecolampadius - oh immortal God, what great men! - compiled and published, since there would be no loss, but rather profit for the printers, and praise for our God, and the most abundant fruit for His church. Therefore, if it can be done in any way, oh Bullinger, ensure that the labors of each are published in a single volume. All of ours thirst for such things. See the thirst of the mountain dwellers!</p>
      <p>Farewell for the third and eternal time.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, vigilant, faithful, and learned bishop of the church in Zurich, his teacher to be observed with all reverence.</p>
