      <p>Celio Secondo Curione through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Even if there was nothing particularly important to write to you about, nevertheless, since a bundle of letters was brought to me in Strasbourg, in which there were letters to you and your son-in-law Lavater, as I believe, along with some others, I did not want to send them without including my own. And so you know on what day they were delivered to me and on what day they were sent to you, know that they were delivered to me today, which is the 27th of May. As soon as I have finished writing this, I will immediately look for someone who is going to Zürich and give them to him to deliver. There is another bundle, as you will see, addressed to Richard Chamber, whom I assume to be an Englishman; it will be your kindness to ensure it is delivered to him. I received your very brief note about the matter I had with my dearest brother Mr. Gwalter long ago; but since I thought there was nothing that required my response, I refrained from bothering you. If in this matter you and he, especially, are satisfied, so that all suspicion about me is removed, I am glad; for there is nothing I desire more than to be approved by you. As for myself, I have long since learned that nothing is better for a man than placability. I therefore thank you for resolving the matter and for wanting to keep my reputation intact. Regarding your love for me, although it was known to me before, Dr. Massarius has made me even more certain of it, both in his letters when I was absent and in person with his words. I will also make an effort, as I have done so far, to respond in love, if not in other matters. Farewell and give our greetings to your family, with your daughters and sons-in-law, most distinguished gentlemen. Massarius sends you his most loving greetings. Farewell again, my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>I suppose you have heard that the English Jezebel was unable to achieve anything in the high council of England, neither to have the pious books and men burned, nor to have the pope's authority restored in England, nor to have Philip of Spain proclaimed as the heir to the English throne, which were the three things she sought and greatly desired. May God assist the miserable kingdom.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, my most esteemed lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
