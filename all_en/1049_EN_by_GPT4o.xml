      <p>Greetings. I cannot thank you enough for taking so much effort to write yourself what you sent to me; I see with what spirit you are towards me, namely the most friendly, not that I did not know this before, but because you have now shown it, much more clearly through the effort undertaken for my sake. But there is another reason from which I know the same, namely that you forbade me to show the entire letter you sent to him, who, however, I know is great, and not without reason, with you. Believe me, I have rejoiced in my heart not simply. You ordered everything to be returned; I would have sent it back immediately, as you had instructed, if the Sunday, which brings us many and serious tasks, had not hindered me. "Nor do you send it now," you say.</p>
      <p>The reason is that I do not know this Pole well enough; I judge him to be good and pious, but otherwise, I do not know what kind of person he is in delivering and returning such letters. I will send it through someone for whom I am without worry.</p>
      <p>This Pole, however, came to me a few days ago in a Franciscan robe, asking me to free him from it; I arranged for him to be supported by the Augustinians for about 14 days, until it was declared by the senate whether he could be sheltered there for the winter. The decision was finally made that due to the scarcity of all things, it could not be done; therefore, having been given two Basel gold coins and having paid the host, he was dismissed and recommended to the Lord. It was uncertain where he should go. I had advised Bern; but shortly after, I dissuaded him because of the plague, although he himself showed that he was not at all afraid of that calamity. Since at this time he could hardly find a place outside of Switzerland, where else could he have gone but to ZÃ¼rich?</p>
      <p>He asked me to commend him to you, which I did all the more willingly, as I was eager to thank you sooner.</p>
      <p>During the days he spent with us, he conducted himself in such a way that he was approved by all of us; he also showed in reality how much zeal he had for divine letters. Therefore, if he could stay in Switzerland for a year, he believes he could gain such judgment and such use of our language that he would not want to be a burden to anyone thereafter. I therefore ask you, as you will be, to find a place for him for the winter at least, where he could be sustained; there is no doubt that whatever is bestowed upon him will be most pleasing to the Lord. Indeed, I said a word or two about Poland. How he rejoiced: "For my homeland," he said, "is healthy in the Lord, and I am healthy in all things; for I would serve no people more willingly than my own."</p>
      <p>About H., I will say one word: I did not think I could conveniently extricate myself from his hands without indicating it to you; for they had first come to him; he saw many things contained in them, and therefore hoped to receive something that was not in yours to him. I finally said that they were the same as what you had written to him; you had ordered me to return everything as soon as possible, and I have done so.</p>
      <p>About Pantaleon and his Chronicles, I wish to hear from you; I have seen them, but read nothing; then I have heard the name Scapeler at some time, but I have not known what kind of person he is until now. They say Mr. Joachim is somewhat disturbed. Farewell with your family and children in the Lord; greet Gwalther and Otto in your leisure; I do not dare to greet Theodor, my contemner, and who would have thought? Basel, October 14, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, theologian, his esteemed in the Lord.</p>
