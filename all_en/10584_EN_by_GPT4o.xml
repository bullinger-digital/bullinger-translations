      <p>Greetings. We received your letter dated February 15th, dearest brothers, on the first of March, in which we understood that you have decided to call a meeting in Zofingen as soon as possible, so that if any discord has arisen, it may be removed through mutual discussion, and our spirits may be bound together again with the bond of peace and love, so that solid concord may exist and remain in the future. We wholeheartedly agree with your decision, since nothing is more important to us than to have any discord, not only towards you, brothers, if there ever was any, but towards all mortals, completely abolished. Indeed, we also implore you through the compassion of our God, not to ever suspect anything alien to sincere love from us. But in the meantime, please understand how our affairs stand. Our Francis, almost worn out by old age, is in poor health day by day, so we do not dare to impose the affairs of the church on him alone. Moreover, Megander and I are so afflicted by the common illness of cough and rheumatism that we are often forced to change roles unexpectedly, so that one who is somewhat well today may be less so tomorrow. We do not have deacons who can satisfy the church in our illness or absence. As a result, we could not announce the day of our meeting before Easter. Nevertheless, as we request a meeting from both sides, we will not fail to attend, but in the meantime, so as not to disturb your Easter synod, we will visit our chapter synods in our usual manner, three in Aargau: in Brugg, Aarau, and Zofingen. From these places, choose one that is most convenient for you, since one of us will visit it, or if you prefer a private and quieter meeting in Zofingen, assign us a day after Easter, and we will attend with the good hope that this meeting of ours will be most beneficial to the entire Christian Republic of Switzerland. Once you have chosen the chapter location in Aargau, indicate the day of your synod, and we will inform you without delay of the day of the chapter meeting. You have all the information. In the meantime, may the Lord keep you all as the most faithful pastors and teachers of His church. Through this messenger, since he will soon return to us, write what you have decided.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brothers in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 8th, 1535.</p>
      <p>Berchtold Haller, in the name of all the brothers.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Leo Jud, and the other colleagues of the church in Zurich, our dearest brothers in the Lord.</p>
