      <p>As I sealed your letter, this was written to me from France verbatim: On the 2nd of February, three cohorts of Italians were intercepted by the prince in Burgundy and cut down to the last man. Again, not far from Nevers on the Loire, Gonzaga, the brother of the Duke of Mantua, who had obtained the favor of our queen two years ago, and the daughter and all the goods of the most noble Duke of Nevers, was also intercepted by the forces of the Condés and was gravely wounded, though he managed to escape despite his injuries; but they say he barely escaped death and that a great slaughter of those most wicked ones was made. Three surgeons were sent from Lyon by arranged horses to him and to the other wounded, to whom that Jesuit Edmund joined himself, so that they might have both spiritual and physical doctors at the same time. It is also confirmed that the town of Blois was captured by the prince, that is, by some part of the garrison of Orléans. Rumor also brings the same news about Tours and that Bourges is now being besieged, with the prince meanwhile heading to Paris. But these are not as certain as the previous ones. Adazeres the apostate, after having attacked Costa, a town on the Rhône, for the third time, which was held by 400 Condés, they went out at night and escaped safely with all the inhabitants. In the morning, he entered the empty city and was horrified; for his soldiers, stirred up by sedition, thought that Adazeres, their leader, was aware of their escape, and all the troops dispersed. You have no doubt heard about the immense fleet of the Turks, which is planning to invade Italy. In Spain, something incredible happened, but nevertheless very certain: Charles, the son of Philip, is plotting the death of his father Philip and is therefore now being guarded; the reason is unknown, but everyone exclaims that it is a great misfortune. These things were sent to me verbatim from France.</p>
      <p>Geneva writes on the 24th of February: It is certain that the man who received your and my letters to your son Christophorus has safely reached the prince's camp; however, we receive no response.</p>
      <p>But not even the most illustrious Prince Palatine, who is here, has received any from his brother Casimir yet. I will send it soon if I receive anything, etc.</p>
