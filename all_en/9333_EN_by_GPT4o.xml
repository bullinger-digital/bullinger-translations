      <p>Greetings. I am returning to you your Rhetica and thank you for it, as does Mr. Steiger, who also read it. In return, I am sending you what I have from the Dauphiné, France, and the Netherlands, most of which is written in the French language, as it was sent here to the lords; for I did not have anyone at hand to interpret it so suddenly; however, you have several there who can understand and interpret it. If I have more, I will send more. That writing of Satan to the king should never have been written or published. It never pleased me; for such writings provoke the wicked more than they edify the good. However, I am not certain about the author of it nor the printer.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I am still writing and walking somehow; therefore, you will forgive me if I am brief.</p>
      <p>Steiger and all of ours send you many greetings in return, as does Mr. Treasurer Manuel.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 26, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
