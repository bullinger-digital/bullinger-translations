      <p> Greetings. I do not cease to trouble you, most esteemed lord, and always take the opportunity to write to you about Italian matters. However, from your long letters, which you sent to me the day before yesterday, I could not understand whether you received my previous ones, in which I enclosed two copies of the latest Italian news. As you wrote that the Frenchman, instead of showing water, presents the fire of destruction, so indeed it happens here. For his interpreter wanted to persuade our people that the king desires nothing but peace and only requests soldiers to protect his borders. He asked for only three banners and, having summoned three heads beyond the usual order, did everything. If the king requests soldiers, he must hold assemblies at his own expense, in which the delegates instructed by the communities either accept or reject the king's request; however, sparing expenses, he summoned only a few heads, who, without holding any assemblies, immediately refer his request to the communities. Our people of Chur did not want to grant him anything. What will happen elsewhere, I do not know. I truly wonder that these men are not ashamed, nor is the magistrate ashamed, that they propose such a question to the people, whether they want to help a robber and a perjured king to destroy the remnants of our brothers, nor did I spare them here when three were to be convened. If many in Rhaetia deny soldiers, it will not be due to piety, but a. because he requested beyond the order, b. because only 3 banners, c. because the leaders are not yet sufficiently greased with gifts. Although I received your letters after my sermon, in which the king's deceit is revealed, I nevertheless communicated the matter itself with the consul, who greets you most kindly. - It is mere collusion that Gantner is acting; he pretended to be about to move and therefore sold cows to acquire greater things for himself. Hence, our people were so struck and received this proposal of his with such a wounded spirit that they allowed him to remain here, even if he abhors participation in the Lord's Supper, and thereby sufficiently declares how alienated he has become from our confession. They think he can easily be tolerated, as long as he does not draw anyone into his opinion with him, as if the example of a minister, even if he were mute, would not be a great scandal and corruption to others due to its enormity and impiety. They would rather expel us than this most cunning and deceitful wolf, and I do not cease to wonder where such impiety and inconsistency in these men will finally erupt. - Our bishop desires, from some letters I do not know, to persuade everyone that Hannibal still survives and did not die from a cannonball wound, and thus dreams of what he would gladly see and wish to be so. </p>
      <p> Now again, the case of the Engadiners is being discussed in the Upper League. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most distinguished man; all of ours greet you respectfully. Most swiftly, 1574, May 25, Chur of the Rhaetians. </p>
      <p> Most subject to your eminence, Tobias Iconius. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zurich, his most reverend lord and father. </p>
      <p> Zurich. </p>
