      <p>I wrote to you through our Musculus, who is now followed by this good brother Rasdorferus, a priest of the church of Kempten, expecting certain exile.</p>
      <p>We will now see Swabia and indeed all of Upper Germany fertile with this kind of proscribed faithful ministers of the churches, unless the Lord timely restrains the most cruelly raging beast. O Lord, see and visit this vineyard, which your right hand has planted, etc. About the matters of the churches of Swabia, which are not so desperate, our Paul here will explain more than you can hear with a calm mind. Let us humbly pray to the heavenly power, that it may very quickly put an end to these unbearable evils and not leave the rod of the wicked upon the lot of the righteous, so that the righteous may not extend their hands to iniquity.</p>
      <p>The town clerk of Lindau returned from Augsburg last Wednesday, having been harshly addressed, he writes that he was among lynxes, foxes, bears, and lions. He was sent back again with harsh threats: he should tell his people that they should consider something else and better.</p>
      <p>As a result, they have increased again on the 6th of July, man to man; what has been decided will come to us tonight; I hope they will stand bravely in God. With us, it is still hard; waiting every day further to see how it will turn out. Everything will be brought to a common decision. I always hope that ours will act decisively and find themselves with God, rather die and perish than bring such disgrace.</p>
      <p>The Reichstag has concluded; the decision has been read; the princes and bishops are departing. The Papists boast of the good decision, which is so unanimous that no one protested against it, and all things are correct; but when they say peace and safety, etc. The emperor still remains in Augsburg; the king is supposed to move down, and some Hungarian lords want to stir up, perhaps awaken a sleeping dog.</p>
      <p>The cities of the Lake Constance region and the Saxon cities do not want to accept the Interim. The bishop of Augsburg is arranging everything again, so that everything is restored, consecrated, and blessed anew. But the Lord, I hope, will destroy everything again with his curse and bring the Antichrist to nothing. Oh, oh, the great lamentable deceit of such a great, respectable community! O happy souls, who expose themselves to danger for the name of their emperor Jesus Christ, while in the meantime we see those who dare to abandon their duty having Nemesis at their back.</p>
      <p>Brentius has escaped, although the Emperor menacingly ordered the people of Halle to bring him to Augsburg, and to be careful not to be reminded, and hence (because the excellent man escaped the hands of the Emperor in the name of the Lord) he was so angry with the people of Halle that suddenly by imperial decrees the entire number of soldiers of twelve banners, which were stationed at Wimpfen and Heilbronn, were transferred to Halle. Thus, we do not avoid what we fear, failing the discipline to which we had given our name as twice-born Christians. Would that we may learn wisdom in time from the misfortunes of others, we who are the remnants of such a great world of men!</p>
      <p>Pray for us with your church and household. Greet the brothers and friends. Ours greet you. 7th of July 1548.</p>
      <p>Take care to burn all our letters, I beseech you by the Lord. I will soon send you all of yours in return, so that you may keep them for me as the most precious treasure, in case our misfortunes do not involve you with us.</p>
      <p>On the 2nd of July, the envoys of the King of Poland came to Augsburg, whose kingdom is associated with 60,000 Tatars; the king, as he had begun, is still diligently mediating the establishment of Christianity among his people.</p>
      <p>The emperor and king have had a mandate read at Zell am Untersee and several other places, that everyone should behave entirely friendly and neighborly with the Confederates and not offend them in any way, etc., with very many beautiful, sweet words. But it is said: Beware of men.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his most venerable and dearest brother Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
