      <p>S. I received both of your letters, dated the penultimate of April and the 4th of May, and there is nothing to which I need to respond, except that Mrs. Musculus is gradually recovering again, praise be to the Lord, although she is still quite weak. She sends her regards to you with all her family. I will take care of what you want me to write to Michael Schlatter.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the king of France wrote to my lord yesterday, among other things, that the Pope himself desires to postpone the opening of the council until the first day of September, so that he can restore Parma to the Roman See. The Emperor does not want to do this, and therefore he believes that nothing will come of the council. He also writes that Meissen is still holding strong and that within a few days Duke Maurice has killed many people and captured 6 cannons. Thus he writes.</p>
      <p>Today I received a letter from Erbe von Richenwyl, who among other things writes: "Students leaving Wittenberg come to us, reporting that Philipp Melanchthon and Pomeranus have left the university and are now with the two sons of the captured duke in Weimar, because Maurice has restored papist ceremonies in Wittenberg. The besieged Magdeburgers do not heed the threats of their adversaries. The Emperor, a living corpse, is alone with those mitred ones in Augsburg. Ferdinand is contending with Philip of Spain for the kingdom; he says he was elected Emperor by the German princes, while the other claims he was born Emperor; it is certain." Thus writes Erbe. I have nothing else at the moment. Let us pray, let us pray, let us pray, extending pure hands in repentance to the Lord, if perhaps He may have mercy on us and spare us. Farewell. Convey my greetings to all the lords and brothers, as well as to your wife and the entire family. Bern, on the day of the Ascension of the Lord, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I would like you to write to Mr. Haller the treasurer and thank him for the generosity shown to Musculus.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful minister of Christ the Lord and the church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, his venerable lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
