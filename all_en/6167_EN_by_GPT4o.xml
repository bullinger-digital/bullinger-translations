      <p>I think it has already been reported to you about the passing of our Calvin, who peacefully and saintly fell asleep in the Lord in the hands of friends around the night of the 27th of the previous month. Alas, my father, what a great light that day has taken from us! The next day he was carried out with the greatest and most just mourning of the whole city. But on this subject, indeed, enough for now.</p>
      <p>For you will grant this to my grief, that while I console myself as much as I can in the Lord, I am not forced to renew the most bitter pains by writing about these matters at every moment. There will be given to us, as I hope, a more suitable time to describe both the life and death of my best parent. Meanwhile, I ask that you commend this church, and especially me, upon whom such a burden now falls most unwillingly, more and more to God. We proceed as much as we can, and as far as it concerns us, I see the same spirit in our people as before, although the threats of the enemies are growing. The king has done nothing new in Burgundy. He entered Lyon four days ago. Our public sermons were immediately forbidden, according to the formula of a certain edict that was promulgated a year ago, that no public sermons be held wherever the king is. But only the place will change, and in private places, the crowd will be all the more frequent, unless the adversaries, who promise themselves the greatest things, achieve something more. Most of our people affirm that nothing should be changed, others fear everything. I remain in suspense, although I do not doubt that if our people are patient, the remnants of the papacy will soon collapse of their own accord. For I know that even in the very Sorbonne there is now sharp disputation about transubstantiation and private masses, and indeed the most ardent openly say that, provided their interests are safe, they care nothing for the pope. Would that a treaty could truly be composed by which the churches of these parts could also be united with the Gallic ones: which would not be difficult to accomplish if that legate, about whom I wrote to you before, would perform his duty. About this matter, I do not doubt that our Linerus has recently discussed with you. But although he is treacherous, he has a companion of better faith, and in such proximity to the king himself, it would be easy to settle, even against the will of the legates themselves. About this, however, more at another time if it seems appropriate. I only fear that the king will remain in Lyon for fewer days because of the plague raging there, and thus a most beautiful opportunity will be lost. Although I hope that even if he leaves Lyon, he will not be far away this summer. Moreover, the one who delivers this letter to you is leading the children of a certain noble and excellent man to you, whom I again and again ask you to commend. For their father is worthy to be embraced by even your church for his many virtues and especially his outstanding piety, which he showed continuously throughout the entire civil war, sparing neither expenses nor life to help the afflicted. I would wish that they could be placed with our Mr. Gualter if possible. If not, nevertheless, I commend them as much as I can to him, to you, and to the other brothers. Farewell, my father.</p>
      <p>May the Lord look upon His afflicted church, raise up truly pious and brave workers, strengthen those who labor, and protect them with His holy spirit. Geneva, June 14.</p>
      <p>I have the response of Brentius and Eberus at hand, but I fear that whatever I can accomplish in such great grief is very little. I will return Eberus's book as soon as possible. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Yours, Beza.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my most revered father. In Zurich.</p>
