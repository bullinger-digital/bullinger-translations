      <p>A. salvatore S.</p>
      <p>With that joy and happiness of spirit, my most learned Heinrich, which befits a Christian, I received the greeting inscribed by your apostolic hand on paper and was delighted by those things which were spoken in your name by our most loving Galitius, strengthened by that heavenly hope, that at last we may walk together in the great house of God and enjoy that eternal salvation, which you wished for your Magius in your letters, amen. As for your wish to receive my unlearned letters, although I have often had to prick the head of Priscian with my pen, yet, when I have come across something new, so that I may not seem inhuman, I will fulfill your most humane wish from my heart. Now there is nothing from my storehouse to send except this, that from a friend's letters from Vienna, everything you wrote to our Galitius about Germany and the king and kingdom of Poland has been confirmed. We must pray that what the Lord of hosts has worked in Germany, He may deign to confirm for His glory by increasing faith in the king and kingdom of Poland, and may He render all the princes of the earth not only taught by God but also powerful in deed, so that the poor who complain, the defenseless who lack a defender, may be freed from fraud, from injury, from the tyranny of the Antichrist, and that the innocent blood of those, as you wrote, recently poured out in the temple and altar of Baal by that Jezebel called back from the infernal tricks of the Antichrist, and is daily shed, as you say, by King Ahab, for which bloody blood, oh admirable, oh ineffable, oh most holy, oh dreadful sacrament, that Christ, the only begotten Son of God and Himself God, shed His blood in abundance as a cursed sign, amen. As for that little fox depicted on paper, I will say nothing else at present, except that I do not doubt it is well known to all mortals: namely, that it is an animal endowed with all malice, armed with deceit, equipped with snares, although very often it is caught and skinned by malice, deceit, and the snares of men. But if it were granted to me to write enigmas with my Bullinger on the island of Patmos, I would only say this one thing: the mystery of the fox's exit from the cage, if it should come to the month of June, will be revealed to you. Meanwhile, I will wait expectantly for those most holy mysteries promised in your letters and condensed, as well as what you have worked on the Apocalypse, although, as it seems to me, whoever the author was, he wanted to enigmatize for himself alone, so to speak. For I do not believe that John, who openly handed down the mystery of the mysteries of the Church of God, saying: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God," etc., sweated under the cart of enigmas, and to confess the truth to my most learned Heinrich, whenever I compare those things which that John wrote by the command of the spirit to the seven churches of Asia with those which Paul committed to letters to the seven churches, the fire and lightning like flashes grow cold with Magius, nor do the thunders, earthquakes, sounds of waters, and the playing of harps and other Apocalyptic spectacles and portents move him much, indeed all those things seem to me no different than purgatorial fire when I am engaged in the writings of the apostle. Do you not say that Paul thunders when he preaches Christ Jesus and Him crucified, testifying that he knows nothing else except this crucified one, a scandal to the Jews, foolishness to the Gentiles, but to the called, the crucified, the power of God and the wisdom of God. Does not Paul truly flash when he writes to the apostle called not by men nor through men, but through Christ? Does he not shine when he presumes to curse an angel from heaven, to strike Peter in the face for not walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel? Does he not shake with an earthquake the false apostles when he calls them enemies of the cross of Christ, when he prefers himself to all the apostles writing that he received nothing from those who were considered pillars in the church? Truly, to omit many other things, these flashes, thunders, lightnings, earthquakes, sounds of waters, sounds of the trumpet and the playing of harps from the organ of God surpass, if I am not mistaken, all those Apocalyptic terrors, all those portents, and all those mysteries hidden until this day, although many pious and most learned men have sweated to reveal them.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God therefore grant you that spirit in your service, who, bringing the sacrament in which all sacraments are contained to the Virgin Mary, clearly exposed it to the whole world, so that serving you, those Apocalyptic coverings may also be explained through you, and to the glory of God, that John may at last be understood by the church, amen. I wish you health in Christ, dearest brother, together with the other co-workers in the gospel, Pellican, Bibliander, Occhino, Gualter, Josias, and with all who love Christ. If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus, let him be anathema, maranatha. Farewell to you all and be surrounded by the false brothers, who with the utmost zeal (having overthrown the most holy table of the Lord) erect a shambles for themselves, preparing teeth and bellies with the Capernaumites to tear Christ apart, although He sits at the right hand of the Father with a glorified body, not to come sooner than on the last day to judge the living and the dead, who, even if He descended bodily (as a man) to the Capernaumites, could by no means deliver His body to those voracious ones; for He died once and can die no more nor say: "This is my body, which is given for you; this is my blood, which is poured out for you." Therefore, only the most holy memory of the death of Christ is left to the church of God, for which in the congregation of the righteous thanks will be given to God, our Father (with the most holy supper prepared), in which, as truly the flesh of Christ is eaten with the teeth of faith and the blood is drunk and tasted, may God have mercy on His church, amen.</p>
      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you, Chur, December 16, 1555. Our Ponticella, as I was closing this letter, came in and asked me to convey to you in Christ his many greetings. Vincenzo Maggi, theodidact from Brescia.</p>
      <p>[To the apostle of Jesus] Christ [Heinrich] Bullinger. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
