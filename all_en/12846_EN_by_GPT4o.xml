    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Myconius is lying sick in bed. Everyone wants to know from him whether the Five Places really intend to punish Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther for violating the [Second Kappel] Peace. However, he cannot provide precise information about it. It burdens him to always hear something different and over time always something worse about it. Although Bullinger had mentioned Gwalther's "Endtchrist" [in No. 2757], he did not report anything about himself. If he is charged for the same matter, he will surely know how to defend himself. Just now, Isaak Keller came with Bullinger's letter [No. 2788]. This allowed for an inquiry about the matter, especially since the letter does not provide information about it. Keller claims that the matter is settled. How wonderful! Thank God! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] The situation in Swabia is terrible! Constance is particularly to be pitied, but also the Helvetians, whose powerlessness is clearly evident here. For if the Helvetians allow the Spaniards and Italians to cross Lake Constance and occupy Constance, they allow them to enter their territory and attack them from there. God seems determined to punish the Confederates! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] From the court of the French envoy [Antoine Morelet du Museau or François de La Rivière] comes the message that Emanuel Philibert, the son of Duke Charles III of Savoy, with the support of the Portuguese King John III, is assembling an army of about 70,000 Spaniards to be able to reconquer Savoy. Also [Philip of Spain], the son of Emperor Charles V, is involved. Charles III of Savoy certainly intends to reclaim his territory occupied in the German part of the empire and to station occupation troops there to prevent an uprising. This is the price Germany has to pay because it allowed the untrustworthy Ghent [Charles V] to introduce foreign troops! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] It is well known that Elector John Frederick has had God on his side since his return to Saxony. However, Bullinger will not have learned that Duke Maurice of Saxony ordered the citizens of Leipzig to bring all gold and silver to the fortress for greater security; that he then seized these items, left Leipzig, and left behind nine companies as well as his brother August and some nobles. On January 14, the siege by the Elector began. The river [Elster?] was diverted. On the 18th, the Elector added 20 more cannons to the twelve already present. What happened afterward is unknown. Maurice is waiting for imperial reinforcements. The Elector is in good spirits; as are his mercenaries, who receive their pay. Just now, a noblewoman from Belgium [Anne t’Serclaes], who reports on behalf of her noble English husband [John Hooper], came and stated that Maurice is indeed arrested! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] There is such a pleasing news about Landgrave Philip of Hesse that Myconius hardly dares to believe it. Yet he cannot withhold it from Bullinger: Philip is said to have killed up to 10,000 mercenaries who were recruited in southern Germany and were intended for the large imperial army gathering near Cologne! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] In contrast to the last news (which is also unknown to the people of Strasbourg), the reports about the Elector are verified. Strasbourg seems to want to remain steadfast. Sultan Suleiman is on the verge of an attack. King Francis I continues as before. Pope Paul III, whom some declare dead, is said to have now turned against the Emperor. The Bohemians are divided and refuse to march against the Elector. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> [7] May the Lord bring an end to this dire situation and grant endurance! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest8"> [8] Greetings. Bullinger should kindly accept this letter, written with effort in bed. Gwalther should prove himself courageous! </p>

      <p>S. Everyone comes to me as I lie sick in bed, asking what it is that the Five Places are demanding from you and Gwalther, to act with you as with violators of the common peace. I cannot respond because I have received nothing from you on this matter so far. It greatly disturbs me, as one person tells me one thing, another something else, and each subsequent report is more unfortunate. You only mentioned Gwalther because of his "Antichrist," but nothing about yourself, nor is the reason given why they are also demanding you. If the cause is the same for both of you, the defense will not be difficult, provided there is law and justice; but if you have a particular cause, since I do not know it, I cannot say anything. However, after I wrote this far, Isaac Keller intervened with your letters, in which, finding nothing about this tragedy, I asked if he could report anything certain. He replied most assuredly. He narrated that everything is settled. I rejoiced, even in my bed, and gave thanks to the Lord; for the matter seemed to me such that not only the gospel would have perished for us, but also the glory of our covenant. I will remain in thanksgiving, therefore, until you instruct me otherwise.</p>

      <p>From Swabia, I see everything is much more miserable. I deplore Constance, not only for its own sake but also for the Helvetians, whose misfortune I see here more than anywhere else. For if they allow the Spaniards and Italians to cross the lake and occupy the city, what else have they permitted but the most wicked men to enter their territory? And who will drive them out, indeed who will prevent them from continuing on to you and other Helvetians? God will do something against us with this entry, which we will regret not having foreseen.</p>

      <p>From the court, I believe, of the French envoy, comes the news that the son of the Duke of Savoy has gathered an army from Spain up to 70,000, with the King of Portugal providing money. The son of the Emperor is also there. Rumor flies that they want to restore the Duke to his kingdom. But what is the Emperor's son doing here, if not to claim occupied Germany and impose subsidies, lest it ever rebel? This is the reward for Germany, which allowed a foreign army to be introduced by the perjured Ghent, etc.</p>

      <p>You know about the Elector, how magnificently the Lord has been with him since he returned to Saxony. Perhaps you do not know this one thing about Maurice: He ordered his citizens in Leipzig to bring all their silver and gold, made or unmade, into the fortress, where it would be better protected by the garrison. He later took all or at least the greatest part of it and left. A garrison of nine companies was left with his brother and the nobility. On January 14, the siege began, and the river was diverted. On the 18th, with the first 12 cannons, he began to press the town more heavily. What happened afterward is unknown. Maurice, with few troops, awaits the Emperor's reinforcements. The Elector is wonderfully uplifted and confident; so is the army: for they are paid. While I write this, a noblewoman from Belgium, visiting me sick, said on her husband's command, a noble Englishman, that Maurice is captured, and truly captured!</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>There are some reports about Hesse, which I do not dare to relate because of the joy taken from it. I fear it may not be true. However, I will tell you: They say up to 10,000 of those recruited in Upper Germany, who wanted to go to the large army said to be gathered in Cologne, were killed by him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Everything about the Elector is true. I doubt about Hesse; about which even Strasbourg has no certainty. Strasbourg itself acts as if it wants to persist in the Lord. The Turk is at the gates. The Frenchman continues. And they say the Pope is against the Emperor, whose life is still in doubt. We still hear that the Bohemians are divided and refuse aid against the Elector.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>May the Lord, I pray, bring an end to such afflicted matters for His good, and grant us to endure strongly in Him until the end. For He is the Lord and God, who has the words of eternal life.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell and consider these things, however they may be, kindly. I wrote in bed, not without difficulty. Tell Gwalther to think about whom he suffers for, and to be of good cheer! For He has overcome the world. He will also grant that he himself may emerge victorious. Basel, February 6, 1547. Yours, O. M.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and pious man, brother and lord in Christ, to be respected. Zurich.</p>
