      <p>Before this day, I could not write to you, most excellent Bullinger, because I knew nothing certain about the state of England, and all regions are full of vague rumors about England. Therefore, I share these things with you because I believe them to be true. Mary, cousin of Emperor Charles, has been proclaimed and confirmed as Queen of England with the consent of all the estates of the kingdom. May God make this fortunate and prosperous for the entire kingdom of England. The Duke of Northumberland, who had betrothed the great-niece of Henry VIII of blessed memory to his fourth-born son, has been taken captive along with his five sons and brother to the Tower of London. Besides them, fifteen others have been captured, among whom are the Earls of Derby and Huntingdon, the Chief Justice Montague, one Marquis of Northampton, the Bishop of London, two doctors, the unfortunate and pitiable young Cheke, and six knights. I fear that some of them are guilty of treason and poisoning against their lord and most pious king, for whom no punishment could be harsh and cruel enough, even from Busiris or Phalaris.</p>
      <p>Whatever I learn about this tragedy hereafter (horrible and monstrous, as I fear), I will inform you. The Emperor has decided to pursue war against the French. The English ambassadors, who were sent to both princes for the purpose of restoring peace, will soon return home. The Margrave of Brandenburg has gathered new forces, both cavalry and infantry, amounting to twenty thousand, and has declared war on the Duke of Brunswick, who, as it appears, has been deprived of three legitimate sons and one illegitimate one. For he intends to offer him a just battle soon, and the recent skirmish was hardly worthy of the name of a skirmish. We hear that the Emperor is urging the Margrave and the Duke of Brunswick, as well as the Nurembergers, to lay down their arms and allow good men to mediate and pacify the disputes among themselves and to hand over all their soldiers to him. But whether he will achieve this, I do not yet know; for the Roman king will not cease to avenge the death of Maurice and pursue the Margrave, against whom, along with Maurice, he has openly declared war, and there are many suspicions that the Margrave is more inclined towards the Spanish... than it appears so far. Maurice's death occurred at an inconvenient time for Germany; he alone among the princes was the ear and eye of Ulysses. Commend me to your family. I am grateful for the booklet you sent. Farewell. August 15, 1553.</p>

      <p>To the distinguished Mr. Bullinger, eminent in learning and piety, a friend to be highly regarded.</p>
