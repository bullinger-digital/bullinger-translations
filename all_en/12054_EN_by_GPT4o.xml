    <p xml:id="regest1">Fagius has conveyed Bullinger's message; he, who has now moved to Strasbourg, is waiting for a letter from Bullinger regarding this. Albert Hardenberg corresponds to the descriptions of Bullinger, Bucer, and Vadian; he is not a Sorbonist and has nothing of a former monk; he has departed for Augsburg, from where he will proceed to Ulm and Strasbourg; in the matter of the Lord's Supper, he needed neither Blarer's nor [Thomas Blarer's] instruction; he praised the [Zurich] stance highly and receives the publication of Zwingli's works well; the [Zurichers] know what he intends in this regard. Certainly, Luther behaves towards the [dissenters] in a completely unreasonable manner and allows no [other] to correct anything; however, Blarer has no doubt that the [Zurichers] will do everything to ensure public peace; also, in the drafting of Zwingli's biography, utmost moderation is appropriate, not for the sake of Luther and his followers, but rather concerning the [Zurich] rural population, among whom Zwingli's reputation is often poor; yet even here, Blarer does not doubt Bullinger's prudence. From a letter addressed to him by Georg Frölich, to which a copy of the "Speculum" directed against Andreas Osiander was enclosed, Blarer believes he can infer that Frölich is the author of the "Speculum," especially since he knows Osiander well and was the city clerk in Nuremberg at the time of many of the events mentioned in this writing; however, Bullinger should remain silent about this to avoid harming the friend. Bullinger should not hide from Blarer the letter [above No. 1966] of Philipp [Melanchthon]; may he be driven away by [Luther] to be able to go to Heidelberg with good reason; the majority of the W[ittenberg] school will probably follow [Luther]; this could contribute to those who are shown too much respect ultimately appearing less credible. Blarer takes care of Bullinger's nephew Josua; he now has a teaching position. [Matthias] Schenk praises the [hospitality] of the Zurichers. Blarer quotes from Frölich's [letter the section] about [Nikolaus von] Amsdorf: The Bishop of Zeitz has compiled more than a hundred passages from Philipp's books, which he labeled as "Philippist errors" and reported to the Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony; many of these passages are said to concern the Lord's Supper; those who do not even spare Philipp will probably spare no one! Sends Musculus' letters to Bullinger [above No. 1991] and to Gwalther, as well as the letter from Sixt Birck that arrived the day before yesterday [above No. 2000]; he has a disagreement with some colleagues in Augsburg [about the evaluation of dramas] and wants to know what other scholars think about it. Blarer would like to learn something certain from Bullinger about the peace treaty [of Crépy] between [Charles V] and [Francis I]; what [Hans] Welser wrote to Blarer three days ago regarding Bullinger's book ["Hope of the Believers"] will be learned by Bullinger from the enclosed and to be returned letter part. Greetings also from [Thomas Blarer] and [Konrad] Zwick; the uncertainty of the times invites prayer.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Due to the constraints of time, I am able to respond to your letter with only a few words. I have informed Fagius of what you wrote; he, who has now moved to Strasbourg, is eagerly awaiting your letter. He has left the church there and was recalled by the senate; I wish it may turn out as well for him as it has turned out poorly for us!</p>
      <p>Dr. Albert Hardenberg is exactly as you, Bucer, and indeed our Vadian have described him to us. Good God, how learnedly, how piously, how fluently, and with what grace he speaks on all the main points of our solid religion, how sweet his manners, how humane he is, how far removed from that Sorbonist arrogance and monastic superstition, so that you would never suspect he had been a monk! May the Lord preserve and continually increase those gifts He has so kindly bestowed upon him.</p>
      <p>Indeed, if anyone is, this man will be most suitable and successful in extending the boundaries of Christ's kingdom. He has now gone to Augsburg, from where he will proceed to Ulm and then back to Strasbourg. Let us pray to the Lord that He may preserve this chosen instrument for the propagation of His glory in His churches for as long as possible. In the matter of the Lord's Supper, neither my brother nor I needed to confirm him; for he seemed to us to speak and think rightly and quite orthodoxly about that most august mystery. He praises all your works with great admiration and interprets the publication of Zwingli's works candidly; you are not unaware of what he wishes to be done in this regard.</p>
      <p>Indeed, as far as Luther himself is concerned, it is very unfair for him to spew anything he wishes against anyone, while on the other hand, no one is allowed, even in the interest of defending the truth, to wipe away what is smeared. But the greatest possible regard must be had for public tranquility, which I have no doubt you will maintain.</p>
      <p>As for you, my venerable and dearest brother, since you have recently written to me that you have undertaken to write the life of Zwingli, everything must be managed with the utmost diligence, so that not only Luther and his followers, but rather your own people, are not more gravely offended by it; you know how much Zwingli's name suffers from hatred among many of your rural communities, whom it is more fitting to lead to the kingdom of God and win for Christ than to deter with new reasons. But I am very confident in your modesty in all these matters, that you will admit nothing beyond what is proper.</p>
      <p>From certain conjectures, I could easily believe that the author of that "Speculum" is Georg Frölich, the chief scribe of Augsburg. He is somewhat skilled in poetry, knows all of Osiander's matters well, and knows him inside and out, and was a scribe in Nuremberg at the time when some of the things mentioned here were done. Finally, he sent me a copy four days ago with a letter, from which I easily suspect him to be the author. But this is for you; I would not want my conjectures to be a harm to the best and most friendly man to me. I would indeed wish, as you do, that these hours had been devoted to a more plausible argument, since it benefits no one at all to provoke these hornets.</p>
      <p>Do not hide from me what Philipp has recently written to you. I wish Wittenberg would expel him, so that he might have a decent reason to move to Heidelberg! There is no doubt that a good part of the Wittenberg school will follow him, and perhaps by the singular counsel of the Lord, these things are happening, so that the authority of certain men, to whom more than is just is attributed, may be somewhat diminished, and the truth may shine more clearly to the glory of God.</p>
      <p>Your nephew from your brother will be my care; he has found a master of the art here. I have promised him all my efforts; for I have nothing more important than to gratify you in all things.</p>
      <p>Our Schenk praises your hospitality with full mouth. Would that there might be some occasion for us to reciprocate to you!</p>
      <p>Georg Frölich writes to me about Ambsdorf as follows: "Amsdorf, Bishop of Zeitz, has extracted more than a hundred articles from Philipp's books, which he calls 'Philippist errors,' and has presented them to the Elector of Saxony in the form of a denunciation. Most of the articles, as I hear, are proposed in the matter of the sacrament, where Philipp calls them symbols, so that those who do not spare Philipp will spare no one." Thus he writes.</p>
      <p>I am sending you Musculus' letters written to you and our Gwalther, which I would have sent sooner if I had not lacked messengers. I received Xystus Betuleius' letter the day before yesterday; his opinion does not agree with that of some others who are in Augsburg, and therefore he wishes to be informed of what other learned men think here. If you have written anything in reply to either, send it here and consider it delivered to them as soon as possible; for I am accustomed to write to Augsburg frequently.</p>
      <p>Regarding the peace that has been concluded between the Emperor and the French, there are very varied rumors among us, so I am very eager to learn something more certain from you.</p>
      <p>Welser of Augsburg wrote to me three days ago as follows, as you will read from this fragment, where he also mentions you; from which you will understand that I have sent your book to him in good faith; you will return the fragment.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household with all the brothers and friends. My brother Germanus and Zwick commend themselves to you greatly and greet you most dutifully in the Lord. Farewell, my soul, and continually commend us to the Savior Christ in your most holy prayers. The times are indeed uncertain; therefore, we must flee all the more to the most certain aids of Christian truth and sacred prayers. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Constance, October 8, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed brother in Christ. In Zurich.</p>
