      <p>Greetings. I thought it necessary to inform you of the state of our affairs and the events occurring here, as I understand that this duty has not been unwelcome to you thus far, and I also fulfill my duty of writing in some way. At the beginning of this year, news came to us from the Netherlands about Alba: he seized by force the city of Noord-Holland (Holland) located between Amsterdam and Utrecht; in it, he massacred everyone found, including men, women, and all infants. A few days later, a battle was engaged between the forces of Alba and the Geuzen; several thousand fell not far from Haarlem; it is not added on whose side the victory stood; it is known that many distinguished Spaniards fell and were captured. Recently, the Spaniards built a bridge to Haarlem, as they distrusted the ice; when several had crossed it, the bridge collapsed; the garrison from Haarlem attacked the Spaniards who had crossed and were now separated from the others, slaughtering them to the last man; they say there were 300.</p>
      <p>The citizens and the garrison have resolved to defend themselves to the last breath of life and, before surrendering to the enemy, to burn the city and themselves. The forces of Alba, provoked, decided to assault the city with all their might on December 25th in four divisions. The Duke himself, Alba, is suffering from a severe fever. Recently, the people of Vlissingen captured 7 ships laden with goods.</p>
      <p>In Paris, a fire that broke out around the beginning of this year caused the city great damage. The King fears he is not safe enough in Paris and has decided to move elsewhere; he is said to be completely changed and to breathe nothing but atrocious and most hostile things, delighting in cruel spectacles; he is said to have been gravely wounded recently in a hunt by his own carelessness, as some say, or, as others, by his brother.</p>
      <p>The Elector of Brandenburg is said to be departing from the assembly of princes held in Neuburg to Prussia, as if to visit his cousin there, but in truth to proceed from there to Poland and be inaugurated into the kingdom. The Spaniard is liberal in promises, and the Pope urges the Venetians not to separate from the league. Everyone thinks they will certainly make peace with the Turk. He also tries to persuade the French through an envoy to join the allies.</p>
      <p>The French, however, deny that it is possible for them to do this at this time. The Voivode of Transylvania offered his obedience to the Pope through an envoy; however, he wished that this would not be made public. Our Emperor is lying mortally ill. At the beginning of January, several ships of the Venetians were either driven ashore or sunk by the force of the winds.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Given at Bocksberg on January 12, in the year 73.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Georg von Stetten. To the reverend, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
