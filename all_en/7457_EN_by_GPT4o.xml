      <p>Greetings. Apart from what I wrote eight days ago, I have nothing worth mentioning, dear brother, except that I believe the terms of peace, which I sent then, to be spurious. I think the ones I sent first are true. Meanwhile, it is certain that the king has also promised many other things to the nobles, which, if he fulfills them, will ensure safety. Please take care to deliver these letters addressed to our Ulrich, and farewell along with all your family, colleagues, and our mutual friends. Since no other messengers now report even a little about Philip's death, I also doubt that account, although Duke of Hesse has written to Claron that there is a rumor in France that Philip, the King of Spain, is dead.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 7, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Tobias Egli, most faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
