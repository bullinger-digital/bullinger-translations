    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer wrote the day before [with letter no. 2635], but does not know if the mail has been sent. Only today did he learn that his brother [Thomas] will be sent by the Konstanz council to the Diet [in Zurich]. He can provide more details about the war. Bullinger, for his part, should report on the Diet so that Blarer can also inform [Georg] Fr√∂lich about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Greetings. One should persistently ask God for assistance and for victory!</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you yesterday by post, although I am not quite sure whether it has been sent. However, it does not matter, since my brother (which I did not know yesterday) is departing today, sent by our council, to you; he will explain to you in person more faithfully than any letter whatever we have here about the success of the war. I would commend him to you, but I consider it unnecessary to recommend a most friendly person to another most friendly person. Whatever the appointed day there has brought forth, you will write to me in summary, so that I can in turn inform our friend Leto about it.</p>

      <p>Farewell, my dearest and best Bullinger. Greet your household with all the brothers and friends in the Lord. Let us, however, persistently approach the throne of grace with supplicant prayers, so that we may obtain the help of Him who is stronger than the prince of this world, whom He has long since weakened with His mighty hand, having kindly granted us His victory. Farewell again. October 21, 1546. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable friend and brother.</p>
