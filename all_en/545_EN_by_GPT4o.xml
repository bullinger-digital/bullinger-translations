      <p>Greetings. Today, dearest Bullinger, we received a most welcome bundle of letters. Such was the joy and excitement of my people while reading your letters that, if you had seen it, you would not have been able to refrain from tears.</p>
      <p>The memory of you, which my people hold in their hearts, was so stirred by the letters that it produced a truly delightful spectacle. May the Lord repay your and your people's kindness, which refreshes us more in your absence than the presence of those who, however, wish to appear as ministers of Christ, among whom I have seen nothing more foolish in my entire life. O brother, how miserable this church would be if it were deprived of Haller. I cannot sufficiently lament in my heart the calamity of the present times, not only that which oppresses the already afflicted Swabian churches but also that which threatens those that are still free from the hostile plague.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord daily that He may regard not our ingratitude and vanity, but the glory of His name and word, and not allow the hands of impious men to utterly tear apart His vineyard. The letters from your most honorable wife, in which she encourages me to patience, were most welcome. I hope they will not be ineffective.</p>
      <p>Mine will respond today.</p>
      <p>Regarding the reconciliation, or rather the declaration, which took place between you there and Mr. Calvin and Farel in these days, we have seen your letters. They have not yet been read publicly; however, they will be read this evening. May the Lord's grace be with you, who inspired you with this spirit, so that you considered the necessity of the present times and brought to light the agreement of the cause, which was previously in hearts. I have read the written declaration and do not see what could be desired, except that these things could have been stated more simply and clearly. But this must be attributed to the malignity of the present times, especially since the truth of the cause suffers no harm.</p>
      <p>What you write about Mr. Gervasius, our dearest brother, has greatly cheered me; for until now I was very concerned about his name, in what way his affairs could be managed. You do well to take his situation into account, and your church loses nothing by this counsel.</p>
      <p>The ministers of Richwiler returned here three days ago from Count Georg, whom they met while he was staying at the baths in Valais. He sends them back to the churches, but with very little hope; Charles is feared, and there is little mention of God, the supreme ruler. Clearly, we perish by our own fault, who seemed unwilling to suffer anything for the gospel of God. What has been decided in the case of Mr. Haller, my godfather, by your people, I have not yet seen; however, I do not doubt that they have agreed for him to remain here. Farewell most dearly, dearest of men; may the Lord preserve you. Greetings to all yours, even to the lords and brothers there.</p>
      <p>Bern, Switzerland, June 2, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed theologian and minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most revered lord and brother.</p>
