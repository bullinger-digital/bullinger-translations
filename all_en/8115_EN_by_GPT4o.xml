      <p>I recently received two letters from you, one written on December 13th and the other on the 16th, which were delivered to me by Mr. Antonius Franciscus. I would have gladly obliged him, both for his learning and his piety, if I could have done so in any way. I gave the letters addressed to your treasurer's son, since I could not send them sooner, to Mr. Antonius to deliver, who will begin his journey to Heidelberg from here tomorrow. From France, I cannot write anything certain to your lordship: for everything that comes to us from there is so uncertain that we hardly dare to trust the few things that are reported. We have this one indication that the affairs of the Huguenots are not yet desperate, that the royalists, otherwise vain and boastful amplifiers of their novelties, are silent and have become more moderate. I believe the Italians, having been well and deservedly received, will not rashly rush into France. The cruelty of the Spaniards and their impious tyranny will be retaliated by the avenging arms of the Turks.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of London wrote to me on October 10th, and I finally received the letter on December 20th. Since we are currently deprived of the convenience of transferring letters through Belgium, and the German Sea is now closed, we are deprived of the ease of both sending and receiving letters. The Bishop in his letter wished me to greet your lordship in his words. Indeed, I judged that what I received from there should be communicated to you as a supporter and enthusiast of English affairs. The Duke of Norfolk, who has so far conducted himself obediently and peacefully in England, as befits a nobleman, has been inflated by swollen and ambitious promises and has decided to contract the most unfortunate marriage with Medea, the parricide and bloodsucker, and inflamed by this deliberation, he withdrew from the court to his ancestral estates. Upon learning of this presumption, he was summoned to the court by a herald, but neglecting this summons, he remained on his paternal lands. The Queen, understanding with her prudence that these beginnings must be opposed, sent the captain of the royal guards with a century to bring him in; understanding this, he voluntarily began his journey to the court, during which he was stopped by the Queen's command, and he was not allowed to approach the court. After a three-day delay, he was taken to the Tower of London, where he is kept. Two other earls were ordered to remain within their homes, as they are heavily suspected of being aware of his plan. With the Duke captured and the others brought into line, the whole kingdom is quiet and tranquil. Unless that serpent is removed, she will bring about great destruction with her hereditary arts and tricks, like the one who was seen to give birth to a burning torch. This most serene Queen has so far administered the kingdom peacefully without the shedding of any blood; may God grant and allow her to continue to enjoy this happiness.</p>
      <p>Recently, an ambassador from the King of Spain was sent to the most serene Queen of England, who, in the name of the King, requested passage for three legions or regiments of Belgian infantry to be transported to Spain, so that the King might use their service against the rebellious Moors. It is said that the Queen responded immediately, that the multitude of so many soldiers sailing along the coasts of England could be dangerous; for since the winds are changeable and unstable, and many things can happen to sailors contrary to what they expect, if these soldiers, compelled by some necessity, are forced to land in the ports of England, the arrival of so many soldiers cannot happen without harm, and therefore it would be necessary for the Queen to arm and fortify her coasts and ports with garrison troops: but if the King is willing to bear these expenses and give hostages that he will not use the service of the German soldiers for any other purpose than against the Moors, she will oblige the King.</p>
      <p>But it must be considered that heretics are not to be trusted, and if an oath is to be violated, it should be violated for the sake of the kingdom. Pope Julius used to say that merchants are bound by faith, not princes.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing from Saxony. Aurich is still staying with the Saxon. The Elector himself is said to be present at the wedding of his daughter, who will be brought to Heidelberg, where the wedding will take place on the fifth day of February. Regarding the soldiers to be brought to France, nothing is yet settled with us: small forces cannot penetrate; large ones will be very costly, and for the sake of piety, it is the work of Samson to bear the expenses and face the dangers. I offer my services to your lordship.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, 7 days before the calends of January, in the year 69.</p>
      <p>We must pray that by divine mercy we may achieve more successful outcomes in the coming year. I ask that you omit English titles in the inscriptions of letters.</p>
      <p>He who is wise, let him rejoice in silent joy. C. M.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, most esteemed patron. Zurich.</p>
