      <p>Greetings. The affliction of the people of Locarno still affects me as well, and I cannot help but gravely fear for our common homeland, in which some oppress the innocent with force, others connive and consent, and in the profession of justice and truth, they show that the zeal for righteousness has largely cooled, if not extinguished. Meanwhile, the enemies are eagerly working against the kingdom of Christ, fully inflamed, and there are also other signs of a hateful and pernicious lukewarmness. Therefore, we are reminded by the difficulty of these times to insist all the more diligently and vigilantly on the duty entrusted to us and to fervently implore the Lord in our prayers to ignite our hearts with the spirit and fire of His love, so that they may breathe His glory more ardently and strive for its promotion. I hear from your people that it has been obtained from the Rhaetians that a place is made for the exiles in the Valtellina, so that they might perhaps live more tolerably due to the commerce of the same language. I strongly approve of your people's zeal for the saints in this matter and praise the Lord for tempering the affliction of His own to that extent, and I pray that He may strengthen and advance the best brothers in truth, faith, and much patience. The recently elected bishop somewhat bitterly threatens us because of the acceptance of some of his subjects into the rights of the city, similar to those who have long been from the same jurisdiction and are now with us, Bern, and, if I am not mistaken, Solothurn. He does this, no doubt, at the instigation of others and with confidence in some protection, which time will reveal the nature of. Those who occupy that pestilential chair are the same everywhere, and the successors are almost always worse than their predecessors, until the Lord puts an end to it.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, the princes are gradually gathering, and a large number of bishops and priests have already flocked together with the legate of their Roman antichrist, whose primary business will undoubtedly be to devise plans against Christ and for public destruction. But the Lord is powerful to confound and break the efforts of the impious. Farewell in the Lord with all your people. Basel, February 7, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
