      <p> S. Claudius Darbonetus, a senator of Orbe and my fellow citizen, is about to send his son to you, so that he may cultivate his talent in good letters and your language, to which he has already devoted some effort in Basel, more diligently and fully. He asked me to assist with my recommendation if I had any friends there. I could not honestly deny this service to an old friend, who has faithfully worked to promote the gospel among our people since its revival, nor should I have refused it by the right of old friendship. For even if no other cause moved me, the character of the young man in question, of which I have seen an uncommon example, should have been enough to inspire me. He is indeed gifted with intelligence and prudence for his age. Therefore, I hope that he will become an outstanding citizen of his country someday, if he does not lack the supports needed to achieve his goals. The father is not lacking in spirit; but because he is burdened with a large family, he cannot make the expenses he desires and deems necessary for this matter, although he has so far thought nothing should be spared from his resources and will not spare in the future, but will spend what he judges fair and what his son's studies seem to demand. Since I have willingly undertaken this task, I see no one better to whom I could commend him than to you; for since I am certain that you are all my friends and that you are all bound together by the bond of friendship, I consider him abundantly commended to you all, whom I have commended to you. Therefore, you will not be burdened to indicate to the worthy young man what you think he should do and to advise him on those things which you judge necessary both for a frugal way of life and for the progress of his studies, not that I wish these things to be taken care of by you, but that you may entrust them to those who can be his helpers in this matter and who will have more leisure than you. I write nothing to you about our affairs at present, because nothing new has happened since my last letters that is worthy of writing. Moreover, I am somewhat afflicted in health. I would write about the son of that pastor, in whose name you recently sent me letters, unless I hoped that my letters on that matter had been delivered to you, in which I explained at length what you requested; for on the very day I received yours, indeed almost at the same hour, having found an opportunity with a courier, I entrusted my written letters to a courier to be delivered to Basel to Sultzer, whom I earnestly recommended to send them to you. Therefore, let me know whether you have received them or not. </p>
      <p> I had agreed with Quintin, a professor of arts, a most excellent and learned man; the total price for annual living was twenty-four or sixteen crowns; for according to the manner of living, the price varies. The father can choose either according to his means, or if another plan pleases, as I advised before, as soon as you indicate with a gesture what you require from me, I will not allow anything to be lacking from me. I wanted to indicate these things briefly, so that if by chance my letters have not reached your hands, you may not be entirely unaware of what has been arranged by me. All of ours send you their most dutiful greetings. Greet the colleagues and fellow ministers in my name. Farewell. Lausanne, May 26, 1550. </p>
      <p> Yours, Peter Viret. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, adorned with singular learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, brother and most esteemed fellow minister. In Zürich. </p>
