      <p> Greetings. Perhaps it is not unknown to you, incomparable friend, that Johannes Fabricius, formerly my deacon in Memmingen, came to me through ZÃ¼rich to Lenzburg on October 23rd, and then went to visit Bern. In Biel, he met our Ambrosius Blaurer, and afterwards he went to Bern, where he was well received by the brothers there. On his return to me, he stayed at an inn in Aarburg for two days due to the weakness of his body, and finally, somewhat refreshed, he came to Aarau on November 8th around four in the afternoon. He visited the house of our beloved brother Jungius; there, he was severely struck by erysipelas and on the tenth of this month at four in the morning, he crossed this most turbulent sea to the Lord, not without great sorrow on our part. </p>
      <p> We soon sent a messenger to Memmingen to inform his holy wife of the Lord's will. I know how grateful the man was to you as well; hence, I wanted to inform you of his death. He conquered the world in Christ, having obtained far better things; he was very glad that the Lord called him to Himself in a place where Christ is purely preached and the antichristian kingdom was abolished. May the Lord Jesus Christ strengthen us with His spirit, so that, having conquered through Christ our enemies, sin, the world, death, and Satan, we too may one day, having shed mortality, live eternally with Christ our Savior. Amen. In past days, I sent to your charity an old coin marked with the image of Vespasian, and I am not yet certain whether you have received it; if your occupations permit, my brother, please let me know. My daughter Rahel, on November 6th, after five days of labor, finally and most unfortunately gave birth to a dead child, for which she is gravely bedridden. May the Lord God look upon this misery of mine and my daughter's with a serene countenance and transform this unfortunate event into some joy. I am overwhelmed by various tribulations, so that, unless the Lord extended His helping hand, I would have already collapsed. Good gods, while I write this, my daughter fell into an exceedingly severe ecstasy, so that for half an hour she seemed to us completely dead; but through the Lord, she recovered. </p>
      <p> I commend myself to your prayers. May the Lord increase my faith. A nobleman from Pfirt was in Lenzburg and wished to see some letters from our senate, which, having read, he left. My mind predicts nothing good for me; impiety attempts everything. May the Lord grant our magistrates to resist the impious endeavors of these scoundrels with holy prudence and through the Lord. Farewell, my brother, greet your family in my name, especially your wife. Given in Lenzburg, November 14th, 1550. </p>
      <p> Yours, Gervasius. </p>
      <p> To the most faithful minister of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, lord, brother, and long-time dearest friend. </p>
