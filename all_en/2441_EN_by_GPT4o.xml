      <p>All the more willingly do you read this letter... urged me to write, and promised a messenger. I am well by the grace of God and continually labor for His glory, as little as it is that I can contribute. The history from the year 1517, namely by D. Sleidanus, is being printed, which I am reviewing, and if I can help in any way, may it be to the praise of our Lord God. The entire book of Cardinal Pole for the papacy is being printed, but with antidotes also taken from your books; for what you wrote on Matthew and John will be described: "You are Peter, feed my sheep."</p>
      <p>20 letters of F. Petrarch are being printed, in which he left testimony of what he thought about the papacy. Those two actions of the secretary, which you saw this summer, are being printed. The idol of Laurentius is being printed, of which I also send some pages, and not only in Latin, but also in Italian. Finally, my response to the latest catalog is being printed, namely the one in which they spared you, which gave me the occasion to say much about you. You have the account of my business. When the three printers, who have worked for me, have progressed a little further, I will dismiss them and come to you, as I hope and have written.</p>
      <p>I received letters from Mr. Bassafontanei, who bid me farewell as he departed from the legation and recommended his successor; to whom I said a few things. You will ensure that they are delivered to him. The money obtained by me from the English was sent here to the magistrate; it is about...</p>
      <p>He urged me... I am diligently handling the cause of those who are there. I wish you would inform them of this and that they pray for me. I do not think I have more to write. I would indeed like you to share not only with your family and my dearest sons, but also with my Lelio, since I can hardly send him a few things now. Farewell and be well, pray for me. Strasbourg, October 30, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To you, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
