    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller suspects that Bullinger has not yet received his letter [No. 2548 from August 24], especially since the messenger [...] said he could not deliver it before September 1.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Verified news arrived yesterday. [Maximilian von Egmont, Count of] Buren, with the help of the Archbishop of Mainz [Sebastian von Heusenstamm] and through a military ruse, crossed the Rhine at Bingen with his Dutch army. Before that, he sent a few hundred cavalrymen towards Oppenheim within sight of the [Schmalkaldic League]. They believed that the entire [imperial] army would cross the Rhine there and gathered to prevent it. Meanwhile, the army crossed the Rhine further north [at Bingen]. Now the embarrassed [Schmalkaldic League], who are far superior to this army in infantry and artillery, though not in cavalry, will do everything to fight it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- As a result of a lightning strike on August 7 in a tower [in Mechelen], which served as a storage for 700 barrels of gunpowder, 300 buildings and 700 homes were completely or largely destroyed. There were 300 dead and 170 seriously injured. The imperial court there was razed to the ground. A significant omen!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Emperor [Charles V] has unwisely left [his camp near Regensburg] and crossed the Danube. He probably thinks to escape from Landgrave [Philip of Hesse], who is aiming for Regensburg. However, the [Schmalkaldic League] followed him until they were half a mile from his camp.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Haller reported in the last letter about the plundered supply train of the [Schmalkaldic League]. They were now able to take revenge. Near Ingolstadt, they hid cavalry cohorts and then led 500 cattle past the city. The [Imperials] once again broke out of the city with the intention to plunder, but were ambushed by the cavalry and lost some men.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Hopefully, the capture of [Duke Henry of] Brunswick serves as a prelude for Charles V!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Yesterday, the city clerk [Georg Frölich] reported that the Five Places at [the Diet] in Baden had decided not to join either the [Schmalkaldic League or the Emperor], and that they allowed the [Four Protestant City Cantons] to assist the [Schmalkaldic League] in case of emergency. Thank God, if that's true!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Due to the prevailing shortage of pastors, the people of Kaufbeuren have tasked [Michael] Keller with finding a non-Lutheran pastor. Keller is considering [Utz] Eckstein, whom he knows from before. What does Bullinger think about this? Other candidates would also be welcome. If the [Zurichers] cannot help with weapons, then at least in this way! If learned pastors were available, Haller would advocate for their [employment] with the city authorities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- In haste, in anticipation of the messenger [Hans Großmann]. Greetings to the colleagues. Greetings from Frölich, who could not write because he has to attend a council meeting.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- P.S.: Enclosed is the oath formula with which the Emperor committed himself to the Empire. There you can see which articles he adhered to!</p>

      <p>Health and life through Christ. I wrote to you the day before yesterday, venerable father, a letter which I do not yet think you have received. For the person to whom I gave it said that it could not be delivered to you before the first of September.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>However, since many new things arrived again yesterday, I will not hide them from you as part of my duty. They are certain. That lord or captain of Buren, the leader of the imperial army from Lower Germany, crossed the Rhine with the help of the Archbishop of Mainz at Bingen, using an excellent stratagem. He sent a few hundred cavalrymen towards Oppenheim in the sight of our men, so that our men would think the entire army would follow and cross there, whereupon our men gathered to prevent the crossing. Meanwhile, he crossed with the army further north; having done so, he easily received the remaining cavalrymen. Our men, therefore (far superior to them in infantry and artillery, though not in cavalry), now press on them and, driven by shame, will not let them go without a battle. Perhaps the Lord willed it so that those crossing would be slaughtered, who could have been safe across the river.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We expect something more any day now.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Furthermore, if you do not know, on August 7, God showed His power, when lightning struck a tower in which 700 barrels of gunpowder were stored. It completely overturned 300 buildings along with the tower and largely destroyed and scattered 700 other houses, with 300 people dead and 170 seriously injured. The Emperor's fortress and court, which he had there, were uprooted. I think any Christian will understand what these omens mean.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>For the Emperor, having unwisely crossed the Danube and attempted to flee, thinking that the Landgrave would be aiming for Regensburg, could escape in the meantime. But our men, having set out day and night, reached his camp, so that there is scarcely half a mile between them. We hope something has already been done, which we do not yet know. We are caught between hope and fear.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Nor can I pass over the stratagem of our men, by which they avenged the treachery of the Ingolstadt people. I wrote in previous letters how they plundered our supplies. Therefore, our men, having hidden some cohorts of cavalry, drove 500 cattle near Ingolstadt. Those who broke out again to plunder were cut down by the rushing cavalry, and the rest barely escaped into the city. We hope the capture of the Duke of Brunswick is a prelude to Charles.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Yesterday I heard from the chief scribe what was done at Baden: the Five Places will not join either side, but it is free for our men to give aid to the Empire if needed. If this is the case, I give immortal thanks to the Lord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>One more thing: There is a great shortage of ministers among us; the people of Kaufbeuren would gladly have a good man. They have entrusted Keller to find someone. He, however, knows Eggstein from some old acquaintance; he seems suitable to him. He asked me to write to you, to see what you think about this matter, or if you could promote someone else there. For they do not want to have a Lutheran. Furthermore, if you know any other good men, let us know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>So they will write about it. Help even in this matter, if you do not want to with arms. If learned pastors could be had, I would gladly promote them to the city.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Farewell, and write back as soon as you can. In haste, with the messenger waiting. August 26, 1546, Augsburg. Greet the brothers. Laetus greets you, who would have gladly written, but now he himself must go to the council.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller. I send here the form of the oath by which the Emperor is bound to the Empire, but which articles he has kept so far, you yourself consider.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and venerable father. Zurich, to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
