      <p>I am sending you nothing new now, except that there is great commotion among the king's mercenaries here, whom our envoy does not want to reward with the usual gifts, as has been the custom until now. However, the main reason for writing was the departure of Brother Johannes Baptista von Cribellis from Milan, who, covered with a Franciscan cowl, escaped the Babylonian stables and shed his cowl in Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>[...] as much as the cause of Peroniana should be commended to us, since the French churches have received no offense from the recantation of Johannes Antonius von Pero.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly from our baths, 1569, July 9, in Chur.</p>
      <p>That brother says he is a relative of our departed Mr. Cellarius.</p>
