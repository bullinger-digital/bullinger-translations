      <p>Greetings. I received letters from you, dear brother, and the latest ones indeed contain news of our dear Mr. Lentulus, to whom I am always grateful and ready to serve him willingly in any possible duty. In return, I now recount to you briefly what has been brought to me from the Frankfurt fair.</p>
      <p>The English bishops' letters announce nothing but peace and good news. Letters from Bremen testify to the abundant progress of the gospel and that all is peaceful.</p>
      <p>Letters sent from the Netherlands affirm that everywhere there is not only no money, but also no income, and that everything is expensive and there is an uncommon hunger; peace is being negotiated or discussed. If these things are true, then hunger and begging are intertwined. This is the end of wars. The Duke of Saxony has dissolved the famous school of Wittenberg; for most of the students are leaving. The prince, instigated by ill-disposed people, has thrown Mr. Peucer, the pastor, and the professors into prison for no other reason than that they seem to have turned from Lutherans into Zwinglians.</p>
      <p>The people of Heidelberg still stand firm; however, that school is also being dissolved by the plague.</p>
      <p>For in Hesse, the Palatinate, the entire Rhine region, and throughout the vicinity, many are dying from the plague, and this plague is spreading along the Rhine. What we are to expect can be learned from this.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with us. Jacob Andreae, the talkative, lying Swabian, has written a most virulent book of 21 pages against us, the ministers of the church of Zurich, in which he particularly attacks me. In it, he discusses the cause of the Lord's Supper and the majesty of Christ present everywhere, responding to our booklet opposed to Brentius's Testament. We are to him blasphemous Mohammedans and thrice and four times heretics, etc. In Germany, everything is full of contentions, even about original sin and other matters. Africa always brings something evil. Those coming from France say the king has left Lyon, sick with quartan fever, hurrying to the anointing at Reims. He has a very large and strong army, which is said to be used against the Huguenots.</p>
      <p>The Swiss, who are to send envoys to the king, are awaiting Mr. Bellivrei's indication of when it will be opportune. I fear that the matter may be considered foreign, etc. May the Lord assist His own with His power and grace! We hear that the Turks, having lost 40,000 soldiers, have left Goletta, the Spaniards are victorious, and the Turks are almost crushed. If you have any certain news of this, share it and farewell.</p>
      <p>Especially greet Mr. Johann Baptist MÃ¼ller, then the honorable councilors and all our friends and brothers in order.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 1, 1574, very quickly.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church of Chur, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at Chur, at St. Martin.</p>
