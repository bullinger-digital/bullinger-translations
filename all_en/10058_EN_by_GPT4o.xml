      <p>Grace be with you.</p>
      <p>Not only because I was abroad for some time, my dear Bullinger, but also because I was sick for almost a month and a half, I was unable to write anything to you, my esteemed friend, or to other dear friends. A fever attacked me most bitterly at Herisau, and so much so that, if you consider the unbearable torments of this, I was almost killed. But the most merciful Father has restored me to myself and to our church, which anxiously prayed for this, and may He grant that whatever remains of my life be entirely devoted to His glory. Otherwise, what is the point of surviving even for many centuries if we live only for ourselves, idly and, as he says, as a useless burden on the earth, in such a way that we even hinder the pious diligence of others?</p>
      <p>And here indeed I congratulate you most heartily and beyond what can be expressed on this most honorable and truly Christian calling, which claims you entirely for itself and compels you to live for others, which you were already doing before, especially in this time full of dangers, in which hardly any vigilance and circumspection of pastors can be equal to the deceptions of so many most serious wolves, not to mention their power and might, which, the more openly they act, the less they can harm. O my brother, what evil arts does the most cunning Satan not try with his most cruel accomplice to undermine the kingdom of Christ? And what pains me more, we see some success of the most impious endeavors among many. You strive with all your heart not only to manage the province you have undertaken beautifully but also to adorn it, since you can do this most successfully with the excellent gifts given to you. Be an example of the faithful in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity, rightly dividing the word of truth. Teach continually the one and only Christ, naked and crucified [1 Cor 2:2], and the faith that is in Him, yet beginning with repentance, so that the common people may be touched by some sense of their sins and further hunger and thirst for the word of grace, that is, the gospel of Christ. For while some teach preposterously, they promote nothing at all except that they make the wicked worse, and hence that license of crimes, which sells itself under the title of the gospel, and which stirs everything up and down. But why do I say these things to you, whose sincerity, modesty, zeal, and exact judgment in Christian matters need neither teacher nor monitor? You will forgive me, my brother, since perhaps excessive concern for the churches drives me here, and at the same time, charity willingly persuades me that you will take everything in the best part.</p>
      <p>My brother Thomas diligently presented to me your book dedicated to me when I returned, for which I give you the greatest thanks. I find not a few things that even the most learned will marvel at (I do not flatter) that a young man and indeed a youth could achieve; yet we expect greater things than these, which we do not doubt the Lord will grant, since what He has given so far, you have applied so well and Christianly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother, and act in such a way that, when that chief of shepherds appears, you may be able to account for the sheep entrusted to you in good faith; to whom I also beseech you to commend me diligently and piously. Thomas, my brother, bids me to write greetings to you.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, August 11, 1529.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at Bremgarten, his learned and most sincere brother in Christ. Bremgarten.</p>
