    <p xml:id="regest1">After Frölich has now also met Bullinger in person, he is delighted to have found such an excellent friend and that Switzerland, indeed all of Germany, has such a famous man as their own. May God preserve Bullinger! - Frölich has already described his departure from Zurich in his letter written in Constance [No. 2256]. In Constance, he spent almost two days in the hospitable company of Konrad Zwick, Jakob Funcklin, and others. On October 1st, he traveled on to Lindau, where he met the churchman Thomas Gaßner and the councilman [Hieronymus] Pappus, who wanted to host him overnight, but due to rumors about the armaments of the Augsburgers, Ulmers, and the other [Schmalkaldic allies] against Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, he hurried on to Memmingen, especially since extensive business awaited him at home. In Memmingen, he dined in the evening [of October 2nd] with Gervasius [Schuler], about whose "Six Questions on the Lord's Supper" he wonders. Perhaps Bullinger can ask Schuler in a letter why he wrote these articles. - On the 5th [of October], Frölich arrived home safely, where he found numerous letters and tasks. The rumors about the armaments against Duke Heinrich also turned out to be true, as nearly 2000 horsemen and 8000 foot soldiers, who had been gathering for several months on the Rhine [against the French], had joined the Duke's army. With this, the Duke invaded the land occupied by the [Schmalkaldic League] for three years, which he wants to reclaim. Some believe that this was decided during the Diet [of Worms]. The [Schmalkaldic League], who unfortunately trusted too much in the promised [religious] peace, meanwhile probably have 8000 horsemen and 15000 foot soldiers. Frölich could report more about the cunning of the opponents, who even deceived the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] and convinced him that these troops were not directed against him. - The [Augsburg] council repeatedly asks Bullinger and the entire Zurich [pastoral] college to send a preacher. - Frölich sends greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Erasmus Schmid, his friend Rudolf Gwalther, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Johann Jakob] Ammann, [Rudolf] Collin, [Konrad] Gessner, [Johannes] Fries, [Benedikt] Euander, [Johannes] Wolf, Otto Werdmüller, [Heinrich Buchter], the provost [Felix Frey], and all others in the haven of scholarship. - Frölich will soon return [Bullinger's] manuscript on the incompatibility [between Christ] and Belial. Greetings also to Christoph Froschauer. - [P.S.:] Frölich requests a written and German-recorded account of how the church is administered, how unity among colleagues is maintained, how censorship is exercised, how pastors are appointed and recommended to the council, and how they are examined in the city and country. Bullinger had indeed communicated this orally to Frölich, but he could not remember it. - Greetings to Mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, to the treasurer [Heinrich Rahn], and to the successor [Hans Escher vom Luchs] of the [deceased] city clerk [Werner Beyel]. - Heinrich of Brunswick is said to have regained his duchy except for Wolfenbüttel. The troops [of the Schmalkaldic League] are now ready to attack. Frölich has no doubt that [Emperor Charles V.] will also deal with the [Confederates] when all of Germany is in a tumultuous state.</p>

      <p>Greetings. After having recognized you not only in your absence through your published sacred volumes and letters, but also in person with my own eyes, and having found you to be someone worthy of all memory and honor, I am sincerely grateful to have encountered such a virtuous and commendable friend and brother. I congratulate, I say, the Swiss, indeed all of Germany, our common fatherland, for having such a distinguished man whose virtue and learning can compete with and easily surpass any nation. May the Lord, that heavenly Father, keep you safe for us and the entire republic for as long as possible. Amen.</p>
      <p>The success of my journey, recently undertaken from Zurich with you and other incomparable friends, was conveyed to you by my letters written in Constance. There, I spent almost two days delighting in the company of the Blaurer brothers, Lord Konrad Zwick, Jakob Funcklin, and other excellent men, who received me with such hospitality and kindness, as they did in Zurich, that I almost do not know whether they maintained the measure of frugality or not. It is certain that I received all these things both in Zurich and in Constance not without embarrassment, because I cannot repay them in kind. On the first of October, I departed from Constance, heading directly to Lindau, where I found Thomas Gaßner, the churchman, and Hieronymus Pappus, the councilman, both pious and learned men, who, out of the goodness of their hearts, wished to host me with hospitality and kindness and to keep me there overnight. However, since there was a rumor there that the Augsburgers, Ulmers, and the other allies of our league were arming themselves against the rebellious Duke Heinrich of Brunswick and raising an army, I did not want to delay, especially considering what business I might have at home in such turbulent times.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I hastened to Memmingen. There, I spoke amicably with Gervasius, the churchman, and invited him to dinner. He expressed with great sorrow the tepidity and indeed the rustic minds of the senators and magistrates there, so that his disgust at having to linger there for a long time was easily perceived. He is a good and pious man, but I am very surprised that he published six questions on the Lord's Supper, the first of which is: "What is the Lord's Supper?" to which it is answered: "It is the body of Christ," etc. Since I see that he is very devoted to you and holds you in the highest regard, I believe it would be worthwhile for you to write to him and amicably inquire about the reason for publishing those six articles. However, let that be at your discretion.</p>
      <p>On the fifth of this month, I returned home safely to my interrupted labors and cares. Good God, what business and concerns I found! Piles of letters, awaiting my arrival! I also found that the rumors about the expedition against Duke Heinrich were very true. For nearly two thousand horsemen and eight thousand foot soldiers, who had gathered for several months on the Rhine against the Celts and Cimbri, have become part of Duke Heinrich's army, undoubtedly with the long-sought counsel of the priests. With this army, he now strives to reclaim the duchy occupied by our forces three years ago, and he has already reached that territory, devastating much along the way. And this seems to many wise men to be the main consultation of the held diets. What then? Our forces, having been attacked unexpectedly, trusting too much in the promised peace and the flattery of some, are now raising an army, and I hope they will have eight thousand horsemen and fifteen thousand foot soldiers by this day, with whom they will soon confront the enemy on all sides. May the Lord protect the innocent blood and exercise justice on the most wicked men.</p>
      <p>I could write to you about the incredible and astonishing treachery and deceit of the adversaries, by which they have led such an army into that region and deceived the Landgrave, so that he would not believe that the arms were turned against him, but time and business do not allow it. If anything happens in that expedition (which may the Lord graciously turn to our favor), I will not fail to write to you about it.</p>
      <p>Our magistrate repeatedly asks you and the entire Zurich college not to cease consulting among yourselves until you have sent us a minister for the church; for our necessity demands this, and it will bear witness to your affection towards us. I could not write more now. You, with your skill, will kindly consider these things, hastily poured out by me.</p>
      <p>Say many greetings from me to Lord Pellican, Erasmus Schmid, my singular friend Rudolf Gwalther, Bibliander, Ammann, Collin, Gessner, Fries, Euander, Wolf, Otto Werdmüller, Gunther, the provost, and the entire haven of Pallas with you.</p>
      <p>I will soon return your copy on not reconciling with Belial and will never cease to love you. Farewell forever, my Heinrich. You will also greet Lord Christoph Froschauer.</p>
      <p>Hastily, October 8, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours from the depths, Georg Laetus, chief scribe of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>One thing, which is not the least, I had overlooked: I earnestly ask you, if possible, to communicate to me in writing and in German the manner and form of your church, how the unity among colleagues is maintained, what censorship is used among them, how they deliberate on the replacement of the deceased, how they are offered and confirmed to the council, and what examination is held for all both local and provincial colleagues, and other things which you recounted to me orally, but which I could not retain due to the frailty of memory. May that labor not burden you, or, if it cannot be done by you, may you ensure it is done by others. Perhaps I will one day repay you for those and other benefits.</p>
      <p>You will also most diligently greet Lord Mayor Lavater, the treasurer, and the successor of the chief scribe.</p>
      <p>Duke Heinrich of Brunswick has occupied his entire territory with arms before our forces were prepared, except for the fortress of Wolfenbüttel, which is believed to be impregnable; and it is such that whoever holds it has the entire duchy in their hands. Our forces are now ready to try every fortune against the enemy. May the Lord protect his and his people's cause. I am convinced by certain conjectures that all of Germany will be in turmoil, and it will not be lacking that the Swiss cause will be addressed.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of Zurich, friend and brother forever. Zurich.</p>
