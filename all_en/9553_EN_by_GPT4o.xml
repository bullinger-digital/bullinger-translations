      <p>The summary of the confession of the Zurich church on the principal articles of the Christian religion, against which no one should spread anything in this church and school. 1. God is one in nature and essence, which is common to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. 2. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not properties or affections of one God the Father, but three truly subsisting, intelligent, and willing persons. 3. The Father is true God, the Son is true God, the Holy Spirit is true God, yet there are not three gods, but one God. 4. Neither the Son nor the Holy Spirit is a creature nor God by appellation, but in reality, and each of them is equal and consubstantial with the Father. 5. None of these persons is greater than the other, although in order one precedes the other. Indeed, the Father is numbered first, then the Son, thirdly the Holy Spirit. 6. The Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, proceeds from the Father and the Son, and that from eternity, and since he is equal and consubstantial with both, he is to be worshiped and invoked with both. 7. The Son was not only begotten when he took flesh from the Virgin, nor only before the foundations of the world were laid, but also before all eternity was begotten by the Father. 8. Christ took the substance of flesh from the Virgin Mary and did not bring it from heaven and is consubstantial with us according to human nature and in all things similar except for sin. 9. The Son, having truly become man, by his true passion and death acquired for us the forgiveness of sins and eternal life and reconciled us to the heavenly Father. 10. We are justified by faith alone in Christ and indeed freely without works or merits. 11. The fathers, who were under the law, were also saved by faith in the Messiah, the Son of God. 12. Since Christ is not only God but also true man, as to the body, from his ascension to the last day he is above the heavens and in heaven itself, and no longer dwells on earth nor fills all things with his body everywhere.</p>
      <p>We approve and receive all the canonical books and embrace them as the true and pure word of God, likewise the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, the Constantinopolitan Creed, and the Creed of Saint Athanasius, as nothing is contained in these that is not in conformity with the word of God and entirely contributes to the sincere explanation of faith.</p>
      <p>I have diligently read and re-read this confession of the Zurich church concerning the one divine essence and three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, consubstantial and coeternal, concerning the two natures of Christ, concerning the remission of sins and free justification, likewise concerning the true humanity of Christ against the ubiquity of the body of Christ. And since I have found nothing in it that does not agree excellently with the sacred scriptures, the creeds of the fathers, and the unanimous consent of the whole church, I had no reason not to subscribe to it willingly and from the heart; for thus I believe and will believe in my heart, thus I have taught and will teach with the help of God's grace, until Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God the Father, grants me the enjoyment of this life. Therefore, to this confession of the Zurich church, I, Johannes Matth√§us from Schmalkalden, Doctor of Theology, have subscribed with my own hand and faithful heart. January 19, 1574. Zurich.</p>
