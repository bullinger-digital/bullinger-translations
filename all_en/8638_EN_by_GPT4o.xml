      <p>Greetings. I recently sent some letters of recommendation, to which, however, the person whom I thought you would meet did not respond.</p>
      <p>I also informed you how immodestly Gantner and Marius were behaving. Since the time the synod dispersed, Marius has been meeting with his faction's people in the Valtellina, and after greeting Turrianus, they seem to be nurturing some kind of monstrosity.</p>
      <p>Gantner was summoned and asked in the council whether he would yield, having been defeated, and confirm the subscription made in his own hand, he refused and said he would rather renounce everything than be of our opinion. Therefore, he was deprived of citizenship by the council.</p>
      <p>Now he loudly complains and, running around, moves every stone to be safe with the people's favor, etc. I am sending some things that were sent to me the day before yesterday by Mr. Lentulus. Farewell, most esteemed father. About other matters another time; now my wife's serious illness calls me elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Most hastily, August 14, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church in Zürich, his most venerable lord. Zürich.</p>
