      <p>Greetings, my venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I write nothing as I am entirely taken up with other matters. Everything is still in a moderate state with us. Pray to the Lord that we may progress more and more for the better. Joachim Gachnang, who was with me in Tuttlingen, if he still desires the ministry of the word with us, make sure he moves here soon. Then, a certain Johannes Buchmann, who served as a parish priest in Wengen in the Thurgau region and is now residing in your city, if he seems worthy to you, send him as well.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my very dear and beloved brother, and forgive me for not fulfilling my duty at all. I endure such a difficult task that you could not believe it unless you experienced it yourself. Commend me to the Savior Christ. Greet Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Rösch the consul, along with the other good brothers and friends, especially your wife.</p>
      <p>Soon you will receive the new ordinance of this university.</p>
      <p>October 8th.</p>
      <p>Yours, Amb. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere bishop of the church of Zurich, venerable and dearest brother.</p>
