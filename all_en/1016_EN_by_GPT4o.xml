      <p>Greetings. You may perhaps wonder, most learned man, what our letters, such unusual letters, intend. I am burning, so to speak, with an incredible love for learning the divine letters ever since my youth and indeed, as much as possible, to know them thoroughly. Therefore, whatever time is granted to me from the affairs of both the academy and our prince, I have been accustomed to devote all of it to the continuous reading of the Bible and the explanations that exist on it, especially at this age of mine now growing burdensome, particularly those that have come from you and those who are most similar to you. Thus, about two years ago, while I was standing at our bookshops and, as is my custom, asked if there was anything new from Zürich, from Geneva, from Bullinger, Pellican, Calvin, or others, I came across a booklet entitled "Series and Arrangement of Times and Events Described by Blessed Luke in the Acts of the Apostles" by Heinrich Bullinger. Having eagerly read the introductory letter of this booklet, I thought that just as you rightly considered it to be joined with Gwalther's oration, so I should similarly take care to combine it with that booklet which, on a similar subject from the beginning of the world to the birth of Christ, I had learned from the same letter that you had also written. However, from that time until now, I have not been able to obtain it here with us or anywhere else, even though I have so often sought it in Frankfurt, Strasbourg, and even Lyon in France. Therefore, what I had not thought of until now, it occurred to me that you might not have yet published it through the booksellers' assistants. If that is the case, I ask you, my dear Bullinger, to arrange for the work to be copied in my name at any price and to ensure it is sent to me as soon as you have found someone to whom you can rightly entrust it, and to consider this importunity of mine and these letters with kindness and fairness. If, however, the book finally appears at these autumn fairs, I have given a mandate to the one who carried these letters to Frankfurt, Ulrich Moerhard, our bookseller, to either bring it back to me or to discard it completely; for I think that your occupations for the public good should be spared, just as Pliny wrote to Vespasian. Farewell. Tübingen, on the first of September, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Melchior Volmar Rufus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and excellent man Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
