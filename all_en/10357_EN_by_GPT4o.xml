      <p>Greetings. The unrest, which is said to have occurred in Paris, has reached our council in writing these days, and today it was confirmed by a nobleman who came directly from the king to Basel. The king, with a large cavalry, is now heading to Paris, I do not know what he intends to do. He is planning something against the emperor and his brother, I do not know if also against others. Hesse was with him without his people knowing. What he did, I do not know. I do know that pamphlets were exchanged and sealed. The interpreter of this was Philipp, Count of Fürstenberg. The French embassy soon moved from Augsburg to the Duke of Bavaria. Initially, they spoke kindly as if they were going to act as mediators in the assembly, but finally so threateningly against the emperor and Ferdinand that I understand from this the subject of their speech, about which you warned us. The Archbishops of Mainz, Würzburg, and Trier are so friendly to Hesse that the Archbishop of Trier led him back to his homeland from the king. These things are astonishing. Saturnalia and a gathering of horses, so to speak, have been announced for Hesse, up to a thousand six hundred.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that the Turks are preparing a naval expedition to Italy. I do not hear a word about the pope. We must always invoke God to remove the disturbances and protect His word.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord with your people and Utinger and Pellican and Leo and Theodor.</p>
      <p>In Basel, hastily, February 16, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, friend.</p>
