      <p> Greetings. I received your letter of December 19th and on the same day, with the diligence and faithfulness that was appropriate, and with the devotion I owe you, I inquired with some of our locals, with as much diligence as I could, to carry out the task you entrusted to me, to find out about that man's whereabouts and hiding places. I finally learned that it has now been five weeks since he left our city, having stayed here for several days with relatives he has here, and that he is now hiding with his family at the Abbey of Rheinau, and may perhaps return here next spring. Therefore, if he cannot be conveniently apprehended at that abbey, and if Lord Georg Laetus is pleased to pursue him and you vouch for him in writing, I can arrange for a man here who, by your command, will ensure that if that man passes through here, he will be imprisoned, establishing himself as the opposing party according to our civil laws, and as is our custom, until justice is satisfied. I am sending this back to you with the enclosed letters, quite pleased that I have such favor with you that you would deign to ask someone whom you should have commanded, not because such an honor is due to me as unworthy, but so that you may impart to me the eloquence and charm you possess. For I, who can do little, wish you to consider me ready and prepared to obey even the slightest word of such a great man, knowing well that you will command nothing but with a sincere and holy mind. Furthermore, I greeted Lord Calvin with the presentation of your own letters, by which he understood your opinion on the Greek concordance, and he will send you letters concerning this matter and our affairs through this local courier, a preacher. I also thank you for informing me about my brother's health, and since I know and see that he and I are commended to you, I remain silent, praying and beseeching God to always be favorable and supportive to us both. </p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Geneva, December 22, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted, Michael Roset.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent, outstanding, and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, a lord and friend to be especially honored and revered.</p>
