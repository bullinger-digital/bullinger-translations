      <p>Many greetings in Christ, our God and Lord.</p>
      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, I would not want you to suspect me of negligence or forgetfulness, or rather of that respect which I have always tried to show towards you, or even of contempt for my duty, because, although I have received your letters full of humanity and Christian piety almost two years ago, I have not yet responded to them.</p>
      <p>The reasons that have delayed me are of such a nature that they have led me to postpone writing to you until today. The main reason was that at the time your letters reached us, our church was in such a miserable state, so oppressed by the waves of so many opinions, that it did not seem right to me to inform you, who have shown us such great piety, of the miserable state of the church, lest I cause you grief when you learn that we are not being harassed, scattered, and destroyed by the papists or the enemies of Christ, but by our own, who wish to appear as brothers, attacking and opposing us with such a hostile spirit in their disagreements of opinion that nothing more hostile can be imagined.</p>
      <p>Another reason was that around the time I was preparing to respond, a rumor spread among us, truly unfortunate for all of us, about your death, which affected us deeply as it should have; thus, not only did the opportunity to respond seem cut off, but what was more serious, all hope of help and assistance, which we hoped for from you while you were alive, for our collapsing and falling church, was taken away. Finally, letters written by your hand were brought to Christoph Thretius, from which we understood that you were still alive and could still bring some aid to the church of God, about which you can imagine how much we rejoiced.</p>
      <p>We gave the greatest thanks from our most kind heart to the Father, who preserved for us, that is, for the Christian church, a diligent pastor and minister and a vigilant guardian, from whom we can still seek not inconsiderable assistance.</p>
      <p>Now indeed an opportune occasion is offered to me to write, so that I may fulfill my duty and satisfy these young nephews of mine from my cousin.</p>
      <p>They are indeed endowed with excellent character and wonderful promise, who are sent to you for this reason, that they may so advance in Christian doctrine, in the piety of morals, and in the integrity of life, that they may someday bring not inconsiderable assistance and ornament to our church, of which they will be most worthy members, and to the entire republic.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I commend and entrust them to you, most humane Bullinger, and to the other men endowed with remarkable piety, as sons from the heart; for consider this to be the seminary of our church, which is nourished, educated, and instructed in the greatest hope. For if there are any who now live infected with the gravest errors, they will perish someday, and then a new offspring will arise, filled with the best teachings, instructed and formed in pious morals, which will represent some image of the true church.</p>
      <p>For this reason, we wish as much as we can that these and whoever from our people come to you to imbibe piety, be commended to you.</p>
      <p>In what state the affairs of our church are, I think you will learn from the letters of our people, for they are such that we see them daily rushing into worse. Therefore, I ask you to help us with prayers to God and to assist and support us with some writings together with your colleagues. Every day monsters arise, every day remedies must also arise, which will vigorously overcome them.</p>
      <p>Who can accomplish this both more easily and more successfully than you, I do not easily see. Farewell, most illustrious man, and embrace us with that love and Christian piety which you are accustomed to in Christ. May the Lord God preserve you for us for a very long time through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Given at Krakau, October 10, 1565.</p>
      <p>Stanislaus Myszkowski of Mirow, Palatine and Captain of Krakau, etc., by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend and most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, an exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, a friend and brother to be respected in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Palatine of Krakau, in the month of October, the year 1565.</p>
