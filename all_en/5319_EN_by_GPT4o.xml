      <p>S. D. I received the letters about the occupation of Lyon with great joy.</p>
      <p>Glory and praise be to the Lord; may He break the most impious stubbornness of the wicked. For those letters of yours, I give you, honorable man, the greatest thanks on behalf of both my fellow ministers and myself, and I pray that you continue to write and promptly send the main points of the events, either through yourself or through Budeus or Jonvillé. Mr. Coignet takes excellent care of our letters.</p>
      <p>He has also conducted himself excellently in this matter and continues to do so, faithful to the king and Condé. What he does by order of the counterfeit and Guise letters, he does coldly, so that he is poorly spoken of by the 5 Pagans. But I continually encourage him with written letters.</p>
      <p>The main reason I am writing now is this. The most illustrious Prince of Hesse sends me letters through his own messenger.</p>
      <p>He wishes to be informed and made certain about the affairs of France, as such varied rumors are spread in Hesse. He wishes to know what I think about Condé's cause, and whether his defense seems just and legitimate to me. I explain the matter to him as I received it from you and from France.</p>
      <p>I send Condé's declaration and protestation with the treaty. I defend Condé's cause in many ways, showing that it is against the Constable and the Guises as Jehoiada was against Athaliah. I urge him not to believe the false royal seal.</p>
      <p>I urge him not to send soldiers or cavalry to France against Condé, but rather to prevent the parricides and nefarious plans of the Constable and the Guises against the king and the kingdom from being exposed to neighboring princes and neighbors. The prince's letters were written on April 24th in Giessen, Hesse.</p>
      <p>He also recounts in his letters that Guise sent to him with Navarre, requesting cavalry. He sent the entire action of the envoy.</p>
      <p>I enclose it as I received it from him and pray that you promptly send it to the illustrious Prince Condé. He will have interpreters, or that noble Bernese from Erlach. It would seem useful to me if he sent either letters or an envoy to the Landgrave to explain the whole matter. Perhaps he has already sent it.</p>
      <p>For, as I just said, the prince's letters are dated April 24th in Giessen.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow I will again send his messenger laden with letters and urge him to hurry. If you write to France, commend me to the illustrious Prince Condé, to whom I pray God grants wisdom, strength, and constancy.</p>
      <p>Greet the dearest brother Beza, for whose health we diligently pray to the Lord. The Lord uses his ministry for the greatest things.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless him and keep him.</p>
      <p>Rumor reaches us that the Five Cantons are most unjustly bearing the delay imposed on them by the Zurichers and Bernese. They cry out: they hindered us so that in the meantime ours would perish along with the ancient religion. Oh, if only, oh if etc.</p>
      <p>In others, the fervor begins to wane when they hear that Lyon has been occupied by our people. Others say they will send soldiers to France if they are first satisfied in all things. However, I hear that the total debt grows to two gold coins[!?]. I know, however, how the Guises have plundered and exhausted the royal treasury.</p>
      <p>Some think that a legion must be led altogether. Thus Captain Frölich urges and strives, by which name he is most hated by Coignet.</p>
      <p>And it is said that Frölich told him to remember the benefits received from France, and that Navarre, the Constable, Guise, and Malesherbes are not France, but the better part is on the opposite side. It is better for Condé to know this, so that by delaying too much he does not miss the opportunity to act conveniently, complete the matter, and recover the king, the queen, and Paris before foreign soldiers enter France.</p>
      <p>But I commend all these things to your prudence. We anxiously await what has happened in Paris.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the brothers.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you, honorable man and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 12, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. John Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, and in his absence to Mr. John Budeus or John Jonvillé, my most honorable and dearest brothers. Geneva.</p>
