      <p>Gerhard Campius instructed me, my dear Mr. Pellikan, to write to you myself and to establish some familiarity with you, since at that time your son was at my house in Friesland together with the aforementioned Gerhard, when the funeral of my deceased wife was being held. However, you can learn about our affairs from Bullinger's letters, which are of such a condition that there is no doubt it is worth the effort for you to assist us with your prayers before God, although it is certain that so far the Almighty has preserved the integrity of His word among us before the gates of Orcus, so that nothing has yet been changed, even if we fear a change in religion is coming, and already such a change that will be the cause of exile for many preachers, although everything depends on the divine will, so that human efforts are easily overturned and do not come to fruition. The Eastern and maritime churches have not yet recognized that declaration, which is commonly called the Interim, and the cities themselves are suffering not insignificant hardships because of religion. They are so connected by a certain covenant that they are prepared to endure anything before denying their religion.</p>
      <p>May the Lord strengthen the spirits of such people, who consider nothing more important than religion, and provide us with such steadfastness of mind that, according to Christ's teaching, we would sooner deny our soul than the word of salvation and truth.</p>
      <p>In England, the light of the word is still shining brightly in my opinion, just as it began or arose in the East, so in the West it will set like the sun with the condemnation of the world; for I do not remember reading that it ever returned to where it once departed due to stubborn ingratitude, although it has revived at various times. Therefore, may God, in His infinite mercy towards us, grant that we fall asleep before we reach that time in this life, about which Christ predicted: "When the Son of Man comes, do you think He will find faith on earth?" God is my witness how diligently and earnestly I pray for this, as I see that the Lord is testing us with this very thing, since the plague has begun to rage among us, as it has raged in the eastern region, I have no doubt you are well aware. May the Lord's will be done. Amen. Pray for us; we will do the same for you, and for your Peter, who earnestly seeks prayers in the name of Christ from the pious, knowing that they penetrate the heavens to the Father and obtain what is asked. Farewell, my most esteemed father and most respected lord, and please consider my very humble condition kindly; I consider it enough and good to know that Christ has been given to me and Him crucified for my salvation.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, June 29, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, as much as he is, Peter Campensis.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished and most illustrious men, both in piety and learning, Mr. Konrad Pellikan and Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant doctors of the ZÃ¼rich church, their most respected lords, most dutifully.</p>
