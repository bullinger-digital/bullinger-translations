      <p>Greetings. Finally, as I hope, our Linerus has reached you.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I received another letter from you through our brother here, to which I could not respond until this day, as there was no courier to whom I could safely entrust my reply.</p>
      <p>Regarding our affairs: the Lord has wonderfully delivered us, watching over us, as our friend here will narrate to you in detail.</p>
      <p>For it is a long story.</p>
      <p>But it is truly disgraceful that no one seems to believe that we were in extreme danger and still are, until we are utterly destroyed.</p>
      <p>Yet the Lord lives, in whom we will hope even when dead. And by God's grace, we continue in our way and, as I hope, will continue.</p>
      <p>Our Calvin perpetually struggles with his illnesses and awaits a response from you, and at the same time sends his greetings. Regarding France: you would say that together with the Cardinal, new hordes of devils are now threatening France. The Guise family renews their complaints, and the adversaries raise their crests.</p>
      <p>Geneva, already destroyed, or soon to be (as they say), is the den of all evils.</p>
      <p>The Queen Mother looks favorably upon Lorraine and the Cardinal. But by God's grace, our people do not leave the king's side, and although a certain declaration of a peace edict has recently been issued, which is quite unjust, our friends still bid us to hope for the best. I see that prayers are needed, if ever before, so that the Lord may break the final efforts of Satan: otherwise, I must admit that such calamities threaten us as I do not know if God's church has ever endured since the world was created.</p>
      <p>May the Lord therefore grant us perseverance both in favorable and adverse circumstances. I am sending back to you the letter from Wisb.</p>
      <p>I hear that Castellio has revived and denies the charges I made against him. If the people of Basel decide on the controversy in my absence, that is, on the matter, it is likely that it will be easy to defeat someone who is absent and not resisting.</p>
      <p>But I commit the whole matter to God, who will undoubtedly avenge this laziness or treachery of some in His own time.</p>
      <p>Balduin, under the name of a certain Fabricius, has spewed new loads of insults against us. I have received only a few pages, one of which I handed to our friend here because it contains something about you and our Gualter, which is worth knowing, lest a lost apostate continues to abuse your name. I have a copy of the pardon diploma, which he obtained from Philipp, to be readmitted into the bosom of the Roman church after renouncing the heresies of our churches, which he also did publicly with the Atrebatensian cardinal as a witness.</p>
      <p>I hardly think I will respond to him.</p>
      <p>For who would ever be the end of these insults? However, when I obtain the whole book, I will deliberate, and I ask that you return that page.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, along with all your colleagues, whom I commend to God's grace with you, so that our Lord Jesus may strengthen you all in His work and bless your holy labors more and more.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Geneva, January 10.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my father, to be greatly respected in the Lord and the truly faithful pastor of the Zurich church. In Zurich.</p>
