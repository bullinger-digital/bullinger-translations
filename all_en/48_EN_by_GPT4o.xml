    <p xml:id="regest1">In his own name and on behalf of the St. Gallen council, Vadian thanks Bullinger for his last letter [not received], especially for the report on the unity of the Confederates. For, trusting in God, the people of St. Gallen rely on the fact that the old [Swiss] freedom will remain intact as long as unity persists.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">In Augsburg, lavish banquets are frequently held. While [the participants of the Imperial Diet] sleep during the day and spend the nights celebrating and dancing, many are meanwhile executed, having been slandered as supporters of King Henry II of France. This includes the famous mercenary leader Sebastian Vogelsberger, who, after his arrest at his own home near Mainz and transfer to Augsburg, was recently [on February 7, 1548] beheaded.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">In France, as Vadian reports, the situation is quite similar. Octavien Blondel, for whom the councils of Zurich, Bern, and St. Gallen had intervened with concern, was brought from Lyon to Paris (the cesspool of Babylon, place of superstition!) at the end of January 1548. There, on February 1 [correctly: February 4], he was more tormented by the flames than burned. It is astonishing that Blondel remained steadfast in the true faith until his death, even though the stoked fire burned him only slowly! According to his sentence, the man's wealth (he was rich!) was supposed to go into the state treasury. However, some notable people [N.N.] have embezzled and removed his possessions. Undoubtedly, they also withheld the petitions from Bern, Zurich, and St. Gallen, as the places of origin [of the letters] alone seemed suspicious to them. This is how the truth is handled today! The Lord, who foresaw this, will save His own and grant them eternal life.</p>

      <p>S. I give great thanks to you, most excellent and learned man, both in my own name and on behalf of the council, for the recent, indeed the very latest, letters you wrote to me, in which it was most pleasing that you advised about the concord of the cantons. For with that preserved, we confidently trust in the Lord that our ancestral freedom will remain intact.</p>

      <p>In Augsburg, frequent and lavish banquets are held. They sleep during the day, and at night they play and dance. Meanwhile, punishment is inflicted on many who have been betrayed as favoring the French King. Among them, the notable captain Sebastian Vogelsberger was recently beheaded, having been captured at his home near Mainz and brought to Augsburg.</p>

      <p>Similar things, and to speak truly, are happening in France. Octavien Blondel, for whom your most honorable council and Bern and ours interceded so earnestly and diligently, was brought from Lyon at the end of January to that Babylon of errors and superstitions, that is, to the city of Paris. On the first of February, he was more roasted than burned. For he was slowly toasted by a gentle fire, yet he breathed out a soul wonderfully steadfast and persevering in solid faith! His goods (for he was wealthy) were adjudged to the treasury, but they are said to have been begged and plundered by certain nobles. Nor is there any doubt that our letters were suppressed by those to whom even the names of the cities are suspect. With these adornments, truth is decorated today! But the Lord, who foretold this, will be the avenger and will crown His own with the gift of unfading life.</p>

      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, on the 20th day of February, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed bishop of the holy church of Zurich, his most revered lord.</p>
