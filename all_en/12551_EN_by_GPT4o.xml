      <p>Grace of the Lord be with you. I received Gwalther's letter on June 26th from a certain citizen of Colmar, to whom it had been delivered by Leonhard Hospinian. I give you both immense thanks, but especially to you, most kind and learned Bullinger, who, overwhelmed by the affairs of so many churches, prepared a response for me through our beloved brother Rudolf. For as all the arguments are solid and firm and in accordance with the Holy Scripture, they will provide me with the opportunity both to respond and to think against the schemes and deceits of Veit of Nuremberg, who has several disciples among us. It would be worthwhile to refute the obstinacy of such people, etc. About which, when there is time, perhaps more later.</p>

      <p>As for the state of all affairs in Germany, it is not necessary for me to write at length. For you yourself hear more and greater things, if I am not mistaken, than I can write. In short: There is a convergence from all sides, almost citizen against citizen is armed, so that I think soon it will be as Christ said, a man's enemies will be those of his own household, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Duke Ulrich of Württemberg has twelve thousand armored cavalry, unless those who affirm this so solemnly are lying, and the foot soldiers are still gathering. We recently sent him a cohort or banner, they say. In Strasbourg, all who wish to serve as soldiers have their pay ready. Some are sent to the Landgrave of Hesse, others to the imperial cities. There is no one among them all who either fears or loses heart, etc. We therefore diligently pray to God to defend His cause. We advise the rest to repent.</p>

      <p>I am forced to shorten my hand. The messenger is pressing on my shoulders. Riquewihr, June 16, 1546.</p>
      <p>Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the learned and equally pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent churchman of Zurich, always to be respected as a brother. Zürich to Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
