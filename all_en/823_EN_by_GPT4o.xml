      <p>Greetings, dearest compater. The letters you sent on the 17th of this month, I received today for the first time. The ones you wrote in German regarding the matter of our compater Mr. Haller, I immediately presented to the lord treasurer to be read. He instructed me to approach the senate and, after summoning the chief secretary, to convey these matters; for he himself, being afflicted with foot pain, has not left his home for several months now, which causes not a little hindrance in many affairs, both ecclesiastical and scholastic. I conveyed your advice to the chief secretary; he replied that these matters have been most diligently entrusted to their envoys, so there is no need to remind the senate again. Thus, both you and I and the good treasurer have done what is fitting for men of the church who desire to consult; now, what remains, let the Lord take care of, and you will undoubtedly continue to do diligently what you have done so far. Indeed, what is good in the eyes of the Lord will be done and will happen. At the end of the letter, you implore me not to leave here, whatever may happen. My mind, dearest compater, does not entertain departure, although this place is quite burdensome for many reasons. In the meantime, however, you will consider how harsh a weapon necessity is, which compels even the unwilling to do what they would not want to do. It is exceedingly burdensome to serve such a wealthy republic to the detriment of my own affairs and to expend what was meant for the use of my wife and children, preserved with paternal care and concern for the time of widowhood and orphanhood. I would serve a much poorer church more eagerly in this manner, no matter how much I would expend my resources for its sake.</p>
      <p>However, whatever may be, we belong to the Lord, my wife, children, and all that He has given; His providence is not so limited and narrow as to disregard the straits of our necessity. Farewell excellently, compater in the Lord, dearest. Greetings to all yours in my name and in the name of all mine. Bern, January 29, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his lord and dearest compater.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
