      <p>Greetings. Three days ago, I forgot to mention something about Sulzer.</p>
      <p>If your people had any spirit, a meeting should have been immediately called so that the remaining allies could seriously protest with the people of Basel, and finally demand from them a frank and open declaration of their opinion.</p>
      <p>Thus, the fox would have been dragged into the arena. And I am surprised that you are delaying in handling this matter.</p>
      <p>For if this matter of discord is nurtured, it will soon break out into an open fire.</p>
      <p>The people of Bern, Schaffhausen, and St. Gallen agree with you very well, so there is no danger from the slightest controversy.</p>
      <p>If therefore the pastors of those cities were to demand from Sulzer what he means, he would be shamefully forced to withdraw from the reckless subscription, to which mere ambition drove him, or at least he would reveal what he has so far concealed.</p>
      <p>For unless I am very mistaken, he aspires to something else.</p>
      <p>Surely, unless you intervene, the adversaries will boast, not without your disgrace, that the Swiss are already divided.</p>
      <p>Now the importunity of Marbach has prevailed so that the doors of the temple were closed to the French.</p>
      <p>Thus, the small church which had flourished for 25 years was overthrown by the furious onslaught of this beast.</p>
      <p>Sturm and Ottomann soothe the pastor, so that he may bend to some middle course.</p>
      <p>They wanted to have me as a supporter, but I gave advice as truth dictated to me.</p>
      <p>I am responding to the letters of Lord Stanislaus, whose surname I could not read as it was written by his hand.</p>
      <p>Unless a new stimulus had been added to me, I intended to remain silent, because that nation is now suspect to me as few act sincerely.</p>
      <p>However, since I understand that his children were your companions, I did not want to fail in my duty.</p>
      <p>I ask that you ensure my response is delivered.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and brother, highly esteemed by me. Many greetings to all colleagues.</p>
      <p>Geneva, September 12, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>Your Ionville respectfully and sincerely greets you. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, brother and fellow minister, highly esteemed by me.</p>
