    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Kilchmeyer received Bullinger's letter [not preserved] on January 29. How good it is that the people of Zurich are arming themselves against the Antichrist not only outwardly but also inwardly! May God grant them victory for the honor of His name and the redemption of His Church!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The judgment conceived against the obscurantists [Johannes Ulrich Göppel and Benedikt Schürmeister] was already presented to the Bernese pastors, but not yet to the council. On January 24, Kilchmeyer suffered an unexpected relapse, possibly as a result of his previous illness. When Simon Sulzer heard about it, he immediately offered his help. Kilchmeyer would have appreciated this if he did not know that Sulzer was merely lurking like a vulture for his prey. Beat Gering, who cannot hide his antipathy, did not visit. Previously, the expectations of the two were disappointed when they had to witness how God healed Kilchmeyer so well that he was able to preach again with fresh strength on January 1 (although he was so seriously ill that even some Bernese patricians were worried about him and forced him to see a doctor [Christoph Christeiner]).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Kilchmeyer now wants to report this relapse to Bullinger himself, so that if he hears about it from others, he will not worry about him and the Bernese church. Rather, Bullinger should continue to pray for him, so that God may give him the strength (if it is His will) to continue plowing the field and removing all stony obstacles, so that God's kingdom may be revealed to all. To God alone belongs the honor, which neither Bullinger (who deemed Kilchmeyer worthy of the Bernese church service and helped him to the position) nor Kilchmeyer (who hesitated to follow the calling) deserve. Yet Kilchmeyer also knows that virtue will reward those who practice it sincerely, as Seneca has already taught.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings to the wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler], to the family, to the godfather Johann Jakob Ammann, and the always helpful Johannes Fries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In these days, four Bernese students [Jonas Danmatter, Johannes Fädminger, Johann Knechtenhofer, and Abel Mühlhofer] were sent to Zurich with a letter of recommendation [No. 2764]. Bullinger should meet the expectations of the Bernese. It would be good (and Bullinger knows why) if the Zurich authorities now also sent four Zurich scholars to study in Bern. They should be young boys still in basic education, as the [Bernese Lutheran] priests have ensured that there is currently no theological education for older students. Kilchmeyer would be completely devoted to the Zurich council if they appointed him as the host. The Zurich council would find in him a preceptor and father who is concerned with the good reputation of Zurich, understanding, yet at the same time strict and by no means negligent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Another greeting.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [P.S.:] Greetings from Johannes Wäber, Eberhard von Rümlang, and Nikolaus Pfister.</p>

      <p>S. On the 29th day of January, I received your letters, most learned man and beloved brother in the Lord, which greatly cheered me, especially because they informed me that against the kingdom of the Antichrist, both in the city and in the countryside of Zurich, all are prepared, not only with military equipment but also with the greatest eagerness of spirit. In this alone, I truly believe the confidence of victory depends. May the Lord, whose is the victory and who turns enemies to flight, uplift, strengthen, and make them victorious for His glory and the salvation of His Church! Amen.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Our judgment against the controversy of certain obscurantists - you know whom I mean - has indeed been made among us, but not yet revealed and proposed to our magnificent council, and this because of a certain weakness (I think it is the remnants of my old fevers), which unexpectedly overwhelmed me on the 24th of January to such an extent that I was forced to omit one sermon. Upon hearing this, my Sulzer (oh, the man's faith!) hurriedly came, sad and mourning, offering his help in every event. I owe him many thanks, if he had not flown in like a vulture seeking prey. Our Battus, a more open enemy, did not even deign to see me. But what of the Lord of all? When they were eager for prey, they were deceived. For divine clemency suddenly raised me up, making me so strong, wise, and entirely new in my old skin, that on the first day of January, they were compelled not only to see me in public assembly but also to hear me preaching! I believe this was done by the inscrutable providence of God and that I was again placed on the Lord's plow by the prayers of the pious. For my unexpected illness disturbed the minds of many, even nobles and optimates, by whose counsel I even admitted a doctor against all my intentions, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I did not want to hide this weakness of mine from you, lest perhaps hearing it from rumor and uncertain fame, you might lament my fate and the cause of the church too much or in vain. You should continue, as always, to commend me to the Lord in your prayers, so that, if it is His will, He may be present, so that I may be able to draw the plow, to which He (not without your help) has bound and tightly fastened me, to break and uproot the rough soil, rocks, roots, and all impediments to good fruits, so that it may be openly seen that the kingdom is the Lord's, and neither to you, who judged me worthy, nor to me, who obeyed tardily but justly, any glory or strength may be attributed. For nothing is ours but to glory in the Lord and to inculcate this to all. If there is any reward for virtue (as I do not doubt), it will not perish. Or to whom, I ask, either among the pagans or the living or the dead, has virtue not brought favor, if only he followed it in good faith, as our Seneca teaches; if he did not paint and adorn himself?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell, farewell with your wife and all your family. I bid Jacob Ammann, my godfather, and Johannes Fries, born to all, to be very well.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In these days, four of our students are being sent to Zurich with letters given to you. It will be your duty, as we hope, to execute everything with dignity according to our trust. I also desire four from your stipendiaries (you know the reason), but such as are still to be instructed in the elements (for the theological reading for the older ones is not yet established among us as it should be, due to the worst priests hindering it), and the boys who are sent, if the Zurich magistrate grants me so much trust, for which I acknowledge myself entirely to him. In me, they will have a guest, a father, and a strict preceptor for the glory of Zurich, indulgent and by no means negligent.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell again. From Bern, on the 29th day of January in the year 1547. Your always, Jodocus K.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Textorius, Eberhardus, Artopeus greet you all.</p>
      <p>With learning and sacred vigilance to the distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the most ample church of Zurich, his always esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
