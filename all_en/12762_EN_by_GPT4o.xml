    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger's headaches are regrettable, yet not surprising given his continuous work and the additional worries caused by the war! Myconius also can hardly sleep, especially after bad news. Often, he loses his appetite. At times, he no longer even finds joy in the company of friends. But then he finds peace and comfort in the Lord again. However, only for a while, as the times have probably never been so bad. Well then! May the Lord grant resilience and victory through patience!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Myconius immediately sent back the letter from the Hessian Theobald [Thamer] [No. 2647], so that (according to Bullinger's wish) no one gets to read it, not even [Francisco] de Enzinas, who always asks for news from Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The news about Duke Maurice [of Saxony] is painful, if they are true. Who would have thought such betrayal of a relative [Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony] possible in a person, let alone a Christian? Maurice behaves just as cruelly as Emperor [Charles V.] towards Germany! But that is entirely in line with the Emperor's approach: He binds the power-hungry or greedy to himself by promising them even more fame or money. Thus, the Emperor is said to have promised the electoral dignity to the Duke... The punishment of both potentates is left to the judgment of Christ!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The report from Constance about the wintering of [imperial] troops in the Hegau and on Lake Constance leaves Myconius quite indifferent. It is probably a deception maneuver by the Emperor, who says one thing to be able to do another. He has already achieved quite a lot with that. Myconius therefore does not understand why this worries Bullinger so much. What is he afraid of? If all the Emperor's forces pursue the Elector, there is no reason for [the Confederation] to fear. It was reported from Strasbourg that due to military resistance, the Elector on his way to Franconia had to change his route. He is said to have moved through the Bergstraße to Frankfurt, to get from there to Thuringia, which is already said to be in Maurice's hands.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] At the Baden Diet, [François de La Rivière] could not report anything certain about his king [Francis I.]. He is said to have sent an embassy to Ulm in recent days. [La Rivière] did not know why. Furthermore, [Nicolas Perrenot de] Granvelle is said to be in France.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Enzinas just writes to share that he has learned from St. Gallen that the Emperor is going to marry! But probably in hell! For Matthias Claudius writes that in Augsburg, as well as in Nuremberg and Memmingen, the Emperor is declared dead. However, Claudius adds to his report that he fears something terrible behind it. What if the Emperor were to move to Bohemia to cause harm from there?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bullinger is to report on the Baden Diet. Greetings, also to the family and colleagues. The messenger [...] is urging; hence the haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] Myconius does not complain about Jodocus [Kilchmeyer], as the situation [in Bern] has calmed down.</p>

      <p>S. I am sorry because you are suffering from headaches. However, I am not surprised. The endless work you endure, what else could it cause? If you add the troubles of the present war, you will suffer more. I know what I endure here. Sleep is partly unpleasant, partly taken away, especially when something serious is announced. Food often becomes unappetizing; drink does not delight; and sometimes I even recoil from friends. Finally, when I return to the Lord, my mind is calmed, peace is restored, and the decent pleasure of words returns. This lasts as long as it pleases God. Then again turmoil and again tranquility. And I am indeed forced to play such a game continuously, until enough of this greatest storm, which I do not know if anything has ever been more turbulent. Come, may the Lord be with us, so that we can bear all these things in Him and overcome them happily through patience!</p>

      <p>I returned the letters of Theobald Hessi quickly, to comply with the command that you prohibited anyone else from seeing them. For when Dryander approached me, the first word after the greeting was: "Do you have any news from Bullinger?" If I had retained them even for one day, it could have happened that I would have indicated to him, thus asking.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am further tormented by pain because of Maurice, if what you assert is true. Who would have thought such treachery possible in a man, I do not say a Christian, but someone joined by blood? It is equally cruel to me what he does against a relative, as what the Emperor does against Germany. But Charles is said to be such that he attracts great men to himself, as he knows anyone to be inclined by nature, like the ambitious through the greatness of honors, the greedy through money, the brave through the promise of glory, etc. And it is said that he did so with the glorious Maurice: He promised the electoral dignity, so to speak, and conquered the man, so that he acts against the law of nature, kinship, affinity, and especially Christian charity. Therefore, a bad Emperor who incited; a bad Maurice who obeys. Since both are bad, let us leave them to the judgment of Christ to be condemned and punished.</p>

      <p>Besides, when the people of Constance write about the wintering of some horsemen and foot soldiers through the Hegau and at Lake Constance, it moved me little, because this is the nature of the Emperor, to say this and do that, so that he may deceive people more easily. And by this method, he has indeed achieved not a little so far. But you add here: "If it is true, you will see what will happen." Here I do not understand. What do you threaten or what do you look towards? However, if the Emperor with his forces follows the Elector with all his might, there is no reason for anyone to fear. From Strasbourg, it came to our senate that when the Elector attempted to make his journey through France, there was such a rush to arms that if he did not want to be enclosed from the front and back, he was forced to deviate from the intended route. Therefore, he came to the road called Bergstraße, and from there proceeded to Frankfurt, then through Thuringia, which they say belongs to Maurice, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The lord, who was at the Baden Diet, knows nothing certain about the Frenchman. However, he said that envoys were sent by his king to Ulm these days; for what business, it is not clear. Granvelle is also said to be in France.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>But if it were true, what he sent, while I write this, Dryander again from St. Gallen, the Emperor will perhaps marry in hell. For Matthias Clodius writes from Augsburg, Nuremberg, Memmingen that he came and died. However, he adds: "Something monstrous is being nurtured." And I fear, lest he, having set out for Bohemia, attempts what might cause harm.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I would like to understand what was done at the Diet. Farewell with your family and brothers. In Basel hastily, for the messenger urged and the brevity of time. December 15, 1546. Yours, Os. Myco.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I do not inquire about Jodocus, for the matters that seemed to violate peace and charity are settled.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the best minister of Christ, lord and brother in Christ, venerable to him. Zurich.</p>
