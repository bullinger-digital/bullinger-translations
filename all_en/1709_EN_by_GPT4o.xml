      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, many and serious reasons keep me wishing to come to you for many and serious reasons. But I will explain myself from here, I hope, shortly and I will return to your advice.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, know that the Lord has driven out the market of masses from the new village with me as minister. It is not far from Soglio, the homeland of Travers. I have already given them a minister, but not the kind I would have wanted; for few workers appear. I am now attacking another village with almost daily sermons. One of these, from which the mass had also been expelled, threatens defection. Therefore, here too great labors must be undertaken, indeed dangers are imminent; for the nearby papists do not want to tolerate the neighboring gospel and are powerful and my perpetual enemies. These are the troubles in which our Lord God exercises me, although others are not lacking.</p>
      <p>The messenger is safe, who will carry the letters; therefore I will dare to write more here. The English ambassador will soon return to his homeland; he affirms that he will not leave without me and advises that I should expect his call, and adds that he wishes to visit your churches with me. Therefore, I do not dare to leave Raetia and come to you before he writes to me. Keep this to yourself.</p>
      <p>Gallitius, who had been advised by letters from you (Travers saw them), not to treat me unworthily, rages against me; he delivered a speech in the synod against me and does not cease to harass me as if I were an Anabaptist. These are the aids, of course, that they bring to a man laboring day and night and resisting the Roman beast even to blood, as if there were no drunken pastors, still teaching the delusions of the papists, ignorant, lazy, against whom they could exercise their pen and tongue. I wonder that the churches do not rather collapse due to such malice and envy of our own; but if they do not collapse, indeed if some are built daily, it is due to the kindness and power of God, lest the cross of Christ be emptied, lest we can ever say that it was done by our sincerity and concord that we were able to resist the papacy.</p>
      <p>So it is, Heinrich Bullinger: they now attack me, they want to make me a heretic, whether I want it or not. But who knows better than you what kind of person I am? What do you ask? Camillus is now almost at rest; such is the desire to oppress your Vergerius, indeed unlearned and lazy, but sincere in that very doctrine, which you especially profess, that I have always determined to stand in the same footsteps. But no other way will be left for Gallitius to enter, to make my name odious. See what the devil is doing: not even the pope harasses me so much, and with that Gallus (Frenchman) protesting and raging, yet I still make progress daily and win new churches for God, and this is what troubles him, if it pleases the gods.</p>
      <p>Take it in good part; for to whom should I complain more than to you? Yet know that I value the little man as much as I should. It pains me that the papists rejoice in the meantime; indeed listen, I speak the truth, listen and you will be astonished: the papists, who are among us the coarsest and most hostile to me, incite Gallitius' spirit against me. What they could not achieve with threats and arms, they now hope through a pastor and minister of the gospel. Do you now hear a monster? truly an excellent pastor. I pour these things into your bosom; do not share them with others.</p>
      <p>If you write to England, affirm that I will soon go to them. Your booklet, titled that our churches are not heretical, has been translated into the Italian language.</p>
      <p>Farewell and be well with the whole family, school, and church. Vicosoprano, 22nd August 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
