      <p>S. D. Last Friday, since there were no citizens from Chur in the market, I handed the package to Johann Ziegler, who is well known as Junghans, although he is the father and old; for he is still a son of Hans Ziegler. He solemnly promised to handle it faithfully with the goods (with the merchant's goods). While I was speaking with him about this, Sp√∂nly, our faithful citizen, also arrived, who also promised his assistance. Therefore, I entrusted the package of letters to you with them; for I was in a hurry.</p>
      <p>However, Curtius had set out for Basel. He returned today; through whom I send this.</p>
      <p>All your letters have been delivered to me; therefore, be at ease. I wish that mine have also been delivered to you now, which I hope.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the council deliberated on current matters; today, couriers are leaving for Bern, Basel, etc. I hear that the demands of the envoys are being written to the cities, etc., and that they are also being summoned to the Heremitan assembly, in which, although only the Five Cantons and the people of Glarus are to convene, it still seems useful to our people if the envoys of other neutral parties are sent there. If it does not seem necessary to others that envoys be sent there, I think ours will send them nonetheless.</p>
      <p>I do not understand that anything has been concluded about sending envoys to your assemblies. They will await the opinion of other evangelical cities; I urge both privately and publicly that they do not neglect anything; but what I achieve will be shown by the outcome. From Bern, it was written to me yesterday evening that things are going well in France and the gospel is advancing; that the four estates of the kingdom have met, three absolutely want to hold a colloquium, the fourth, the clergy I mean, resist and affirm that it is not permissible to hold a colloquium outside a council, etc.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Savoy has instituted an inquisition, especially against the nobles in religion; the officials have responded that if they institute it, death threatens them. Therefore, that matter is now at rest.</p>
      <p>It is added that the papal legate is seriously negotiating; but it is thought that he will achieve nothing, etc. This from Bern, September 17.</p>
      <p>We hear from Constance that Emser is seeking the bishopric and has the papal bulls. Bolvyler has come there, and everyone thinks Emser will be the bishop.</p>
      <p>The pious citizens are anxious.</p>
      <p>We hear that the envoys who were with you have also set out for Lindau, from where they might go to Constance, where they will participate in the futation, a joyful matter. I cannot write more as I am pressed from all sides to write letters; for I have those who are about to set out for France and... other things. Therefore, farewell with all yours, and let us pray to the Lord to protect us from evil.</p>
      <p>My lords would like to know what response is expected from and before the communities, and whether you think that the Five Places would also send envoys. Therefore, perhaps... Mr. Tscharner himself should write to the mayors, if he wishes, how it stands before the communities, you may write to me. Zurich, September 21, 1561. In haste.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
