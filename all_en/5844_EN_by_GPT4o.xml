      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, these are now handed to me at night by Italian men who come from Chiavenna and pass through here to Geneva; therefore, I barely skimmed through a few lines, and I am sending everything as it was given to me.</p>
      <p>Whether the book has reached your hands before or not, I still think it is necessary to write to the illustrious man Martinengo; there are many reasons, which I do not add here; you, with your wisdom, understand them well enough.</p>
      <p>In the Adige region, the plague has begun to spread quite significantly, as well as in several places beyond the Steig; I believe it will bring an end to the council.</p>
      <p>This is sudden.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend Father in Christ, with all your people. August 19, in the year 1563, in the evening.</p>
      <p>We are expecting news from you about England and France. To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend Father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
