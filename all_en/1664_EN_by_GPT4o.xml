      <p>Julius von Mailand wishes Heinrich Bullinger health and peace in the Lord.</p>
      <p>The one who delivered my letters to you is most faithful, whom the Lord has visited in this manner: the Almighty Father has allowed that his twin sons (confessing Christ) have been thrown into prison by the impious, and it is soon to be that they will either suffer martyrdom or be condemned to the galleys for their entire lives. Since these sons of this pitiable old man have wives and thirteen children of both sexes, of whom this boy, whom he brings with him, is the eldest and not yet past the boundary of his thirteenth year, and according to his age, (even though he has been ill for two whole years) he is very well instructed in both languages as well as in the holy scriptures, he has decided (with my advice) to go to Geneva to the brothers, so that the starving family may be helped and the boy, who is wasting his time, may be provided for. For this reason, I also beseech you through Christ to meet with the brothers there, and to make an effort to collect some money among you, and to provide for him who lacks a means of travel, and not to allow this Christian family, starving and in danger of losing all their substance and driven out by the Antichrists, and awaiting our piety with dry throats, to perish from hunger. This man has a wife worn out by old age, two marriageable daughters, as many daughters-in-law, thirteen grandchildren, all of whom are in their infancy, and nothing is left except their souls and mere hope of good things. Laelius Socinus and Paulus Vergerius had decided to inform you more fully in writing about his poverty and condition and dignity; they did not come in time (which is the most important thing of all) because both of them secretly went to Bologna to visit Marianus, the aforementioned father of Laelius.</p>
      <p>Moreover, please deign to support him with your letters to the brothers on his journey, so that he may enjoy their hospitality and receive better treatment, if possible. Farewell, and do not hesitate to impart many greetings to all the brothers in my name. From Tirano, on the ninth day before the Kalends of July 1552.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and faithful minister of the most holy gospel, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, to be respected in Christ Jesus. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>Julius von Mailand.</p>
