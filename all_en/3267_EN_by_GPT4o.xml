      <p>Greetings. I am sending to you the preface with the title of the Apocalypse; we have arranged for the index to be placed at the end of the work, and we are still stuck in printing it; however, it will be finished, as I hope, by next week. In other matters, which were begun long ago, I see that we can hardly be ready by the next calends of September; so many things remain beyond expectation, and the remaining time is too short. Therefore, I wanted to devote myself primarily to completing the Apocalypse, as I considered its reading particularly useful and necessary for the present state of affairs.</p>
      <p>Regarding the book of Canterbury, you understand better from Froschauer's nephew himself what has been done; for he said that he would deal with it with Fox himself. Its publication was not prohibited by our people, but Fox himself, despite soliciting once and again, has not yet been able to obtain permission from our Sulcer to allow it. They are so dependent on that Worms colloquium like cawing crows and do not think it would contribute to the tranquility of affairs, especially at this time when the adversaries are so mad in this matter that anything of that argument should be brought forward by our people.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would be of a very different opinion, the more they rage, the more it is fitting for us not to abandon the struggling cause, but to resist all the more firmly, and if at any time it would have been useful for that writing to be published, in this so exacerbated age with the adversaries so wickedly spreading their poison against us, I would consider it both most useful and extremely necessary. And I wish that I might also be allowed to be involved in printing it or to promote it with whatever effort of mine, so that it may be done by anyone else; for in this way I would hope to have deserved not inconsiderably from the Christian republic. Farewell well and do not ever doubt my faith and respect towards you.</p>
      <p>As soon as I can, I will print the orations, either all three together or the third separately, for which I give immense thanks, as is entirely fitting, for the gift given to me. Master Borrhaus, Junius, and Lycosthenes send you their respectful greetings.</p>
      <p>I have not yet been able to show your letters to Sulcer. But both Master Fox and Bale commend themselves to you very much.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 10, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the best and most learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
