      <p>Honorable and highly learned, dear sir and friend, your letter from June 12th has reached me well, and I thank you once again very kindly for the book on the holy estate that you have honored my dear bride with. I have also faithfully delivered your greetings to her as well as to my dear father-in-law; they both wish you all the best and divine blessings in return. And although I would gladly share with you the little news that has come to me since, today's business overwhelms me so much that it is not possible for me.</p>
      <p>Attached herewith, you have what has been read in recent days at this Reichstag concerning the article of religion; if the young scribe has made some mistakes and the writings were not all together, please excuse me; for I do not have the time at the moment to look for them. You have the substance well understood.</p>
      <p>I just returned from the countryside yesterday and learned that His Majesty has since been well satisfied with Eberhart von der Tann; one hears more daily. Today, a letter from Antwerp, along with news, about how the faithful have been mistreated in Spain. Herewith, you have what notable persons, counts, and knights have been burned and driven into misery because of the Lord's word; many more are said to be imprisoned and will soon face a similar court day, in France as well, which God in His grace may prevent, if it is His will.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you faithfully.</p>
      <p>Augsburg in haste, July 2, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your very willing Philip Welser subscribes. To the honorable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the word of God in Zurich, my dear lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
