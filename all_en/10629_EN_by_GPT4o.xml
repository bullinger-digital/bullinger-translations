    <p xml:id="regest1">Hans Füßli, who is suffering from a two-day fever, is not in life-threatening danger; should he nevertheless die, Bullinger will think of Stumpf's letter [No. 590]. He has received Georg Ottli's record and will depict the battle [at Gubel] for Stumpf; if he does not get around to it, he will leave him the documents.</p>

      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to his Johannes Stumpf.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Füßli, the dearest brother, is in good health, though he is currently suffering somewhat from a two-day fever. There is no danger to his life. And if he were to be called by the Lord, I will remember your letters.</p>
      <p>Georg Ottli handed me the written history almost a month ago. I have also examined certain things from the opposing side. I am trying to outline the face of that battle for you. Business has so far prevented me. If I cannot complete it shortly, I will send fragments from which you can piece everything together.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>June 11, 1535.</p>
