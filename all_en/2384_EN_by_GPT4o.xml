      <p>Greetings. Dearest doctor of the Church of Christ and teacher.</p>
      <p>I believe you received the letters written by my hand at the end of June. I was very uncertain whether to settle in Marburg or Montbéliard; I preferred to be in the academy, if it could be done (with the exercise of piety and my studies). While I have no response from Hesse and Frankfurt, I learned that I am desired by the counselors of the most illustrious Count Georg. Immediately, I wrote to the Duke of Württemberg about this matter, resigning what I have here. Soon I received letters from Bourges from Lord François Baudouin, a most renowned professor of law, who, wishing to flee idols, desires a position in Strasbourg. I soon advised him more fully, both by letters and in person, and suggested to the Duke that he be appointed in my place here, so the Duke will have two without a new stipend, him here with a smaller school stipend and me in Montbéliard with a counselor's stipend almost double, with which I am content, so that I may be in a pure church and more easily attract and instruct. If I had that, I would not want to be here in this leavened church. This illness does not afflict Baudouin, who is without a wife and can even scorn, indeed even scourge and undermine, papal leaven. Fifteen years ago, he was my chief scribe; six years ago, I recommended him to the people of Bourges when they needed a professor; he was received with praise and is performing his duties. He is half-German, being from Arras.</p>
      <p>Regarding the public disturbance I promoted against the papacy on May 9, there were no slanders, but only protests against me, as the court leaders and Lord Johannes Brenz were present. But on the second occasion, July 24, when, lacking scribes, I neglected to write to the court, the prince ordered that everything that had been done be written to him. I gave him my confession, signed by me, on the last Sunday as he was passing through, a copy of which I send to you here, written by Burbandus. When you have read it, I ask you to send it to Lord Johannes Calvin along with the letters to him also enclosed here.</p>
      <p>Here, some are manifest and obstinate papists (and these are less evil, as I also wrote to the prince), others are Lutherans, not pure, but leavened with the horrendous pseudo-differences of the Augsburg Confession, others are of both, others of no religion, so I would rather leave my family where it is than leave it here when I die.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the envious and papists will seize the opportunity not to admit Baudouin, as if he were a Zwinglian, because he was recommended by me; however, I think I will achieve that the majority of the audience will request him, I would say all, except that the hostile faction will seduce some.</p>
      <p>My wife has already sent many French scribes to me, losing effort and money, because no one ever crossed the Rhine. But soon, as I will be (God willing) in Montbéliard, I will have them in abundance and will resume the French work on the papacy, which has been interrupted for over a year.</p>
      <p>I commend all these things to your and the holy church's prayers. Desiring to greet the reverend father Lord Pellican, Lord Bibliander, Lord Lavater, Lord Zwingli your son-in-law, and others. Farewell. May the peace and grace of Christ always be with you. Tübingen, September 4, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Charles du Moulin. To the most pious doctor of the Church of Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
