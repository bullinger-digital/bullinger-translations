      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, a pious man, learned and a patron of the liberal arts, Diethelm Keller wishes grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I have been included in the number of those receiving a stipend from the senate and the canons' benefice, and I have benefited from this for the past year, on the condition that by the time of Christ's birth, which is now at hand, I declare whether I have been pleased to devote my efforts to human studies during this time, so that I do not later, after having received these funds for some time, abandon my studies and desert the pursuit of letters, as some have done until now. However, I have never been of such a mind, nor do I hope to be in the future, as long as it is not against divine authority, and I promise to devote my efforts to liberal studies, provided that you promise a sufficient stipend for my necessities, which is not unreasonable, especially since more generous stipends have been given to some who needed it less, and indeed by much. I do not say this to envy anyone if things have turned out more prosperously for them, but I also think that help should be extended to me. For it is by your encouragement that I have been diligent in my studies up to this time. Three years ago, indeed, when Myconius was my teacher, my parents had decided to instruct me in some mechanical art, so that I might later acquire sustenance and clothing and not burden my parents. When Myconius learned of this, he informed Zwingli, our former pastor. When he noticed this, he called my father to him, in the presence of other canons, and begged him not to alienate or separate me from letters, promising some assistance soon. This happened in the year preceding that slaughter, alas, suffered at Kappel. Now finally, at the beginning of January of the present year, sixteen gold coins were given, the entire sum of which, if I were to spend it entirely on necessary books and clothes, would scarcely suffice. But you know very well that it is more fitting for me to be of assistance to my parents, so that they can restore their strength, which has collapsed and been exhausted by constant and unwearied labor, old age, and many and constant infirmities, while they are forced to abstain from suitable food and deprive themselves of their own resources, so that they can acquire sustenance and clothing for us, and I must constantly hear reproaches that I am much more of a hindrance than a help, since this entire sum is almost entirely spent on the bookseller and the cloth merchant, due to the harsh times and the high cost of provisions. For many thousands of people over the past eight years have lived much more frugally and sparingly, leaving the table with a very hungry stomach, despite having a much greater and richer fortune. However, this has never happened to us, thanks to the benefit of the supreme deity. But we will not be able to endure much longer unless those harsh times are somewhat mitigated, which is indeed by the benefit of almighty God. For our resources are almost worn out and exhausted, although we have never suffered such things before. May God prevent us from having to endure them in the future. Thus far you have my account of my situation. But since it is up to me to either promise or refuse, I ask you to assist me with your words, so that I may be given enough to purchase my annual sustenance with some learned man. For I have a home not suitable and convenient for the Muses, due to the noise and clamor of those running here and there. I believed that my opinion would be more clearly expressed through letters sent to you and much more accurately than if I were to speak in person. For thus it is allowed to say everything that has been premeditated. Therefore, O most learned man, kindly consider my barbarism as that of a novice who has entered the field for the sake of practice. And if you find anything too barbaric, please correct it and inform me, so that I do not stumble upon the same stone twice, as the proverb says.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on December 16, in Zürich.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, a pious and deservedly venerable man.</p>
