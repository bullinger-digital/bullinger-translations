    <p xml:id="regest1">Lavater received the letter [No. 2557] from Bullinger, who seems to reproach him for having turned to him as an arbitrator in the matter of the Lord's Supper. However, Lavater had good reasons for his writing [not received]. Bullinger should not think that he had changed his opinion or even defected to the Lutherans!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The question here is whether a Zwinglian can hold communion with Lutherans without both parties compromising their faith. Lavater was sure that Bullinger would advise against it. Bullinger had told him how the Lord's Supper should be understood and what to answer those who inquired, namely, that he had not come [to Strasbourg] to dispute, but to be educated in the liberal arts. However, since Bullinger had not explicitly forbidden him to participate in the Lord's Supper, and since [Konrad] Gessner urged him to seek Bullinger's advice so that his preceptors [in Strasbourg] could see that he was not obstinate, he reluctantly wrote to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The above question is answered differently by astute people. A Zwinglian [...] thought that there was nothing against participation, as the celebration refers to the merits of Christ and the elements [bread and wine] are the same. In principle, Lavater would not abstain from the Lord's Supper because of doctrinal differences. Thus, Hans Zart from Winterthur (who claims to still hold on to his faith) participated in the Lord's Supper; so did all the people from Constance in Strasbourg, and this on the advice of [Ambrosius] Blarer, who was friends with Bucer (although those from Constance are ashamed of the religion of their homeland). All these considerations, however, are of little help. This, as well as [Konrad] Gessner's urging, explains why Lavater wanted to know from Bullinger what to do, especially since he knows how much Luther would be annoyed by those who hold communion with Zwinglians. Lavater's [refusal to participate in the Lord's Supper] is therefore not presumptuous! He seeks only one thing, namely to be allowed to participate in the Lord's Supper with his faith (which acknowledges an efficacy to the symbols and even confesses a presence of Christ) without allowing those who urge him to participate to claim that they have led him away from his religion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Briefly on the events. What Bullinger wrote to Lavater, he did not share with the people of Strasbourg, as they did not tell him what they said to Doctor [Konrad Gessner] at that time. Since [Gessner's departure], Jakob Gessner, the Schaffhausen boarder [...] Zingg, and Lavater were summoned before their teachers. They had to explain why they did not participate in the Lord's Supper in these dangerous times. They gave them the answer already given earlier, which they did not like to hear. Bucer then wanted to know whether the Strasbourg church taught well or badly, or whether it should even be excommunicated. Lavater replied that it was not his place to judge. They then asked if he denied the Basel [First Helvetic] Confession. He denied it, but added that he only rejected what was similar to the Wittenberg [Concord]. [Bucer] sought an agreement. He asked why Lavater claimed that the people of Strasbourg were comparable to the Papists. Lavater replied (as [already] to his host [Johannes Marbach]) that he abstained from the Lord's Supper because he did not understand the difference between the Lord's Supper of the people of Strasbourg and that of the Papists, as in both cases a bodily presence of Christ is claimed. The interrogation was then interrupted, and the students were urged to consider the matter more carefully.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Subsequently, a good friend [...] indicated to them that they would be expelled from the school if they did not give in. This completely unsettled Lavater. He commissioned [Jakob] Gessner to speak with [Petrus] Dasypodius (who knew nothing of the [summons]). He immediately went fearlessly to Bucer and asked what was intended with the Zurich students. Bucer then summoned them again and reminded them that the Old Church excommunicated those who did not participate in the Lord's Supper. However, he reassured them: They would not be hastily expelled from the school; they would first write to their teachers [in Zurich] and explain what was expected of their students and why. Lavater already indicated that the attitude of the Zurich students corresponded to Bullinger's opinion. Bucer, however, acted as if he knew nothing about it, and the Zurich students agreed to a letter to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Their studies could have been greatly harmed if they had been forbidden to attend lectures. Therefore, if Bullinger responds to the people of Strasbourg, he should clearly explain Zurich's will, show that the matter is serious, and that the students did not act stubbornly. However, he should not be aggressive, especially since Lavater was not treated badly by Bucer. Probably the whole matter was stirred up by the new host [...].</p>

      <p>I received your letter, most esteemed father, in which you explained the reasons for your long silence and what I should do regarding the matter of the Eucharist. You seem, somehow, to be displeased with me for bringing this matter before you as a judge. However, if you look more deeply into what I wrote, you can easily gather that I had very just reasons. I did not write with the intention of ceasing to be who I was, nor of joining the Lutheran party. I urge you to expel this suspicion from your mind and to expect better things from Lavater.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Another question was being discussed, namely whether a Zwinglian, as they call it, could partake in the Lord's Supper with the Lutherans without compromising the faith of either party. As for me, I was certain that you would not be an advocate for this matter. You indeed told me what I should think about this sacrament and what to answer those who questioned my faith, namely that I was present not for disputing but for the sake of learning. These and other things have not yet left my mind. But since, as far as I know, you did not give me instructions to completely abstain from that communion when I left, and since Mr. Gessner urged me to consult you so that the teachers would understand that I was not obstinate, I wrote, though reluctantly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>And as far as the matter itself is concerned, I hear this question being debated on both sides by astute men. I heard from a man of our religion who said that as far as the memory of Christ's benefits and the external symbols are concerned, the matter is the same, and this food cannot harm me if I partake rightly. Nor do I want to abstain from this communion because of different doctrine. Moreover, this matter would not lack precedent, for Hans Zart from Winterthur, who claims not to have denied his homeland's religion, did not abstain. The same is done by the people from Constance who are in Strasbourg, certainly not without the advice of Blarer, who is a friend of Bucer. But this is certain: they are Lutherans, and they are ashamed of their homeland's religion. All these things matter little. However, the voice and urging of Mr. Gessner greatly moved my mind to hear from you what I should do. I am not indeed ignorant of how Luther is angered by those who commune with Zwinglians, as he calls them, and what he advises them. You see, therefore, that nothing was done rashly by me. Add to all this that I only asked to approach with my faith intact (provided I do not say the symbols are empty, but establish some presence of Christ), nor did they openly want to be authors of changing my religion. Therefore, this subtle question was to be referred to a higher judge.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But now, let me briefly explain what happened: I had not indicated what you wrote to me, because they did not want to say to my face what they said to the doctor. Meanwhile, Jakob Gessner, our fellow boarder from Schaffhausen, Zingg, and I were summoned to the professors to give an account of our faith and conduct, and especially the reasons why we abstained from the holy supper in these most dangerous times. We said what they had often heard and did not want to hear. There Bucer wanted me to answer these: Whether their church taught well or badly? Whether it should be excommunicated?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It was not difficult for me to answer this dilemma. For I answered in this way: I do not say that your doctrine is good, nor do I say that it is bad. For it is not my place nor that of my kind to pronounce on this matter. Let it be the judgment of others. Thus, I did not fall into the trap. I did not want to explicitly say what I thought of them. For it would have been unbecoming of my person. Moreover, they asked whether I denied the Basel Confession. I said I did not deny it, but I denied that it was similar to the Wittenberg Concord. They sought some reconciliation of discord. Why then did I say that we should be compared to the Papists? There I said: Listen to what I said, among other reasons, why I abstain from the supper (and I recited this to the lord): I do not understand the difference between your supper and the papistic supper, since both establish a bodily presence of Christ. And it was a fallacy of accident from the second to the simple. Then they did not want to hear us further because of certain matters, ordering us to consider the matter more carefully.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>There, however, a sincere friend warned me that if we did not comply, they would want to prohibit us from the school (for this is the thunderbolt of excommunication). This moved me so much that I thought of everything and looked around to see what I should do. And I could not sufficiently marvel at how this kind of people was so opposed and hostile to us! What should I do? I advised Gessner to meet with Dasypodius as soon as possible and briefly explain the whole matter to him (for the matter was being conducted without Dasypodius's knowledge). Dasypodius, fearing no envy, asked Bucer what they had decided to do with us. Bucer again summoned us to his house, explaining at length that it was the custom of the old church to excommunicate those who abstained from the holy supper. Meanwhile, he greatly diminished the suspicion of expelling us from the school, and, to show that nothing was done rashly with us, he said he would write to our teachers in the name of all, explaining what they had requested and what the reasons for their counsel were. I did indeed say that it was your judgment; he pretended not to hear. But we agreed that they should write.</p>
      <p>For they could greatly inconvenience our studies if they deprived us of the power to attend lectures. Therefore, I ask, if you respond, let them understand your will about us. That this matter is not to be trifled with, nor are we obstinate. I beg you, do not write to them too harshly, lest a biting word wound their tender ears! Bucer would not have been so unfair to me. I think this tragedy was stirred up by the new host. You now have the catastrophe of this story.</p>
