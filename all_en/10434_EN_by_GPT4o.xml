      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I hear, most illustrious man, that your attitude has somewhat changed towards Wolfgang's son. However, I do not know whether what I heard is true or false. Nevertheless, I earnestly beseech you to have the young man recommended to you. He is the son of a very good man, a boy who, I hope, is not entirely bad.</p>
      <p>Farewell and consider these things kindly.</p>
      <p>Zurich, June 27, 1534.</p>
      <p>I wish our Karlstadt well.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother.</p>
