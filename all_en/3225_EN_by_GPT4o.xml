      <p>S. I am sending to you again 5 gatherings, opqrs; I believe that all the preceding ones have been delivered to you. I hope that within 3 weeks or a little before, we will have placed the colophon on the entire work, except for the preface and index. I am sending letters recently sent to me partly by Naogeorgus addressed to you, and partly also by Mr. Valerand Poullain to Mr. Peter Martyr, whom he instructs me to urge to respond soon and to send the response to him either by his own courier (if it is not convenient otherwise). As for the rest, I earnestly beg you, my dear Mr. Bullinger, since I read that you have cited Theodorich of Nyssa or his history of the Roman pontiffs or of the schisms of the church in your Commentaries, and I believe you have that author, to grant us the use of it for a few days at the earliest opportunity. We will return it to you in good faith shortly. Mr. John Bale sought it throughout our city and would very much like to inspect one or two places in it, but did not find it here. Therefore, you will do a favor to both me and the excellent old man Bale and indeed to the republic itself if you send it to us shortly. You can conveniently send anything you wish to be safely delivered to me to my wife in Baden (Thermen), who is now staying with the wife of the younger Froschauer in the courtyard and will probably remain there for one or two weeks, and she will have almost daily opportunities to send it to me. Farewell and tell Mr. Theodor that I have finally obtained the Arabic Gospel with the apostles of Paul, published by the liberality of Albert of Stade, whose work it also is. Also, greet him and Mr. Peter Martyr, Frisius, Gualther, Gesner, and all the other friends courteously on occasion and when it will be without inconvenience.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 26, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus from the heart.</p>
      <p>I have also obtained the Aphorisms of Mr. Bucer written shortly before his death in England about the Lord's Supper, not differing from our confession, and his books on the Kingdom of Christ, which I will also print shortly, if the Lord wills, as well as the edicts of the ancient emperors against Christians collected by Baudouin, who are found to have been much more lenient than ours today.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord and much esteemed friend.</p>
