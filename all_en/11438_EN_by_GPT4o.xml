    <p xml:id="regest1">[Martin] Frecht sends a report through Michael [Adam] about the results of the meeting in Schmalkalden; Blarer additionally sends a copy of the unexpectedly pleasing but carelessly copied documents that reached [the pastors of Konstanz]; he requests a quick return and confidentiality and hopes for an even stronger connection between their churches. Intrigues are to be expected at the religious discussion scheduled in Speyer; may God turn it for the good! He recommends Hieronymus [...] of Siena, who is on his way to Bern with a letter of recommendation from Philipp [Melanchthon]. He has heard that Bullinger attacked Bucer in a letter to a pastor in Chur, and Bucer responded in an equally sharp tone; he appeals to his mildness and implores him - also in the name of Zwick and others - not to unnecessarily hurt Bucer, as he significantly contributes as a tool of God to the breakthrough of the evangelical cause. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although our Frecht sends the chapters of what was done in Schmalkalden to you through this Michael of yours, we nevertheless thought we would do something not unpleasing to you if we sent to you and your other fellow ministers everything we received, especially since in your recent letters to Zwick you seemed to request it with great desire. Therefore, receive, venerable and dearest brother, and rejoice with us in the Lord as much as you can, because everything turned out better than expected for us and many others, so that we clearly see that Christ the Savior was present with us with His most immediate presence. Although it was not possible to reread and correct what was copied from the original, which was not written carefully enough, we believe that, as far as the matter itself is concerned, you will understand everything clearly. But, hey, my brother, we absolutely want you to return this copy faithfully as soon as possible with the next messenger, if you think it should be transcribed. Then see to it that these do not fall into the hands of slanderers, nor that anyone learns they were sent by us for certain reasons. Now we ardently pray to the Lord for this one thing, that your churches may also be more closely united with ours, so that we may be able to withstand and more successfully evade the attacks of the enemies.</p>
      <p>The Emperor's assembly, which he wants to hold in Speyer on June 6 for the sake of one religion, is not without suspicion of remarkable (I will not say otherwise) attempts.</p>
      <p>May the Lord turn it for the good, to whom we will entrust ourselves entirely, as much as we are, placing our souls with Him, who alone can save.</p>
      <p>I commend to you and the others this Hieronymus, a priest from Siena, in a Christian manner; he stayed with me for about ten days, a man, as far as I could judge from such a short acquaintance, very pious and moderately learned, who also has letters of recommendation to the Bernese from Philipp [Melanchthon].</p>
      <p>We hear with great sorrow of mind that you wrote some harsh things against Bucer to a certain pastor in Chur, unless I am mistaken, and that these letters came into Bucer's hands, who responded no less harshly. Ah, my dearest Bullinger, if what we heard is not false, we beseech you by the common author of salvation, that you, for your genuine gentleness and placidity of mind, lay aside such feelings and be reconciled with him. Otherwise, all our matters are more than sufficiently ulcerated, even if we refrain from inflicting new wounds. Bucer is, for many reasons, very much to be loved and respected by all Christians, and we have never doubted that he seeks the Lord and His glory with a pure heart. Meanwhile, however, we greatly feared from his excessive zeal for concord, which seemed to us to be excessive in him, lest - as the saying goes - he goes beyond the mark. But since we clearly see that the heavenly Father does not fail the efforts of His instrument, let us also not fail him and ourselves, so that with common efforts and united forces we may be equal to, and even superior to, the adversaries, who are thought to be about to experience the utmost. What I ask, the same is asked by our Zwick and all our other most loving friends of yours, and we do not doubt, given your sweetness of heart, that you will willingly incline to this, preferring to be a friend rather than an adversary to Bucer.</p>
      <p>Zwick and our brothers with our sister Margareta send their greetings to you. Commend me to the best friends and brothers Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Carlstadt, and other friends, etc. Zwick himself writes to you. My wife sends her very loving greetings to you. Farewell, my soul, and commend me and our church uniquely and always in a Christian manner to Christ.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, May 17, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my lord and dearest brother.</p>
