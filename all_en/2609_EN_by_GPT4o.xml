      <p>Worthy, highly learned, I offer you my friendly, willing service beforehand, especially to you, dear sir and friend.</p>
      <p>I received your letter dated the 22nd of March recently during this fair and was pleased to learn from it that the index of my coins has reached you correctly, which I had somewhat doubted since Mr. Froschauer did not bring me a letter from you. However, I have been informed that your letter was delivered shortly after Froschauer's arrival by Mr. Vuldernius. Also, the aforementioned Froschauer, on your command, delivered to me a copy of your sermon "De extremo iuditio," for which I thank you very kindly, with the promise to reciprocate such kindness to you whenever I can. If you find anything in my index that you do not have and I have a duplicate, I am willing to share it with you. I would like to see your Hebrew shekel, which you mentioned. I also have one; however, I do not consider it genuine, but rather cast, which is why I did not include it in the index; it is almost the size of half a thaler.</p>
      <p>I kindly ask, if you ever write to me again, to let me know the weight of your aforementioned shekel, and if you come across anything regarding the question I have often raised with you, to communicate it to me at your convenience without hesitation.</p>
      <p>The Roman Imperial Majesty intends and, as I understand, is already in the process of having their coins printed, and Mr. Wolfgang Lazius is supposed to make annotations or something similar for it; that might become something special.</p>
      <p>Dr. Wolfgang Waidner is, as I have been informed, somewhat weak at this time and in such a condition that he might not recover. As I have been told, he is suffering from dropsy; that might be the end for him. May the Almighty comfort him and keep him in His knowledge.</p>
      <p>Regarding Johann Baptist Wyssamer, I spoke again yesterday with Jost Glusser about him, who informed me that he has not received anything from the aforementioned Wyssamer; he knows nothing else but that he is still alive and does not stay long in one place. Jost received letters for him during this fair and sent them to Hamburg, where he might be inquired about. If you consider it advisable to write to Wyssamer once more, you could assign me such a letter, and I would deliver it to Jost Glusser to be sent further to Hamburg on occasion.</p>
      <p>I did not want to withhold this friendly opinion from you regarding your letter, and I am always ready and willing to be at your service. You must accept this poor and illegible writing; I did not have an amanuensis at this time. Mr. Claus Brom, Jost Glusser, and Mr. Heinrich Lautensack send you their greetings and service. Dated Frankfurt, the 12th of April, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, Hieronymus Zum Lamb, Doctor, etc.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the Holy Scriptures and leader of the Christian community in Zurich, my especially dear sir and friend. Zurich.</p>
