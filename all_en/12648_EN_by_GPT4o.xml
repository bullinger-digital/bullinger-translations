    <p xml:id="regest1">If only Bullinger could report better news...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The Imperial forces have taken the town of Neuburg an der Donau, which belongs to Duke Ottheinrich, through treachery. The nearby Schmalkaldic forces did not retaliate. Citizens were stabbed, and many women were disgracefully dishonored. It is likely to lead to a Benjaminite war [see Judges 19f], and the 100,000-strong Schmalkaldic army achieves nothing!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [Elector Johann Friedrich I of Saxony and Philip of Hesse] now want Basel, Bern, Schaffhausen, and Zurich to attack Emperor [Charles V] and invade his lands. However, the Zurich council is not prepared to do so, especially since the neighboring land [does not belong to the Emperor, but] to Austria. Burgundy would need to be occupied, but that is unlikely to happen. It also does not seem advisable. Much displeases Bullinger. Perhaps, however, he understands nothing of the matter...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Call to prayer.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. God willing, I wish I could write you much good news. But it stands as it may...</p>

      <p>Neuburg an der Donau, belonging to Duke Ottheinrich, has been taken and treacherously captured by the Imperial forces. Some citizens were stabbed, many women and maidens disgracefully violated (raped), shamefully mistreated, etc. I fear (if our forces had been stationed at Donauw√∂rth, and still, and had not avenged such misery), it will lead to a Benjaminite war. Our forces, numbering a hundred thousand strong, achieve nothing!</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Both princes and the empire now demand from those of Zurich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, etc., that they soon attack the Emperor and invade his lands. My lords are not willing, for everything around here is Austrian. Burgundy is Imperial. We would have to move there. Do not believe that it will happen, nor does it seem advisable to me. These things I confide to you. Many things displease me greatly, but perhaps I do not understand the mysteries...</p>
