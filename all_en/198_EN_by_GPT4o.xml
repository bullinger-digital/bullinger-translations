      <p>Georg Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings beforehand, well-learned, dear special one, we have received your two letters, the first dated June 25, and the second July 10. In which we perceive your thoughts on the highly burdensome Interim, that also the majority of the imperial cities have fallen away from the truth, likewise how shortly also otherwise the steadfast response from Lindau was heard. And it is truly a dreadful lamentable matter, for which we must earnestly call upon God the Lord to remove such a heavy burden from us and to give steadfast hearts. Regarding Constance, we would very much like to know thoroughly how the matters of their reconciliation and the Interim are arranged.</p>
      <p>Many arguments and objections are gathered from the scripture and alongside the scripture, that one might accept the Interim, which one unfortunately, since one cannot resist the strict harsh force, to make a concession to widows and orphans, are being considered. Therefore, we think it would not be without fruit, if someone learned and understanding of the scripture would compose a summary brief report and refutation of the supposed doctrine of the Interim etc. in writing and put it into print, it would undoubtedly provide comfort and steadfast spirit and heart to many a good man in this violent undertaking and fright etc.</p>
      <p>We have shortly written to Hedio and Bucer and have exhorted them in a Christian manner, what they are now obliged to do before God and also to their flock, to exhort and comfort them, also to not neglect in the same; for now is the time to cry out, call and pray, secretly, openly and as it may happen with good Christian zeal.</p>
      <p>With us, it remains still in all danger and the longer the more worrisome and burdensome for the aforementioned reasons. May the dear God keep us in His gracious hand with true faith and increase the same in us. Amen.</p>
      <p>If we are to know the gracious will of Musculus, he would have inclined to us. We are willing, if the time will allow and give, to make a journey to you and others, where many things will be able to be discussed, which are not to be written now.</p>
      <p>We pray to the dear God, that He may keep us in the right faith; may He grant this to you and also to all your brothers. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated Basel, July 14, in the year etc. 48. G[eorg] C[ount] o[f] Württemberg.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned our dear special master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
