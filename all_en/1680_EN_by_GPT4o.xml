      <p>To the most reverend and illustrious men, pastors and superintendents of the churches of Upper Germany, to whom these letters will be delivered, the ministers of the church of Magdeburg send their greetings.</p>
      <p>Grace, peace, and mercy of God through Christ. It is our duty, reverend and illustrious men, that we do not entirely neglect the bodily life of those whose souls have been entrusted to our faith for care by the saving word of our Redeemer. And while we are seriously intent on this care, we encounter everywhere the difficulty that we attempt almost in vain to bring aid to the afflicted state of our church through mutual efforts and services among us. For public and private resources are too exhausted, and many doors are still held by the injustice of the malevolent. The parish church of St. James, of which you may have heard, lies half-ruined by the enemy's bombardment, and the temples that still stand are close to devastation, while it is to be feared that some may be abandoned by their teachers due to lack of sustenance, and many living temples of God either suffer from hunger or, however diligently they perform their honorable services, cannot maintain their place as before among the average citizens. Therefore, since we need external support to partly restore and partly refresh these temples, and since we are not unaware of the groans, prayers, and wills of many pious people in your churches who are truly affected by the calamities of our church, which has suffered so much for the common cause of religion and the fatherland, we, moved again by the poverty and piety of the cause, which we leave to all the pious to consider, have decided to ask the pious pastors to be reminded of the zeal of the apostles, by which they often encouraged the churches they taught everywhere to make collections for the poor of other churches, especially those suffering persecution, if it may now please you to perhaps imitate this example. Added to this is the similar piety of some in the Netherlands, who of their own accord sent their collection here long ago, in the distribution of which we recognized both the poverty of many and the fruit of this grace. We also understand that the Swiss churches, along with the church of Strasbourg, have long been prepared to perform a similar service, as the apostle adorns such alms with these titles. Therefore, we give thanks to those churches as we ought, asking that what they have begun with great piety and praise, they similarly complete, and that the other churches also do what seems right to them, according to the inclination of their spirit. This will be entirely not only pleasing to God and necessary for us, but also a glorious testimony to the authors themselves for posterity, that although absent in body, they have nevertheless sympathized in spirit over the afflictions of Joseph and have now, with the opportunity and occasion accepted, testified to this sympathy in actual deed.</p>
      <p>And because we know that these collections cannot be made so quickly that the envoy of our city can carry them with him, which perhaps would not be safe either, we therefore leave to you all the care and counsel of collecting and transmitting, for which benefit we promise you and your churches the gratitude we can in return, and we pray to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He may graciously protect, guide, and preserve you together with your churches, increase the seed of your liberty and the fruits of righteousness for you, to receive a more abundant reward. Farewell well in Christ. Given at Magdeburg on the 21st of July in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Lucas Rosenthal, Nikolaus Gallus, Joachim Wolterstorff, pastors, Johannes Baumgarten, Heinrich Freden, Ambrosius Hitfeld.</p>
