    <p xml:id="regest1">Has barely recovered from his carbuncle illness and would gladly pass this "carbuncle" on to the [Archbishop] of Mainz, a lover of precious stones; he, along with [Duke Wilhelm] of Bavaria, is preventing the discussion of the religious question [at the Diet of Speyer], curtails the rights of the cities, and wants to postpone all topics except the Turkish campaign to a new Diet in August. The planned distribution of burdens [for the Turkish aid] testifies to the tyranny of the princes over the cities and merchants and could call for a counter-alliance, but the outcome is still open. [Duke] Heinrich of Brunswick tried to keep the envoys of his brother-in-law, [Duke Ulrich] of Württemberg, away from his wife [Marie, née Countess of Württemberg], who died shortly thereafter; Heinrich is said to have transferred the duchy to his son and departed, perhaps to the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I] or to Pope [Paul III]. A Basel envoy returning from France reported alarming things about the imitation of Turkish customs by the French. Bucer writes that the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] is entirely on the side [of the Protestants], but as a church prince, he is in dependencies. According to a printed document, the Turkish [Sultan] threatens the Polish [King Sigismund I] with war; Myconius fears the Turks less than ever after they have challenged God in such a way. This should also be communicated to Theodor [Bibliander] and Pellikan. Sends a letter from the Neuchâtel [No. 1609], who have also written to the Baselers, and recommends them to Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have not yet fully recovered from the carbuncle (as women call it) and yet I am compelled to preach, write, and do everything. I have heard several times that the Archbishop of Mainz is very fond of precious stones and buys them at a high price. I offered mine for free, but he refused. If I could, I would compel him to wear it around his neck perpetually. He, along with the Duke of Bavaria, is the reason why the religious matter could not be brought into discussion. He is full of wicked plans and uses them stubbornly. He has ensured that, contrary to law and old custom, the cities have been excluded from common consultations so far, so that nothing has been done at the Diet except for collecting money for the Turkish war, and he has tried to postpone the consultation on common judgment, peace, currency, and other political matters to the Diet promised in August. What will happen, I do not know; for I do not yet know whether anything has been concluded.</p>
      <p>But listen to the plan about money: Tithes must be imposed on everyone. The princes, counts, and nobles have agreed to give them, but from revenues, not from all goods. The cities are urged to give from all goods, even if they lack revenues, and merchants are to pay double tithes. See the tyranny, which has the gospel and freedom as its cause, as well as the wealth of the cities and merchants.</p>
      <p>It is not surprising if some new federation is formed against such severe oppressors of the cities. But I speak thus with you. So far, the cities have resisted; what they will do next or are going to do is still uncertain to me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you know that the wife of Heinrich of Brunswick is the sister of the Duke of Württemberg. He had the custom of visiting her every year around the birth of the Lord with a gift, either personally or through some honorable men. He did the same last year; he sent envoys and a thousand gold coins. After they arrived, the sister prevented them, while the Brunswickers tried in the meantime to extract money, but in vain. But before they wanted to release the money from their hands, they admitted the envoys. After they had completed what they were instructed to do, they departed. Not long after, news came that the duchess had passed away, the duke had transferred the entire duchy to his son, and he himself had left with a few, it is not known where. This was told to me for certain by noble men. Whether he went to the Turk, to the Pope, or elsewhere to forge new disturbances with wicked plans, everyone doubts.</p>
      <p>Moreover, our envoy, who brought the money for pacification from France these days, reports such cruel things about the clothing and customs of the French similar to the Turks, that you could say they have degenerated into Turks. But you surely understood the same from your own sources.</p>
      <p>Bucer writes about the Archbishop of Cologne in these words: "The old man is entirely ours; but you know how much and to whom the power of such princes is subject." He says the rest is not to be entrusted to letters.</p>
      <p>Letters are circulating, which you may have seen, printed, in which war is declared by the Turk against the Pole. Good God, what cruelty there, what blasphemies against Christ! Indeed, I say in the Lord that I have never feared the Turk, but our sins, which increase daily. Now, that is after such cruel blasphemies, I fear even less; for I know what kind of God responds to blasphemies.</p>
      <p>See the times in which the Lord has placed us! He will protect, I know, His church. You will share this with Theodor and Pellican.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in Christ.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 10, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>I am also sending the letters of the brothers from Neuchâtel. I think it is a thanksgiving, for they have written to us similarly. Make sure to have them recommended when needed.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the best minister of Christ, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
