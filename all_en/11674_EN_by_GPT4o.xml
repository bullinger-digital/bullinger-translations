    <p xml:id="regest1">Regrets that the son of Quirinus von Leiden is traveling through the lands with his father, and suggests providing him with an [educational opportunity] in Zurich that corresponds to his talents. It seems that the French [King Francis I], Venice, and Pope [Paul III] are in agreement with the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I]; the Frenchman is said to have terminated the truce with Emperor [Charles V]. A nobleman from Colmar recounted his ransom from Turkish slavery by French envoys. The Turks are said to have destroyed Buda and Pest and made the fortress impregnable. Regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It pains me that Quirinus von Leiden is leading his son around in such a manner; the boy seems to have a good nature, if he were properly educated. Recently, I tested his intelligence in a remarkable way; I found him to be much more prudent than his father. He knows well what brings shame to his father and freely criticizes him; however, if he remains this way, I fear for his future.</p>
      <p>Is there not a place among you that could be suitable for him? What I say has no other cause than to show my affection for this boy.</p>
      <p>In a single meal, he seemed this way; perhaps he is different than he appeared, which you might know better. I submit him to your judgment, whatever he may be.</p>
      <p>There is no news, except that there is suspicion that the French King Francis I, Venice, and Pope Paul III are in agreement with the Turkish Sultan Suleiman I. Who does not see what disturbances this matter could cause? It is reported as true that the Frenchman has renounced the truce made with Emperor Charles V for a decade.</p>
      <p>A nobleman came to our city these days, who said he was captured by the Turks and, with a Jew and a camel, was made to plow. The French envoys, who were about to depart for the Turks, passed by and asked from their horses who he was and where he was from. He replied that he was a Christian and from Colmar; they then immediately paid, I think, sixty crowns and ransomed him.</p>
      <p>There is also a rumor that the Turks have completely demolished Buda and Pest, but have fortified the castle with food and drink for five years, making it impregnable.</p>
      <p>I did not want you to be unaware of such small matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, May 15, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
