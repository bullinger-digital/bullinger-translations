      <p>S. While I was diligently looking around for someone to send the forty crowns to Paris, and since Culmann was hesitating due to fear of dangers because he was alone, a Parisian bookseller conveniently offered himself to me. This bookseller had already received 30 crowns from your young men, as the document testifies. Therefore, I gave him the money and instructed him to continue to provide it there for necessary uses; for he would receive it here, so that in this way, without danger or any trouble, this business could henceforth be expedited at the Frankfurt fairs. I received the news with joy about Servetus being captured, and that in a place where he seems to be restrained, so that he may no longer infect the churches with heretical doctrine. For this matter, the spirits of the Genevans are needed, as I know there will be those who will strongly disapprove of Calvin's instigation and the senate's compliance in this matter.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for your diligent writing about Italian affairs. As for German affairs, I have nothing certain, except for the fact that the knightly order under August of Saxony is urging and pressing for peace with Albert by all means, while Ferdinand is inclined towards war. Johann Friedrich demands restitution through his son sent to the Emperor and other envoys sent to Ferdinand and the imperial estates, and although there are those who encourage August not to possess what is not his by force, others equally insist that he should succeed Maurice in all things; now it is said that the breach, land, and people should be returned; apples and pears should be given back. It is also said that the Emperor did not want to confirm the electorate for August and responded that he would refer the matter to the imperial estates. However, what the princes' assembly in Heldprunn is planning is not clear, and there are those who have instructed me through letters to hope well; for soon there will be a marvelous transformation, and a very auspicious one, if the Lord favors pious counsels; but there are great secrets, which will suddenly burst into light. I only fear that these councils and closer confederation of the pious princes and estates with manifestly impious and enemies of Christ will not have God's blessing, and that the cunning of the sons of Belial will not abuse the simplicity of the sons of light for their own benefit and the subversion of true religion. The Parisian bookseller reported that he had received from trustworthy sources that peace between the Emperor and the French is being seriously negotiated, so that there is no doubt that it has either already been made or will certainly be completed soon. It is believed that the French will leave the Germans sitting in the bath. We receive nothing from England, so if you have any certain news, I ask you to inform me, and farewell to you and all yours. Basel, September 28, 1553. My fellow students greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord and fellow student.</p>
