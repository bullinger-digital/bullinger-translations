      <p>Greetings. From France at present I have nothing particular, except that the Lord's business is proceeding excellently everywhere, and that the Guise family has been summoned peremptorily to give an account for the crime they intended to commit against the king's brother. It is also reported that they have been publicly proclaimed as kidnappers.</p>
      <p>On the next Sunday, the Prince of Neuchâtel, along with his most excellent mother, came to us; he was received quite magnificently and tomorrow he will renew the alliance with our people. From his people in La Neuveville, who have so far retained papism relying on the alliance they have with the people of Solothurn, he was not only treated with indignity but also with great injury. For when he arrived there on the last Friday and the princess wanted a sacred sermon to be held in the temple and she herself had already entered it, they did not allow this; but rushing in with spears and using the gravest threats, they managed to prevent the sermon. But I hope that by this action they have harmed their own mass more than they have benefited; for the indignant prince refused to accept any gift from them and threatened that he would see to it that they are brought into order. And he will also consult with our people about this matter.</p>
      <p>I truly fear that some trouble may arise between our people and those of Solothurn, although they are so distant from Solothurn that they can hardly defend them by force. We will soon hear what the outcome of this matter will be.</p>
      <p>Regarding our synod, I believe my brother has told you something; for after our Frenchmen have for quite some time now excessively demanded discipline and it has been denied to them by some of our people, it has finally been decided to hold a synod next spring and to invite learned men from other churches throughout Switzerland and to involve some from each of the German and Savoyard classes who are more learned, so that through them a deliberation may be made on how it can be instituted beneficially. Since you too are to be invited and all eyes are on you in this matter, you will consider not to fail us in such a great business. We would like to grant them something, but in a moderate way; however, nothing will satisfy them unless it is established by the authority of the synod. So that you can think about these things, I am sending you what we, together with the schoolmasters, have decided could be granted to them, about which Diesbach has also reported to you. You can see and indicate what should be added or removed. This matter greatly troubles me; for they have caused our church and especially the magistrates to be greatly concerned about this matter... as much as I can... it requires that someone skilled in the French language be appointed. Therefore, I beg you to consider what you think should be done, and at the same time, fare well in the Lord. May He grant you, your wife, children, and the entire family the happiest years! Musculus and the other brothers, the treasurers as well, Haller, Dilger, Steiger, also Diesbach, Zehender, and many other good men, Hagius and Crispinus, greet you and wish the same for you.</p>
      <p>In Bern, the last day of December at the beginning of the year 1562.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
