    <p xml:id="regest1">The fact that he [during the meeting in Zurich] was not treated more amicably was solely due to the pressing business. Inquires about his opinion on his book ["De scripturae sanctae authoritate"]. Requests temporary accommodation for Rudolf Gwalther, as Grynaeus can only take him in later.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I fully admit, my esteemed Myconius, that we have shown little courtesy to a most deserving person otherwise. However, you should not attribute this to a lack of affection, but to pressing business. "I thought," you say, "that I was not an ordinary friend to you, but in person, I was treated no differently than someone known only by face." You are not mistaken, my dearest Myconius; you are indeed an extraordinary friend, and we will remain yours as long as these spirits govern our bodies. The pressing business truly hindered our familiarity. You yourself saw that we barely had time to eat. Therefore, I beg you, do not interpret our necessity as if it were hatred or a renunciation of friendship.</p>
      <p>We are not troubled by quarrels, but we love you. I wanted to respond briefly to your complaint. Please consider it well.</p>
      <p>There is no need to give great thanks for my book. I acknowledge that I owe you greater things, and I will indeed provide them if the opportunity permits and the occasion demands.</p>
      <p>But what do you think of that book? I ask this so that, wherever I may have erred, I may be more cautious in the future.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is a learned and pious young man with me, Rudolf Gwalther, moderately learned in Greek and Latin. Grynaeus has promised to take him in. But since he has not yet settled his affairs, he is compelled to wait for a time. Therefore, I would wish that in the meantime, he could stay with you in your house and at your table. You would do me a most pleasing favor. He is otherwise an orphan, but a stipend recipient of our church. I have supported him freely for three years because of his good character. He will pay for his sustenance in good faith. Therefore, write with the next messenger if there is any place available for him with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord together with Grynaeus and all the brothers. The day after St. James, in the year 1538.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most worthy Lord Oswald Myconius, Antistes of Basel, his venerable lord.</p>
