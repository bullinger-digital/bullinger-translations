      <p>Greetings and the favor and benevolence of God be with you. If you have not yet received my letters with two whole cloths, one for you, the other for Mr. Butler, you will receive them shortly, most esteemed lord and father.</p>
      <p>They are detained longer in Antwerp because of the dyeing. However, by the grace of God, everything will reach you safely. There is no reason for you to be surprised that you have not yet received the cloth; since I entered England, I have been overwhelmed with such arduous and constant affairs that I have never been able to visit my homeland or my parents. Now the situation has changed, and the condition of English affairs is changing to some extent. My lord, who was the foremost and protector, is now held captive in the Tower of London with many others, as you will better understand from the letters you have on the way. We greatly fear a change in religion, but nothing has changed yet. Help us in your prayers. The king lives and is well by the grace of God, a most learned and prudent boy and prince. The Papists hope and strive fiercely for their kingdom. The Bishop of London, the most hostile enemy of the gospel, now lives in prison and has been deposed from his bishopric. This happened while the affairs and fortune of the Duke of Somerset were in better condition than they are now. With this bishop, I had a sharp and dangerous fight, both publicly from the pulpit at St. Paul's Cross and before the king's counselors. If he is restored to his office and episcopal function, I will be restored to my homeland and heavenly father, I have no doubt. Fourteen days ago, silence was commanded and enjoined on all readers and preachers. But this lasted only for seven days: now they are again allowed to teach. I read publicly every day in the most crowded auditorium in London, and I alternate between John and Daniel. I was reading the Psalms while the Duke's fortune allowed, in the king's court; but now that reading lies buried.</p>
      <p>My most esteemed lord, for your love towards Christ and me, see that your notes on Isaiah are copied and sent to me in good faith; for I am in great need of your work, and also all other works you have on other prophets or in the New Testament. I know all are pure, learned, and holy. I will compensate the labors of the scribe or copyist. I also ask the same from Mr. Gualter and our godfather Mr. Bibliander in their undoubtedly holy, pious, and most learned lectures. You will receive Peter Martyr's disputation with the Papists in Oxford on the cause of the Eucharist with the cloth. Johannes Stomphius is well and conducts himself honorably; tell his parents that I will never fail him if he needs my help in any matter. Johannes from Ulm is also well; you will do well to write to him to study diligently and stay at home; I fear that by frequently running between Oxford and London, he may lose not only time but also money. Use your prudence in this matter. In haste. Greet all my good lords and teachers, and all friends and their most pious wives in the name of all of us.</p>
      <p>I ask you to love and greet the excellent Mr. Butler, to whom it is not permitted to write anything now, and ask him to give two florins to the widow of the late Zinkius in my name. You also tell the afflicted widow that, as long as we live, we will remember the kindness shown to us.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted John Hooper.</p>
      <p>To his most esteemed lord Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. His most beloved lord.</p>
