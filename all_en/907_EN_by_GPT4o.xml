      <p>S. Regarding the people of Lausanne, I write nothing at present, because I hope you have meanwhile received my letters, in which I address that matter. The people are restless and arrogant, hardly overcome by any kindness; wherever they see an opportunity for their complaints, they press harder and fill everything with words and slanders, and are scarcely kept in line except by moderate severity, as I have already experienced in quite a few cases.</p>
      <p>However, it is now pleasing to respond to them modestly and amicably, yet in such a way that they feel not all their efforts are approved by us in every respect. If the matter were still to be referred to the council, it would already be settled. You will encourage them not to disturb the council and our spirits over a matter of such little importance and not to bring about bitterness that is harmful to both themselves and the churches. What you write about Mr. Musculus's stipend, I have diligently attended to so far, but in vain; the treasurer is too slow in this matter, and reluctantly refers the matter to the council; he would rather assist him with extraordinary subsidies, knowing the ways of the senators. Nevertheless, I will press him sharply and will not cease until I see some effect; you too will render your assistance, as you do, but not before I have advised you to write to anyone about this matter; for the minds of men are varied, and untimely intercessions often do more harm than opportune dissimulations.</p>
      <p>An opportune occasion must be seized, without which we will achieve nothing. Sometimes it seems that a good man, prompted by his wife, proposes these things too importunately, from which he gains more envy and rancor among some than goodwill; he does not suffer from any necessity of sustenance, but I think little remains to be set aside for his children, even if Hervagius grants him 50 florins each year. Whatever he receives from there, it is due to his singular labors; otherwise, if you calculate those, it far exceeds my pension.</p>
      <p>Whatever it may be, the more modestly he asks, the more easily he will obtain, and the less he complains, the more he will receive. For I will not neglect any opportunity, nor will I omit any effort, to ensure that he and his children are well provided for; I would rather contribute from my own than allow anything to be lacking for his needs.</p>
      <p>As for our Gervasius, I advise that he should fly to us immediately;</p>
      <p>Summerius will indeed leave Lenzburg; we will therefore ensure that he is replaced, although it will sometimes be a very difficult and envious task, especially for me.</p>
      <p>However, I do not care; let him come, we will use the opportunity with its forelock, and the sooner he comes, the better he will come. You will only ensure that, if not to the entire council, at least to certain leaders, the treasurer of Erlach, Sepinianus, etc., you commend him; it would be better if he also had letters from the most illustrious council of Zurich. You will ensure with your prudence that he comes quickly and conveniently. Weber has somewhat calmed his spirits; Jodocus is going to some baths. Musculus might not find him here; for today he left for Basel to prepare the edition of his Commentaries on the Psalms; for Hervagius now wants to commit them to the press. He will be away for 8 or 10 days; but let him come nonetheless; perhaps he will be less suspected in his absence than in his presence, and what might seem to harm could benefit, with God's will. I will handle the Wedischwil matter faithfully, as you commend. The treasurer is again sitting at home, detained by foot pain.</p>
      <p>Hagius is not in the city; when he comes, I will urge him as well. Farewell. I congratulate you on your daughter's marriage; may the Lord bless them and all yours, amen. My wife sends her greetings to you and yours; you will greet her from me as well. Bern, May 17, 1550.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich</p>
