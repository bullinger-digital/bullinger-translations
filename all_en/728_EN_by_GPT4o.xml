      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I cannot, most kind Bullinger, give you thanks worthy enough for your kindness and benevolence towards me. May the Lord God, the rewarder of all good, give you and the other lords and brothers worthy thanks.</p>
      <p>I recently left you without saying goodbye; but it happened thus: I was compelled, willing or not, to return home partly due to the care of my family and partly due to our church, whose matters were to be addressed before our senate the following day, which was of no small importance to me. Indeed, I did this with all the diligence I could, but achieved nothing; I warned of stumbling blocks and great crimes, but all in vain. But leaving these aside, I come to my matters. Your kindness knows that I have endured very heavy labors for a long time, as I alone have taught the gospel for 34 weeks with no small anxiety and trouble on my part, so much so that my bodily strength was greatly weakened and that heavy labor threatened a serious illness. Now, therefore, it seemed unworthy to some good people not to reward me with any honorable gift; they wanted to decide what should be given to me that would be equal to their gratitude and my labor. Finally, they bring forth great treasures, they promise ten pounds of our currency, thuͦnd nitt me dan 9 Zürichpfund, and they promise to give it to me not immediately, but when they have scraped it together from some peasants through debt collectors. Oh, what a great and liberal and more than royal recompense. Therefore, I had decided not to accept anything at all, especially since they are so ungrateful and sordid. But lest I be accused of either pride or greed, I unwillingly accepted. I have kept it with me and I do not know whether I should keep it or return it to those gluttons, so that they may devour even this, whatever it is; although this would be worthy of them, I do not see whether it would also befit me. You can easily gather from this what kind of people they are, who know that our stipends are too meager and now finally devolve to me such a small amount from their munificence for great labor. Meanwhile, they gave another colleague of mine 40 pounds and 5 bushels of wheat for the space and labor of the first 4 weeks.</p>
      <p>I bear these things with a more patient mind, hoping they will soon have an end. Therefore, I ask you not to forget me any longer when a suitable opportunity presents itself, nor should you suspect that I suffer these things from them for any reason other than that I do what I ought as faithfully as I can, I do not accommodate myself to their ways nor do I refrain from openly rebuking the wicked. They are ungrateful, they hate the word of God, yet they do not dare to confess it openly. I beseech you, write to me briefly what should be done with that magnificent gift, whether I did right in accepting it, or whether you think it should now be retained or returned to them to consume (as they do with all other things), and as always, commend me, and all the more as I have endured all these things for so long, so that they may finally have an end and what is now lacking may be compensated for in another way. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>My wife sends greetings to your whole household. I wish D. Gualther and Frisius well.</p>
      <p>In Aarau, on the 30th of October, 1549. Entirely yours, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord.</p>
