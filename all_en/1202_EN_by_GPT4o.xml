      <p>S. D. How fortunate I am, my esteemed Myconius, that our merchant is traveling to you; for he can serve as a living letter. I am so overwhelmed by headaches caused by excessive wakefulness, worries, and labors that I could barely write this, although I had promised you a very detailed letter through our Gastius.</p>
      <p>However, here you have our comprehensive Fifth Decade, you have our Consensus and that of our dear brother Calvin, who is now publishing Commentaries on Isaiah and the seven canonical [books] with a preface against the council to Edward VI. I pray that you consider this small gift of mine favorably. If only I had the leisure to read diligently; I know these will not displease you. I know that many will judge us more rightly, who have so far condemned us as sacramentarians. For I do not hope in vain that I have spent much labor in writing four sermons on the sacraments; but I also wish to hear your judgment. You also have, I say, our merchant, in whom you have invested with great benefit, whatever you have invested. He responded aptly and learnedly when examined; he was therefore accepted by the college prefects into the number of stipend recipients. I congratulate you on such a man of good hope. Encourage him to continue to be excellent and very studious. Farewell forever. May the Lord soon restore you to us in good health, so that we can travel together to the council in Trent; for a sick head and bad feet otherwise do not wish to cooperate well. March 6, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>May all the brothers be well; the brothers greet you. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To D. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother. Basel.</p>
