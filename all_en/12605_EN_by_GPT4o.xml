    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer is surprised that neither he nor Bullinger have received all of their mutual letters. However, Bullinger will likely have received the letter [No. 2546] delivered by Jakob [Ruf]. Blarer, for his part, has only received one other letter besides Bullinger's last letter [not received], namely the accompanying letter addressed to him by Bullinger, which he enclosed with his letter to the [Swiss] mercenaries [in the Schmalkaldic army]. He also understood well the section written in the secret alphabet concerning the [Zurichers or Swiss], despite Bullinger confusing the letters 'n' and 'r'.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Hans] Welser wrote: [Charles V.] crossed the Danube near Neustadt [a.d. Donau] with the help of specially constructed bridges. The [Schmalkaldic] troops have hurriedly moved upstream and are about two miles away from the Emperor. If he remains [north] of the Danube, they plan to attack him soon. A troop with 400 horses dared a sortie from Ingolstadt. The Hessian troops were able to push them back, killing several, capturing a Spaniard and an Italian, and seizing about 600 oxen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [Maximilian von Egmont, Count] of Buren, crossed the Rhine at Bingen and is moving towards the [Emperor's] army. [Count Christoph] of Oldenburg, in the service of the Schmalkaldic League, follows him with 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The letter bearer [...] will tell Bullinger about the misfortune in Mechelen. There are also reports of other omens that are said to have occurred in the Netherlands.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger should report on the Diet [of Aarau]. Many excellent Swiss mercenaries are going to war. The [war] costs will be great. May God grant victory and make it possible to compensate by seizing the treasures of the Pope [Paul III.]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Pamphlets appear daily, suggesting nothing good for the Emperor. May the Lord soon execute his punishment, and may [the Protestants] behave in such a way that they are not punished even more severely by God, but may inherit their heavenly legacy!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan and Theodor [Bibliander]. Ruf will have delivered the money entrusted to him by Blarer to the latter, to settle [Konrad] Hofherr's [outstanding accounts].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Titles of the pamphlets:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The "Causes" by Philipp Melanchthon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The "Origin and Cause of this Uprising of the German Nation".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- The "Description" of the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- The "[Dialogue] of the German Land and Hope" by Bernardino Ochino.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- There are other writings whose titles Blarer cannot recall.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Reports from Vienna and other places stated that King Ferdinand had confiscated the property [of Protestant Swiss] in his hereditary lands. Yet, they do not want to declare war on him, even though it is obvious that such people are only waiting for the defeat of the [Protestants].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- [P.S.:] Bullinger's letter [No. 2556] with his Holy Spirit-inspired commentary on Luke has just arrived. Blarer will never be able to repay him for it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- [Hans] Sch√∂ner praises Bullinger's kindness, for which Blarer is also indebted to the latter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Many [Swiss mercenaries] are going [to Germany], many of them to the enemy. The war costs will be enormous. Hopefully, [the Schmalkaldic League will still] reach Rome to pay their expenses with the Pope's treasure.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- Blarer has nothing new to report about the Netherlands, Mechelen, or Bavaria. Nuremberg has given money to [the Schmalkaldic League]. Ingolstadt was not occupied by the Emperor, but is on his side and has broken [its promise to the Schmalkaldic League]. The Pope with his indulgence is behind the suffering endured by [the Protestants]. Hopefully, the enemies will soon realize how much God detests bloodthirsty and villainous people!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">- Bullinger should pray for [the Schmalkaldic League]. [Thomas Blarer, Konrad Zwick, and Jakob Funcklin] send their regards.</p>

      <p>S. I am truly surprised that neither I have received all of your letters, as you write, nor have you received all of mine, except that I have no doubt that the surgeon Jakob has already delivered mine to you. Besides the most recent ones, I have only received one. Therefore, see to whom you have entrusted them. I received those with which you sent the articles to your soldiers, and no others. What you wrote about your people, I clearly understood, although you consistently write 'n' for 'r', I could easily understand what you meant.</p>

      <p>Our Consul Welser wrote to me yesterday: The imperial majesty has crossed the Danube near Neustadt with the help of specially constructed bridges, 3 miles from Ingolstadt. Our troops have also moved back, a day's march of 5 miles, ahead of their majesty. They are lying over 2 miles away from their majesty. If their majesty stays there, they will soon attempt their salvation. However, if their majesty crosses back over the bridges, they could not get to them. From Ingolstadt, they (the imperial troops) have sallied forth with 400 horses. Thus, the Hessians have driven them back, killed several, captured a Spaniard and an Italian, and also taken about 600 oxen and driven them away. We are waiting every hour for further and good news. May God grant it with grace!</p>

      <p>The lord of Buren is crossing the Rhine at Bingen. The one from Oldenburg and others are following with 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. They will join the army if they are not prevented by our people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You will hear from the messenger about the terrible storm that occurred in Mechelen in the Netherlands, where it struck the arsenal, destroyed everything, burned about 700 houses along with the beautiful imperial palaces, killed about 300 people, and severely injured about 200 people, many of whom must still die. It is also written that many other signs are occurring daily and wonderfully there.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>What you will hear, let me know from the day. Many valiant Swiss Confederates are constantly advancing. The cost is great, but I hope God will grant victory and luck, so that we may yet overcome the Pope and be compensated for the damage.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Some pamphlets are published daily, which ominously predict bad things for the Emperor. Let us pray to the Lord that we may see His vengeance in due time, but let us conduct ourselves in such a way that no even more severe vengeance is taken on us, but that we may happily obtain the promised inheritance of the children of God stored in heaven.</p>

      <p>Greet your household with Dr. Theodor, Pellican, and the others. I have no doubt that your Rufus has counted 20 florins minus 10 cruciates to Theodor in my name. For he received the same amount from me in Curio's name.</p>

      <p>King Ferdinand has had the property of our relatives (the Protestants) in his hereditary lands arrested, so that they are not allowed to change anything. Everything is inventoried and confiscated, as is written from Vienna and other places. And yet our people have not wanted to recognize him as an enemy until now! But these people are preparing everywhere against us. If the matter should go wrong for us and become a failure, they would rise everywhere, and we would have to suffer badly and endure.</p>
      <p>Given in Yl, the 31st of August 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>

      <p>But behold, now your letters are returned to me with the most elegant and learned commentaries on Luke, which clearly breathe the spirit of Christ, with which you bless me, my Bullinger, just as with the previous ones, so that I am also greatly tormented, since due to my barrenness I have nothing to reciprocate to you. I pray to the Lord with all my heart that I may have something to offer you someday, who himself may be your abundant reward and kindly supply you with strength, so that you not only suffice for so many unbearable labors but also surpass them. It is truly too much for me with your constant honoring, which I cannot repay.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Sch√∂ner praises your humanity and helpfulness towards him, so that I also acknowledge myself to be not lightly obligated to you for this reason.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Many of your people are daily going to find many notable people. The cost is great. If God does not arrange it so that an end can be made to the matter, it will be a ruinous war. I hope to God that our people will still come to Rome in time and seek the Pope's treasure themselves, so that the cost will be compensated again. Amen, amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>I hear no further word from the Netherlands, nor from Mechelen, except about the great storm; likewise from Bavaria. But we are waiting daily to hear. Nuremberg has given money to our people. I do not know how much. Ingolstadt has not been taken by the Emperor. But they are otherwise good imperialists. They have not kept their word to our people. It is all the Pope's grace and indulgence, how they can deceive, betray, and offend us with all falsehood and unfaithfulness. But they will experience, I hope, very soon, how much the Lord abhors bloodthirsty and deceitful men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>Pray diligently for us and ours. Farewell. Constance, September 1st. Our people, whom you greeted, send their greetings back to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, friend and brother in every way.</p>
