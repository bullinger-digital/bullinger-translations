    <p xml:id="regest1">There is hardly an excuse for not responding to Bullinger's letter for so long; he asks Bullinger to forgive him for this. He thanks Bullinger for the (albeit unsuccessful) attempt to find a place for his [widowed] sister-in-law [...]; as for his brother [Christian Hospinian], what he had learned from Bullinger did not happen; the fact that the brother continues to work at the school poses a danger to his health, and Hospinian asks Bullinger to call him to Zurich. He heard that Luther, who is now old but still fiery, has written an invective ["Short Confession"] against [the people of Zurich], which Hospinian has not yet seen, but he has been told that it reads like a document from the papal office and not like one written by an evangelical Christian; Hospinian fervently prays to God that Bullinger keeps a cool head if he responds to it. He recommends the young bearer Johannes Perennius von Buren, a refugee of faith. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although a very long interval of time has passed since I received your most pleasant and friendly letters, most esteemed Bullinger, I will have responded to them soon enough (according to Cato) if I do so well enough. Now, because for many reasons it is not only not well, but not even well enough, how shall I excuse my tardiness and delay? Indeed, I have often wanted to write to you and partly to thank you for the kindness of your letters, partly for your eagerness to help me and mine. But somehow, I do not know by what fortune, it has been delayed by me until this day. Therefore, I beg you, forgive my negligence or rather my forgetfulness, as I am a man sometimes not very mindful due to my occupations.</p>
      <p>As for your efforts on behalf of our sister, a most afflicted woman, I recognize your longstanding goodwill towards us, and therefore, because it is not within our power to deserve such a benefit from you, we pray that He who has proposed immortal rewards for the guardians of widows and orphans may reward you. For we know that if it had been within your power, we would have easily obtained it. Regarding my brother, I do not know what has intervened, that it has not been done as I had learned from you. I, for my part, do not approve of him acting in the trivial school. For I fear that the harm contracted from these troubles may not only relapse into the former but into a more serious illness. Therefore, I wish, if it could be done, that he be called back to you, removed from that millstone, and appointed to some office which he could oversee more safely than this one.</p>
      <p>I hear that Dr. Luther has recently spewed forth a book full of slanders and insults against you. I am surprised that the heat has not yet cooled in such an old man, and what is more worthy of admiration, that the decrepit man has not yet come to his senses. I have not yet had the opportunity to obtain a copy of his invective, however much I desire it. But as far as I understand from others, it is such as should have come from the workshop of the Roman pontiff, not from one who claims to profess Christ. But perhaps Jupiter has now transferred his thunderbolts, which he used to forge and hurl in Rome, to Wittenberg. Be that as it may, I have great hope that our God will protect us in such a way that the thunderbolts of Wittenberg will harm us much less than those of Rome.</p>
      <p>This I ask, this I request, this I demand from the Lord, that when I hear you have set your mind to respond, He may so guide and govern you with His spirit that you may not seem to have written anything led by human emotions. Indeed, I would think that, with you remaining silent, the stones would pour forth a voice and stop such a petulant, so insolent, so slanderous mouth. But I will not hinder you any longer.</p>
      <p>I commend to you this young man, who brings this to you, Johannes Perennius von Buren, learned and pious and an exile for the sake of the evangelical truth. Farewell happily with your wife and children in the Lord Jesus. Hastily, from our college on the 7th day before the calends of November.</p>
      <p>In my words, please convey my respectful greetings to Mr. Megander, Bibliander, Fabricius, Gwalther, your schoolmaster, and the other brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Hospinianus, from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man in divine and human letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church of Zurich, his lord and brother in Christ, always most esteemed.</p>
