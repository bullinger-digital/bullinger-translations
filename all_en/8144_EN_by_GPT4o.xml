      <p>I pray for abundant health and grace from God the Father with all my heart and diligently commend friendly services.</p>
      <p>Hindered by our public duties undertaken for the sake of the republic, I was unable, although I greatly desired, to respond to your letters. Indeed, the assemblies held on various matters pertaining to the common utility of the kingdom have occupied me with others for such a long time that we have been unable to attend to our private affairs in any way. I leave it to you to estimate how great the labors I had to undertake were, especially since it was necessary to decide on the preservation of our entire republic. However, I candidly confess that I have devoted myself to this matter in such a way that I have given all my effort to devising a plan by which the glory of Christ can be propagated in a safe and sound republic. However, the diligence and labors I undertook for such a pious cause in this matter brought upon me a very serious illness, which affected me so badly that my relatives completely despaired of my health. Finally, having been freed by the grace of God, I had nothing more urgent than to respond to your letters. For not only did your previous letters, written through Mr. Christoph Tretius, full of benevolence and humanity, compel and in a way encourage me to do so, but also your later ones, entirely similar to the former. Therefore, the fact that you have so diligently cared for my nephew Johann Miscovius, treated him so kindly and paternally, and instructed him in piety and good morals in such an honorable manner, has done something most pleasing to me, and I profess that I owe you a great deal for this reason. When I have the time and leisure, I will ensure that you understand my feelings towards you more fully. Nor did you think it sufficient to undertake such great diligence in his cause unless you also took care to have the accounts of receipts and expenses most aptly and accurately described and sent to me, which I interpret as a sign of remarkable diligence and singular benevolence towards me. I have received the booklets sent to me on the origin of error and on councils, yours, and on the eternal Son of God by Mr. Simler. I hold them with me as precious gifts, enjoy them, and derive the greatest delight from their reading, as they very piously, sincerely, and learnedly describe the origin of the ridiculous superstitions of the papists, one opens, the other refutes the impious blasphemies of the heretics most acutely, so that nothing surpasses it. For the same, I give you great thanks. Nothing more pleasing could have been sent to me at this time, when heretics of this kind do not cease to spread their impious doctrines.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be present to His faltering church, which is so afflicted that it may seem miraculous that any traces of true and sincere piety appear. I earnestly pray to you, my most illustrious Bullinger, that you remember us in your private and public prayers and do not cease to pray to God that He may be present with us with His eternal spirit, confirm us in truth, and wish us to remain steadfastly to the glory of His name. The fact that you have informed me of the state of the collapsing France has been very pleasing to me; for it pains me deeply that that once quite fortunate kingdom now seems to be tending towards destruction or rather collapsing. If you receive any further information about the state of that most miserable kingdom, please do not hesitate to write to me; for it is beneficial to recognize such clear signs of divine wrath for true piety, which admonish pious men and arouse true repentance in their hearts, lest, if they have provoked God with their sins, they be subjected to the same punishments. I familiarly ask you to do this, whom I have often perceived to love me greatly from many arguments of things. I again earnestly ask you that if I can be of any service to you or yours in any matter, you not only request it from me as amicably as possible but also demand it. I, indeed, will strive, as much as it is in my power, to make you aware of my feelings towards you in every way I can.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>Given in Krakau on the 12th day before the calends of February 1570.</p>
      <p>Your sincere friend Stanislaus Myszkowski of Mirow, Palatine and General of Krakau, Captain of Ratno, Slomniki, etc., by my own hand.</p>
      <p>[only "by my own hand" autograph; before 416:] To the Reverend and most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, most dear and highly esteemed friend and brother.</p>
