    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The pastors Lorenz Meyer and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder are returning to Zurich; not because the council dismissed them or they arrogated the right to do so themselves, but due to the miserable situation or the failure of the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] After the papacy was expelled from the diocese, the council intended to have the Gospel preached there. For this purpose, they called pastors from all sides (including the aforementioned ones). Now that the surrounding area has once again fallen into the hands of the priests and many pastors from the surrounding area have already retreated to Augsburg, it seemed advisable to the two pastors to return home, which will likely please the Zurich council as well. Meyer and Schwyzer will themselves tell how honorably they were bid farewell.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] They will also report on the situation in the city and church as well as on Musculusâ€™ prospects of being able to stay in the city. Should he have to leave Augsburg, he might have the opportunity to get to know Helvetia as an exile.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Thoman Ruman (even more appropriately "Frumman" [pious person]!) and Haller have decided to stay in Augsburg. They will probably report on this themselves in writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. D. Returning to you, most learned Bullinger, are the beloved brothers in the Lord, Lorenz Meyer and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder. They return not because they were rejected by our people nor due to any rashness on their part, but because of the miserable state, or rather the downfall, of our city here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It was hoped that the entire diocese could be served by the preaching of the Gospel due to the expulsion of the papacy, for which purpose our people had decided to call ministers of the word from everywhere; for this reason, the aforementioned brothers were also called to us. However, since this hope, as far as the present state of affairs is concerned, has completely vanished, so that the entire area has returned into the hands of the priests, and it has happened that the reason for their calling has ceased, and this city otherwise abounds with ministers of the word, some of whom, driven from the countryside, linger here, the said brothers have judged, and in my opinion not without reason, that it is advisable for them to return to their own, which your people will undoubtedly consider a good thing. How honorably they were dismissed by our people, they themselves will report.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>From them, you will learn about this city and our church, so that it is not necessary to commit anything of our affairs to paper. What hope I have of staying here, they can also indicate to you. If the freedom to stay here is not granted, perhaps it will be given that I may someday see your Helvetia as a refuge for ministers of Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The remaining two, Haller and Thoman Ruman (whom with one added letter we would more correctly call Frumman), have decided to stay with us longer, about which you will perhaps learn from their own letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell well in the Lord, most esteemed of men. Augsburg, March 5, 1547. Your W. Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, a lord and brother much to be esteemed.</p>
