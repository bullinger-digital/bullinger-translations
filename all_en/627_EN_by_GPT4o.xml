      <p>In utmost haste. I have now written to you three times in succession, hoping they have reached you. Now I have a message in haste for Winterthur.</p>
      <p>Know that on Tuesday, eight nights ago, a great alarm was heard at T채gerwilen around ten o'clock at night, over Petershausen towards Wollmatingen, which several people in T채gerwilen heard, among them also the pastor, my Jacob Funkelin, whom I have recommended to you several times; they wanted to find out what it was. The alarm grew louder and louder, so they thought it was a real alarm. As they almost reached the town and thought people would be awake, they saw no light, no torches, nothing, but everything was completely quiet, and the alarm subsided until they heard nothing more and realized it was in the air. Nothing of the sort was heard in the town or in Wollmatingen.</p>
      <p>Then on Friday evening, late, a great commotion was heard again in T채gerwilen, as if there was a great uproar at Emishofen, not far from there, so that several people got up and hurried there - the pastor went with them -; as they reached halfway, they stopped, and the noise subsided, so they returned home, and in the morning all those from Emishofen knew nothing about it, to their great astonishment.</p>
      <p>On the third night, on Saturday, such an alarm was heard again over Constance at T채gerwilen; the pastor and several others went out again, but heard the same as before, and it passed. But on their return home, there was such a crackling behind them, as if the whole Wollmatinger forest was breaking in two, and the crackling gradually subsided, so that honest, credible people heard it themselves. And Funkelin was with me, he told me this himself. May God grant that all this is a good omen. You know what these things used to portend, what Josephus and others write.</p>
      <p>The bishop held his pontifical sacred rites after his departure. Several ships from Zell came to adorn the act; the commander at Constance on the lake, in the king's name, ordered them to turn back and return home, etc. But it was all considered a pretense.</p>
      <p>Someone told me, who has much dealings with Ecklin and others in Constance: it is finally intended that the bishop's meadow will be taken and then strongly occupied, as if it were happening against the bishop's will; otherwise, the Confederates would not approve if he wanted to hand it over to the king himself. Thus, the king also intends to take Arbon and Gottlieben from the bishop; however, the king will assure the Confederates that their rights, which they have in those castles, will not be harmed. There are the most wonderful intrigues all around, so that no one knows where they stand.</p>
      <p>A prominent imperial person said at a table of good people: "Oh, the Confederates are loyal people; they send us artillery and gunpowder to Frauenfeld, so we don't have to fetch it from far away." The commander is gone; his wife is also gone. It is said that he has gone to Ulm to meet the one from Lier, bringing him the money that the imperial forces have collected at Constance. Someone told me: he knows that the commander has sent away all the good silverware and the like. [Gap] Well, let us pray to God truly. Let me know if you have received all my letters with the news. Let us cry out to the Lord of heaven and earth, that he may turn all this trouble into happier times and have mercy on us. My wife and sister send you all good wishes.</p>
      <p>Greet your house and all brothers and friends. Given on St. Lawrence's day, 3 o'clock in the afternoon at Winterthur. Please let Waltharten from Ulm answer the enclosed letter, also herewith an enclosed letter to M. Gervasius from Mr. Hans Schmid; it has just come to us.</p>
      <p>Tell M. Conrad Friccius that he has departed well and in a Christian manner at Isny. Greet him with all loyalty and love</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
