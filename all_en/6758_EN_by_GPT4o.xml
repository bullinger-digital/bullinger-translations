      <p>Honorable Lord and Father, I cannot withhold from you how Lord Batt, at the request of Lords Tscharner and Georg Carli, was asked to intervene in some matters, but both of these lords gave a very dismissive response and are unwilling to consider any mediation. There is no doubt that if he were to forcefully intervene, he would not adhere to the articles that the previous bishops had sworn to uphold; for the violence and willfulness that is being exercised in one place or another is indescribable. Now I see and find nothing else but that God wishes to punish this city and the community of the Three Leagues; for we have well deserved it. Next Monday, when the sermons are over, I intend, if I live, to request all my letters, which I have already once weighed, so that no harm may result from them in the future. I will also resign myself to nothing other than suffering. If better comes, it is a gain. The beginning of all ruin comes from this city of Chur. There are many honest people who mean well. But all the schemes are made here. Therefore, it is no wonder that the matter rewards us the worst. I did not want to withhold this from you in great haste, so that you know that no mediation has a place. If the Six Places had wanted to consider what was at stake for them, we might have come to reasonable mediation; but since no one wants to burden themselves with the matter, it will go as it goes. Year 1566, April 12th.</p>
