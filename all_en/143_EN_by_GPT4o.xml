      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father through Jesus Christ. I sent a letter to you through Master Augustin Mainard, most esteemed Bullinger, who wanted to have special letters from me. Indeed, one would have sufficed for both, and I would have relieved you of this labor. Here is the other part of the controversy, Doctor Franz Stancarus of Mantua, as I hear, a man highly learned in languages, a Christian and pious man, also known to me for fourteen years, also eager to know Bullinger. The reason they come to Zürich, I touched upon in Master Augustin's letters; here I omit it for the sake of brevity. Therefore, act with your humanity with these men, as you are accustomed. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From the Court of Rhaetia, on the first of June, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in humanity and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Zürich church, his lord and primary friend.</p>
