    <p xml:id="regest1">Shares a letter [from Strasbourg]: [The letter writer] saw a printed copy of the Cologne Reformation draft at Bucer's, which is to be published only after its presentation to the electors and princes; Bucer's Latin translation is to appear as a more affordable edition. It is unknown whether Emperor [Charles V] will turn against [King Francis I] or, after making peace with him, attack the Protestants; in the Netherlands, he has issued harsh edicts, and believers were executed in Leuven; [Duke William of JÃ¼lich and] Cleves was obliged to reverse the beginnings of a Reformation; it is said that [King] Ferdinand is confronting the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I] with a strong army, but his approach is wrong. In Metz, the imperial commissioner Charles de Boisot expelled the preacher [Watrin Dubois] and issued a mandate to restore the papacy; some women remained steadfast, for which one of them had her tongue cut out; such actions may not align with the Emperor's will, but the council, in its hatred, even forgets the welfare of its own city. In Ulm, Nuremberg, Lindau, and elsewhere, the plague is increasing. So much for the letter [from Strasbourg] of November 1; what Bucer has written will be communicated by Myconius. Martin Peyer thought that the people of Zurich would have pleased Luther more with a golden goblet or a silk garment than with [the "Biblia sacrosancta"]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>These things were written to me in recent days: "The Cologne Reformation in German is entirely printed; I saw it at Mr. Bucer's place, but it will not be distributed at all until the next assembly when the Elector of Cologne presents a copy to each elector and prince for reading. Mr. Bucer has also translated it into Latin, which will be published more concisely and sold at a lower price.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Emperor, I have nothing certain to write. Some say he is continually attacking his enemy, the Frenchman, with force and arms and will not rest until he defeats him; others say there is already a negotiation for peace between them, and once that is achieved, he will plan something against the Protestants, which some are certain of. There are not insignificant signs of how fiercely the Emperor behaves after his victory in Lower Germany, where we hear the most severe edicts are being promulgated against those devoted to the evangelical truth. In Leuven, they say two women were buried alive for the confession of Christ, and two men were beheaded for the same doctrine.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Cleves has been ordered not to accept Christ, and where He has been accepted, to expel Him again from the borders. How other kings and princes rage at even the mention of the Gospel, you have long known. It is said that Ferdinand led a well-equipped army of 60,000 to meet the Turk at Pozsony, but this was after the festival, and when he will need troops and soldiers, there will be none; thus, everything is done in a disorderly manner. But this is the way to ruin for the people now, farewell to God.</p>
      <p>In Metz, the most cruel acts are being committed by a certain imperial legate named Charles de Boisot; he is entirely focused on eradicating the doctrine of piety and reintroducing the papacy among the simple people with the gravest threats and penalties. He expelled their preacher from the city, who is now here; he prohibited all our sermons, gatherings, books of purer doctrine and song, words and sayings against the old religion, schools conducted according to piety, and similar things, with an express mandate obtained from the imperial majesty. Meanwhile, many weak ones relapse into the mire, and, miserably, even some priests who had come to the truth. Meanwhile, as if to show that the omnipotence of God is inexhaustible, some women also confess Christ fearlessly, one of whom recently came here with her tongue cut out for the confession of Christ, endowed with a strong spirit, and almost every day brings new things. Some think the Emperor is unaware of such things, not wishing his legate to design such atrocities. However, the council of Metz desires, even at its own loss and to the great detriment of the city's liberty, to satisfy its hatred in the calamity and blood of the pious.</p>
      <p>We hear of the plague increasing in Ulm, Nuremberg, Lindau, and elsewhere. In Strasbourg, on the first of November 1543."</p>
      <p>Mr. Myconius will convey the rest of what Bucer writes. If you people of Zurich had sent Luther or his wife a golden goblet or a silk garment, you would have done him a much more pleasing thing than by sending that book. This was said by Martin Beyer.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Theodor and Mr. Vadian with Pellican and the other brothers. November 7, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
