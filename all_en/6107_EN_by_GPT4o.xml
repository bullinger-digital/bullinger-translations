      <p>Greetings. I have received your two letters, most kind Bullinger, to which I cannot respond now due to extreme busyness; however, I briefly inform you that the paths are blocked by the tricks and machinations of the Cardinal of Lorraine; the bloodthirsty little fox will achieve nothing; praise be to God, who diligently observes the arts of man. Therefore, I bid you to be of good cheer.</p>
      <p>Our prince has responded most lovingly to your republic and the Bernese senate. But hear news that may perhaps surprise you: We have organized a disputation here with the theologians of WÃ¼rttemberg; we have spent nearly three days refuting the ubiquity, which defends itself solely with the right hand of God, the majesty of Christ, the bodily indwelling of divinity, and other arguments known to you.</p>
      <p>Among the adversaries are Brenz, Jakob Andreae, who acts as the antagonist, Schnepf, Valentin Vannius; among ours are Boquin, Olevian, Ursinus, Dathenus, Erastus, and Ehemius.</p>
      <p>May God grant a successful outcome to the colloquy; the saying and judgment of Nazianzen make me very anxious and concerned about the meetings.</p>
      <p>In our prince, you would see a living image of Constantine or Martianus; such is the care for investigating truth and promoting the glory of God.</p>
      <p>I cannot say more.</p>
      <p>Our Erastus will add something to this letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>Maulbronn, April 12, in the year 64.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Stephan Zirler, secretary.</p>
