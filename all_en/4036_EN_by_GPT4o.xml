      <p>Grace and peace through Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>Either all my conjectures deceive me, most kind Heinrich, or we now have those letters of ours found, which could not be discovered for so long; in this matter, we owe more to some unknown fortune than to industry. The occasion was as follows: by chance, an Italian man, an honest man, the brother-in-law of Peter Perna, came into the merchant's house for some letters, I know not which. Then the head and treasurer of that public house offered him the letters, suspecting they were written in Italian, to read; although the Italian did not know English, yet because he saw my name on the address, he came straight to me with the letters, announcing that the head wished me to come to him. I came immediately, taking with me our Laurence and a certain Basel schoolmaster, who was to be the interpreter. The head tells that those letters, long discarded in a corner, were recently found by a servant; moreover, other letters addressed to you and to Mr. Gesner were found, which he had already given to Peter Maklin to be delivered to you.</p>
      <p>Opening mine, I find them to be the same that were sent to me by Abel at the same time and in the same bundle as yours. This gives me a strong suspicion that those are yours which were missing. You will understand better upon opening them; about which I wish to be informed at your leisure. If Mr. Frensham is still alive, I pray that he may live long: tell and advise him not to despair of himself, much less of divine grace; which, if it sees fit, can easily overcome all medicine, and even deceive the doctors. Although I have heard of no doctor who openly and simply despairs of him; and if they did despair, they might perhaps judge better of German men than of English. I wish, if you have anything concerning the martyrs, or about Bartholom√§us Grynaeus, as you seemed to indicate in your letters, or about the whole business or cause of Zwingli, to be informed in due time.</p>
      <p>If the Zwingli matters could not be printed here, they could still be printed in England, nowhere better. Greet among others Mr. Frensham in Christ, Mr. Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>Remember me in your prayers to the Lord. Basel, August 2, 1559.</p>
      <p>[Yours] in Christ, [J. Foxe.] To the learned and esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
