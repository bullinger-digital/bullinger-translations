      <p>From the Remstal in Württemberg, several hundred people, men, women, and children, have moved away with the permission of the Duke due to poverty during this time of famine to a county behind Nuremberg; it is almost completely depopulated; the count wants to repopulate his land with these poor people. Shortly before the Duke of Guise was shot, new aid from England was sent to the Prince of Condé; among them, two hundred were shipwrecked and perished, most of them noblemen; the others survived. The Prince of Condé's sister-in-law, as they returned to France, also came with Lord Hans Sturm to Heidelberg to the Elector Palatine and stayed with him in his castle for three days; the Landgrave of Hesse was also still there.</p>
      <p>A French embassy is said to have been dispatched to the Elector, as well as to Württemberg and other German princes, to thank them for the aid sent in this war and to offer all due assistance, should it come to pass that France would likewise demonstrate and prove itself to them.</p>
      <p>The King of Denmark is said to have captured some noblemen belonging to the Landgrave who wanted to sail to Sweden; for he is very displeased that the Landgrave has married his daughter to the King of Sweden's son and thus made more alliances with him.</p>
      <p>In Heidelberg and the surrounding area, the famine is also exceedingly severe and great; many robbers and thieves are also emerging there, who violently rob others of their possessions, even murdering some and beating them to death, six of whom have now been caught and are being interrogated for several days, as they have been particularly suspected of the arson that occurred there.</p>
      <p>When the Landgrave rode back home from Stuttgart after the wedding and came to the Elector Palatine, he informed him how he had heard from Duke Albrecht of Bavaria in Stuttgart that the Elector was in great disfavor with the Emperor because he opposed the order and dignity of the Holy Roman Empire, protecting and defending shameful heresy and even holding it himself, and that it must not go unpunished and unaddressed.</p>
      <p>To this, the Elector replied to the Landgrave: he leaves this whole matter to the Lord God; for he is a poor prince who had neither land nor people, and was placed in this principality, which he now holds; he would gladly give it all back and let it go, if it pleased His Providence.</p>
      <p>From the letters of a certain friend, who is now engaged in studies in Heidelberg: In our Heidelberg church, although the divine mysteries are handled and explained most faithfully and sincerely, yet among the listeners of all kinds, there is a large part that attacks innocence and truth, which they understand to be conquered by its power, with the most wicked slanders and insults.</p>
      <p>If the hidden poison of their fear could freely spread, how much harm do you think it would bring to the Christian religion, since even now many insolent and threatening voices have been heard in this city, who, convinced by common rumor of the death of their prince, boast triumphantly that it is now over with the Zwinglians and their heresy.</p>
      <p>God has reduced their impious wishes and nefarious hope to nothing with clear example, whatever way things may turn out in the future, there is no reason for them to attribute anything to their own judgment or to accuse anyone other than themselves, whose wickedness causes God to allow the light of His truth to be entangled in darkness, lest those most ungrateful men, who have closed their eyes to its view with spontaneous desire, impiously abuse it to the disgrace of the most holy name.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed friend and brother in Christ.</p>
