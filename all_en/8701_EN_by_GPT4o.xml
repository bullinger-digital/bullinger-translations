      <p>S. D. I received your letters, honorable and dearest brother, and I deeply sympathize with you for being so harassed by absurd people. But you know that nothing unusual happens to you, as you share this in common with the blessed prophets, holy apostles, and the most faithful bishops of the church. We have experienced and continue to experience the same as you every day; but the faithful Lord never abandons us. As for Merum, that is, the furious and recalcitrant mare, if she continues to slander us or the church or the republic of Zürich with calumnies, insults, and lies, we hope that the most honorable magistrate of the Rhaetians will not allow this slanderer to go unpunished. This republic loves the very strong republic of the Rhaetians and has conferred not insignificant nor few benefits upon it, and is now also very ready to do well by it. I hope the honorable people will be of good spirit towards the city of Zürich, that they will not allow a runaway babbler to disgrace any honorable church. He, the mare, has indeed been among us in Winterthur, and has also taken the synod oath. If he knew that things were not going right in this church, why does he not report it or why did he swear to us? Where does he now put that same oath? It is a wonder if such an honorable government tolerates such slander. I beg you to discuss these matters with the best of men, especially with our councilors, whom you will greet from me, and that most kindly. But be strong and fearless; the Lord will be with you and the other pious and peace-loving men, so that you may be able to convict and restrain those born to disturb and slander. May Christ the Lord, the vigilant and avenger of his church, grant this to you! I do not cease to struggle with difficulty in urination.</p>
      <p>Simler is still bedridden with gout, but he is beginning to feel a little better. Our Gwalther is also preaching and appearing again, although he is still quite ill. We all hope for better things from the Lord. If what is written about the Venetian victory is true, I fear it will be a victory like that of Tokaj.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant better things! We hear that things are going well in France and that the admiral is in favor with the king and his brother. If you come to us after the Martinmas holidays, you will be a most welcome guest to us, and I beg you to stay with me; we will then discuss many matters. However, I hope that before you come, you will have already convicted your adversaries, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Written in great haste. May the lords and brothers be safe, especially brother Campell.</p>
      <p>Zürich, November 2, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor in Chur at St. Martin.</p>
      <p>Merii oath.</p>
