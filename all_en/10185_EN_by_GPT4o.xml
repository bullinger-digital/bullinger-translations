      <p>On the 27th of November, I received your letter full of consolation, from which I understand that your wisdom has achieved that the cities agree in maintaining faith and averting the slanders of the pagans - as Myconius calls them. Indeed, it is a good omen, and I sense some extraordinary mercy of the Lord in the help of Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen. For it signifies, unless I am mistaken, that the solid piety and the faith recognized by us not so many years ago, which relies on His word, have taken deeper roots than to be easily overthrown by any storms of evil. We experience the same in the faithful men of the common lordships, who, although they seem to lie stripped of the freedom of doctrine and even seized and oppressed by tyranny, yet stand upright in spirit in the midst of affliction and do not cease to devise plans for supporting their ministers with their own resources, so that we may clearly see that the word of the Lord, sown in fertile ground, cannot fail to yield its fruit. Therefore, what remains seems to have been achieved by the grace of the Lord, namely the constancy of the city of Zurich, which in reality is our metropolis. Consider, indeed, how much scandal would arise if your city, which is strong in men, order, and authority, and which, like a pious mother, has provided the other Swiss cities with that pure milk of reformed religion, were to fall from its position due to the storms of conspiracies and evil arts, having professed and asserted such piety with great assurance. For what was given to their fury for the time being in that military alliance does not pertain to the account of that faith, since everyone sees that what was then demanded by the cunning of the adversaries was stitched together and violent, and indeed it happened, as often occurs in this kind of deceit, that with the same counsel by which they attempted to strengthen their own militia and weaken ours, we can now rightly, by examining that head of the alliance, dissolve the deceit and avoid the slander with the assertion of our religion.</p>
      <p>I read your most circumspect counsel with great pleasure, and since you ask what I think should be done, I reply that it does not seem advisable to me to adopt that course at the beginning of the business, since there is hope that they will openly see that their efforts cannot achieve what they are striving for, especially since our people might be variously affected by the dissolution of the alliances and could be either stirred up or alienated in spirit by new arts against us, as if we were desirous of new things and neglectful of Swiss liberty. Moreover, I can hardly persuade myself that it will be as you candidly conjecture, that when we have renounced the alliances, they will easily maintain peace on any terms. Rather, I would fear more what arts they might employ to alienate lands from the cities under the pretext of retaining the old liberty and the Swiss name and glory, which indeed they could easily achieve if they started a war and brought in foreign aids and garrisons, if they made their own those who now seem to be ours by burning and harassing some of the Cantons, which are in the countryside. For you know what faith some from the countryside recently showed to the Senate of Zurich, that is, in the last war, who, although their affairs were not yet sought or afflicted, nevertheless dared to withdraw and make a pact with the enemy, I know not how, and with the magistrate despised. To whose treachery, to speak freely, we owe and attribute this so specious alliance. Therefore, a more humane and placable course should first be attempted, if perhaps they might give way to humanity and grave gentleness. If that cannot be achieved, the next course, as is equitable, will be to threaten the dissolution of the alliances. For to us, alliances open to such slanders are not alliances, but bonds of denied liberty. Who knows whether they might become more tractable at these threats? For they are not so stupid as not to be able to weigh what harm our secession would bring them. But if even this counsel could not succeed, then it is as you advise, namely, for the sake of retaining our liberty, those alliances should be rescinded, meanwhile with much vigilance about forming new and maintaining friendly allies, about seeking the concord of the cities beyond the Rhine and the Christian princes, about greeting the French and privately asking the fields, whether they will remain faithful, and therein about the nature of the cause, namely that it is at the door, that we are about to lose not only our former liberty but also our primitive faith and apostolic religion, than which none is more ancient, if we wish to be allied with the pagans. There are many things which you see more rightly with your keen judgment than I could point out. This will be the last and, as it is said, the sacred anchor. Only take care, as you diligently do, that nothing is lost in the minds of your people for retaining the truth. The day will come which will repair even in this age whatever loss your republic suffered in the previous disaster. Our God is rich and has accustomed to bless those who love Him even with kingdoms.</p>
      <p>Be assured about the Emperor. He has dismissed a large number of German soldiers, and they do not think he has any other plan than to commit himself to the waves of Spain in the early spring to be brought back.</p>
