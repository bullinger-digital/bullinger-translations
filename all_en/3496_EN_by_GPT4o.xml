      <p>S. My lord Tscharner sends you his friendly greetings with the offer of his willing service, and hereby also thanks you kindly and diligently for your effort and work, which you have applied, and also to inform you that there is good hope that the matter may be amicably resolved in a satisfactory manner; should this happen, the priests would not have much to hope for. The properties have mostly all changed hands and been sold over the past 30 years; the abbot would also have to seek out each citizen individually, if he were inclined, with legal means; there would always be disputes and quarrels. Therefore, it is thought to come to an agreement with the abbot amicably, which he is also willing to do. The matter is not as clear as it was presented to me.</p>
      <p>I have been informed that this tithe has been given to the service of God from ancient times, and the abbot claims it in the church, which caused me to speak the words that the abbot himself said: one should read mass there, then he would be satisfied, which could have served to the great disadvantage of our lands.</p>
      <p>Now, however, since the abbot does not claim it as a church tithe, there is less danger involved. Yet it is best to discuss it; for, as mentioned before, if the abbot had to win the tithe by right, it would always cause unrest. It is my request to you, kind sir and father, that you would secretly inform young master Friedrich about the matter of the bishopric, and also urge him that, if the opportunity arises, he would help to ensure that the tithe is used for the true service of God and the schools; for he knows about all the dealings, and is also, as I believe, related to the bishop. The matter is deeply undermined.</p>
      <p>If the old Mr. Travers, along with others, would do their best, I believe they could achieve so much that the bishop could be won over amicably; perhaps he could be bought out; should this happen, something could remain for the churches and schools, as well as the poor. Otherwise, if it is to proceed in a tumult, everything will be torn into many parts. The bishop cannot trust the matter well; he fears that if he lets it be known, the peasants would not stand by, and he would lose everything. Therefore, you must find out from young master Friedrich how a way could be found to speak quietly with the bishop, and also propose conditions to him that he could trust. If the clergymen could be assured of their benefices for their lifetime, they would be satisfied with the matter; but they fear that as soon as they let anything go, they will lose everything. Currently, on our side in the common Three Leagues, but especially in the Gotteshaus League, we have so many old, prominent, respectable men, among whom Mr. Travers is the foremost, that if they were to pass away, the matter would not be so easily taken up by the young. It is my friendly request to you that you speak earnestly with young master Friedrich, but not as if anything came from me; it will have more weight. With this, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>As for the words of the envoy, I do not wish them to be published by me; therefore, I wrote them down for you to keep to yourself. I have promised my gracious lords enough time.</p>
