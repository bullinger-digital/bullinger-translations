      <p>The letters you sent me were most welcome, most illustrious and esteemed Antistes; I hope they will be even more gratifying to the Locarno brothers, especially since a rumor had already reached them that was not very desirable, namely that the Four Cantons had abandoned their cause, which God forbid. But since there is still considerable hope, as it seems to me from your letters, that the Four Cantons and the other soldiers of Christ will want to defend the cause of the Christians, indeed of Christ himself, more vigorously, there is no doubt that the spirits of the Locarno people will be somewhat refreshed and receive consolation and strength. It will be your duty, faithful man of Christ, and of others who watch over the flock of Christ day and night, to always, as now, encourage and urge the lords, as much as is in your power, not to allow their brothers, indeed Christ himself, to be plundered and devoured by enemies. Enough and more than enough has been sown by them; let them finally cease from their iniquities. But what you write, that many among you are amazed at the tepidity and negligence of the Locarno people, because they have not openly subscribed to the word of God, indeed that it is vain what is said about their faith, but that some monks and nuns and priests from Italy have been among them, who try to disturb the whole world, this is said by the wicked and liars, believed by the frivolous, with all due respect to all good men. Or perhaps you are unaware, most illustrious man, that when the Swiss envoys arrived at Locarno on St. John's Day of this year and it was asked by the envoys of the Four Cantons who those Christians were, through the work of your bailiff, who is now at Locarno, a list was presented to the envoys, in which one hundred and forty Christian men and women of Locarno had subscribed, without children and infants, not a single one of whom was a foreigner or alien. What is this? Do the lords not know this? Indeed, it would be more wicked than parricide if the envoys had concealed such a number of Christians and their Christian confession, which was written in the list, which I do not believe happened; for (as I hear) the faith and confession of the Locarno people and the number of Christians were so diligently sought by them, that the envoys seemed more ready to bring help than the Locarno people to seek aid, among whom the most zealous was indeed the envoy from Schaffhausen, who, when he had instructed the former bailiff of Schaffhausen to have the number of Christians described for him, the latter replied that he had not had dealings with the Christians. Then the envoy said: "You have answered correctly," he said; "for not only have you not had familiarity with them, but you have also persecuted them to the point of imprisonment, the vengeance for which crime you will not escape." When the bailiff heard this, guilty and trembling, he himself, along with your bailiff, had the aforementioned list described. What more do your lords seek from the Locarno Christians? If they are still not satisfied in the name of faith, let them send envoys again, who will inquire about the faith of the Locarno Christians and question them; for indeed they will answer with one voice: "We subscribe to the Christian confession of the lords of Zurich and embrace it with all our heart; God is our witness." By the immortal gods, what more is to be desired from them? What clearer and more lucid response and confession? But someone frivolous will say: "They will not say this." You are mistaken, whoever you are; indeed they have said it and will say it again. I have reasoned with you, my lord Heinrich, somewhat heatedly, because we have fallen into these evil times, so that many try to lend their ears more to lies than to the truth, and to such a lie, which not only proceeds from a lying man, but is also uttered by the most hostile enemy of the cross of Christ to this day. I beg your humanity, by the bowels of Christ, to diligently investigate and scrutinize whether these things I write are true; then, as much as is in your power, to sustain and defend the cause, which is still intact. Farewell. The brothers in Christ who are here greet you, especially Maynard and Niger. May the grace of Christ always be with us. Chiavenna, October 13, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Antonio Mario Besozzo.</p>
      <p>Postscript. I also thought it should be written that the brothers in Locarno themselves ensured that so many children were publicly baptized and that the word of God was proclaimed in the public temple in the presence of the envoys of the three Cantons, who had then come to Bellinzona on St. Bartholomew's Day, and this happened in the past month of August, which had not been done before due to fear, except at night. Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Geneva, Zurich.</p>
