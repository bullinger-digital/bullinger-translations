      <p>Praise be to God. March 22, 1551. London.</p>
      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Today, my most esteemed lord, I received your letters dated February 24th, which I delivered immediately to the wife of Herr Johannes Hooper. You expressed a strong desire for me to write about his (Herr Johannes Hooper's) condition in your aforementioned letters. I must inform you that I have nothing to report about his tribulation to your piety, except what I wrote to our mutual friend Herr Johannes Butler on the first day of the aforementioned February. I have no doubt that he has already conveyed this to you. But now (thanks be to God!) the same Herr Hooper has been released from custody and restored to his former condition.</p>
      <p>However, he has yielded in some matters, which are considered indifferent here among us, regarding his opinion and judgment. This Lent, dressed in a red episcopal robe, after being initiated or inaugurated in the manner of our bishops, he preached before the royal majesty, with many approving and condemning his attire, according to their inclinations. Now Herr Hooper has gone to Gloucester, where his episcopal seat is; but I hear he will return shortly. I am saddened that many Germans have agreed to the Council of Trent; but I believe that by the grace of God, our people are so firm and rooted in the truth, especially in those articles that oppose the primacy of the Roman bishop, that they will never consent to the same Council of Trent, at least not in our lifetime.</p>
      <p>In your letters to me dated August 20th, you bring good news from Italy, that the gospel is beginning to be received. May God increase the faith of those who live there in the Lord Jesus Christ, and may He perfect what has begun in some of them until the day of Christ. Amen. I am very grateful to you for the decades of your sermons, which you have given to me as a gift. I cannot easily repay this kindness; however, when the opportunity arises, I will certainly make some recompense for those decades 3 and 4, as well as for the earlier books, many of which you have long since given to me. I pray you will be so kind as to greet your most chaste wife in my name, along with my other friends there; my wife sends her regards to you and all of yours, especially your wife. Farewell in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Yours, Richard Hilles.</p>
