    <p xml:id="regest1">Itelhans Bertz has delivered [Bullinger's package] most reliably. Vadian and Johannes Kessler thank for Bullinger's work "Series et digestio temporum," which they value more than all wealth. Also, Theodor Bibliander is thanked in Vadian's name [for sending his book "De ratione communi omnium linguarum et literarum commentarius"].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Vadian will ensure that the Augsburg city clerk [Georg Fr√∂lich] will safely receive Bullinger's package [not received]. Bullinger's letter [to Leonhard Serin, 18035 from February 15, 1548] was forwarded to Ulm as requested. The enterprising people of St. Gallen have enough reliable messengers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">In St. Gallen, it is not known what Emperor Charles V will undertake next. At the Augsburg Diet, all negotiations are taking place in secret!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Although [the St. Gallen council] has received some information about the Baden Diet, [which began on March 12], from the Zurich mayor Johannes Haab, Vadian urgently requests Bullinger's report on the negotiations. The people of Zurich should strive to ensure that the Confederates do not enter into an alliance with King Henry II of France, despite favorable conditions, even though he is so eagerly courting their friendship. For the preservation of the true religion [in the evangelical places] goes hand in hand with the [political] independence [of the Confederates].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings and a request for a response.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Itelhans Bertz, a most honest man, has delivered everything to me with utmost fidelity. Together with me, Johannes Kessler extends to you the most ample thanks for that remarkable gift of yours, which, though it is made of paper, is more pleasing to both of us and dearer than gold. I also earnestly request that you convey my thanks to Theodor Bibliander.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I will ensure that the pious and learned scribe from Augsburg receives what you sent with good faith. For what you sent to me to be delivered to Ulm has certainly been carried out according to your desire. We do not lack, as people dedicated to trade, messengers of this kind, whose diligence can ensure everything is faithfully expedited.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We are daily awaiting where the efforts of Charles (Emperor Charles V) will erupt. For now, there is a great silence about everything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But I am very eager to hear from you what has been done at the Baden Diet, although we have received some information from the mayor Johannes Haab. I beg you to ensure that we do not, under any circumstances, form an alliance with the French King, who is offering friendship in so many ways, under the most honorable conditions. For I believe that with the preservation of religious freedom, our well-being can be maintained.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell and write back. St. Gallen, on the 26th day of March, in the year of our Lord 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most magnificent city of Zurich, a truly dear and esteemed lord and friend.</p>
