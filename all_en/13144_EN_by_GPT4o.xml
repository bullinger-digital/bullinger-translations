    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frölich did not receive Bullinger's letter of admonition from December 13. Due to his difficult situation, which even the blameless Christoph Froschauer could verify, he was unable to assist him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He bought two copies of the "Swiss Chronicle" [by Johannes Stumpf] from Froschauer at a presumably reduced price of 4 florins. However, he could not yet decide to gift this magnificent work to the person recommended by Bullinger [Johann Jakob Fugger?], as this might arouse suspicion. Therefore, he gifted one of the copies to Nikolaus Müller, known as Maier. Bullinger should send him five or six more of them, well-packaged. Frölich will pay the invoice amount to the bearer or to anyone who can present a corresponding payment order from Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Froschauer departed from Augsburg to Ulm on December 17, taking with him Frölich's letter [No. 3094] and the disgraceful publication "De bello Germanico" by a certain Johannes Pedioneus. As soon as Bullinger receives the latter, he should ensure that Rudolf Gwalther or someone else takes on the refutation [written by Thomas Naogeorg].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is very doubtful whether the proclamation of the Gospel in Augsburg can be maintained at all, for wolves have already pounced on the Lord's sheep! And although only a few doubt the sincerity of Emperor Charles V, the tyranny emanating from his court is excessive.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Diet of Augsburg is such only in name. The Imperial Estates do deliberate, but it is the Emperor who decides. And even if everything is supposed to have happened to the displeasure of the Imperial Estates, they nevertheless gave their consent to it. But let's leave it at that.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Bullinger is greeted with his circle of scholars. He will learn the rest from Froschauer and from the letter [No. 3094].</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have duly received the letter of admonition you sent me on December 13. Froschauer, a most upright man, was with me, to whom I could show no courtesy. He himself partly saw the straits to which I have been driven.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I bought two copies of the "Chronicles" from him at a very fair price, if not too low, namely 4 florins. I have not yet decided to offer this remarkable work to the person you named to me, as it would not be without suspicion. Therefore, I have given one copy to Mr. Nikolaus Maier. I earnestly ask you to send me five or six more such copies in a well-sealed package. The price will be paid to the bearer or to anyone with a mandate.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Froschauer left here for Ulm on the 17th and took with him my letters destined for you along with a booklet by a certain Johannes Pedioneus, disgracefully written about the German War. I beseech you, if this book reaches you, to ensure a response is made through Gwalther or another learned person.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I very much doubt whether the public proclamation of the Gospel can be maintained here in the future, for wolves have now rushed into our fold, and although few dispute the Emperor's faith, the tyranny of the courtiers knows no bounds.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Our Diet is more in name than in reality. It is the duty of the Imperial Estates to deliberate, but the Emperor commands, as it is said that everything has been done so far against the will of the Estates, yet they have nevertheless given their consent. But so be it, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell with your entire circle of scholars. You will understand the rest from Froschauer and from the letters he carries. December 19, 1547. Yours, G. L.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, etc., to be delivered.</p>
