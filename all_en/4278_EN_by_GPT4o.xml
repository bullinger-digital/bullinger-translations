      <p>I have read the confession or rather the conspiracy of the theologians of WÃ¼rttemberg and I see that they, with very few exceptions, fall back to their vomit or to papism; the papists do not think otherwise, although they lean more towards the delusions of Schwenckfeld when they discuss the ascension of the body of Christ to heaven, etc. I see that sincere concord is utterly acted upon and despaired of; for they want to retain this foul error in the world by force. Therefore, they will as certainly undergo the judgment of God as the pronouncements of God are certain and undoubted. Just as God once exercised the church with severe persecution while the pastors quarreled among themselves, so it will also happen to us. May the Lord have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I write this in great haste. May 5, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I am sending back to you that confession; but if it is at all possible for you to obtain another copy, I beg you to give it to me. Farewell again.</p>
