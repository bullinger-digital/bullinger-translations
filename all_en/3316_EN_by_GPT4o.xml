      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus! To distinguished men, who either protect themselves with authority or enrich themselves with wealth, others dedicate the monuments of their genius. You, most learned and also most excellent man, dedicate your most holy vigils to the miserable and afflicted churches of exiles, from which no human protection or worldly benefit can be expected: in this, indeed, following the rule of perfect charity, which seeks not its own, but what belongs to others. For you have sought no benefit for yourself, but the consolation of the churches groaning under the cross, as if placing your hand under the burden, and entering into the part and feeling of our hardships. This intended purpose of your most merciful mind, as we indeed conjecture from ourselves, you have abundantly achieved. For in the revelation of the Lord concerning his churches, the door opened by you, as if introduced to inspect the present matter, and from the will of the most good and great God, by whose permission and nod these things are done, and from this your office and benefit, whom we recognize as God's angel to us, we have indeed received much consolation.</p>
      <p>For your merits towards us, just as you expect no reward from us at all, so we can repay nothing else, except that, as men not ungrateful, we have and give you the greatest thanks from the heart, as we ought, and meanwhile will pray to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ with ardent and constant prayers, that He may wish to protect and preserve such a shepherd for His flock, such a comforter for His afflicted church, perpetually.</p>
      <p>Given at Frankfurt, 15 days before the calends of October, 1557. The minister, elders, and deacons of the English exiles' church, which is in Frankfurt am Main, most devoted to your piety, David Whitehead.</p>
