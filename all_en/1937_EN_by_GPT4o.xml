      <p>S. D. I received your letter dated June 6th on the 27th of the same month with great joy, most esteemed man in the Lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>For many years I have loved you sincerely and have gladly and fruitfully used your writings and expositions. Therefore, I wished to establish a friendship with you. However, since in some matters we did not follow the same opinion, I always feared that my letters would be less pleasing to you. But now, since I hear and perceive that you do not reject my friendship, but rather offer mutual services, I will henceforth write more diligently and frequently to your kindness. Let us love each other mutually, even if we follow different paths in a few matters, let us, I say, love each other mutually. For God is love, and those who remain in love remain in God.</p>
      <p>We have, we have, I say, common enemies of Christ the Lord to fight against, and many new doctrines and authors of sects arising daily. The Lord will certainly grant to those who love sincerely in the Lord that we may also understand those few matters more correctly. Those who have made great progress in true harmony trust each other well, love each other mutually, and converse with friendly letters, having set aside quarrels and sinister opinions and suspicions. My colleagues and I do not cease to commend your safety and that of your churches to God in our prayers. It grieves us deeply if any adversity befalls you; we trust that you will be the same towards us and our churches. Great evils are threatening the churches entrusted to our faith from all sides: we will be able to repel them with mutual help and counsel through Christ. Let us therefore pray, watch, and do our duty.</p>
      <p>I have recently published two sermons on the Lord's Supper, which I send here to your piety; for I hope they will not be entirely displeasing to you.</p>
      <p>I have included the agreement of the Geneva and our church on this matter, as I understood from your son-in-law that you desired it and had never seen any example. I wish to serve you in greater matters; make use of my work. But how those German devastations grieve and torment my soul. Spare, O God, your wretched people. Let us urge, my most esteemed Brentius, as much as is in us, faith and repentance, let us cry out to the Lord and teach everyone to cry out to the Lord most earnestly, if perhaps He may have mercy on us and grant true peace.</p>
      <p>Severe headaches do not allow me to write more. You, my esteemed brother, consider these things kindly and inquire more about various matters from Mr. Vergerio, to whom I had written before the pains became so severe. Live and farewell, most illustrious man and brother esteemed and beloved in the Lord. Greet the colleagues and all the brothers. Our colleagues and all our brothers greet you in the Lord. Zürich, July 23, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Brenz, most faithful doctor of the churches of Württemberg, his most esteemed and dearest lord and brother.</p>
