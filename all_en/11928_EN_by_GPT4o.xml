    <p xml:id="regest1">Still cannot write openly. A reliable source coming from the Imperial Diet reported on plans mainly directed against the Confederates; the Confederates or the [Protestant] cities of Zurich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and St. Gallen should warn Strasbourg and Constance that their agreement to provide offensive aid to Emperor [Charles V] against [Francis I] would put them in opposition to the Confederation; it would be very disadvantageous for [Zurich] if Constance were to side with the opponents; Strasbourg has a leading role among the cities and has always been inclined towards the Confederates; if such a letter from the Confederates or the [Protestant] cities were to arrive before the conclusion of the Imperial Diet and the demand for aid contained therein, [Constance and Strasbourg] would certainly not easily give up the good neighborhood; [the Confederates] must act quickly, for they are not well-disposed towards them, but they still have friends.</p>

      <p>Dear and good friend, I have received and understood your letter in response to my last one, and since you so earnestly urge me to confidentially reveal to you what the secret is that lies within the feathers, as I have written, you should be well aware that I cannot write everything I know, though I am willing to serve you where it would be appropriate for me; but now I would like to ask you to be content with what I have made known to you, and not to inquire further; for I have great reason to let it remain as it is.</p>
      <p>The counsels are swift, and a trusted honorable man, who has just returned from the Imperial Diet, confidentially revealed to me that there are indeed significant plans being made in Speyer, and the counsels are largely directed against you Confederates, etc. And as I wrote to you last and indicated, that sensible honorable and well-disposed people, to whom this matter is very close, consider it good that you Confederates or at least Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, also St. Gallen, write to your neighbors, Strasbourg and Constance, how it concerns you, that the cities are being urged to provide offensive aid to the Emperor against the French and his allies, and if they agree, one could well consider who is aligned with whom, and that your neighborly admonition is that they should not engage unfriendly against you, etc., as you know better to handle. The same good supporters still think that it should not be neglected by you. For those of Constance are at your doorstep, and if they, as human beings can do much, allow themselves to be moved, influenced, and incited by princes against the Confederates, you must consider what great power people you would have to expect, just waiting for Constance - besides, it now has a very different armament to fight than in the Swabian War. And if the duration would break your neck and tire your people, Constance is prepared to rise up, you would not soon overrun it, etc. Strasbourg is of great power, and many cities follow its lead. And they have always had a good heart towards the Confederates, etc. If then your letter from the Confederates or cities were in the cities before the conclusion of the Imperial Diet, when the conclusion came and the mentioned aid was urged, one would consider before giving up good neighborliness. Therefore, look into the matter in time, for they are not well-disposed towards you. Yet you still have good friends, if you do not disregard them. God protect you.</p>
      <p>Given on March 26.</p>
