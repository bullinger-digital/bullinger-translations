      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>First of all, I thank you, my brother, for the book published against the Anabaptists, the reading of which is both pleasant and necessary for me. Upon the return of your messenger at this hour, I was so occupied that I could hardly hear how that lady from Ribeauvillé was doing. However, I fear that the maiden is not satisfied; if that is the case, I truly feel sorry for her, after having endured such great labors, not to receive even some relief for her efforts. Sultzer promises, and Stöllia also promises, that there is no danger of the maiden being left without a generous gift; I hoped the same and still hope so now.</p>
      <p>The fact that I did not write to the lady was indeed done deliberately. Stöllia asked me to inform her if I received any news from Zurich on this matter; therefore, upon receiving the letters from your son-in-law, which you wrote, I informed her, namely about the gift of cloth to the lady, to which she promised her efforts so that the gift would be received with a fair honorarium. However, shortly after, when this messenger delivered your letters to me, I received from him the prohibition that he should not approach Stöllia nor receive any letters from her.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I did not dare to inform Stöllia of the messenger's arrival nor to write to the lady, being certain that my supplicatory letters would not be pleasing to the lady without Stöllia's letters; for she had written to Stöllia a little earlier, asking what she should do in her name if she received anything from Zurich or if the cloth was returned. It would have been better if the maiden did not so greatly abhor Stöllia; for she was intent on ensuring that the maiden received a reward worthy of her labor. What she will receive, I do not know, and with the messenger hurrying, I can hardly investigate this amidst these business affairs. Therefore, I wish to be informed in the future; for if nothing has been given yet, the matter should nonetheless be attempted again by us. I have nothing new or certain to report at the moment.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the first of April, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely in the Lord, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and truly pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Church of Zurich, his venerable brother. Zurich.</p>
