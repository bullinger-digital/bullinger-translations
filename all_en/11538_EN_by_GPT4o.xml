    <p xml:id="regest1">Letters from Regensburg report [from the Imperial Diet] that, apart from a solemn Mass by the Catholics on April 3rd, little has happened. Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] and [Duke Ernst III of Brunswick-Lüneburg-Celle] are already present, while it is still unclear whether Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] will participate. From Augsburg, Blarer was informed of the title with which [Sultan Suleiman I] honored the French King [Francis I]. Fears dire consequences of the Turkish-French coalition.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, during dinner, I received letters from Regensburg, which indicate that nothing has been attempted yet, except that the adversaries sang a magnificent Mass of the Holy Spirit on April 3rd, just as they had done earlier in Worms, rather than addressing the cause of truth as intended.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave and the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg are present among our princes; it is unknown whether the Elector will come.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, among other things, I received a title with which the Turk honors the King of France, which I thought should also be sent to you: "To the illustrious and most honorable, Christian prince of princes, great and virtuous in all virtues, the most renowned in matters and practices of all peoples and races of the Messiah Jesus, especially a peacemaker and mediator of all discord among the Nazarenes, mighty, great and steadfast lord, worthy of all honor and foremost emperor of the realm of France, my good and powerful brother, may there always be luck and salvation; may it increase with a good end, etc."</p>
      <p>Indeed, if that most Christian king colludes with our most savage enemy in this manner, you can easily infer what we should expect from this.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us. April 11th, 1541.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
