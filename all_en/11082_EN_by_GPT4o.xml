    <p xml:id="regest1">His letter from Isny [No. 1024], where he was together with Bucer, was not forwarded in Constance due to Johannes Zwick's absence, and his deacon [Hans Salb], who wanted to deliver a second letter, had to abandon the journey due to illness; assuming that the first letter had arrived, Schuler waited impatiently for a response from Bullinger, in order to reconcile in friendship. He will visit as soon as his wife has given birth. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I wrote a few days ago, while I was in Isny together with our dearest brother Bucer, and I arranged for the letters to be delivered to you by Doctor Zwick. However, when my letters, which I had intended for you, reached Constance, Johannes Zwick was absent, which resulted in an unintended delay in reaching you. Meanwhile, the deacon of our Memmingen church, my fellow worker in the Lord, was about to leave for Constance and promised to visit your kindness on my behalf, to whom I also gave letters to deliver to you. But, intercepted by bodily illness, he was forced to abandon the journey and return to Memmingen from Zurich, where I was disappointed for the second time. But since I have convinced myself that my letters, which I wrote from Isny, have reached your hands, I urge you, incomparable friend, by the Lord, to respond with at least one word, so that if any spirits are covered with the rust of rarity and somewhat overcome, they may happily come together again, reclaimed from neglect.</p>
      <p>I have not yet completely given up on my visit (which I have attempted for the second time), indeed I have decided to visit you and your family. However, I am compelled to delay due to present necessity. For my wife, heavily pregnant, is about to give birth. But after she has given birth successfully, I will prepare myself for the journey. Pray to the Lord, my brother, that He may advance these my efforts with His spirit.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest brother, and continue to regard me with your former love. Greet in our name your beloved wife and mother, Leo Jud and Pellican. May the Spirit of the Lord always be with you.</p>
      <p>Given on September 9, in Memmingen, in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gervasius Scholasticus.</p>
      <p>To the man of great piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant leader of the Zurich church, teacher and brother to be especially revered.</p>
