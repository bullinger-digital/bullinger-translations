      <p>Greetings. At this hour, when the public courier brought your letters, the moment for sacred reading was pressing upon me, calling me away, so that it was not possible to respond to each of your points, much less to carry out what you desire, especially since shortly thereafter he was preparing to depart from our city. Although I was unaware that Göldi was nearby, I am certainly sorry that she does not get along well with her husband, who in my judgment is an excellent man; for I have learned from him in person that there is some controversy between them. Therefore, I will seriously do what is within my power, and whatever I accomplish or do not accomplish, I will inform you by letter at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>From our envoys, I could learn nothing sufficiently, except that a friend briefly reported that it seemed to him little had been achieved, and unless my mind deceives me, they are cautious, as much as they can, to prevent us from finding out. Therefore, my brother, I earnestly pray you to diligently inform me about the whole matter.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I will not cease, along with the brothers and our church, to commend the cause of the afflicted brothers to the Lord, as you piously advise. But also the perilous state of our Germany, unless the Lord protects it with a mighty hand, seems to be subject to extreme calamities.</p>
      <p>You receive Constantinus Balduini, and regarding Göldi, while I was writing this, I rushed to her and indeed, as much as was possible in great haste, I understood that the complaints between those spouses are not of great importance, which seem to be easily healed, and if indeed the excellent man would like to come here, I will gladly and diligently and faithfully offer my assistance. But if, as I urge, she does not refuse, let her come to you, you will find a way of reconciliation; for she will not reluctantly comply with your advice, which she greatly values, as she rightly should. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours.</p>
      <p>Oporinus did not respond about your copy, whom I could not meet in this haste. Basel, December 18, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
