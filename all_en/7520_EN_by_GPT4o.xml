      <p>Greetings. You indeed instructed me, most esteemed lord, to reply through the messenger you mentioned in your letter written on June 25th; however, these letters were delivered to me at my castle in Bocksberg. I am now writing through this messenger of mine. You will understand what is happening with us from the attached note. I am waiting to see what the people of Milan will respond to the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>The young man you recommended to me in your previous letter written on June 11th, I will genuinely assist as much as I can. I agree with you that Belgium, which has long been soaked with the blood of the saints and intoxicated with all kinds of allurements and luxury, is now being purified by the fire of the Lord. I fear that the same may happen to us someday, as we have deserved no less. I will not deny that the Antichrist will somehow endure until the judgment; however, I am confident, in my judgment, that he will be completely overthrown from his seat before that day, which we hope will come soon, as many evident signs indicate. To omit the sacred, I have noticed the predictions of many papists that suggest this; it can also be observed from both sacred and profane histories that nations have had their fates predicted by their own (not without the will of the true deity). I thank you for being concerned about my son, and I indeed change my plan to send him to Geneva for a time.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given on July 2nd, in the year 68, in Bocksberg.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten. To the reverend, pious, and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
