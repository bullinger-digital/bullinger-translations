    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Birck received a letter of recommendation for Johannes Haller from almost every church and school leader in Zurich, who is such a valuable person! Hopefully, Birck did not disappoint the expectations of the people of Zurich, as he did not treat Haller as honorably as he should have, partly because he is not capable of dealing with people according to their dignity, and partly because in a true friendship, displays of honor are not appropriate. It is certain that Haller has become a friend to him as one of the most venerable people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is Birck's duty to recommend Haller back to the people of Zurich and, at Haller's request, to evaluate his way of life in Augsburg not only in his capacity as a supervisor but also as someone who knows Haller through and through. But unfortunately, due to the many tasks at school and Haller's sudden departure, Birck cannot devote much time to this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Haller's honesty and impeccable way of life (not to mention his other virtues bestowed by God) make any recommendation unnecessary. And if the people of Zurich had not been convinced of this, they would never have sent him to Augsburg! The most esteemed men are deeply saddened by his departure. As a result, the Augsburg church suffers a great loss, especially in these times of decay. Many people are shaken by this, while the enemies of Christ rejoice and the devil dances with joy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Birck hopes that the people of Zurich take this testimony seriously and do not underestimate it because of the friendship that has developed between him and Haller. Haller's good reputation is also highlighted by the authorities and their writings, as well as by all outstanding men.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Birck counts on Haller to prepare a refuge for him in Zurich if necessary.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings. For Haller's sake, may the people of Zurich remain favorable to Birck!</p>

      <p>Greetings. Almost every one of you, most excellent men, has recommended our Haller to me, who is more precious than many talents of gold. I hope that I have met your expectations of me! I confess, indeed, that I did not treat him as honorably as was fitting, either because I do not know how to treat people according to their dignity or because familiarity tends to exclude honors, which are enemies of true friendship. Certainly, I have embraced him in my heart as one of the most worthy individuals.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Duty required that I, in turn, recommend him to each of you or, as he himself requested, provide testimony of his life spent with us, as I have been not only an observer of his actions but, due to the familiarity that existed between us, an insider, so to speak. But because he announced his departure sooner than expected, I write to all of you as the academic noise permits.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>His innocence and sanctity of life (I remain silent about the other virtues lavishly bestowed upon him by God) are more evident than to require my testimony before you, whose integrity, unless it had been sufficiently observed by you, would never have led you to send him to us. He departs not without great sorrow among the best of men, not without great loss to our church in these ruins, not without the offense of many, not without the joy of the enemies of Christ, not without the devil's jubilation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I hope my testimony carries some weight with you, not because I love him (for here suspicion might arise), but because it is joined with public testimony; "public," I say, not only because it is written to you but because it resides in the hearts of the best men, who expected nothing less than his departure.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I send him ahead to you, so that he may also prepare a place of refuge for me among you, should the occasion arise.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell, most excellent men, and continue to favor Xystus for Haller's sake. Farewell, I say, in the Lord. October 3, 1547. Your most devoted X. Betul.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, Lords Heinrich Bullinger and the other leaders of the Zurich church and the school there, his most esteemed lords and friends.</p>
