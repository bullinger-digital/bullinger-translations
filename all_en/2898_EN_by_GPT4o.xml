      <p>As my singular love and perpetual respect for you, which I have always pursued for the sake of religion, and your incredible kindness towards me, which I have observed in many ways when I was in Zürich, (most learned Bullinger), have led me to send this letter, the most certain pledge of my affection towards you, and as if sealed tablets of my perpetual love for you, which I wanted to exist, to this young man to give to you: in which I thank you for your kindness, and also promise to repay you, if I can ever do anything to gratify you. And I wish you to accept these words from me, not like those people today who introduce a certain appearance of words and a form of duty, more so to seem than to be what they profess; but rather as having proceeded from a sincere and entirely devoted heart, you may be most certain. Therefore, if I can ever do anything for your sake (which I know is very little), whatever it will be, it will be entirely yours. But enough, and perhaps more than enough, about this; especially since it is still my intention (if nothing else intervenes, which might divert my intended journey elsewhere), to visit you on my way back to England, where I will confirm in person what I can only declare here in bare words. The young man who carries this letter informed me of the death of Konrad Pellikan (whom I name out of respect); which, as I heard, I took very seriously and grievously, not so much for his own sake as for the sake of the whole church. For he completed the course of this life most gloriously in cares, vigils, constant studies, and promoting learned men; and finally, by dying, as he lived, he was transferred to a better life in heaven: but the church will greatly miss such an accomplished man for many reasons. Therefore, as I rejoice for his sake, I cannot help but grieve greatly for the church's loss. But I hope and wish that your presence will easily mitigate the cause of this sadness, whom may the best and greatest God keep safe for a long time for the church and all good people through His mercy.</p>
      <p>In Venice, 6th day before the calends of May, Your most devoted, F. Bedford.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Master Bullinger, distinguished professor of sacred theology, in Zürich, let the letters be delivered.</p>
      <p>Letters of the most illustrious prince, Lord Francis Russell, Earl of Bedford, Englishman, written from the city of the Venetians in the month of May in the year 1556.</p>
