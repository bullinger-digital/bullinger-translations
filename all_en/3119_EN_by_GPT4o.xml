      <p>Greetings. When our Zwingli was recently with us, I did not have enough leisure to write to you as I would have liked, as he himself could have told you. Therefore, I returned your sermons on the Apocalypse only with a hurried letter; but he could be a faithful reporter of those things which I could not write, since I recounted to him everything that needed to be written.</p>
      <p>I was greatly troubled by that shameless and unworthy rejection of such a great work; but you, in your wisdom, rightly interpret this action in a better light. Perhaps our city is unworthy of this honor; I hope it does not also become unworthy of this doctrine!</p>
      <p>I did not change the number of sermons nor did I add from that Savoyard's work on the number of the beast as you wished; for I did not have all the parts at hand and I was going to do this for a book already destined for the press. Meanwhile, I wrote nothing, partly because there were no messengers, partly because I had nothing worthy of you except this one thing, that at one time it almost came to pass that a disagreement with the Genevans erupted into a great and serious tumult. But we worked faithfully both publicly and privately, so that by the grace of the Lord, the minds of some, who were very agitated by the response of the Genevans themselves, were beautifully calmed. I hope for more peaceful and calm counsels in the future. If anyone were to press again, I would hope our people would not reject fair conditions, provided the Genevans were not obstinate either.</p>
      <p>Lord Haller, the treasurer and my neighbor, sends you many greetings and kindly asks that you write either to him or to me about a certain surgeon from Locarno, whom he hears is in Zürich and who is highly recommended to him for his piety and also for his art, and among other things, because he has helped some gout sufferers to the extent that they can at least stand or walk around the table. If this could also happen to him, he would certainly consider it a great benefit from the Lord; for he is perpetually sedentary and not infrequently entirely bedridden. The whole force of his ailment revolves around his knees; he cannot stand on them, and his right knee is more swollen than the left. He hears that this surgeon has not been unsuccessful in Lucerne with some such cases. I therefore ask you to speak with him about this matter, and if he knows your testimony about him and his judgment in some way, he will summon him to himself at his own expense and will not dismiss him without a fee, even if he achieves nothing. Therefore, let this matter be diligently commended to you in his name, and please ensure that we have a response soon, so that I do not appear to have neglected anything here. Farewell. February 24, 1557.</p>
      <p>My mother, wife, and entire household, as well as the Musculus family and the family of Treasurer Haller, send their greetings to you, your wife, and your entire household.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot. M. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
