      <p>Greetings. I am again sending two gatherings, t and u, through these good Italian men, who also greeted me very amicably in your name and in the name of our Theodor. Shortly, if the Lord wills, we are about to put the final hand to the entire work, which indeed I would have liked to be more extensive; but it pleased Euclio Froschauer to use a smaller typeface, so that it would be completed with fewer pages and so that I (if it pleases the gods), if I had used a larger typeface, would not become rich from it, indeed he seriously also enjoined that I should not print more than one thousand one hundred copies, when, if he had wanted even two thousand to be printed, I think they could have been easily distributed. But such is the nature of the man. I, for my part, do what I can at present, would that I could do better, and that more for your sake than for his, to whom I desire to serve with all the zeal and effort that is in me. Farewell well and please do not forget Theoderych of Nice in the favor of our Basel. He sends you his most dutiful greetings. Again, farewell with our friends and brothers and with all the fathers.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 1, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the best and most learned pastor of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
