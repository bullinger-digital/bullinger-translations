<letter xml:id="file7721"><body><div><p>Christ, our Lord and Savior, may He ensure that this year begins for you and all yours with happy omens and ends most happily! Your letters have been delivered to me, beloved brother, from which I understand that many lies are being spread among you just as among us. I have not received any letters for several days now, neither from Geneva nor Bern nor Neuch√¢tel or Biel; everything is persistently silent. Therefore, I have nothing to write about the affairs of France. However, what has been sent to me from Nuremberg* through a most excellent man, I share with you, having been put into writing, and these are confirmed by other letters brought from elsewhere; but we will await the messenger, who is said to be limping. You will offer all my services to the lords consuls, Mr. Charles, Ganthner, Pontisella, to whom I wish a most happy year. If anything is brought to me, I will faithfully share it at another time.</p><p>Farewell now together with all good people.</p><p>A sad rumor has been brought here that the son of Mr. Ambrosius Martini, the consul, has died at the Rhine Falls, who not long ago married the daughter of Stucki, who is the governor at the castle at the Rhine Falls (in Laufen); they say he died at his father-in-law's place. However, I would not want to spread this as an indication from me; if it is true, it will be announced to the parent by the father-in-law.</p><p>Farewell again and again.</p><p>Zurich, the last day of December in the year 1569 after Christ's birth.</p><p>Your Bullinger.</p><p>Since it is so very quiet, I suspect the harbor will soon be bustling with activity.</p><p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, esteemed lord and beloved brother.</p><p>Chur.</p></div></body> Note: Proper nouns have been translated into their modern German equivalents where applicable.</letter>
