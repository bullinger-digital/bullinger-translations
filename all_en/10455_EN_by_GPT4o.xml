      <p>Grace and peace from God, our heavenly Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Knowing, my dear lord and brother, I have been asked by some Christian people, who have a pious daughter to marry off, to write to you for friendly advice in this matter. Specifically, there is someone interested in this daughter, who is from the Hünenberg family and is from Baden. We have heard that he has recently been in Zurich for some time because he is said to be a Lutheran, as the enemies of God say. Now, we have no other knowledge of this person except that he is a respectable person. Therefore, I would like to ask you, as a trusted friend, if you know this person, to let me know. You shall not be mentioned in good faith, as I currently do not know anyone more trustworthy in Zurich to write to. Therefore, please act according to my request. If I can repay you, you will find me willing.</p>
      <p>Then my ward sends her son to Zurich with the bearer of this letter. I would like to ask you in particular to keep an eye on him so that he may be raised in discipline and learning. This shall be rewarded. And regarding the aforementioned matter, if possible, please let me know your answer through this messenger, etc. Then I would like to ask you to greet Anna Zwingli warmly and tell her that her son Wilhelm is well and healthy. He continues to attend school, and although he is quite childish, he does enough for his age in terms of learning. He is very dear to me and my wife because of his pious father, who, after God, cannot be removed from my heart, etc.</p>
      <p>Nothing more, may God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, on Tuesday after St. James' Day in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Your always willing</p>
      <p>Lienhard Tremp.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my especially dear lord and brother, to his hands.</p>
