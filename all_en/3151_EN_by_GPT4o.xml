      <p>Greetings. I could neither hide from your humanity, most esteemed Bullinger, nor should I have, that since the last autumn fair, my health, which was previously afflicted, has become much worse. For whereas before I could somewhat manage to crawl through the house leaning on a staff, today I can barely crawl from the table to the nearby bed.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I am deeply grieved that I cannot engage in reading with the same eagerness (as I have been accustomed to until now) because my eyes are gradually failing and my hands, if there is anything to note in the meantime, are beginning to tremble more and more. From this, I clearly understand that the day is not far off when the Lord will call me from here. I hope with true faith, this is the one thing I pray to the Lord for daily and almost every hour, and there is nothing I would wish to be done for me more than by you, in whom I have placed my greatest trust in this regard, and then by your colleagues, the best and most holy men, if this should happen, with your prayers interceding with God along with mine, for in this part I will not be allowed to be idle or lazy myself (whose matter is at hand), I will be happy three and four times over, as I will rejoice eternally with Christ and all the blessed.</p>
      <p>The second matter, which I cannot help but complain about to you, who undoubtedly desires my salvation, is that you assist me with your counsel as I am in danger. My wife, poorly persuaded by her maternal friends who covet her fortunes, is beginning to become more disobedient to me; for the more I need her help and care in this age, indeed in this health, the more negligent she becomes in fulfilling her due duty each day, which is very troublesome to me and makes me, already quite irritable due to age, even more irritable, and more impatient in enduring my health. Because of this, the thought often crosses my mind whether I should make her the heir of all my goods, which I acquired through my industry and labors during our marriage, both among the purchases and the temporary pensions at Basel and with you for the days of each of us. And indeed, unless she returns to her former ways towards me and her due duty, having dismissed her maternal friends, that thought will likely prevail in my mind, yet in such a way that everything she brought into the marriage will remain intact for her and much more, as they have been improved by me in the meantime. I write this to you, whom I do not doubt is affected by my troubles as if they were your own. You will give advice, intercede with your prayers for me with the Lord, that He may either grant me greater patience or restore to my wife her former, that is, a sounder and more obedient mind.</p>
      <p>Now to your letters. You amplify with words the benefits (as you call them) I have bestowed upon your church; I, however, know of none that I would not have preferred to double, had it not been for the exactions, and those very frequent ones, which are continually imposed upon us miserable ones who are subject to the empire. Just as today, almost intolerable exactions have been imposed upon us at Regensburg to be paid within a few days. Add, as you yourself write, the dearness of all provisions spreading almost throughout Germany, especially in the lower parts of the Rhine, which are hereditary to the Emperor, about which many report astonishing things, not to mention in the meantime (which I indeed mention unwillingly, especially to you) the obstinate mind of my wife in this matter, persuaded by her maternal relatives coveting her fortunes, indeed, so that they even attempt to make trouble for me in my affairs, but in vain, as I hope. I had decided to transfer the houses, which I have here quite magnificent, to your church by testamentary right. Here they oppose me with all their might, because the said houses came to me from my wife, but so..., that I could not inhabit them comfortably; I was therefore forced to spend over a thousand Rhenish gold coins on their improvement. I have no mind to give this to them, or rather to her relatives. But enough of these matters for now, perhaps more at another time, with my wife in the meantime, as I would wish, returning to a better mind.</p>
      <p>I greatly rejoice in the tranquility and pious studies of your school, church, and entire republic, and for that reason, I give thanks to the Lord and pray that this happiness may be perpetual for you. As for what you write about your strength gradually being broken by frequent labors, who can wonder, knowing your labors? Within a few years, you have written so many books in pious matters for the glory of Christ, that you almost equal the labors of Saint Aurelius Augustine, which are nevertheless scarcely countable. Strengths... are not given to the human race; therefore, as in other matters, so also in the labors of the mind, a higher measure must be maintained. Therefore, preserve yourself for your children and all who venerate and love the glory of Christ propagated far and wide through you and your like.</p>
      <p>You have written sermons on the Apocalypse. This book will wonderfully increase your already considerable fame. For scarcely any other book has greater difficulties that exercise men more. You are then about to turn to Jeremiah, a prophet entirely lovable, and you promise to dedicate those labors to me. You heard me once writing to you about this matter, that I am unworthy of such an honor and for that reason, it is more in my wishes that you pour out your most holy prayers to the Lord for poor me, that He may grant me a happy departure from here. But lest I seem to have held the judgments of good men who once thought honorably of me with little reverence, I leave the decision of this matter to you. You will do as you wish.</p>
      <p>As for what you write about the war raging in Italy between the Emperor, the Pope, and his ally the King of France, I am not surprised.</p>
      <p>For among the signs that the last day is approaching, Christ predicts that nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. We Germans (I speak of those who are subject to the empire) have experienced similar things several times within a few years, and the end is not yet; for that reason, exactions have again been imposed upon us at Regensburg, intolerable.</p>
      <p>Regarding the colloquy, which is again promised there to be held at Worms at the beginning of June, I have little else to write than that I fear it is a trick by which the orders of the empire are deceived until both the Emperor and King Ferdinand consult their affairs to our disadvantage, skin and exhaust miserable Germany, exhausted (may God avert the evil omen) and finally send it under the Spanish yoke. These are my thoughts on your letters, excellent Bullinger, more than I intended due to my trembling hands. It remains for me to wish you and all yours, your wife, children, sons-in-law to be happily well in Christ, and to wish all of you and indeed all your colleagues, who preach Christ with you in Zürich and teach in schools and propagate His glory through writings around the world, a long life for the consolation of many, who are daily edified there in the doctrine of salvation, amen. Again, may you all be happily well in Christ.</p>
      <p>From Worms, the Lutheropapist city, 17th April in the year 57. The most observant and perpetual worshiper of Bullinger, if anyone else, Wolfgang Waidner.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and adorned man and lord, Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and faithful minister of the primary church of Zürich, the dearest lord and friend, and in spirit a father to be greatly esteemed.</p>
