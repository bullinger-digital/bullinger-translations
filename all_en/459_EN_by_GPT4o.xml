      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I rejoice that you continue excellently in the homilies, which contain the principal places about which there is now controversy. May the Spirit of the Lord make you eager, so that you may bring such a holy work to completion.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg has accepted the papacy. The bishop, with a new mandate, promises much and tries to establish the reformation of the priests, which he will never complete. The senate publicly orders that no one should eat meat on prohibited days, approves fasts, and mandates feast days, inventing trivial reasons. But they did not ask the counsel of the Lord. Now we will see what the preachers have accomplished with that church, which has been inundated with sects. Now all are failing, and few, both from the common people and the ministers of the word, are steadfast in asserting the truth of Christ.</p>
      <p>Philip, the King of Spain, is in Heidelberg and entered on Ash Wednesday with great pomp. Nobles from everywhere gathered in Heidelberg to receive the Spaniard coming with the Palatines. Mention was made of the Landgrave and the Elector, who responded, "Philip will see Philip, the disturber of Germany. The old Elector is not yet known to me, whom my father loves, whom I also love for his constancy." Various things are said about his pride and arrogance. When he rode into Milan, the Milanese councilors fell before him, receiving him in the usual manner. He had them lie long before him; his councilors advised him to tell them to rise and in this matter to imitate his parent Charles.</p>
      <p>He soon said, "I am worthy of greater honor than my parent, because I am born of a king, my parent of a prince." We have a rich citizen among us; he has a son who is full of mischief and engages in all sorts of wickedness. To this, his father said, "Dear one, how can you manage the household like this? You waste it wantonly; follow me, have a household like mine." He replied, "Oh dear father, if you had had such a rich father as I have, you would have lived very differently."</p>
      <p>The Duke of Brunswick is in great armor. A peasant is said to have prophesied to him thus: "When the duke begins something, he will be slain, and all his people will be driven out of the land and never return, and they will be perpetual exiles." This peasant had previously predicted his captivity and disgraceful surrender. This peasant is under the one from LÃ¼neburg. This story reached the duke, who sent for the peasant, giving him a safe conduct to come to him.</p>
      <p>The peasant comes, is questioned; the peasant says what he had spoken before. Then the duke said, "Dear one, who told you this, and how can you know it?" The peasant said, "To know that I know your end, know this: you have a prisoner in a tower, whom no one knows but you and a servant. He escaped last night" (he was a Saxon knight). The duke quickly sent a messenger to the castle to inquire about the prisoner. The answer was, "Well." The servant wanted to speak with him. The tower was opened, the prisoner was no longer there, and no one knows where he has gone. Then the duke said, "May the hand of God strike you!</p>
      <p>If I had not given you a safe conduct, I would have found out from you who told you such things." Would that enemy of Christ perish.</p>
      <p>In Wittenberg, in the castle, Maurice has set a bailiff. He stayed there for exactly four days, then had to leave again, such a tumultuous thing, a tumult was there day and night.</p>
      <p>Why do you write nothing about Thomas? He has taken another wife among us, and if he had not fled, he would not have escaped the danger of death. You would not believe what a devil he was and a notorious deceiver. Beware of him, lest your church contract any stain.</p>
      <p>About Michael, the preacher of Speyer, an Augustinian monk, he is acting among us. Bucer and Fagius, with the deacon, have been ordered to leave the main church; perhaps Bucer will come to us or go to England.</p>
      <p>What will our Swiss do in these troubles? Write back whether Musculus is in Bern or not. Sulcerus has been elected as the pastor of the Petrine church, but not yet confirmed; they want to test him for a year to see if he is acceptable to the people or not. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 2, 1549. Greet all the brothers and lords in my name. Yours, Gastius.</p>
