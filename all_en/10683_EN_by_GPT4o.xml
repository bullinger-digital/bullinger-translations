    <p xml:id="regest1">Is healthy and rejoices over Bullinger's well-being. It was confirmed from Venice that the Emperor has conquered Tunis; [Khayr al-Din] has, however, escaped. An epidemic is claiming many lives in St. Gallen - as apparently also in Zurich. Has sympathy for the emasculated priests. Mayor [Eberhard Zangmeister] from Memmingen places great hopes on the [Schmalkaldic] League after the Esslingen City Day. The two Zurich trumpeters have been turned away by Vadian; many disapprove of the unauthorized begging. Wishes Bullinger's house to be spared from adversity. Has heard that [Konrad] Pellikan and Leo [Jud] will soon come to St. Gallen. Bullinger can send new news with Hans [...]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>God with us through His Son. Amen etc.</p>
      <p>My lord and brother, knowing of our health, which we, if it is God's will, gladly hear of with all our heart etc.</p>
      <p>My lord doctor, we do not know anything particularly new, except that the fifteenth merchant here (as you might already know) has received letters from Venice and another place, which he now believes more than before, that the imperial majesty has conquered Tunis. Namely: When he set out, the enemies wanted to seek him, he went to an island, conquered it, where Barbarossa himself was located. From that island, much damage occurred at sea, many ships were there, making it hard to approach. When Barbarossa saw that the situation was lost, he used a trick (note that he was not in the battle), took about 400 horses and escaped. What has happened since then, I do not know, or what is to be believed etc.</p>
      <p>Also, here in St. Gallen, the disease is affecting many, the council is harmed and knows, many children die, also women, few men. May God comfort all and turn all evil from us to His praise. Amen.</p>
      <p>Also, much talk about how fast people are dying there with you, some days 40 people, which I do not believe.</p>
      <p>Also, I pity the priests, whose testicles are cut out; they were monks.</p>
      <p>Also, as my lord doctor, a mayor from Memmingen, who was here at a wedding, asked that day halfway to Esslingen of the cities, he should answer him much good, with attention, in silence, that their league, if God wills, will grow fast etc. Other pious ones will also not be forgotten.</p>
      <p>Also, the two trumpeters of yours were here, they would have liked to have work. (Stücheler was quite a speaker.) To him, my Bern doctor replied, he had some, whom he would like to have with him, not there. Thus refused. Many have a dislike for begging, where it does not happen by order or sending of your authority. Also, the matter, the great one has cried, his wife lies dead sick. My gracious lords have allowed him to go away, I do not know etc. But one could well know. Thus, Stücheler accompanied them with the drum with few back to the city.</p>
      <p>My wife and I greet your whole house and earnestly pray to God that He will protect you from spiritual and bodily pestilence according to His will. He will do that.</p>
      <p>Lastly, if Pellican and Master Leo want to come here soon, as my lord doctor told me in secret.</p>
      <p>If you have will or new news, write back to us by Zöger, the good Hans. I would like him to settle in Zurich, as I somewhat suspect.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, quickly, on Monday before Zurich's fair in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler. Greet my lord Rösten, Master Kaspar, Hans Müller, Rordorffer, yes if you have the time.</p>
      <p>To my especially beloved lord and friend M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher [in Zurich].</p>
