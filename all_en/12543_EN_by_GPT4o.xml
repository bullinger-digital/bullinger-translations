    <p xml:id="regest1">On Friday, July 9, the young [Hans Rych] from Rapperswil delivered a letter written by [Johannes] Haller on July 1 [correct: May 31] from Augsburg [HBBW XVI, No. 2451]. He explained the late delivery with business matters and a several-day stay in Rapperswil. He had worked in Augsburg for a long time and is now in the service of the Augsburg captain [Hans] Sigmund von Plieningen. He also spoke of [Johannes] Haller, [Hans Wilpert] Zoller, and [Georg] Frölich, so Bullinger trusted him and took care of him until Saturday noon due to his limited funds. When [Rych] declared his intention to return to Augsburg, Bullinger gave him letters to Blarer [No. 2493] and Haller [No. 2494], which he would have otherwise sent with his own messenger. Now Bullinger has learned that [Rych] has set off again towards Rapperswil, perhaps to continue traveling to Konstanz from there. Bullinger is worried that he might have entrusted confidential letters to an unreliable person. Therefore, Blarer should report immediately when he receives the letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- For his letter to Blarer, Bullinger used three writings: 1) A list with information about the imperial army, which the Zurich messenger [Marx Schultheß] sent from Milan after being sent to Lugano for the annual account; 2) a letter with news about the plan of the Nine Places to send a letter from Baden to Konstanz to take away the [Swiss] mercenaries from the [Schmalkaldic League]; 3) a letter from the Zurich council with its decision on the advance of the Nine Places. Bullinger only hopes that his letters do not fall into unfaithful hands and cause problems for others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger then addresses Blarer's letter from July 7 [No. 2489], which [Konrad] Hofherr delivered the previous day, as well as the letter just delivered by Heinrich Stapfer on July 9 [No. 2492].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- If Count Palatine [Friedrich II.] has offered himself as a mediator [between Emperor Charles V and the Schmalkaldic League], Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria will support him. Bullinger fears that this way too much leeway is given to the Antichrist, where it would be much more appropriate to march against Trent and Rome to finally clean up the nest of snakes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Johann von] Naves is just like [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle a rogue. God will punish them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger regrets that [the Schmalkaldic League hastily] accepted inexperienced captains and young soldiers [from the Confederation]. As a result, the brave [Zurich] mercenaries, who arrived too late and of whom 1000 would have been more suitable than 3000 of the first recruits, unfortunately had to turn back. May the Lord grant [the Schmalkaldic League] strength and wisdom against the Italians and Spaniards! For they will certainly want to attack at night, as can be expected from the Count of Musso [Gian Giacomo de’ Medici]. Blarer should let Bullinger know where [the Schmalkaldic troops] are moving from Kempten.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The people of Nuremberg have a preacher [Andreas Osiander] dressed in silk and a gospel [assigning a salvific role to works]. Bullinger has never trusted them. They are like Ananias and Sapphira!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The Spanish practices [of Emperor Charles V], who wanted to incite Duke Ulrich [of Württemberg] against the cities, are not surprising. Bullinger has already written to Blarer about how the Emperor persuaded Italy. No one is more hostile to the Confederates than the Emperor, even if he temporarily appeases them with friendly words [until the attack].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [Konrad Zwick] should only use his [military] skills when necessary. Blarer should greet him and [Thomas Blarer].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- [The offer of mercenaries] from the people of Uri is a serious matter, but if mercenaries are still needed, they should gather outside of Konstanz. Moreover, only good soldiers should be recruited.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- It is good that Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] is moving to southern Germany [against the imperial troops]. However, the North Germans should keep an eye on the imperial Brabant! Blarer should report where the Landgrave and Duke Ulrich are and how things stand in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Bullinger is pleased that the Confederates are so brave. May they prove themselves likewise in the proper combat actions! Blarer should tell K[onrad] Z[wick] that his humorous nature is well known to him and he will reciprocate!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Bullinger does not yet know the status of the [recall demanded by the Nine Places] of the Swiss mercenaries already joined to the Schmalkaldic League. The Zurich council rejected such a recall and instructed its envoys [Itelhans Thumysen and Johannes Haab at the Baden Diet] to dissuade the [Places] from it. Bullinger had written extensively about this in the letter [No. 2493] he entrusted to [Hans Rych], the servant of Plieningen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- The envoys [of the Schmalkaldic League] from Württemberg [Hans Herter von Hertneck], Strasbourg [Heinrich von Müllenheim], and Konstanz [Ulrich Hochrütiner] were heard on July 10. However, Bullinger has not yet learned about the response given to them [by the Confederates].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Blarer should write often and provide detailed information. He should inquire with the Konstanz city clerk [Jörg Vögeli the Elder] about when he will write [to Zurich] on behalf of his council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- If possible, Blarer should urge that all Swiss mercenaries remain in one troop under one captain and that strict discipline and order prevail in the army.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc. On Friday, July 9, a young fellow came to my house. He brought me a letter from Augsburg from Haller, dated June 1. Therefore, I asked how this came about. He replied: "I was on the road for my business and also stayed for several days in Rapperswil, where I am from. I served in Augsburg for a long time. I am now with Sigmund von Plieningen, captain of the city of Augsburg," etc. He told me various things about Haller, Zoller, and Laetus, which I trusted. However, he showed that he had little money for food. I provided for him until Saturday noon. Then, as he indicated that he wanted to return to Augsburg immediately, I gave him letters to you and to Haller. I wanted to send them with my own messenger. But as he said he was ready and gave such good signs, I trusted him. After he left, I heard today that he is back in Rapperswil; perhaps he wants to go to Konstanz. However, I am in fear and worry. I do not know what to think, whether he might be unfaithful. And if so, and you have not received any letter from him, the matter would be strange and distressing to me, as I wrote to you and Haller very confidentially. If you have received it, I kindly ask you to inform me soon, so that I may be relieved from anxiety and doubt.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have included three writings for you: one is the list of the imperial army, sent to us from Milan by our messenger on the annual account to Lugano; the second, how the Nine Places acted in Baden and wrote to you and refused the mercenaries, etc., as you should not give them anything, for it is the pensioner's trick, and much that was reported to me; the third writing, what my lords, council, and citizens have recognized about it. If all this falls into unfaithful hands, much mischief will be born. However, I entrust it to God. I will answer for it personally, as long as no further displeasure arises from it for other people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Now I answer you regarding the letters I received from you yesterday through Curionem and today from Heinrich Stapfer, one dated July 7, the other July 9.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>If the Count Palatine has offered himself as a mediator, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria will support him, and I fear a foul settlement, giving the Antichrist much leeway, where it would be much more appropriate, if God grants grace now, to march with the army to Trent and Rome and finally remove the nest of snakes. However, God may show us something else for our preservation. His will be done at all times!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Naves is as guilty as Granvelle, and both are wicked rogues and bloody villains, whom God will punish.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We regret that the matter has turned out this way, that you have accepted young and inexperienced captains, and initially paid all who came, even young boys. The insignificant crowd all ran away. Our people, quite handsome and brave mercenaries, came later. They came too late and had to return home. And yet, 1000 of such experienced people would be worth more to you than those 3000. However, the heart is from God, and strength and wisdom will be given by the Lord. May He strengthen them and grant them to be manly and prudent, for against the Italians and Spaniards it will be necessary. They are quick and dangerous, but they will again try to surprise ours by night and unawares. The one from Musso knows the art. Therefore, be careful. You have more than enough people, if luck and fortune are with you. If not, then too many. Let me know where they are moving from Kempten.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Nurembergers have a silk preacher and a mercantile gospel. May God grant them grace, for I have never trusted them to be brave. However, if it succeeds, they will adjust and insinuate themselves so that they become the foremost. They think they can come out of the tournament unscathed. O Ananias and Sapphira, how have you left such a beautiful art behind you!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Spanish practices are not new to me. Be careful, he does not only deal between Duke Ulrich and the cities, but also among the cities. I have written to you before how he overcame Italy. He is more hostile to us Confederates than any other people. Yet he gives such good words, as if he were our best friend! Ad tempus, until he can do better, etc.! Therefore, be cautious and pray to God especially that He protects us from treachery.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>May God grant your cousin, my dear lord, that he uses his art well and at the right time, or else carries it under the hearth with himself, for otherwise there is enough misery and evil arts. But in the time of need, let him bring forth what he can. And greet him and your brother very kindly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>With the people of Uri, it is a matter of opinion, but if you need it, you must determine another place where one can gather. It must not necessarily be Konstanz. And if you need more mercenaries, look beforehand for honest captains, and do not accept just anyone!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>That the Landgrave is moving up pleases me. Now the others have good care and look to the Emperor in his Brabant. Dear, let me know where the Landgrave is now, where Duke Ulrich is, and how things are going in Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>That the Confederates are holding out so bravely pleases me. May God grant them that they also act so in the main and field battles and have strength from God! Tell my gracious lord C[onrad] Z[wick], I know well his jokes and tricks. I will see how I repay him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>With the recall, I do not yet know how it stands. My lords, council, and citizens recognized last Saturday not to recall, and wrote to their envoys to ensure that the Confederates stand still on the recall. I have written all this in detail in the letter sent by Sigmund von Plieningen's servant, and reported how and why my lords stopped the march of the mercenaries. Truly, it has become known to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Your envoys, Württemberg, Strasbourg, Konstanz, were heard in Baden last Saturday. But I do not yet know what the answer was.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>At this time, I have nothing further to write, except that I kindly ask you to write to me often and report to me in detail at all times, especially if something significant happens, of which you have good grounds. Make your acquaintance with the city clerk, so that if he wants to write on behalf of your lords, he informs you. You know and can do well by him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>God be with you. Dated Zurich, July 12, at 9 o'clock before noon, in the year 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Dear, if you can advise and help that the Confederates have their own troop and all are together under your one, the chief captain, then do it and be at it. And not only they, but the whole army should have order and Christian discipline, etc. You know well what that brings.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, preacher in Konstanz, his beloved lord and brother.</p>
