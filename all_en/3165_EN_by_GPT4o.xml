      <p>My friendly greetings along with all the love and good I can offer to you, gracious, dear brother-in-law. As I once again write to you regarding the matter, which you are well aware of, and await your response, I would kindly ask you to provide and send me the same (if it is genuine) with this messenger, my gracious lord's courier. If you sense that they are not as willing and eager as we would like, you need not be too forceful with them or trouble them too much about it. You have the authority to handle it according to your good judgment.</p>
      <p>Awaiting your good response and commending you to God. Greet my sister and all your family for me.</p>
      <p>Dated April 28, 1557. Your inclined and well-wishing brother-in-law, Samuel Zehnder.</p>
      <p>To the highly esteemed, prudent, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the holy word in Zurich, my gracious, dear brother-in-law, to be delivered. Zurich.</p>
