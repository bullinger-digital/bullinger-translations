      <p>Grace and peace from God, our heavenly Father, be with us all.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, since the position and preaching at Rüti are still not provided for and perhaps our lords unfortunately do not have as many suitable men at the moment, as I have been informed - may the merciful God continue to provide for us so that we do not become deficient in His word and other necessary things -, now, dear Master Heinrich, there is a good, pious man, a former bailiff named Heinrich Dürst or Heinrich Michel, who was once a chaplain in Wetzikon, has many small children, has held school this winter and proclaimed the divine word every Sunday in Ötwil. I have inquired about his conduct and life for myself and have truly found nothing but all righteousness. Since he has so many small children and also great poverty, it would be my diligent request, if he seems suitable to you, that you might grant him a position in God's word, so that he might better raise his small children. With a friendly request, you will not take offense at my unskilled writing and understand it in the best sense, as it truly happens.</p>
      <p>With this, may our heavenly Father protect you with His grace as His faithful servant.</p>
      <p>Dated Wednesday in Holy Week in '36.</p>
      <p>Hans Bleuler, currently bailiff in Grüningen, your willing servant at all times.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich at the Great Minster, my dear and good patron, in his hand.</p>
