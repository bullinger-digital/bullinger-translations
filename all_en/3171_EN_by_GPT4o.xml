      <p>Greetings. You are doing the right thing, my dearest Bullinger, in that you so ardently and promptly take up the care of the afflicted brothers in the Lord; this is a worthy occupation for all who profess Christ, and you have surely learned from your people what has been concluded in the matter of the Piedmontese. They have indicated that they will willingly offer their assistance, as is fitting, but a plan must be devised by which the enraged beast may be appeased or at least not further provoked and inflamed. Meanwhile, there are those who find it troublesome that supplications are made to the king, who has led his soldiers into foreign regions against agreements and permissions.</p>
      <p>Indeed, another remedy should be sought for this evil, which will not be lacking if there are courageous spirits who will make better decisions regarding the detriment to the republic and the church and thus also to certain destruction.</p>
      <p>I am certainly deeply afflicted by the sight of this distress. Regarding the English, as you wrote, I had already received information beforehand and had learned of the faith and piety of Pastor Lever and others through many testimonies, which made me all the more eager, incited by your exhortation, to promote their cause here. I have most diligently commended it to the senate in the name not only of themselves but also of my fellow believers and brothers. But I received the response that, for certain reasons, it is not possible at this time for that assembly to be accommodated among them, yet they will preserve those who have gathered so far, about 50 souls. This response struck me greatly, as it was most unexpected, and since there is no hope of obtaining even the most pious request, Lever sought our counsel on whether a place might perhaps be obtained for the dispersed flock of Christ elsewhere. We proposed Bern, Biel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, Mulhouse, but above all (which was also approved by them), that he should meet with you again and inquire about your opinion on this matter, which magistrate among all these you consider should be approached first, and then, equipped with your recommendation, he should attempt the matter, in which we will not fail to assist if we can intercede in any way. I am very grateful for what you have written about Polish and Italian affairs, but I cannot reciprocate equally, as I receive nothing from the Low Countries and there is deep silence about German affairs, except that they affirm that the colloquium and the diets at Worms will proceed. They say that Philipp has been called by the Elector Palatine to restore the school at Heidelberg, perhaps to remain there, while Illyricus is said to be moving to Jena.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. Basel, May 4, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and beloved brother in the Lord.</p>
