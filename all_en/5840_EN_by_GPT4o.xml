      <p>Oxford, August 16, in the year 1563.</p>
      <p>Greetings in Christ and eternal peace! I rejoice and congratulate again and again that the tumult of wars has been calmed; however, it is to be lamented that the matter of religion has made little progress. God will someday grant halcyon days and more joyful gospels, and the church will have (I hope) its children and its gospel will run its course despite all the powers of hell being unwilling and resisting. For truth will conquer, and no lord or power will be able to resist or outwit the divine will and hand. To you and yours, our fathers and brothers, we wish a long life, so that the Christian republic may not be bereft of its parents, patrons, and protectors. Concerning the matter of vestments, I again ask you to write to me your opinion, whether in many words or few, or in one word: first, does it seem to you indifferent (adiaphoron), which has become so entrenched over such a long time with so much superstition and has fascinated the minds of the simple for so long with its splendor and imbued them with the opinion of a certain religion and sanctity; secondly, whether by the command of the prince, with the jurisdiction of the pope overthrown and for the sake of order, not worship, such garments can be worn by pious men in the church lawfully and piously with a clear conscience - I speak of that spherical cap and papal surplice, which are now commanded not by the unlawful tyranny of the pope, but by the just and legitimate authority of the queen -, whether now all these things can be clean and free to pure men. I ask your lordship to write to me briefly what your mind is. Sampson had sent his letters elsewhere; he greets you and Mr. Gwalter and others again and again. May God preserve your church and His own!</p>
      <p>Yours, Laurence Humphrey.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished and most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most beloved father and brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
