      <p>S. D. As soon as possible and as safely as possible, send this letter of mine to Mr. Martinengo.</p>
      <p>The delegates, from St. Gallen, Hermetschwil, and Lucerne, are preparing to return to the council; therefore, a conclusion is expected.</p>
      <p>We must diligently keep watch here to know what kind of conclusion is reached and what happens with our delegates.</p>
      <p>If you can do anything, strive to let us know; the matter is necessary. On the 22nd of this month, the case of Bernardino was examined; the most honorable senate deposed him and expelled him from the city and territory; he is not granted more than 3 weeks at most for his departure.</p>
      <p>From the beginning, he was immediately ordered to move; through prayers, he obtained 14 days.</p>
      <p>Everyone is angry with him.</p>
      <p>I fear that no more pastors will be given to the Locarno or Italian church, and many think it is more useful not to give any more, lest troublesome characters cause us new disturbances.</p>
      <p>By the expulsion into exile, the magistrates wanted to testify that the Zurich church does not approve of those 30 dialogues.</p>
      <p>We have been ordered to read those dialogues; thus, the labors and troubles are doubled daily.</p>
      <p>Unless the Lord mercifully supports me with His hand, I will hardly be able to cope with such great labors, especially as I feel my strength decreasing daily.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with us and grant a better mind to the unfortunate old man.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Greet the friends.</p>
      <p>I await yours with longing, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 26, in great haste, 1563. Yours, that Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Return the letters enclosed here; you will see what is happening in Heidelberg. To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Chur church, my dearest brother and fellow minister.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
