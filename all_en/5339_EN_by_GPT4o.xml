      <p>Greetings. I would write more extensively about the outcome of the Solothurn assembly, but I assume that Mr. a Scharteres, who was present, has already explained everything in detail to you and especially to the illustrious Prince of Condé. Our people are now considering sending a delegation to France.</p>
      <p>However, it was first decided at the assembled assembly to send a message to Württemberg and inquire how the German princes intend to send their envoys, in case the envoys of the five cantons, namely those of Zürich, Bern, Glarus, Basel, and Schaffhausen, might join them. I am particularly concerned here, as someone who has learned from experience, remembering how much the envoys harmed us and the sincerity of religion in our unfortunate war fought 30 years ago. What do you think, my lord and brother, will the Lutheran envoys act successfully in matters of religion? You know how they feel about our doctrine; they will certainly want a place in France for the Augsburg Confession, from which, as from Pandora's box, you know how many disputes have arisen throughout Germany. Therefore, I am writing to Mr. Beza and advising him in time.</p>
      <p>I beg you to not only ensure that these letters are delivered promptly but also to add your advice and admonition. I have no doubt about the piety of our people; but you know what happens in assemblies of so many diverse and cunning people.</p>
      <p>Our allied five cantons are almost insane against the gospel; they will rush to the aid of the Guise, monks, and priests and cannot be restrained or controlled, as long as money or wages are counted. Perhaps their fate is urging them.</p>
      <p>There are various rumors among us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will relieve us of anxious concern if you frequently write about what is happening in France or ensure that others write. We now hear that English soldiers are hurrying to France.</p>
      <p>Would that this were true and that they would follow the Condé's side! We received your letters written this month and thank you very much for them. It is beneficial for us not to be ignorant of French affairs, so that we can refute the lies of those who favor the worst matters more intensely. Martyr and all the brothers and fellow ministers greet you; greet all the brothers and fellow ministers as well. May the Lord keep you safe for us for a long time!</p>
      <p>Zürich, May 27, 1562.</p>
      <p>I have not reread.</p>
      <p>May Budéus and Jonville be safe.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful minister of the church of Geneva, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
