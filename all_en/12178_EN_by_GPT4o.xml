    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer thanks for Bullinger's letter [No. 2096] and the [“True Confession”]. He regrets that his letter [HBBW XIV, No. 2049] arrived so late and opened. Even though he suspected that his advice, which Philipp [Melanchthon] and others also supported, would hardly be followed (as Bullinger's letter [No. 2096] confirms), he still wanted to express how much the cause of Christ and the Church is dear to his heart. - Unlike others, he never believed that the Zurichers should not respond to or defend against Luther's [“Short Confession”]; however, the gifts of Christ in other people should not have been questioned. Since some [Confederates] restrict the Lord's Supper to a commemorative celebration contrary to the [First Helvetic Confession], put [Zurichers] Luther [in a bad light], and do not recognize the gifts of Christ in him, their defense will likely accuse them. For their faith, the [Zurichers] would be ready to die; [their opponents] would do the same for Christ. The [Zurichers] would only remain silent if their opinion could be refuted based on the Holy Scriptures; but those who do not want to be convinced cannot be convinced. - Bucer is not on the side of the opponent, but on the side of Christ. He did not want to intimidate the [Zurichers] either, in case they wrote something false about his and Capito's peace efforts, which they actually did. As long as Bucer is not held accountable by Luther for this, he will tolerate the false claim of the [Zurichers]; otherwise, he will prove with the records of his meetings [with the Confederates] that he never claimed that the dispute between Luther and the [Confederates] was merely a dispute over words when they restricted the Lord's Supper to a commemorative celebration. - Bucer would like to know in what way he has shown himself ungrateful and unjust towards the [Zurichers]. Was he perhaps less friendly than they were during the last meeting in Zurich in 1538 and several times thereafter? However, he forgives them everything and strives for true love. - May the Lord help him to continue working solely in the interest of the Church. - Enclosed are some of his books, more to recommend himself to the [Zurichers] than because he believes these books could be of use to them. - The times are bad; all the more reason to serve the Lord earnestly and to show in life, word, and writing that it is [the Protestants] who care solely about the crucified Christ. - Bucer can understand what the [Zurichers] accuse their opponents of. Likewise, he understands what is lacking in the [Zurichers]. But everyone should strive not to be an obstacle to the other. Bucer is also ready to be admonished and taught, even if he must follow the Lord alone. Since no one is capable of healing the other's ailment, one should only strive to promote the gifts of Christ hidden in a person in the interest of the Church, and not try to change the other. - May the Lord teach His own! - May the Zurichers receive Bucer's letter well! - [Enclosure:] Emperor [Charles V] rages in [the southern Netherlands] and has women buried alive and men burned. Through [his representative King Ferdinand I], he advocates at the Diet [in Worms] to confront [Suleiman I], if not this year, then at least next year. The Common Penny is to serve this campaign. Consequently, it is not the time to devote oneself to religious matters, especially since the Council [in Trent] has begun to meet. Some reform measures can probably be taken, but ultimately the Council will decide on them. One should rather take care of the Imperial Chamber Court, which has not been able to pass a judgment since August [1544]. The electors and the [Free Imperial] cities want to adhere to the previous agreements in religious matters. The princes, among whom the bishops predominate, however, agree with the Emperor's stance. - [Duke Henry] of Brunswick is causing trouble for the [Bishop] of Münster, [Franz von Waldeck]. There are attempts to harm the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse]. [The Emperor], who previously supported the confiscation of Duke Henry's territory, now supports him and demands his rehabilitation. - The Papists are working on an alliance, to which [Duke François I] of Lorraine is said to have joined. - [Hermann von Wied, Archbishop of] Cologne, who continues to fight, and [Franz von Waldeck, Bishop of] Münster, are recommended to the prayers of the [Zurichers].</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your letters and book and thank you for the book. It is not my fault that my letter or book reached you so late and opened, and I am sorry for that. Although I foresaw that my advice, which was not only mine but also that of many true servants of Christ, his churches, and your true supporters, including Philipp [Melanchthon], would have as much weight with you as you write, I still wished it had reached you as soon as possible, because the religion of Christ and the care of the churches compelled me to testify to you.</p>
      <p>It was not I, but others, who thought you should not respond to Luther's book at all. I indeed wished you would respond, but in such a way that you would defend your churches among pious people and not attack or unjustly suspect the things of Christ in others. Now, because you seem to make the matter in the Eucharist not Christ - as the Basel Confession had it - but only the memory of Christ really absent - which some of your people have openly written - then you have left nothing undone to show that Luther is a bad man, full of pride and contempt for his brothers, contentious, obstinate, raging, impure, and that you do not consider his gifts and ministry worthy of any place in the church of Christ, I know that among countless churches your defense will not be a light accusation of you and your ministry. You object to what he accuses you of; but these things also grieve me and many others as much as anything.</p>
      <p>You want to lay down your life and everything for your confession. We have laid down as much for ours, and not when the adversary compelled us, but because the word of Christ admonishes us. You will not yield or be silent unless convicted by open scriptures. But he who does not want to be convinced cannot be convinced by these. I wrote that I would join not with the adversaries, but with the truth of Christ. I did not threaten, if indeed you narrate something other than what the matter is about Capito's and my action for concord - which you certainly did. For neither Capito nor I told you in Basel that the difference between Luther and you was only in words, if indeed you place only the symbols of the absent Christ in the sacred supper, but if indeed you acknowledged that through the ministry of the church in the sacred supper with bread and wine the true communication of the body and blood of the Lord is exhibited and denied only the natural union of the symbols with the body and blood of the Lord or their local inclusion in these, as the Basel Confession has it. These, I say, if you felt, we said that nothing was disputed between you in reality, but only in words. Now, however, you write that Capito and I simply proposed to you in Basel at the first meeting held on this matter that the sacramental contention was more in words than in substance. If Luther bears this and does not drag me into the cause, I will not involve myself with him - not certainly for fear of your style (for the truth indeed prevails among the sons of truth), but because I know that all contention among the ministers of the churches is pernicious and I cannot provide other writings much more necessary for the churches. But if Luther attacks me on this matter, I will testify to you about our narration, which I can clearly demonstrate from the acts of your meetings, in which we participated, and also the most recent one in Zurich. If you therefore receive me otherwise than is in the interest of the churches, the Lord will grant me to free myself from you for the good of the church.</p>
      <p>You write: "If you continue to be ungrateful and unjust to us." I indeed wish to know from you, for what benefit of yours to me have I ever been ungrateful or what injustice have I intended against you; I will satisfy you, if I can. I know that I have cultivated friendship and brotherhood between us no less than you have cultivated it towards me, indeed in your last meeting in Zurich and for some time thereafter. However, I have forgiven those things to the Lord and his church and have strived to pursue what is of true charity. I will continue to strive for the same, even if - which the Lord avert - you or Luther or both drag me into this cause.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep me from doing anything other than what is in the interest of his churches, and grant me always to consider not what is permissible, much less what is pleasing, but what is expedient for sanctifying his name. I wish you to be very well in him.</p>
      <p>I send my booklets, more to declare that I strive to be grateful to you than because I thought their reading would bring you any benefit. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, April 9, 1545.</p>
      <p>Excellent men, let us think and consider how evil these days are and, if ever, certainly at this time we should conduct ourselves in our ministry with much fear and trembling and testify to the world by all means of our life, words, and writings that we wish to know nothing but the Lord Jesus and him crucified, and to be far from him, so that we may not glory in anything but the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. I do not want the preaching of Christ to be diminished in the slightest by any iniquity of the world, or for any darkness to be introduced into it. I wish that we all observe the religion of exalting and illuminating it, of which we see the example set before us in Christ the Lord and his apostle.</p>
      <p>I see what you rightly desire in me, what you rightly desire in those with whom you are angry. I also see what is rightly desired in you. Therefore, let each one, and whoever can first before the others, conform to the form prescribed to us by the Lord, so that we give no offense to anyone or occasion for our ministry to be blamed, much less a cause. I indeed wish to be admonished as gladly as possible by anyone about all my errors; I wish to hear others, although I must follow the one Lord. But in others - while I see that the Lord has left neither me nor other men any ability to heal their ailments - I think it should be endured what cannot be changed, and in the meantime, I should nonetheless cultivate and promote for the benefit of the church of Christ whatever gift of Christ I see has been bestowed on any men for this very purpose.</p>
      <p>Christ, our Lord and Master, himself teach us and truly make us his disciples in all things. Amen.</p>
      <p>If you have received these of mine as I have written, receive them with the best mind.</p>
      <p>The Emperor in the Netherlands rages in horrendous ways, buries women alive, burns men. At the Diet, he proposed through his brother that the Turk is approaching; therefore, it is not the time to deal with religion at this Diet, as he had promised; nor is it necessary since the council has already begun to be celebrated. For he has undertaken to institute action on reformation, yet so that a certain rule of religion would be established until something more certain is determined by the general council. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with the Turks, if not to wage a just war - since the time for preparing for that war has passed - yet to repel them this year, while preparing for the next year a just offensive war, as they call it (money is also sought to be collected from some states).</p>
      <p>It is necessary to deal with the establishment and maintenance of the Imperial Chamber Court by the states, about which, if the states cannot agree among themselves, they should have the power to choose a judge and assessors for themselves. For since August, there has been no judgment of the Imperial Chamber, because they could not agree on the assessors and judge. Among the electors (den Kurfürsten), the majority wants the promises and agreements made in the previous Diets to be kept, so that religion is dealt with first. The same is requested by the cities. In the order of princes, because the bishops outnumber, the majority agrees with the Emperor on everything, the minority agrees with the electors. Therefore, they could not agree on a common response; each one therefore gave their own to the king. May the Lord give constancy to those who are in the better opinion.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Duke of Brunswick is plotting against the Bishop of Münster, who is assisted by his pseudo-clergy. The way to the Landgrave is being sought. The Brabants secretly support the Duke of Brunswick; he has already gathered a common soldier. The Emperor, who previously acted to sequester the territory of Brunswick until the cause is judged, now seeks to simply restore the Duke of Brunswick, so that no disturbances occur in Germany.</p>
      <p>The papal league is being renewed, to which they say Lorraine has also joined. It seems the Antichrist wants to dare something. May the Lord restrain him and lead us all to true repentance and agreement in him. Amen.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Cologne is still fighting very seriously with his people, whom I commend to your prayers as well as the Bishop of Münster.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful chief minister of the church of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
