      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Recent news we hear is as follows: The King of England has defeated the Scots, captured the chief governor along with his wife and child, conquered a large castle, killed many people, and each soldier has been given 12 florins, even the lowest-ranking ones. It is also said that the Pope has sent him much money and other priests, so that he may extinguish the gospel in England or not let it grow.</p>
      <p>The King of Denmark, along with three princes, Holstein, Pomerania, and LÃ¼neburg, have united with the cities in Saxony, declaring that they do not want the Interim, and they wish to commit themselves to God, otherwise they will obey the Emperor in all things. May God grant them the grace to persevere.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg is holding strong, gaining more courage day by day, as they have the great council, they do not want the Interim, they are willing to let the Emperor in if he desires, but as other emperors have been let in, without any force. They have already appointed many leaders, to whom they secretly give money. There are some wicked people there who have mocked the great council, saying that they also want to drive out the Emperor and close the gates to him. It almost caused an uprising. About 16 of them are imprisoned; what will be done with them, God knows.</p>
      <p>A beggar in the village of Schlingen, which is a district of the Bishop of Basel, was begging; a daughter about 12 years old was carrying a year-old child on her arm and gave him a piece of bread. He wanted more. The daughter said, "I will not give more away, as it is not commanded to me." Then the beggar swung his crutch, intending to hit the girl, but struck the child, causing its brain to flow out; thus it died. The beggar is captured; what will happen to him, we shall see; some say he was lying in the cart.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 3, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, parish priest in Zurich, my gracious lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
