      <p>Greetings. Our Laelius, returning from Poland via Vienna and Augsburg, will be able to report to you with the utmost certainty about Turkish, Hungarian, Austrian, and Imperial affairs. War has been declared and proclaimed between the Emperor and the French, and between the Turk and Ferdinand. I pity so many miserable people, and I wish that we ourselves are not drawn into the midst of evil. They say the council is proceeding. What has been done or is being done in Baden, we do not yet know; we are expecting news at any moment; the rumors are varied, and not everything that is reported is auspicious. May the Lord arrange us all according to His holy will. Ferdinand's deputy in Constance unloaded three cargo ships, which were said to be carrying French goods. Peter Martyr is alive and has sent me very copious letters. John a Lasco and Hooper fell ill with the English sweat, but they have been restored by the grace of God. Two most noble princes, the Dukes of Suffolk, have perished.</p>
      <p>The plague has subsided. There is great hope for the people of Magdeburg. I am expecting your news about the people of Strasbourg. Farewell with all good things.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 3, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother. Basel.</p>
