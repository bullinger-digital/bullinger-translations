      <p>S. P. D. The letter you recently wrote to me while I was away, I received upon my return from my relative Oporinus, most distinguished man. I have taken good care of the attached letters, and since I have not discovered any letters for you and there was nothing worthy of a letter at hand, I have postponed the letter until the present messenger. I thank you greatly for not disdaining to share with me the letters of good men addressed to you. I would send other news if I had anything certain. It is certain, however, that the noble Duke of Habsburg, the imperial commander, has dismissed all the soldiers he had gathered around Colmar, Sélestat, and here and there throughout Alsace and had assigned to garrisons, from which many conclude that either the sinews of war are lacking or the emperor is in despair about his affairs, although after the fall of Thérouanne, he has recaptured Ibisch and another very fortified city after defeating the French. In France, the pious are endangered for their profession of the Christian religion, as I understand from my son, who returned to us yesterday from Paris. I wanted to write this to you now, so as not to send away empty-handed that good man who greeted me on account of our common studies. Farewell most happily with your wife and entire family, whom Oporinus and our Marcus Bersius wish to be safe with you. Basel, August 18, 1553.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Con[rad] Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zürich, a most beloved friend.</p>
