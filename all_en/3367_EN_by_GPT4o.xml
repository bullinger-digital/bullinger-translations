      <p>Greetings. I give you immense thanks for your exceptional kindness towards me, about which I never doubted, and for the truly effective consolation regarding the misfortune into which I have fallen, about which I am quite aware that some people of my order secretly laugh, which is what pains me the most. But perhaps God will also put an end to this.</p>
      <p>I have hitherto moved every stone to find money, so that I would not be forced to prostitute all my work merely for others; but also so that I might be able to accomplish something in time. But the more I strive, the less I advance.</p>
      <p>Therefore, whether I like it or not, I am undoubtedly compelled to submit myself entirely to the Lord, who governs my affairs even in this fortune, and to adapt myself to His will. If He wishes my labors to benefit the republic further, He will raise help from somewhere. In the meantime, nothing is more bitter than to see that there is no lack of those who continually supply great wealth to those destroyers of republics, yet no one is willing to spend even a penny to adorn the republic. Nor indeed is there any need for you to explain your circumstances to me so anxiously, as if I had hoped to obtain some money from you.</p>
      <p>I only wanted my letters to be shown to you by Frisius, so that you might pray to the Lord for me, that He might not afflict me with another more severe trial, expecting nothing less than money from you, but also hoping to deposit my fortunes into your bosom as that of a supreme friend and a man most dear to God, so that some solace might come to me from there, which indeed happened. I send to you Baleus and the edicts of the princes by Balduinus concerning the Christians, for which, if you wish, you will send 11 batz when it is convenient.</p>
      <p>I would prefer to give them as a gift; but I know you will not allow it. Therefore, I will act with you according to your judgment.</p>
      <p>If the Lord had wished to restore my former fortune even this winter, I would have asked you, with your permission, to allow me to print your German sermons on the Apocalypse; but now, deprived of resources, I ask for nothing. Otherwise, there is hardly any other kind of writing in which I would have preferred to be engaged in printing, so that at least in this, a trophy against the Antichrist might have been erected. But if the Lord wills, it will be possible at another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray to the Lord for us, as I do not doubt you will do.</p>
      <p>I still keep your oration, in case it might also be possible to print it this winter. If you wish to write anything to Philipp, I will ensure it is safely delivered, and I wish I had it now; for the messenger is leaving directly for Philipp tomorrow. Again, farewell and greet all friends on occasion.</p>
      <p>Basel, 17th October 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Oporinus, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed friend. In Zürich.</p>
