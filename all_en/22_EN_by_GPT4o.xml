    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Lavater knows that Bullinger is very interested in his studies [in Paris], he would like to report to him about it now, firstly because he had promised him in his last letter [not received], and secondly because Bullinger is surely waiting for a letter from him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">The situation is as follows: The eloquent Pierre de La Ramée is currently dealing with the eighth book of Quintilian's Institutio oratoria, which is essential for an orator, namely rhetoric. In alternation with this, he has begun to give a lecture on the first book of Cicero's Letters to Atticus in a very understandable and careful manner. La Ramée seemed to Lavater to be worth listening to for the refinement of his style above all other teachers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">He is learning Greek with Barthélemy Alexandre, who is reading about Galen's writing on the liberal arts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">And because Omer Talon is oriented towards the "Dialecticae institutiones" of La Ramée (which have been newly published with relevant examples), Lavater has so far attended his lecture to better understand the Aristotelian doctrine.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">In a few days, La Ramée and Talon will begin their philosophical lecture series, which they call the "philosophical curriculum." Lavater is now also attending the lecture by Francesco Vimercato on the second book of Aristotle's Meteorologica. If possible, he will soon also attend the lecture on Aristotelian politics (or ethics) and on the mathematical foundations. However, in such a way that the abundance of events does not confuse him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">After the winter, he wants to devote himself with full dedication and utmost zeal to the linguistic sciences. He hopes to improve in this way, especially since he has very educated teachers in all the liberal arts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">There is no other news, unless Bullinger does not yet know that on January 11 [1548], some so-called Lutheran [Sainctin Nivet] was burned alive at the stake amid great laughter and applause from the spectators. The Bishop of Paris, Jean du Bellay, has allowed the consumption of meat on Saturdays a few days ago. The famous physician Jacobus Sylvius has been appointed as a royal professor [at the Collège de France]. Lavater has nothing more to report. Bullinger should kindly accept the letter despite its brevity. Lavater would have written more if there were more to report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">May God protect Bullinger. Greetings to Lavater's teacher in Zurich, Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler], and his entire family.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Knowing that my studies, which I am aware are of utmost concern to you, my excellent patron, I thought it appropriate to write to you at this time about their nature. Partly because in my previous letters I promised to write to you more fully about my affairs when the opportunity arose, and partly because I am certain that you are expecting my letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Thus, the current state of my studies is as follows: Pierre de La Ramée, a man of great eloquence, has recently begun to interpret, with great ease and diligence, the eighth book of Quintilian, which deals with the principal part of an orator, namely eloquence, and the first book of Cicero's Letters to Atticus, alternately. I considered it worthwhile to listen to him above others to refine my style.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In Greek, I have Barthélemy Alexandre, who explains Galen's oration, in which he encourages young people to study the liberal arts.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>And because his lectures are adapted to the "Dialecticae institutiones" of Pierre de La Ramée (which are written in a new manner and illustrated with notable examples), I have so far attended Omer Talon's lectures in dialectics, so that I may later understand Aristotelian doctrine with greater benefit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>For these two will begin to interpret the philosophical curriculum, as they call it, in a few days. I have recently begun to listen to the second book of Aristotle's Meteorologica under Francesco Vimercato. Soon, if possible, I will add lectures on Aristotelian politics or ethics and the principles of mathematics. However, I will do so in such a way that I do not hinder myself with an overwhelming number of lectures.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Having overcome the intolerable cold of winter, I will apply the utmost diligence in all literary duties. For I hope to make some progress, especially since I have the most learned teachers in all the liberal arts.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>There is nothing new here, unless it is new and unheard of to you that on January 11, a certain Lutheran, as they call him, was burned alive with great laughter and applause from the bystanders. The Bishop of Paris has allowed the consumption of meat on Saturdays for several days now. The renowned physician Jacobus Sylvius has recently been elected as a public or royal professor. Besides this, I have nothing worthy to report to you. I ask you to kindly accept the brevity of this letter. I would have written more to you at this time if the lack of new events had not hindered me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for us for a long time. Do not disdain to convey my greetings to my teachers, your most honorable wife Anna, and your entire family. From our study in Paris, on the 9th day before the calends of February, in the year 1548. Yours sincerely, Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Church of Zurich, my esteemed father. In Zurich.</p>
