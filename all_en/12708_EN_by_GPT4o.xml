    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Comander thanks for the letter delivered by [Johannes] Pontisella and its news about the [Schmalkaldic] War, which he has shared with the most important colleagues.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The following regarding the Gotteshaustag [from October 24 in Chur]: Both Emperor [Charles V] and the Empire [the Schmalkaldic League] have sent their ambassadors there. The imperial ambassador [...] denied the rumor about the poisoned salt and urged the Grisons to adhere to the hereditary agreement, which the Emperor and King [Ferdinand I] also intended to uphold. Subsequently, the Schmalkaldic ambassadors [Hieronymus Pappus and Bastian BÃ¤r] also presented their concerns, requesting in the name of their friendship that the Grisons not allow enemy troops to pass through the passes and addressed, among other things, the matter of grain. They further indicated that the Grisons should be prepared for severe consequences if they were to be defeated by the Emperor. Mayor [Luzi Heim] will write more extensively to [Johannes] Haab on this matter. Bullinger will then learn more details from him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Among the Grisons, no one (regardless of whether they are for or against the Gospel) sides with the Emperor, except for the "priests" [the Catholic clergy], who, however, no longer have any political power. Bishop [Lucius Iter] came riding [to Chur] with great pomp and wanted to participate in the Gotteshaustag. However, he was refused.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Johannes Blasius was acquitted in the trial against the Bishop.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blasius and [Luzi] Heim send their regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I received the letter sent via Pontisella and shared the news about the war with the most important brothers. I thank you for your diligence.</p>

      <p>What I have from our assembly is this: The Emperor and the Empire have sent their ambassadors. The imperial ambassador denied the rumor about the poisoned salt and urged that the hereditary agreements be faithfully and steadfastly upheld; this is what the Emperor and Ferdinand also intend to do. He was thus dismissed with good words. The ambassadors from the Empire also presented their serious concerns, offering all friendship and goodwill regarding the passes, the grain, and similar matters, also suggesting to our people what might result if they were oppressed by the Emperor. They received an honorable response with the promise of all goodwill, etc. Our mayor will write more clearly and better about this matter to your mayor Haab; from him, you may also receive a better report.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Among us, there is no one, whether they are with the Gospel or against it, who sides with the Emperor or wishes him well, except for the priests. However, they have again been deprived of all worldly power. The bishop came riding with great pomp on the day, intending to sit in the assembly; however, he was not tolerated, which displeased him greatly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Johannes Blasius was acquitted in his case against the bishop and his concubine, and the bishop was forced to return the letters he had written, etc.</p>

      <p>Farewell, dearest and most esteemed brother. From the court of Rhaetia, November 8, 1546. Johannes Blasius and Mayor Heim send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
