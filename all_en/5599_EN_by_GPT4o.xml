      <p>Greetings. I have taken up the pen (reverend father in Christ) before I was certain about the messenger; for our people do not set out because of the market; for it is our fair.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I have written these few things and proceed to see to whom I might give them, not because I had something, but so that you might understand that all your things have been returned to me, for which we owe you immortal thanks.</p>
      <p>I have copied them in order and noted from each what I want to be read by all.</p>
      <p>The matter of Trent will be my concern; now I will have it at the fair, to which I will commit it, but I am still expecting something from the brothers.</p>
      <p>Now I have nothing, except that a certain honest man from Lower Engadine is here, who brings news from Venice, because the reputation of the girls and matrons of Trent was suffering excessively, the holy fathers of the council sent three hundred of the choicest and noblest courtesans as a supplement. You have the news. It is written to Balingketum that two brothers, sons of a Florentine, killed each other in a hunt and their death was immediately followed by that of their mother.</p>
      <p>Whether these things are true, I cannot easily say. Certainly, it is said to be true that the poor landsknecht (mercenary soldier) is dissatisfied with the emperor, who forbade them to roam around the garden, and yet he does it himself now.</p>
      <p>These things in jest.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>If you read what I added in the life of Conrad Pellicanus about the ubiquitous heaven, do not be offended; for they seem to be whistled out with their heaven, and certainly it would seem advisable that all learned men who stand with us should throw jests at them.</p>
      <p>If it does not please you, however, delete it; the power is with you, which I grant you.</p>
      <p>However, you will read this life of Pellicanus with an even mind, if you consider that it was written long ago and now in such great turmoil, the labor of correcting and amending it has been very troublesome for me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, January 25, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours respectfully, Johannes Fabricius.</p>
