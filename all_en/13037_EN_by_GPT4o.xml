    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius thanks for Bullinger's response [No. 2984]. Johannes Gast will procure the [edition of Persiusâ€™ Satires]. Bullinger's explanations about the Five Places (may the Lord bless them!) are satisfactory, even though Myconius always remains cautious.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] At first, he was pleased with the letter from Emperor Charles V [to the Confederates from July 28]. But upon reading it repeatedly, it seemed much less friendly to him. The fact that one cannot trust this Spanish viper is evident from the experiences of the last 20 years! With fine words, he tries to calm the Confederates, only to subjugate those who have become incautious. However, perhaps God intends to punish the arrogance of the Confederates. His will be done, and may He also grant endurance!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Myconius would much rather have learned how Bullinger interprets the apparition [in Glarus]. When he still lived in his homeland [Lucerne], he heard such tales to the point of excess. He already knows that God sometimes announces misfortune in this way, but he does not want to precede his interpretation of the sign with divine punishment. Only when one lion has devoured the other will he comment on it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Should the guaiac wood not kill the "Nebuchadnezzar of Germany" [Charles V.], it will probably have no healing effect... This Spaniard divides the Confederates with fine words until he is ready to act against them thanks to the [new Swabian] League and other means.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] It's good that Johannes Haller is finally returning!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Should the Emperor attempt to deform religion, God will surely punish him for it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, also to Theodor Bibliander and Rudolf Gwalther. They could also write once or at least send greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You have responded correctly, that is, as I wished. I thank you. I have dealt with Gast as you requested. He promised to comply. I am content with the interpretation of the Five Places, although I always fear a hidden snake. May the Lord bless them! Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I am pleased to hear the words of the Emperor. However, as I recall them, they become increasingly unpleasant. I cannot trust the Spanish deceit! No viper is more filled with venom than that man with his many and varied tricks; this we have experienced sufficiently over the past 20 years. With good words, he tries to make us feel secure, and once he has made us so, he will then oppress the unwary. Perhaps God intends to break our arrogance, which we have indulged in for quite some time. May His will be done, and may He grant us patience in all things!</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I would have preferred to hear your interpretation of the vision rather than interpose my own opinion. While I lived in my homeland, I was so saturated with such tales that I eventually came to despise them, and this contempt still accompanies me. I know that the Lord sometimes foretells future calamities with signs, but whenever this happens, I do not willingly anticipate God's judgments with my interpretation. After one lion has devoured the other, then I will say what I think.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Unless the guaiac wood sometimes destroys the "Nebuchadnezzar of Germany," it does not seem to be beneficial. The Spaniard delays the Swiss with good words until he has prepared himself against them with the treaty and other opportune means.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I am glad that Haller will finally return to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>After the Emperor attempts to deform religion, the Lord will surely rise and avenge it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell in Christ with Theodor and Gwalther. What if they also wrote to me sometime or at least sent greetings? In Basel, hastily, August 12, 1547. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, brother and lord in Christ. Zurich.</p>
