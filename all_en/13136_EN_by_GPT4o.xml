    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Frey thanks for Bullinger's response [not received] to his small question [which he had posed in letter No. 3075]. He has now looked up the passage from Augustine recommended by Bullinger. However, he could not view the passage in Jerome, as neither he nor his colleagues have access to an edition of Jerome. Therefore, Bullinger might, as offered, transcribe this passage for him on occasion, if it indeed answers Frey's question. The passage in Augustine (as far as Frey can judge) clearly explains why a degree of kinship allowed in Holy Scripture is prohibited by secular laws; which Bullinger also emphasizes when he writes that one should not immediately conclude from what was permitted to the ancestors that it is still allowed to us. However, this does not answer Frey's question: He wants to know what he should say to a layperson if they ask him why the Mosaic law permits a marriage between cousins, who are blood relatives, but forbids a marriage between a man and the daughter of his wife's sister, who is not a blood relative. Bullinger should reread Frey's earlier letter and provide his response to it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Frey and his colleagues received with sorrow the news of Heinrich Buchter's death. However, the safe return of Johannes Haller [from Augsburg] has greatly pleased all who know him. May God grant him courage, wisdom, and true piety.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] But what is being heard? Rudolf Gwalther is said to be in even greater difficulties than before, and if the fear of Emperor Charles V did not hold back the Catholic opponents, they would do him harm! The whole of Solothurn is in a rage: Gwalther is worse than Zwingli! One tragedy follows another. How sad! Reason enough to worry about Gwalther and the common fatherland. May God save Gwalther, who fights for the truth!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings to Bullinger and his family, also from the colleagues.</p>

      <p>S. P. I give you the greatest thanks, father, for deigning to respond to my small question. I consulted the divine Augustine on this matter in the book and chapter you indicated. I do not have Jerome, nor does anyone among us possess him. Therefore, as you promise, please describe that passage for me when you have the opportunity, if perhaps it responds more suitably to my understanding regarding the question raised. For as far as I understand St. Augustine, his words aim to show why a degree of kinship admitted in sacred laws is prohibited by political laws. And you assert this: Not immediately, if something was permitted to the ancestors, is it also allowed to us, nor is that degree prohibited, therefore permitted. But none of these things trouble me, but rather how, when this degree is admitted in the law of Moses, it is prohibited by the same, which seems more remote, namely that it is not permitted by Mosaic law to marry the daughter of one's wife's sister. But again, if you have it at hand, reread my letter, then explain to me what should be answered to such a question from an unlearned person (if it happens).</p>

      <p>We received the news of Heinrich Buchter's death with a heavy heart, but we must yield to fate. However, we greatly rejoice at the return of Johannes Haller, as do all who know him! May the Lord grant him the spirit of strength, understanding, and true piety. Amen.</p>

      <p>But what new rumor is being spread again? Rudolf Gwalther is now said to be involved in greater dangers than he was before, and if the fear of Emperor Charles V did not restrain the adversaries, they would not hold back from attacking him. The whole of Solothurn is seething! They claim he is much more intolerable than Zwingli! One tragedy barely ends, and another has already begun, etc. These and similar reports have shaken my spirit, because I fear for both his and the common fatherland's safety. Whatever it is, I wish to know. May the Lord, whose truth and brightest light he loves and defends, deliver him and all of us from the hands of our persecutors.</p>

      <p>Our people greet you. Greet yours in my name. Farewell. Biel/Bienne, December 1, 1547. Yours sincerely, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed father. Zurich.</p>
