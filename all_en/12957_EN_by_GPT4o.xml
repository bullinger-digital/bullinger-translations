    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The Zurich council has finally recalled Haller and Thoman Ruman! Ruman had already planned to leave Augsburg, while Haller would have stayed a little longer. But now the Augsburg council does not want to let them go, to avoid giving any reason for criticism. Therefore, they wrote to the Zurich council, expressing their fear of a rebellion by the Augsburg population. However, it would be in the interest of the Zurich council, as well as Haller's and Ruman's, to stick to the recall and present good reasons for it. For Haller and Ruman do not want to stay at all! The Augsburg councilors must admit themselves that the priests [returning to Augsburg] intend to reintroduce their religion, or rather their superstition, and that presumably the Reichstag and perhaps even a German council will be held in Augsburg. But Haller does not want to wait for this, given the good opportunity, granted by God, to be recalled from Augsburg! Moreover, there is also a rumor that Emperor Charles V will march against the Confederates. If it comes to that, Haller would rather defend his homeland by all means!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It was difficult for Haller and Ruman to wait until the Zurich council would respond to the letter from the Augsburg council with the city messenger sent to them. The council promised them an honorable farewell if the Zurich council insisted on the recall. So if Bullinger has helped to achieve this recall, he should advocate for it again! Haller does not demand that he believe his report on the situation in Augsburg, especially since he probably realizes that he cannot quite believe how much L. [Georg Frölich] has changed due to the influence of Hektor [Jakob Herbrot]. But he should at least trust the testimonies of Michael Keller and Nikolaus Müller known as Maier, who also write to him [with No. 2909 and No. 2910] and complain about [Herbrot], while all sensible people congratulate Haller on being freed from purgatory in time. Occasionally, Haller will orally describe the Swabian way of life, which is so far removed from the simplicity and authenticity of the Helvetians. Bullinger should therefore do everything to ensure that the Zurich council does not change its mind.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Greetings, also to Bullinger's family and the parish colleagues. Haller's relative [...] will await the Zurich council's response in Augsburg, as he believes that the actions of the Augsburg council are just theater.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S.:] Just now, an upright guild master [Hans Schweiglin?] visited, who attended the council meeting where Haller's and Ruman's recall was discussed. He thinks the council's actions are a complete joke. Therefore, he advised Haller to write to the Zurich council to ensure they do not change their mind!</p>

      <p>Greetings. The distinguished council of the city of Zurich has recalled us, and indeed at the right time! For Romanus would have otherwise left within a few days. I would have stayed a little longer. The honorable council of Augsburg wishes to keep us, offering many honors. They write to the Zurich council with the sole pretext of not stirring up the simple populace against them. It would be most pleasing to both them and us if they ratified the previous recall and presented honest reasons (which they can) for it. For we are not at all inclined to stay! They are forced to admit that the priests, along with their religion (or rather superstition), are to be brought back, and that a general assembly and perhaps even a German council will be held here. This is something I will not wait for, given the divine opportunity and calling granted to me! Furthermore, there is a persistent rumor that the Swiss are to be sought in war by the emperor. Therefore, I wish to be present for my homeland and to defend it with counsel, resources, and hand (as the situation demands).</p>

      <p>We barely managed to get them to write to the Zurich council and to delay our departure until the return of their messenger. They promised to release us honorably if we are recalled by you again. So if you helped before, please help again now! I do not want you to believe how things stand in Augsburg (I know you do not believe how much our Hector L has changed!), but trust the esteemed Mr. Maier and Cellarius, who write to you and inquire about the same and congratulate me with all men of sound judgment for being freed from this purgatory in time. I will describe to you in person the Swabian customs, which are so alien to the simplicity and integrity of the Swiss. I urge you, do not let the recall be changed! I will be yours entirely forever.</p>

      <p>Farewell. Hastily from the college of Saint Anne in Augsburg, May 25, 1547. Greet the family and brothers. My relative will await the response of the lords in the meantime, as he sees there is nothing beyond the pretext! Johannes Haller.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>As I conclude this, a tribune, an honest and sincere man, who was also present at the council when our recall was proposed, came to me. He says that the consuls' dealings with us are mere nonsense. If we wish to be advised, we should write to the Zurich council not to change their decision!</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his esteemed lord. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
