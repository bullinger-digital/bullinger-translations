      <p>Although there is such a great entanglement and occupation of your affairs, most honorable lord, that you scarcely have any relaxation from your most serious matters; yet since your piety and indulgence towards all of us is such that you think it necessary to hold some part of the management and arrangement of our affairs in your business; I have been compelled by the importunity of matters and the inducement of your goodwill towards us to address you through letters. As for what might cause some wonder, why, in such close proximity and almost coalescence of houses, I prefer the intervention of letters to a meeting of conversation with you, you should think it is because: a certain absurd bashfulness is still inherent in me, which dissolves too much in the relation and conversation of private matters; and the one who has taken on the role of messenger and intermediary can explain all the feelings of my mind just as if I were present. Let your kindness understand the matter in summary thus. By the persuasion of a certain friend of mine, Herr Burcher offered me 30 florins for one year. Although I remained in the company of the English, I did not think this condition should be refused: first, because a certain necessity was imposed on me to accept it; (for there was a certain request and arrangement among us, that each should work with their family and friends to secure some condition and relief for themselves, so that entry might be open to the more needy English who were in Strasbourg; hence, both by the religion of that sanction and by the reason of others, that condition was not to be rejected by me): it is added that, as it is (since it is very generous), it would not be of my nature or gratitude to refuse: thirdly, because it is more suitable for a certain reason and convenience of my studies. In short, I spoke with Herr Richard, that since that sum would scarcely be sufficient for my living, he should add something to the collection as a supplement for me: he also responded quite reasonably in my opinion, that he would be introducing a pernicious example to the whole fellowship, so that others might similarly demand some attribution for themselves elsewhere. Furthermore, I asked whether it would be allowed to write to some of my family and necessary friends, who are merchants, about some increase (as much as would be necessary) to be applied: he also thought that I could not do this without inconvenience to the society. Blocked by these ways, I communicated with the most friendly man Herr von Ulm because of the old relationship that has existed between us. We came to this, most distinguished man, that having tried and searched all, we saw this as the last refuge: (for to hope for something more from Herr Burcher would be of intolerable and unbearable importunity; moreover, he wrote very hesitantly in letters about his affairs, that he would apply this pension in future years, if his means would allow it.) This finally came to our mind, that Herr Vergerius, with what piety and generosity he held a sermon among us, indeed, showed that he would not only gratify everyone universally as much as he could, but also individually, provided they would want to experience his effort. As we were considering this among ourselves, it occurred that we would not accomplish much without the interposition of your letters: which I say because Herr von Ulm, with the same love and benevolence he has towards all others, thinks not only that the state of my affairs pertains to him, but he himself is also ready (provided it seems useful to you) to bear with me both the troubles of the journey and the solicitation and accuracy of the matter. Now the matter is placed in your piety, to whom as the patron of the miserable and exiled from England, there has often been recourse before, and now I flee with equal confidence; to whom it also seems not at all laborious, however much it may be, to bring some relief to our affairs; so that first your prudence may see whether it is expedient to attempt this, then that you may help me with your counsel and effort (which you can conveniently do). This is the summary. I know of what futility it is to use prolixity with him, who is more aroused by his own piety and zeal for matters than by any regard for the person or any circumlocution of words.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus preserve you for His church, and from His riches repay you this grace by which you daily refresh the hearts of the saints!</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you in Christ, Michael Reniger, Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the venerable lord and singular patron of the English, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy minister of the ZÃ¼rich church.</p>
