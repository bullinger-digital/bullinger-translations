      <p>On March 6th, the following was written to me: "The Emperor has now withdrawn from Speyer to Germersheim, a town about two miles away belonging to the Elector Palatine, due to the death of his chaplain or confessor (who was a notorious scoundrel and an adversary of the truth) and some soldiers hired for the protection of his body. The illness, by which they perished, is said to be one that either quickly takes people away, that is, suddenly, or drives them to madness. Furthermore, many say for certain that the Emperor is now gathering money from all sides, especially from the merchants of Augsburg, having already received some and expecting more, amounting to over 70 hundredweights (Zentner) of thalers, with each hundredweight containing 1600 florins, and for a principal of 100 thalers, he is offering an interest of 16 florins.</p>
      <p>All this is for military use against the Frenchman, whose herald he now holds captive, but due to his own fault and treachery. In the matter of promoting religious affairs, we dare not promise ourselves anything from men, especially those who despise divine matters. Bucer is writing a pamphlet against Latomus, which will have about 25 pages," etc. The rest is from Myconius.</p>
      <p>I am sending here a poem, which you will share with good friends and brothers and then return; for we have no other copy here.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius. March 11, 1544, Basel.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear lord.</p>
