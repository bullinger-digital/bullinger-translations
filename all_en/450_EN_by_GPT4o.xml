      <p>Greetings, grace, and peace from God. Your letters, the more welcome they were, the later I received them, and almost worn out by the negligence of my nephew from my sister, who delivered them to me in Geneva, soaked with much ink. You bear witness to your sincere spirit towards the church, about which I could never think otherwise, nor could I, that you would do whatever you know to be in the interest of the church. I wish that all would accomplish this with you from the heart. If your people desire to have the pious pastor Haller among them, they do not do so unjustly: for, as there are far fewer plowmen than ox drivers, so there are very few true pastors, though many seem to be in name. But what? It is better to have fewer than none. But if in far inferior matters the necessity is considered, as often, even if domestic affairs demand that one stays and does what is at hand, yet one must run to the stable because of a fire or something else, leaving everything behind, and much more in those matters where the care of one should be no less than that of another, as in the churches.</p>
      <p>But lest I be rightly told, as I speak to you about these things: "Sus Minervam!" I will not add more: thinking that you will take it well, since you see that I seek nothing here but the edification of the churches. This compels me to deal with those whom I suspect, as I rightly should, as if they needed my admonition. However, as I do not regret having dealt with Calvin and others in a far different manner, so that he might be drawn to the church which he administers so piously, so I hope now by the grace of the Lord to succeed. For Haller does not have enemies as hostile as Calvin did: who, I do not know if they would have given up their lives before their hatred. And indeed they were of the kind you note, and rightly so, who could do much and were influential in many things, not entirely unlearned, but yet not so burdened with knowledge that they needed a chariot to carry it: they could carry it all alone themselves.</p>
      <p>But they were poorly taught self-denial and the pursuit of Christ and piety: they loved themselves too much, and so far from striving with Paul for the glory of Christ alone, that they would even rejoice that Christ was preached by occasion and would sincerely perish from all as ardently as possible, that they would rather bear it grudgingly that the gospel was announced purely: therefore they were more favorable to impure pests than to pious pastors. Who, if it were possible for this kind of men to surpass angels in knowledge, eloquence, and all gifts, which they would not use for the proper purpose and edification but serve their own affection, would not prefer a single pious person from the common people, not to mention a pastor, who with much modesty eagerly desires to serve God, to edify the church, who neither seeks nor regards himself, but only Christ, on whom he entirely depends?</p>
      <p>As for those whose modesty you rightly commend, I do not count them among those like myself, to whom moderate learning has fallen: would that it were granted to approach more closely to that which I suspect in them to be rare and uncommon, which I desire to always serve more and more for the glory of God. May He give to all the learned that mind by which they strive only for peace and edification, and keep far from all, whom He adorns with clear gifts, the lost scoundrels who, by the instigation of Satan, make it so that what could serve most for the illustration of God's glory, the edification of all, peace, and charity, are perversely used to the insult of God's name, to the ruin of all, to wars and wicked hatreds: and may He make it so that the more one is endowed with better gifts, the more he humbles himself and, kindled with greater charity, avoids abuse, but uses them more purely and holily, and repels such harmful pests from himself, never giving ear, and much less heart. How harmful are such devils?</p>
      <p>What do they not attempt among others, where they deal with the unknown? What do they not pick out, collect, and invent to slander the good? When with me, who am nothing, for whom no one can hear well or ill, whom they have so often found to be moved not even a little except by the most certain matter, they have so often acted that I would judge the angels of God as devils, and turn away well-known brothers for unknown enemies. God gave Viret, whom I know better than myself, I have never found in him anything but a true and sincere affection for Christ and the gospel, a teachable mind and a truly Christian heart, a follower of charity and a lover of peace, who, unless he saw many perishing and himself compelled by God's command, never contended with anyone, and that with such modesty that enemies, whether they want to or not, are forced to confess in appearance very commendable, and when they cannot condemn the deeds, they take on divine parts for themselves, saying it is not done from the heart, but that all is hypocrisy. I will not report what they have attempted with others: therefore I do not think there are more harmful pests today, nor are there, by which Satan can do more in disturbing and destroying the good. May the Lord Jesus exterminate such harmful ones. Among other notable gifts in Haller, it pleased me greatly that he conducts himself here very piously and prudently, and does not give place to Satan, to whom not a few have surrendered themselves to be led, receiving calumnies and finally most wickedly harassing and causing to be harassed the pious servants of God.</p>
      <p>I am most grateful to you for opening the way by which what I judge to be so ardently desired may be obtained by all the good. How easy it would have been for me once, before the orders of monks and blessed bellies entered the church, to obtain this. But now, unless the Lord acts, there is no hope through me, except among very few, to be able to accomplish anything. Therefore, there is need for prayers. The wicked, of whom there is no small number, want no one to be master of themselves, but who is carried away by passions, as soon as he hears something, rages and acts insanely, is ambition itself, allows himself to be adored, and believes anything of vain praises: for the monks are well taught to elevate and adore such men above God, to say only what pleases even without measure. What? Men, who were ambition itself, were forced to accuse such of excessive civility, as they called such shameful flattery excessive civility.</p>
      <p>And such monsters, who seemed to accuse these pests, often suffered me, an old man and long engaged in ministry, whom they could, far be it from the word envy, to recognize as a colleague in the Lord and a brother, not to be entirely rejected by them, to be begged far more humbly with so many and long exposures of the head, which they were certainly unworthy of, to be supplicated for those things which were of the church, and which they themselves were bound to do, than any mortals ever suffered in Germany. How often did that great Zwingli there, although I was a young neophyte, when I had come there twice only accompanying the Gallic Lyonese, rebuke me for addressing him honorably as he deserved, not allowing me to satisfy my own desire?</p>
      <p>What shall I say of Oecolampadius and Capito, and men of similar note, who would have sent me as far away as possible? But I do not say these things because it was troublesome to me if anything was obtained for the Lord with so many genuflections, since I would not only wish to uncover my head for a long time, but even my body and to be beaten, provided that the churches could be consulted in this way, but so that you may understand how monks make fools insane, and do not think they seek anything but the wicked or whom they can make wicked. I will not touch on their other matters, I only ask that they be known to the good so that they can be guarded against. For besides the crimes, by which they gravely provoke the wrath of God against themselves and the churches, they excessively destroy the simpler ones with their sycophancies, alienating them from the good and piety: and we owe these to those you note, who, indulging their own wicked passions without fear of God and love of neighbor, have introduced these pests. This evil can only be remedied if those who teach in Bern are in agreement, and wish to consult for the churches, for which Haller is exceedingly necessary.</p>
      <p>As for the Germans, you yourself know more. The city seems almost different since his arrival. The sermons are much more attended and the people more attentive. The strife between pastors and citizens, which provided a horrendous stumbling block to all, has ceased.</p>
      <p>The communion is most attended, and as I hear, of much edification, while all have understood themselves to be invited unanimously to the true and spiritual food, with the mind not intent on visible things, nor depressed to the earth but elevated to heaven. All these things you should diligently ensure are completed for the glory of Christ and the great edification of the churches. We must support such holy and divine auspices, under which I wish, as the last of all, I could contribute something: I would gladly give myself to any service to Haller, in whatever way I could finally serve him to complete what has been begun. Let us all help with our prayers to God, with holy exhortations towards those we can. No one who can do anything here should cease. And in the meantime, let us lament the most deplorable dispersion of the churches, asking God with the most ardent prayers for their restoration, and the preservation of those that remain, and their full amendment, and the fullest agreement in all things, in which matter much depends on you. May Christ grant that you expend yourself here to the best of your ability and add encouragement to others. A great, not to say the greatest, wound would be inflicted on Satan, and much would be added everywhere to the gospel, which seems to be kindled from sparks driven from Germany, which, while the poorest is deprived, enriches others. But these things are indeed to be wished for by me, but far more excellent ones are needed to handle them. May the Lord stir them up, so that through them He may accomplish what all ought to desire.</p>
      <p>Farewell, man of God, and, as you do, illuminate the church of God. May the Lord Jesus keep you with your holy colleagues, whom I wish to be reverently greeted, Gwalter, Bibliander, not to forget the pious old man Pellican. May Christ keep them and all the pious, may He always guide the council. Your colleague sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Neuchâtel, March 3, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your entire Farel.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, very distinguished in piety and learning. In Zürich.</p>
