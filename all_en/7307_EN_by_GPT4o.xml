      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters, I believe, the bundle first, then the individual ones afterwards. I also received them intact earlier through the courier Bader. As for Brunner, I have nothing to say except that he has made a poor decision for himself by not staying where he was honored and well-treated. But prideful contention and quarrelsomeness allow nothing to be done rightly, indeed they cast one from a happy state into an unhappy one. I pity his wife and children.</p>
      <p>The king's envoy wrote lengthy letters three weeks or a month ago, explaining that Condé unjustly brings arms against the king who desires to maintain peace. I responded briefly that different causes of war are presented by different parties; time will reveal who narrates more truthfully; it is not my place to judge or pronounce on these matters; I pray that the Lord grants peace, lest France, the most flourishing kingdom, be miserably torn apart by civil war. Besides this, I wrote nothing and I do not think he can misuse these words, except through extreme impudence.</p>
      <p>Greet the three councilors along with Karl, Pontisella, and Ganthner. Use what I send wisely and among trusted individuals, so that it may not someday be to my detriment. I send what I receive from friends and sincere people, and they do not fabricate anything, I am quite sure, but as it is conveyed to them, they share it with me, and I with you; however, I will not declare how thoroughly everything is verified, I leave the judgment to the reader. Therefore, I send enclosed what the people of Basel sent here, and what I received from two most outstanding men in Geneva. Consider it well and request the same from friends in my name.</p>
      <p>Rumor or the report of some brings news that the royalists have burst out of the city and inflicted damage on Condé's forces; others report the opposite; perhaps both invent what they wish had happened. We have nothing certain yet about the Baden assembly, which is not yet concluded. I think it will not be of much benefit; for everything among the Swiss begins to falter, perhaps because the day of reckoning is not far off. Lord, have mercy on us and save us. Councilor Müllner is gravely ill; if he recovers, it will be a miracle. Thus we see the best among us taken away daily, so they do not see the evil to come. I pray to the Lord that those who live then may bear it with a strong spirit, to whom I commend you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 21, 1567.</p>
      <p>I languish in sorrow and am overwhelmed and covered by countless other matters, etc. Therefore, forgive me for responding briefly to your lengthy letters.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
