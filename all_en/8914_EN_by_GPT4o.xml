      <p>Greetings. I am now sending back [everything] through my son, reverend lord and godfather, including those latest news you sent to us, and once again I thank you in my name and in the name of all the lords of this city for your diligence and dedication, which rightfully is admired by everyone in your great age. Furthermore, my brother also sent what the Archduke of Austria wrote to the Rhaetians; we do not yet have their response. There is nothing particular with us, except that it is known a great fleet is being prepared in France, especially around Brittany, which will be commanded by an admiral; but for what purpose it is being prepared is not yet known. As for my booklet, which is in your hands, I thought it would be more appropriate to dedicate it to both of our treasurers, so that the other one does not feel slighted, since he is no less familiar and benevolent to me than the other.</p>
      <p>If it seems right to you, the inscription in the dedicatory letter could be changed and the latter part of it could be adapted to suit both in a similar or more detailed form, which I am sending to you inserted in this note. However, I leave all these matters to your wisdom to arrange as before, and I ask you to forgive me for continually troubling you with business. I also commend my son to you. If only I could be with you as well, if only to see you, whom I still wish from the heart to meet and see more often!</p>
      <p>Both consuls and the treasurers, along with Diesbach, my father-in-law, Telamon, and many others, send you their diligent greetings. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Bern, the last day of May 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
