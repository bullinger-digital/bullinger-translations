      <p>May the grace of Christ be with you, most learned servant of God, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Simon came on December 18th, first greeting Mr. Leonhard Hospinian, who led him to my house immediately after delivering the letters. I read, not without great horror, the fate or rather the exile that the good Johannes Willingus undeservedly suffers from those malevolent and neutral people for the true confession of Christ. But after the clouds, Phoebus will sometimes see the clear sky; for the gracious God will use the works of the good man elsewhere, where he will undoubtedly be of greater benefit. May the Lord grant him Christian patience.</p>
      <p>In the autumn, we entrusted Johannes Fabricius to look for a good and pious minister for the new church in Rappoltsweiler, who would be of a calm disposition, truly pious and not contentious, and who would be instructed in the customs and confession of your church. We feared, since there are so many wanderers, that someone might be imposed on us who is a sophist, imbued with bad opinions, and that the variety of ceremonies and doctrine might endanger both that and our neighboring church. For Sultzer and Mr. Wolfgang Wissenburg, returning from Strasbourg with the unresolved and uncomposed dispute, which I believe you know arose between the ministers of Christ and Satan, persuaded the lord and mother of Rappoltsweiler to a papist and mass-priest, who indeed took a wife but sacrifices in the Gregoriana Valley.</p>
      <p>Then both visited me, indicating the matter. Having certain reasons, I dissuaded them in every way; then Sultzer promised to send someone from the Basel region. Thus, the matter has been delayed so far, and no one has been sent, and everything is at a standstill, so we, like those adrift, do not know whom God will call. It is certain that the lord himself inclines his mind to that papist, because he is a man skilled in hunting, and princes delight in such things, etc. What the people of Basel are planning, we do not know. Therefore, God must be earnestly prayed to grant His grace and send true workers into that harvest to propagate Christ in that region; many people there need to be won over, etc.</p>
      <p>Now about the present matter. I, joined by Nicolaus, although I am very weak, leaning on my staff, nevertheless, what my feet could not do, I would have accomplished with a hired carriage. Tomorrow we wanted to meet the lady, as Simon will indicate; but since the lord's son is absent and busy capturing and confessing wild boars in the place where that papist lives, we were frustrated, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, by the counsel of the brothers, it was agreed among us to wait for the baron's arrival for a few days, then we will act not only with the lord and mother but also with those who are his advisors and the nobles. Therefore, it will be necessary to act prudently, as you know, lest, while we seem to be giving birth to mountains, a ridiculous mouse is born. I do not doubt that the Spirit of Christ, whose cause it is, will not fail us; for the lady herself, unless my opinion deceives me or she herself labors under hypocrisy, will persuade her son, who willingly obeys, to receive this Johannes. Therefore, he will wait three weeks, and we will inform you of all matters. Enclosed with these letters are the lady's letters for you to read, expressing her wish that all your German sermons be collected and published in one book and in a larger volume, in quarto as they call it. I wrote to you about this matter twice; but you did not respond, perhaps more occupied with serious matters. It is to be lamented that Satan's machinations have such power among the people of Fünfkirchen, that they wish to extinguish Christ again; but they will see someday whom they have pierced. May the Lord comfort His church and grant us the spirit of true contrition and repentance, so that finally, having shed this mortality, we may receive that unfading crown, which the whole world, not to mention the impious or rather atheistic people of Fünfkirchen with their wicked associates, will not snatch from us.</p>
      <p>Amen, amen. Hastily, more copious things another time. Greet your family, the brothers, Pellican, who is no less than I am a long-liver, Gwalther, Bibliander, Fabricius, and the others. May the Lord keep you in peace. The rest from this messenger. In Riquewihr by the morning lamp on December 19, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>I pray for a peaceful and even happier year for all of you. Amen.</p>
      <p>The prince is dealing with his brother in Bohemia; he is expected at Christ's nativity.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful overseer of the church in Zürich, always to be respected as a brother in Christ, etc.</p>
