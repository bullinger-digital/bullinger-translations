    <p xml:id="regest1">Hospinian recently called his brother Christian [Hospinian (Wirth)] to his side for support due to a dispute that some of his in-laws have sparked. After all, no one can heal themselves! Rather, in the case of persistent illnesses, a doctor must be consulted. Bullinger should please excuse that Christian was forced to stay away from his congregation [in Bassersdorf] much longer than expected.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">What Christian reported about Bullinger greatly pleased Hospinian. For when a good friend [N.N.] warned him that his good reputation had been severely damaged (completely undeservedly!) by the nephew of Konrad Pellikan [Konrad Wolfhart (Lycosthenes)], Hospinian already believed that Bullinger no longer thought well of him. However, since he could not address him personally about it, he entrusted the matter to his brother [Christian]. Bullinger's opinion of him has always been important to him - indeed, it still is today and will (God willing) remain so in the future. For Hospinian, there is hardly anything more unbearable than hearing a bad word about himself in Bullinger's house! But his brother dispelled this fear by reporting that false rumors about Hospinian had never reached Bullinger's ears. Hospinian cannot even put into words how much joy this brought him! He would therefore like to ask Bullinger to continue treating him as he has done so far and not to deviate from the opinion that he is an honest and orthodox man who is fully dedicated to his ecclesiastical duties.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">In response to the accusation of his slanderers that he reveres academic degrees, Hospinian replies: God, who knows the hearts, knows that Hospinian does not chase after vain and arrogant titles but is content with his professorship. To make his view entirely clear to Bullinger, Hospinian gave copies of his two speeches held in Basel [not preserved] to his brother for Bullinger to read. Should Hospinian's opinion appear wrong to him, he should (for his love of Jesus Christ!) correct Hospinian. He is very willing to be taught better.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Greetings and best wishes to Bullinger along with his wife [Anna, n√©e Adlischwyler] and children.</p>

      <p>Greetings, most esteemed and learned Mr. Bullinger. In recent days, I called my brother Christian to my side because of the injuries inflicted upon me by some of my in-laws, so that he might be both my advocate and advisor in this matter. For no one can heal themselves, but (as they say) a doctor must be sought for one's own ailments. Since this matter was more prolonged and my brother was forced to be absent from his church longer than we had anticipated, I ask you to excuse him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>My brother reported things about you that greatly delighted and cheered me. For when a good friend warned me that Mr. Pellican's nephew had severely (though undeservedly and falsely) damaged my reputation with you, I came to the opinion that this had also happened with you. Therefore, since I could not address you on this matter myself, I entrusted the matter to my brother. For your authority has always been significant to me, and it still is today and will be in the future (God willing), so that hardly anything would seem more distressing and intolerable to me than to hear ill of myself from you. But my brother relieved me of this anxiety by saying that no negative rumors or reputation about me had ever reached your ears. Upon hearing this, it cannot be expressed how much joy I felt, and I have resolved to ask and beseech you not to be otherwise affected towards your Hospinian than I see and experience you to be, nor to think otherwise of him than as a sincere and candid man, well-instructed in orthodox religion, and wholly dedicated to ecclesiastical functions.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding the degrees (as they are called) from which you heard I stand, the Lord who knows the heart knows that I do not love vain and arrogant titles, but order. And to have my opinion on this matter fully known to you, I gave my brother two speeches I delivered here, written down, to offer you to read if you have the time. If my opinion seems erroneous to you, I ask you, my dear Mr. Bullinger, by the love of Christ, to admonish me. For I will most willingly yield to better teachings.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell most prosperously in the Lord Jesus with your wife and children, whom I greet most dutifully in my words. Given the day after the calends of February, in Basel, in the year of human salvation 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Hospinian.</p>
      <p>To the most knowledgeable man in divine and human letters, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, his lord and most esteemed patron in many respects. Zurich.</p>
