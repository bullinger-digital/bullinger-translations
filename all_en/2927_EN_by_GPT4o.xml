      <p>Greetings. The letter I wrote to you last month with our friend Laurentius Agricola, most esteemed among friends and brothers, was abrupt and somewhat neglected because I was overwhelmed with a multitude of tasks and concerns. Having returned from a long journey, I found many necessary matters at home that needed to be addressed during the very hours when Laurentius was preparing to leave. Hence, I did not mention that I had presented the Sum of Faith, meticulously compiled by you, to Prince Ottheinrich. I offered it to him while we were still in Höchstädt, elegantly bound, and not only did I adorn it with words as much as my stammering could, but I also recommended you to him as worthily and diligently as possible. He accepted the book with a certainly serene countenance and ordered many thanks to be conveyed to you. However, since theological matters are not very common to him and he relies more on the authority of others than on his own judgment and reason, he gave the book to 'Michael Diller', a minister of the word, to read, undoubtedly with the intention that he would evaluate it and form his own judgment.</p>
      <p>Then, after a few days had passed, when by chance your mention occurred between him and me, he said that you had stated that in the matter of the Lord's Supper, the presence of the body of Christ was nowhere established, from which I immediately sensed what kind of judgment had been conveyed to the prince. At that time, because I had not yet read the book, I could not oppose anything; but after reading it, I easily discovered that he had either erred or presented a bad interpretation. I clearly see the man's insincerity, which I could prove with many examples and reasons, and to hold one from many: it happened in Alzey, when I was appointed as the presiding officer in a religious matter and a question arose among learned and noble princely advisors about images in churches, then that Michael, who not long ago thought images should be removed, openly asserted that the image of the crucifix should be observed in churches; for God had ordered cherubim to be made, and the evangelists were not unwisely nor impiously depicted through brute animals; therefore, such pictures are entirely tolerable, etc. Behold a fine theologian with arguments and subtleties contrary to himself. I am weary of saying more about this. What was done and concluded in the matter of religion there would be too long and indeed tedious to recount. The end, however, is the ordinance of the Württemberg church, which must be held as sacred by Brenz, recently printed and published, yet under the title of Prince Ottheinrich. I opposed vigorously and seriously in the matter of baptism, as far as the words of contradiction, belief, and response are concerned, and also as far as the words concerning the offering of bread and wine in the Lord's Supper are concerned, namely, take, eat, this is the body of Christ, which is given for you, etc., and I protested that I would never consent to such a figment; nevertheless, the greater number of votes prevailed. And when I reported before the prince and the entire senate how the matter of religion had been handled by us, I said that all my colleagues agreed together, but I did not approve of those things I mentioned above, but would suffer intolerable attacks, moreover, so that I would not impose anything on my conscience, I offered my opinion in writing to the prince on how the church's formula could be rendered more correct, but in vain.</p>
      <p>I received one copy of Bertram, but now four copies of the Apology in two deliveries, and I have innumerable thanks for you as the most generous brother, and I suspect, praise, venerate, and adore God the Father and the sole author of things in his holy men, namely, and in praiseworthy instruments, who bestows so many and such great kinds of benefits on this most ungrateful world before it is consumed by fire. What, I ask, now remains, what is more hidden, that could be concealed from a Christian man seeking true salvation, if he would only want to, that he could not rightly say, indeed exclaim, "where shall I go, I have the words of life." I proclaim your Apology to be the Saxon hammer.</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen the refutations of Calvin and Bernhard, because books of this kind are rarely found here in the booksellers' shelves.</p>
      <p>The greatest gathering of soldiers has taken place at Werdea in Swabia and Augsburg, causing great terror among the inhabitants and neighbors, and no wonder, since no one knew against whom or by whom these movements were being made, until in these days the matter has been revealed to show that King Ferdinand is planning an expedition to Hungary, which is also confirmed by strong arguments, and the outcome will be indicated within a few days. Hence, people's minds have been rendered more peaceful; I hope we will have a tranquil summer unless Margrave Albert decides to avenge an injury.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is in men and body beyond nature, although not athletically, he is healthy, but in mind, he is weak.</p>
      <p>I am pleased to hear that the Swiss are peaceful. Perhaps the hope of Alpine aid has fallen, so they attempt less what they are planning. However, let them plan whatever they want, the better part will feel the Lord's help. I reluctantly hear of the marriage of the French and the Savoyard, especially the conditions and dowry agreements. However, a remedy can be applied to this ulcer as well.</p>
      <p>Now I am at home building, working, and never not exercising myself as much as my health can bear. I am entirely focused on how I can serve the church and the country to the best of my ability. I also feel that my efforts are pious, but the fruits and progress are not. Because I am certain of this and have it before my eyes, even if all of papism is abolished, a new and indeed much more pernicious one is at the threshold, with which we will also have to struggle greatly. All non-papist princes and cities are fighting for Lutheranism and not at all for Christianity, which can be seen in the Prussians, who now strive to force their own prince and lord to some unknown recantation and satisfaction of the church, although those men, however clamorous in the church, are more like wild asses than preachers of the word. But let these things pass.</p>
      <p>I will defend Laurentius not only to the altar but also to my blood, with God's help, although I do not have a single man to assist me. The prince relies on opinions; Michael is an excellent flatterer, I would even call him bilingual. The one truth lifts my heart, and that the adversaries are very stupid men, full of envy and malice.</p>
      <p>Tell our Gualter that I could not write to him now due to the haste of the messenger, who will first carry this letter of mine to Augsburg; however, he should persuade himself and firmly believe that friendship and memory of him have never left my mind.</p>
      <p>I know indeed how great and in what place that man should be held, as well as all your fellow students, whom I wish to be greeted most earnestly along with the consuls, the chief scribe, and the entire assembly of good men. Farewell.</p>
      <p>The affairs of the empire are in their former order without stability; however, I hope for better things now than a little before. Farewell again and consider these hastily written words kindly.</p>
      <p>I am keeping my Jonah, now in his nineteenth year, at home and instructing him in domestic matters, since he did not want to progress in letters, yet against my own inclination. You will greet your sons-in-law individually. May 20th, in the year etc. 56.</p>
      <p>Your Georgius Laetus from Lemnicz etc.</p>
      <p>Daughter Affra gave birth on the 17th of July to her firstborn son from her husband Rudolf Khaib, who today received the baptismal bath with godparents Master Laurentius Agricola, Doctor Johannes Gemelius, and the wife of Christoph Arnold, from which it can be gathered whether I evade pure doctrine and clean Christianity. Farewell, my man, and pray to the Lord that he may make and preserve me as a righteous man.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious lord Heinrich Bullinger, faithful servant of the church of Zurich, my gracious lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
