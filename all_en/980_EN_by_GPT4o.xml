      <p>S. It has recently been decreed by the senate and the people that Hagius and Rosina should not be joined in marriage.</p>
      <p>Thus, through the usual means of greed, it was arranged that both renounced their rights as citizens, with our people clearly not opposing, since they finally and openly confessed that they had established a marriage through clandestine love; which I indeed believe was persuaded by those same people, at whose discretion the entire shameless act has been concocted. But we entrust these matters to God the avenger.</p>
      <p>A nest is now being sought in which the married couple may reside abroad, with Juno favoring this union. But also, some foreign relatives have settled the betrothal and the agreements have been made with great trust on both sides, which the senate does not value at all, however much they promise to reconcile with this matter in the future.</p>
      <p>The Reichstag is supposed to have been extended until Michaelmas; this is what we have received in writing from Nuremberg today. Few of the princes are still in Augsburg; the clergy: Cologne, Mainz, and Eichst√§tt, are present. The Emperor is with 2000 men on horseback and foot at Munich and Landshut, thus traveling; and it is said in bad terms that Heintz of Brunswick has been defeated.</p>
      <p>His son Philip must return to Spain, the Moors and Saracens, Dragut are causing great troubles, so much so that the King of Portugal is in fear that he might be deprived of his kingdom at Lisbon. The Emperor does not want to grant the princes a safe conduct; this will not lead to good blood. The Spanish monarchy and the unheard-of servitude of the Germans are feared. Therefore, one must look out for oneself. May God undertake with grace and mercy for His own. Amen.</p>
      <p>The inheritance of our citizen Hansen Wiken, deceased, has been settled as of today. The gentlemen from Zurich have amicably settled the clarification of the same and reported that my lords have behaved kindly and friendly. To the bishop, the superior knights, along with the three siblings of his wife, 120 guilders have been granted out of grace; that is 30 florins each.</p>
      <p>30 guilders have been gifted to the orphans of Fattlin, the carpenter, by my lords of Zurich and due to your and Mr. Gwalter's intercession. What remains will be received by Mr. Tumbysen's sister; in my opinion, after all deductions, it will amount to 700 guilders. This is well granted to each part, and we are, thank God, very grateful and well-disposed towards a city like Zurich. Farewell. On the fifth day of August in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most deserving bishop of the city of Zurich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
