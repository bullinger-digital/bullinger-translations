      <p>Highly learned, worthy, pious, prudent, wise, gracious, kind, dear lords. We send you our friendly, humble, willing service beforehand, gracious, dear lords.</p>
      <p>We have carefully heard what your wisdom has written to us regarding Hans Landenberg, the town scribe, and we have deliberated on it, gathered to discuss it, and found much, namely, as your wisdom mentioned in your letter, that the aforementioned Hans Landenberg, the town scribe, and his wife lead an improper, unsuitable lifestyle and conduct themselves in an indecent, scandalous manner with clothing, etc. It is not without reason; it has come to our attention over the years and times how they engage in discord, quarrels, and swearing (cursing) with each other, and also regarding the clothing his wife wears, we have sent both of them to our judges, warned and reprimanded (admonished) them, and told them to refrain from such behavior. However, how they continue with such quarrels and swearing is not well known to us, as we are not daily in their house, so something always comes to our attention in the end. Yet, regarding the inappropriate clothing that his wife wears, it is not, but rather God-clothed, that we think it is not fitting for her to wear such things. Furthermore, regarding the indecent behavior of useless people, and also regarding those who are contrary to our holy faith, and regarding the hospitality, it is no less; he occasionally holds such hospitality, though not as much as before (as you will hear later, we have reprimanded and admonished him for it), because we did not understand that he has given meals since then, well to the day laborers he has given, so there are also some strangers whom we consider not very favorable to our faith, who at times have their behavior and residence always (constantly) with drinking at his place. Regarding the coarse words, his wife occasionally uses them in the butcher shop, but how they follow in the house is not known to us, well to think how they are in open behavior or position, from which Hans has learned, that she continues to do so. Regarding church attendance, Hans has been more diligent since the carnival, since we have reprimanded him with words, but his wife occasionally comes, when it suits her, on a Sunday (dressed like a noblewoman) to the sermon and soon leaves again and on weekdays not at all. Furthermore, regarding the breaking of our commandments with the hospitality, which they have held on certain Ash Wednesdays, it has been as follows: When we then abolished the carnival and Ash Wednesdays in good Christian intention, some of our citizens went to buy fish, which they ate in his house as a snack, in which they had day meals, night meals, and drinking bouts, in which drinking bout they came into discord with each other, so far that they pulled at each other and a small bloodshed occurred. We have taken such offenders before us and punished them for such offenses, and also presented Hans to be punished before us, after we heard him, we then truly washed and instructed him regarding such matters, also regarding church attendance, likewise regarding hospitality and the indecent behavior of those who are contrary to our holy faith, and also regarding all matters.</p>
      <p>Such, gracious, dear lords, we are informed of their behavior (although perhaps more is involved, yet such is not known to us, because an authority always comes to the last thing), for if we were further informed, it would not be withheld from you, for we are always inclined, as far as our ability reaches, to eliminate shame and vice and also to assist those who would like to eradicate such things, to which your honorable wisdom is well pleased and commanded to always comply and fulfill according to our ability.</p>
      <p>Dated Thursday before Albanus, in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Mayor and council of Winterthur.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, worthy, pious, prudent, and wise appointed of an honorable council and the entire synod of the city and land of Zurich, our gracious, dear lords.</p>
