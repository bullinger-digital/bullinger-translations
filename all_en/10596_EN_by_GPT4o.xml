      <p>My friendly greetings and always willing service beforehand, venerable, highly learned Master Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Regarding your effort, writing, and faithful warning, firstly concerning the priest or abbot of St. Gallen and the clerk from Pfäffikon, and then the new tidings regarding the "Müsser", as contained in the copy you sent me, I have understood well and have also written to my gracious lords of Bern (along with other news from the countrymen, which was written to me on this date by our gracious lords, our faithful, dear confederates from Zurich, also concerning the aforementioned Müsser and Eck von Reischach), which I have received with great thanks.</p>
      <p>Thank you also diligently for such faithful warnings and good will with further earnest request and desire, if you have further information, especially if it might be detrimental to the divine word and my gracious lords, to always inform me. I am always obliged to you in the same and more.</p>
      <p>With this, may God keep you in His grace and protection.</p>
      <p>Given on the 21st of March in the year 1535, etc.</p>
      <p>Your particularly good friend and brother Sulpitius Haller, chief bailiff of Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly learned lord, Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the word of the city of Zurich, my particularly good patron.</p>
