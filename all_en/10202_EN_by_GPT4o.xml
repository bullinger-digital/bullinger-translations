    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to Bucer's letter No. 169 and comments on his criticism of Leo Jud. The people of Zürich are brothers of the people of Strasbourg as well as of Luther, if only he would show goodwill. Bullinger once again explains the Zürich understanding of the Lord's Supper. If Cyril is considered a witness for Luther's standpoint, then Bullinger cites Tertullian, to whom other Church Fathers have also adhered. The people of Zürich do not deserve to be labeled as interpreters and enthusiasts by the Lutherans.</p>

      <p>You ask for a response from me, most learned Bucer, because Leo is too thorny, but I fear that I too may seem prickly if you judge Leo's gentle nature to be harsh. I am utterly weary of this dispute, but I am pleased that you, having grown tired of these matters, finally add: we are brothers, nothing more about this matter. For we are indeed your brothers, and even Luther's, if he wishes. For who ever called the baker's bread with Eck the Eucharist? Who ever called it mere bread? We denied that the bread is the body of Christ, and not in every way, but substantially, naturally, corporally, locally. For we confess that the sacred bread is a symbol, a mystery, and a sacrament. Moreover, a sacrament is a sign of a sacred thing. Now if for Luther a single Cyril, among the ancients more recent, holds so much weight, how is it that the exposition of the older and more learned Tertullian, who explained these words of Christ "This is my body" as "This is the figure of my body," does not defend us? Jerome, Augustine, and Ambrose, who followed him later, frequently used the term "signifying." What then have we done to deserve being called interpreters, enthusiasts, and dreamers by them? If Cyril's authority is so great that Luther rightly uses the word "corporally," then we, relying on the scriptures and the fathers, hold and teach, and since you admit: we are brothers, no apology is needed. We have not delivered, but your letters were read by some brothers. But no more words. Let Luther teach, let him allow us to use our own, let him be a brother, and we will prove to be brothers.</p>
