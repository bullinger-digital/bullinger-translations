      <p>Greetings. You are not wrong to doubt whether I have received the books you sent me as a gift, since I have been more negligent in this matter than I should have been. Indeed, since I cannot reciprocate equally with you, I have not even given any sign of gratitude; the fault is more evident than I can deny, and more serious than you should ignore. I confess, but the fault does not rest with me alone; for the one who brought me the last ones also bears some part of it, because he did not come to me again and left faster than we expected. But this is not a sufficient reason to excuse me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since I cannot deny it, I am compelled to apologize; I acknowledge the fault, forgive me for admitting my negligence. I willingly yield and confess that I am surpassed by you in benefits, but I do not think I am surpassed in love; for I hold you in the highest regard and consider all your things most pleasing. I wish you to be convinced of this once and for all; even if I do not always seem to show it openly, he who sees all and hears all is my witness. I showed your sermons on Jeremiah to some; they not only approve of them greatly but also admire your immense labors and tireless dedication. Therefore, while others argue among themselves with the most odious and virulent pamphlets about trivial matters, quarrel, and attack each other with mutual insults, continue to deserve well of the church and all posterity with such most useful writings. This will be the reward of your work, this is what befits a true ecclesiastic; piety is promoted in this way, not by disputes, not by quarrels, not by insults, not by altercations. Forgive me, I beg, if I seem to you to be too vehement in this matter; you cannot believe how much certain pamphlets, to put it mildly, annoy and upset me, with which we are now almost daily overwhelmed. Just as Africa is said to be fertile in monsters, so Germany, especially the more northern part, is too prolific in monstrous pamphlets, which cannot be said to bring anything but disgust to good and wise men; on the contrary, your and Dr. Peter Martyr's commentaries are highly commended and rightly so by the same people, who now eagerly buy and read them, even those who recently did not approve of his doctrine in all respects. But enough about these things.</p>
      <p>The war in the Netherlands is not yet completely settled; both sides have indeed ceased from arms, and the army has been partly led into winter quarters, partly disbanded and dismissed, a large part of which is said to be making its way here, and therefore the devastation of our fields and the plundering of villages is feared. But the conditions between the kings have not yet been agreed upon; both are young, both are powerful and tenacious of their purpose, and therefore neither can be easily moved from their position. The French king has taken several places from the other; Philip excels in cavalry and desires to have everything restored to himself and to Savoy and others that was taken from them.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while the dispute is carried on not with arms but with words on both sides, a huge amount of money is being spent, and many people are perishing either from disease or cold or lack of necessities. Never in human memory has there been a greater preparation on both sides, never more soldiers gathered on both sides, and yet nothing worthy of such great efforts has been accomplished, nor does any hope of peace seem to shine forth, nor are there any just truces; but each, as if tired, as if exhausted and like a defeated man, withdraws to safe and peaceful places, and as far as can be conjectured from most actions, each would prefer, if they could, to withdraw honorably from arms; but each is ashamed to concede anything to the other. Although Philip's spirit seems somewhat shaken and his ferocity blunted either because of the death of his parent or because of the English affairs which are not at all pleasing to him; for, as has been reliably reported, Charles the father, who was recently exalted by so many triumphs and victories and terrified the whole Christian world with his name alone, and seemed almost about to overthrow Jupiter from heaven, after abdicating the empire on the seventh of October, indeed outside the empire in a certain corner of Spain, having laid aside his titles, insignia, and fasces, died obscurely and, so to speak, unnoticed. A few days later, his sister Leonora, who was married to Francis, the king of the French, ceased to be among the living, for whom King Henry took care to have funeral honors performed as a stepmother. Then not much time passed before the other sister Maria also died.</p>
      <p>You would say they conspired among themselves so that they did not want to survive each other. In England, we could not know for a long time what had happened; for all the ports facing France and Germany were closed, so that no one could leave, no one could enter, and Philip was said to have suddenly recalled the head of the delegation sent to France, from which many not unreasonably conjectured that either the queen, who had long struggled with very serious illnesses, was dead or some great disturbances had arisen.</p>
      <p>Now, however, both from the letters of many and from not unfounded rumors, our people have recently become certain that Mary has died and that Elizabeth, not without much contention, has been brought to the helm of the kingdom and greeted as queen with the favorable acclamations of the greater part of the people. What ceremonies are usually employed in such a matter by that nation, I cannot say; they say there is a huge palace there called tristegum, that is, divided into three stories, in the highest of which bishops and princes meet, in the middle the nobles, and in the lowest the cities and plebeian delegates. Among those three orders, there were initially different opinions; for the priests had almost drawn the entire nobility to their side. But the better and undoubtedly also the greater part prevailed; for the middle order finally joined with the lower. But about these matters, ask the English who are with you; I seem to be quite inept, who do not fear to write so prolixly about matters little known to me. Forgive me for writing somewhat more verbosely and freely, having found some leisure.</p>
      <p>Greet our common friends and brothers, especially Dr. Peter Martyr and Fries, Gwalther, and others.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, the day before the calends of December.</p>
      <p>Petrus Dasypodius, entirely yours.</p>
