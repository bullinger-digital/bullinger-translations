      <p>Greetings. The recent letters you sent to me, along with a copy of Leo's letter to my colleague Megander, dearest Heinrich, which I received and when, seem entirely worth knowing. On January 17th, that minister from Solothurn came, bringing your and Leo's letters to all of us, and then also Leo's to Megander. When we read them together, on the 19th, your letters to me were returned with Leo's copy, but opened and with Megander's title erased. He, as they were indeed given to him, returned them to me. I am then truly afraid that he might be angry with both you and me and suspect what we are doing. I wish, I say, that such suspicion (if there is any) be removed from his heart and that he clearly knows why we agree so well among ourselves. Meanwhile, you will ensure that Leo - otherwise very dear to me - does not become indignant with you for sending his letters to me. I know how much these two have loved each other so far, so that neither this nor any letter can easily separate them, for we indeed agree very well among ourselves. Furthermore, I am not unaware of the integrity with which Caspar has dealt with me in this matter. Therefore, it must be ensured that no discord is spread among us for such a trivial reason. I certainly grieved and spent sleepless nights fearing that these letters, so fraudulently opened, might become the seed of future enmity among us all. So, dearest Heinrich, make sure to obtain forgiveness from both. For if they had not been intercepted by someone's fraud, opened, and finally returned to Megander, no mortal would have ever extorted them from me, but I would have returned them in good faith, as you wished. It will be easy for Megander and Leo to agree among themselves, as long as you and Leo do so repeatedly. Therefore, with your prudence and kindness, clear all this up, and hope the best for all of us, just as we do for you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Last day of January, year 35.</p>
      <p>Yours, Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
