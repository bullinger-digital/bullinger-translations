      <p>Gracious and trusted, dear lord and friend. I thank you for your letter and will carry out your command with Jorgen Frölich, also sending him your letter, which Gastius entrusted to me. People are waiting for news from France and especially from the Netherlands, regarding what the king will decide with Margrave Albrecht, Count Jos, Hieronymus Cötzlin, and other leaders. I am confident that I will learn and give you an oral report. I have information from credible people, who are not far from Brunswick, about many things, namely how the city was supposed to be betrayed by an abbot and who, alongside the abbot, as a nobleman sent by Mr. Heinrich, arranged it and how the matter ended with negotiations and in other ways, all the details. Also, what Duke Augustus is negotiating with his brother Duke Moritz and how the same Augustus wants nothing from the old elector's land and in what concerns Duke Moritz stands, also that all want to hear nothing of the Interim, preferring to lose dear life, livelihood, and property, also that they are fighting against wearing the choir mantles and say that only Pomeranus and no one else agreed to it, I will also reveal to you orally.</p>
      <p>With high and friendly diligence, I ask you to kindly persuade my lord mayor, Mr. Dietrich, and his wife not to rush with the principal sum. I know ways that they can hardly come to money; I will advise the lady not to delay the sale of her goods in Schwatz any longer.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to you. Given in Basel on the 28th of February in the year 50.</p>
      <p>Gabriel Arnold.</p>
      <p>To my gracious and trusted dear lord and friend Master Heinrich Bullinger, to be delivered personally.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
