    <p xml:id="regest1">He has heard of the unrest caused by his "Retractations," although they contain nothing that goes beyond the [First Helvetic] Confession or other recognized texts; his ["Report from the Holy Scripture"] was even approved by Bullinger without being asked. In the "Retractations," he confesses, on the one hand, to having attributed a doctrine of the sacraments to Luther and his followers, which they actually oppose, and on the other hand, to having rejected certain expressions that are in agreement with the Scripture and the Fathers. He has admitted to having one-sidedly sought the fault with the opposing party, but he speaks only for himself and is ready to face criticism at a meeting, as no Christian can settle for being considered a traitor to the truth. He asks for a response. In view of the Schmalkaldic League, he calls for prayer and assures that he only wanted good for the [Swiss] churches.</p>

      <p>To the people of Zürich and other Swiss brothers, that they may hear us. Grace and peace to the observant in the Lord, fellow believers and brothers. I hear that you are again troubled by my "Retractations," or rather by those who report and interpret them in a less than favorable manner. However, if you wish to be fair and true judges, you will find nothing in my "Retractations" (at least in my judgment) that is not already present in your Basel Confession, and which I have not approved to you several times. Certainly, the excellent man, H. Bullinger, without any provocation from me, received our writing to the Monasterians in such a way that he wrote to me, stating that I had given testimony to his spirit in that book, expressed his mind, and thus bound him to me even more. I confess to two faults in my "Retractations." One, that I attributed to Luther and his followers a clearly impious opinion about the word and sacraments, which they were the first to oppose, and today they oppose much more successfully than I do. For I seem to myself to be very shameless if I arrogate to myself even a tenth of the success with which they preach that we obtain salvation not by any works, but by the merit of Christ alone. The other, that I rejected certain expressions about the power of the word and sacraments, which both Scripture and the Holy Fathers have always used piously. Certain importunate writings of theirs led me astray, but more so my own carelessness, confidence, and contempt of Christ in them. I know well enough that the sin lies on the other side, but this concerns me: the righteous is an accuser of himself at the beginning. In the Church of Christ, each one confesses his own sins, not those of others. The world has this custom to conceal its own sins and proclaim those of others. However, I both ought and wish to admonish them in the place of their sins. I did not want to involve you and yours in my "Retractations" as much as possible, although it would be much better for them to review their own as men. But these are my "Retractations," and it is your judgment about them. I can testify to my intention as it is known to me. However, I impose too much on myself, it is your task to know the deed. It is for the Lord and those who decide from the Spirit of the Lord to judge both. Therefore, I advise and beseech you, recognize that nothing is gained by the detractions which I have endured from brothers there for several years, much is hindered, and take the path against me which you know shows the zeal of Christ and true charity, and which you know all the men of God, all the ancients, have taken. Call a meeting of the Saints, whom you judge to be suitable, call me, and having heard and convicted me of my errors, condemn me. I do not wish to judge; I am a part, you are also a part, yet meet and hear me, I will commit myself to your judgment. If you do not wish to hear, you should not judge, much less condemn. The Father has given all judgment to the Son. It is not to be endured, brothers, that any Christian should be considered a traitor to the truth of Christ or a deserter of the churches. I beseech you to deign to respond to what my prayers have obtained from you. Farewell in the Lord. Strasbourg, January 27, 1537.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord that the assembly now being convened at Schmalkalden may decide everything according to His Spirit.</p>
      <p>M. Bucer, who always wished to deserve well, never ill, from your churches, however his services towards you may have fallen or been received. To the most learned and most religious men and ministers of Christ of the churches of Basel, Bern, and Zürich, brothers to be observed in the Lord.</p>
