    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] There is hardly anything to report, but the messenger [...] should not go to Zurich without a letter. Lavater knows from Richard Hilles that Bullinger's silence is due to important official business.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] He received a handbook with forms of address for his father [Hans Rudolf], whose simple expressions will undoubtedly please him more than the artificial formulations common at courts. The book contains good rhetorical instructions and teaches how to address everyone according to their rank and office. In this regard, Lavater is allowed a remark: The pompous titles that Emperor Charles V uses in his letters to the Confederates are probably only meant to dazzle the latter. The Emperor has only one thing in mind: to split the forces of the Schmalkaldic League in order to better seize them and restore the rule [of the papacy]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Certainly, the people of Zurich are already well informed about the capitulation of Frankfurt and the peace treaty between Duke Ulrich of Württemberg and the Emperor. This should prompt them to think about their future strategy. Landgrave Philip of Hesse has gathered numerous troops, and the traitor Duke Maurice of Saxony is said to have been expelled by Elector John Frederick of Saxony.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] A garrison is now deployed in Strasbourg. Artillery has been installed on the fortifications. They are preparing for a siege. Spaniards carrying war booty were intercepted.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] But without God's help, Germany is lost and given over to the Turks! In view of the Spanish Inquisition raging in the Netherlands, many, and not without reason, would rather be subjects of the Turks than of the Emperor. And yet it is still claimed that religion is not his concern!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The terrible war in Germany affects Lavater's landlord [Matthias Zell] so much that it is believed he will soon die. Moreover, the Strasbourg Gymnasium is likely to be dissolved, as the prospects are poor due to the war. Johannes Sturm, who has returned from his embassy, was finally able to resume his teaching. He is currently dictating a writing in which the sophistic fallacies are refuted and the foundations of rhetoric are presented.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Lavater had previously asked to be informed how long he could study in Strasbourg so that he could better organize his studies. Unfortunately, he received no answer, which has already had bad consequences! Had he known he would stay in Strasbourg for so long, he would have attended the newly beginning lectures on Aristotle's "Politics" by Justus Velsius and the lectures on the basics of arithmetic by Christian Herlin. However, he refrained from doing so because he was afraid of acquiring the corresponding books in vain. Until recently, he completed the upper class instruction with great benefit and is now enjoying a good education in rhetoric and dialectics. He now wishes to attend the lectures on Euclid's [Elements]. After the end of the war, he hopes to benefit from a new academy. Bullinger should advocate for this with his parents [Hans Rudolf and Anna, née Röichli]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Until the outbreak of war, the University of Wittenberg enjoyed a very good reputation thanks to the daily lectures of Philipp Melanchthon. If only Lavater could hear this philosopher someday! However, he fears that the war will exhaust the so famous Melanchthon and Joachim Camerarius [the Elder] so much that they will no longer be able to carry out their teaching activities as before.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Lavater would write more often about the situation of the city and the church of Strasbourg, but he does not know what interests Bullinger and whether his reports would reach Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Bullinger should remain with the church as long as possible!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Greetings from Zell. Lavater sends greetings to his parents, as well as Anna [née Adlischwyler], the children, and Bullinger's entire household.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although I have nothing to write to you, I am sending this letter so that the messenger does not come to you empty-handed. I would be surprised that you have not written to me, if I did not know from Mr. Richard that you are so occupied with more serious matters that you do not have the free time to spend on writing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I received the handbook of letter forms addressed to my father, but I have no doubt that my father will be more pleased with the simple form than with the courtly and artificial one. And I do not see, if I compare it to the precepts of better rhetoricians, what is lacking. For it contains the name, the condition of life, and dignity, and, to speak freely what I feel, I greatly fear that Emperor Charles (Karl) with his magnificent titles imposes on the Swiss, so that they believe he speaks from the heart, while in the meantime he seeks only this one thing: to oppress the unsuspecting by dividing the forces of the Kingdom and to restore the impious tyranny of the Antichrist.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I would write about the disgraceful capitulation of Frankfurt and the Duke of Württemberg, and the conditions of peace, which I have read, if I did not think that all these things are well known to you. And they rightly ought to stir you to carefully consider what you should do. Landgrave Philip (Philipp) has gathered large forces; where he will lead them, we do not know. The traitor Maurice (Moritz), who is well known, has been expelled from his native seats by Duke Frederick (Friedrich).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>A garrison has been imposed on our city, and although everything is full of fear and deceit, they are preparing for a siege, occupying the fortifications with war machines. They have captured some Spaniards laden with spoils.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Unless God brings help to the weary affairs, it is already over for Germany; for the way is opened to the Turks. And many, not without reason, prefer to obey the Turks rather than the Emperor. The Spanish Inquisition is now held in Lower Germany. For our Emperor, religion is not a concern!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>These warlike movements and the degenerate Germans so torment the mind of my lord that we think he will not have a long use of this life. As for the camp of the Muses, I fear they will dismiss the school, as no happy outcome of this war is open. Mr. Sturm, who has been occupied with warlike matters until now, has returned to the long-interrupted duty of reading. And recently he began to dictate a book on sophistic fallacies, on arrangement, and on the question: Treatises very useful for all parts of life. His absence always greatly inconveniences the school.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I remember writing to you in previous times, that if it could be done, you would mark the time allowed for the study journey, or at least the time I must remain in Strasbourg, so that I could better organize the order of my studies and see what I should learn each year, lest I hinder myself more by the variety of things than I could advance. Since you neglected this, I now finally see how much harm it has caused. For I could have heard the beginning of Aristotle's "Politics" from the most learned Mr. Justus Velsius and the principles of arithmetic from Christian Herlin. But since I thought I could not complete it, I did not want to acquire the books for myself and only hear the beginning. Until now, I have almost heard the lectures of the first class. I have now obtained a greater benefit and use of rhetoric and dialectics. Soon I hope to hear Euclid with some others. After this unfortunate war is settled and some new academy is established, I hope you will also be an advisor to my parents, so that I may have some use of it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Shortly before this unfortunate war broke out, the school of Wittenberg was very well established through the efforts of Philipp Melanchthon, for he exercised the students daily by reading. If only I could hear this most illustrious philosopher someday! I fear, however, that this unfortunate storm will so weary the great men of this age, Philipp and Camerarius, that afterwards, as much as they wish and desire, they will not be able to undertake.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I would write more often to you about our affairs and the church, but I do not know what you wish to know, and what you would receive from me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I pray to the most good and great God, that He may preserve you most happily for the falling church as long as possible!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Mr. Matthias wishes you well. Also, in my name, do not disdain to greet your most honorable wife, your sweetest children, and your whole family and my parents. In Strasbourg, from the house of Mr. Matthaeus Zell, on the 7th day before the calends of February in the year 1547. Yours sincerely, Lud. Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, the Antistes of the Church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered father. In Zurich.</p>
