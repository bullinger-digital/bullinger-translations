      <p>Greetings. For a long time, I have not written any letters to you, honorable brother, nor have I received any from you in return. But I am certain that you still hold me in affection. For I also honor and love you in the Lord. Yet I am continually anxious, lamenting that nothing can be achieved by the pious in restoring the covenant. Our willingness would not be lacking if the opportunity were present. Now, since I can do nothing in this matter, which many have so far despaired of, I turn to prayers, certain that all good things are obtained from Almighty God through faithful prayers. May the Lord grant your magistrate the spirit and also the Bernese the disposition to desire what is fair and good on both sides. Pray to the Lord as well. I have no doubt that you do this. The Lord so governs the affairs of His church that, when they seem to grant too much to men, He suspends all things from Himself, having driven all men far away.</p>
      <p>Our best old man, Pellicanus, has died, which I have no doubt you have already heard. Doctor Peter Martyr has been called to his place. For he, having returned from England, has kindly committed himself to me. He came to us on the 17th of this month, safe and sound, and was received with public joy by all. For he was elected with unanimous votes. May the Lord bless us and may He wish this to be happy and prosperous for us.</p>
      <p>From Germany, we have much news about the fury of the Lutherans. The princes are diligently cautious in reforming the churches, so that no orthodox person is admitted, but only the Lutherans are sought. The best and most holy man, Johannes a Lasco, conferred with Brenz, but at the end of the colloquy, I hear the Prince urged him to accept or acknowledge the Augsburg Confession and to unite his foreign church with the churches of Germany, etc. Did I not predict this would happen? If a thousand colloquies are held, we will act in vain with these people.</p>
      <p>Experience will prove it. Meanwhile, I do not despair. For I hope the Lord will provide some opportunity for more advantageous action. Let us pray here as well that the Lord does not abandon us and all of Germany. I hear we must fight again at the next fair. May the Lord our God be with us.</p>
      <p>I commend to you the Englishmen Lever and his companion. Greet them on my behalf. I have received their letters but could not respond now. Farewell with all the brothers and with the whole church. May the Lord Jesus keep you all and especially protect you for us for a long time. All of ours greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 26, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Doctor Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, most esteemed lord and honorable brother and dear friend.</p>
