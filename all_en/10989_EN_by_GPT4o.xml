    <p xml:id="regest1">Is not ready to accept the Four Cities and the Augsburg Confession; if Luther should reject the Swiss Confession, new concessions would only endanger their unity. Would like to see the position of the Strasbourg [on the council question]. [Hans] Klotz Escher has died; there is no shortage of such boors.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You ask what I think should be done if Luther does not approve of our confession. I believe Luther should be left behind and we should adhere to the confessed truth. I see that the advice to accept confessions pleases none of our people. Indeed, we once wanted to accept the confession of the four cities, but the Bernese opposed it. What do you think they will do if they hear that the Saxon confession is also to be accepted? Thus, we would be divided. What need is there for words? We have written a confession, we have unanimously agreed to it, let us persevere in it. When have we been led around enough? Why is our matter so bitter to the people? But I knew well in advance that, as long as we do not sign the Saxon confession with Luther, there would be no peace. In short, it is nothing but bluster and arrogance. For our confession is short, clear, and truthful; yet it is worth nothing, and they want to suppress it. Is that not bluster? Therefore, let us remain in the unity we have begun. If it is nothing with Luther, then I absolutely want nothing to do with the matter. I do not say this because of Zwingli, whom I know to be entirely ours, but because of the promises of those who have so far fed us with vain hope. And it seems to me that the matter will be less and less important as time goes on. Therefore, it must be out of my mind.</p>
      <p>I would like to see the consultation on the articles of the people of Strasbourg, which has 13 points. I will faithfully return it with the next messenger.</p>
      <p>Farewell and give my regards to Grynaeus along with the fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>February 12, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Hans Klotz Escher has passed away. Yet we do not lack such boors. We also have imitators.</p>
