      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I ask that you attribute the fact that I write to you less frequently either to business or to the scarcity of messengers. My place of residence is somewhat remote from public roads, so I rarely encounter those who are going to you. Moreover, the affairs of the church and domestic matters claim me so much that I have less time to inquire about a messenger. The Lord knows otherwise how often this mind here longs to converse with you. At present, I commend to you the bearer of this letter, about whom Sultzer also writes.</p>
      <p>I have acted much and diligently on his behalf, even in the assembly of both senates, and at first, it was indeed obtained that the senate seriously wrote on his behalf to the Bishop of Pruntrut (Porrentruy), by whose chains he was detained. But he was scarcely released and not forced to abjure the sincere religion he had embraced; however, he was banished by oath ten miles from the diocese of Basel. Since this was very harsh for a good man and against the more recent edicts of the empire, we tried again to obtain from the bishop through the people of Mulhouse (Mülhausen) and Count Georg that the bishop would remit this oath; but so far in vain.</p>
      <p>Hence, he is compelled to leave the nearby places around us, and Sultzer advised that he should undertake a journey to Glarus (Glarona). Therefore, if you can help a good and simple man in any way, you will have done well and also a favor to me; we owe this to those who defect from the Antichrist to Christ not without temptations. I did not want to recount his entire story, which you will be able to hear from him in person.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I want you to know about our city that our magistrate has recently prohibited under the penalty of death and loss of all fortunes, that no one should go into military service either to the King of France or to any other lord; may they remain steadfast in their purpose and truly repent of the bloody counsels (as they wish to appear). Our captain Chalibeus, but made golden from steel, after his long-standing defiance and serious hostilities, which he exercised against me more than others, has finally humbled himself these days, promised repentance (whether sincerely, God knows), and even separately asked for my forgiveness.</p>
      <p>This is what I rejoice in (even if I doubt the true repentance of him and others) for this reason, that I see the people more and more abhor that bloody alliance and that my cries, with which I vehemently attacked all those who were responsible for these evils, have not been entirely in vain, so much so that the consul himself and others have openly confessed to me that if those sermons, which are now being held, had been delivered at the time when this web was being woven, neither the senate nor the citizens would ever have been ensnared in the traps in which they are now miserably bound.</p>
      <p>Therefore, pray with us for our church and magistrate, that the Lord may forgive us this fault and that He may further advance what has been begun; for I have hope that if this devil is expelled, it will once be that other good things will follow. Farewell together with each of the brothers and this church of Christ, most dear to me.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the calends of June.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his venerable brother.</p>
