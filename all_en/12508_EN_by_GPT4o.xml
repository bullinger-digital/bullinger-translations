      <p>Grace and peace through Christ Jesus, our Lord. Amen. Worthy, well and highly learned Master Heinrich, my letter is not special, as I have received your letter and have faithfully understood it, and I can imagine that it is as you have written. For unfortunately, here this year, almost everywhere, the opinion prevails, and the lack is as you have written. May God, through His help and grace, soon improve it.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Nevertheless, I express to you my friendly and diligent thanks for your kind, inclined, and good will with the desire to deserve (reciprocate) this.</p>
      <p>With that, I commend you to the grace of the faithful God. In haste, on June 14, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant Felix Schmid.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to my gracious lord's hands.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
