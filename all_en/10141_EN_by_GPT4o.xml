    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to the threat posed by the Turks, the Emperor desires peace in Germany. There is a danger for the Protestants, against whom the Emperor could then proceed. Landgrave Philip of Hesse and a few cities are the only reliable protectors of the Protestant cause. Has heard of the danger that Zurich is in. Wishes for news about it. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Although the threat of the Turks, greater than our forces, looms over us and the Emperor now acknowledges this and therefore desires a peaceful Germany, the papists, having found a leader in their obstinacy in Joachim of Brandenburg, are so determined that the matter of restoring concord among us is neglected until a council is convened. Meanwhile, the tyrant of the Turks seems to decide to wear us down and gradually conquer us. He seeks an opportunity, namely, to break us with minimal risk to his own and make us subservient to him, as he has done with other kingdoms. May the Lord be with us! Philip of Hesse, along with a few republics, has finally prevailed so that neither you nor others are to be excluded from the agreements of this concord, if any are established. He alone - among the princes, of course; regarding the faith of our people, I believe you have no doubts - properly fulfills the Christian duty, as he considers all who believe in Christ equally. Soon, I hope not to the common detriment of us all, the assembly will have to be dissolved. May the Lord grant that they decide what is to the glory of Christ! It has been reported here about the danger you have been in. Please, inform us. Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, July 12.</p>
      <p>Martin Bucer, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>Greet Leo, Pelican, Bibliander, and the others in our name.</p>
      <p>To the truly most pious and uniquely learned Heinrich, pastor of the church in Zurich, a brother to be respected.</p>
