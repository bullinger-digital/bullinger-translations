    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] After Haller has already written twice [with No. 2970 and No. 2972], he must report a third time about an even greater evil! As he was waiting for the departure of the Swiss messenger [...], Wolfgang Musculus came to him and reported that the Augsburg councilors had taken away his church, the Augsburg Cathedral, and made it available to Emperor Charles V for the celebration of Mass! This inflicted the worst possible suffering on the pastors (who are rightly filled with zeal for the house of God), against which they are powerless! It seems as if all pastors are gradually being driven out of their churches and removed from their offices. Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria is already claiming the Church of St. Ulrich, in whose adjacent monastery he is housed. Likewise, the provost of Holy Cross [Bernhard Werlin] and that of the Augustinian Canons' St. George [Jakob Wiedemann] have appeared before the Emperor to regain possession [of their premises and benefices]. The canons of St. Moritz will certainly also drive out Haller and Michael Keller, especially since the St. Moritz Abbey in Augsburg was as powerful as that [of the Grossm√ºnster] in Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Hopefully, the response letter from the Zurich authorities, which Haller is expecting, will show that the latter have recognized the deceitful situation in Augsburg and do not want to leave Haller there any longer. He and his colleagues can continue to preach, but they are allowed to do so only in a limited way, as in the times [of the Second Kappel Peace]. They would gladly contribute to the edification of the church, but neither reproachful nor encouraging words seem suitable for this. Musculus does not want to stay any longer. Haller does not show anything, so as not to arouse suspicion that he wants to go to Zurich soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] These few messages were written in German so that Bullinger can share them with others. Evening greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Behold, I am compelled to write about a third and even greater evil. After I had written this and was constantly thinking that the messenger from Baden, who is here on behalf of the Swiss Confederates, would be ready to leave, Musculus came to me and told me how things were going, that my lords had announced in their church and granted the emperor permission for his priestly work. This causes us a pain greater than any we have yet experienced! We should rightly be consumed by zeal for the house of God! But what should we do? We cannot change it. I fear we will gradually be driven out of all the churches. The Duke of Bavaria is already demanding St. Ulrich's Church, as he resides in the same monastery. The provost of the Holy Cross and that of St. George are also petitioning the emperor to be restored to their possessions. I do not doubt that the canons of St. Moritz will also drive us out, as it is a powerful chapter like that in Zurich.</p>

      <p>Now I am waiting for a letter from Zurich, as I hope my lords will have compassion and not leave me in this deceitful life. We continue to preach, but we are hardly allowed to preach anything other than what is permitted at home in the peace of the land. We would gladly do what serves for edification. However, I fear neither harsh nor sweet words will help. Musculus does not want to stay. I keep quiet so that no one thinks I want to leave.</p>

      <p>These few things are all in German, so you can share them with others. Farewell once again. The last day of July, in the evening.</p>
