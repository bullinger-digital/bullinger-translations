      <p>To the most revered father, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Matthieu Coignet the Younger sends greetings.</p>
      <p>As if emerging from a shipwreck after various storms and the greatest waves, most learned man, when I had safely and unharmed arrived in this port, where the adverse fury of the winds, the immense cruelty of pirates, and the dreadful storms can neither harm me nor instill fear in me, I would undoubtedly be considered of an ungrateful mind, not undeservedly, if I were to pass some time here in silence, forgetful of your great merits towards me, and remain idle without at least greeting you with a letter. For indeed, I consider those who, with no regard for their duty, allow a negative opinion of themselves to be impressed upon the minds of men through their own laziness, to be rightly called idle, and I am all the more to be blamed, the longer I have longed for the conversation of your letters, so that when I come to this thought, it seems to me that the same thing has happened to me that usually happens to captives, who, bound in chains in a hidden prison, are sometimes tormented by the greatest hunger and are deprived of the sight of those most necessary to them, but after they have escaped from there, they seize with both hands that which they lacked, and now they go to this friend, now to that one, who are participants in their joy, they tell the story of their past miseries and rejoice in themselves...</p>
