      <p>Greetings and peace of conscience through Christ.</p>
      <p>When the bailiff recently admitted me to a meeting, it happened that while we were exchanging some familiar words back and forth, we also mentioned you. There, after much was said, he mentioned that he had long desired to meet with you, but had been deterred until now by some unknown reason. Then I said: "But there is nothing that should prevent you from meeting with Bullinger any longer, if you wish. I know that he will make himself available to you at any place and time." - "I do not doubt it," he said, "but I do not want to impose myself on him without a proper occasion." - Since he seriously expressed this, I thought it would not be out of place for me to secretly inform you of this matter, so that as soon as you hear he is in Zurich, you do not wait for his occasion, which he perhaps observes, like the man who made the proverb about the moon, but rather approach him first and, by introducing a conversation in any way, discuss in detail with him the matters pertaining to the evangelical cause, while consistently concealing that I am the instigator of this. Immediately, with his usual ease or perhaps imprudence, he will open up to you.</p>
      <p>At present, I have decided to write to you according to our old custom, by which I think I am allowed to do anything towards you. As for the rest, the messenger will easily report it, from whom you will also hear the reason why we did not want your letters to be delivered to the bailiff.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and continue to embrace us as a friend, as you have done so far.</p>
      <p>Frauenfeld, on the Ides of December, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your Petrus Dasypodius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, his uncommon friend.</p>
