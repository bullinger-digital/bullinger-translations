      <p>Greetings. If I could have actually accomplished what I should have, or at least what I wanted, I would have certainly received that noble patrician of yours with honor; but since the times are most calamitous, I have done nothing or very little worthy of such a man.</p>
      <p>What could I do, sitting among the followers of the kingdom of Satan? There is almost complete agreement with the Roman religion. The wicked are praised, the good are blamed. Musculus has left; Michael Cellarius has long since fallen asleep in the Lord, and besides the dregs of our people, no one will remain. I am almost held in chains; tears prevent me from writing more.</p>
      <p>You speak wondrously of that worldly man. May the Lord lead him back to the path. I beg you by our friendship, that as much as possible, you inform me sometime of the state of his affairs and circumstances; I love the man greatly, but not his vices. Your printer, an excellent man, has from me what should be written to him; make sure that is not overlooked. I sincerely wish for his freedom, which he could have enjoyed comfortably, had he not rejected it to be led into servitude by Pluto.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, almost all cities are perishing except for Strasbourg, Lindau, Constance, and the Saxon cities. With Nuremberg and Ulm having long since fallen, Augsburg has collapsed. You have never seen more lamentable events in the hearts of the pious. Oh, if you should now measure those Hercules, whom you once thought to be something, you would see them as utterly vain, not to say mushrooms.</p>
      <p>Pray diligently for your long-lasting tranquility, so that you do not enter into temptation; I will do the same well, and would that I might not only be granted this wish, but also become a part of your future fellowship.</p>
      <p>Your epitome may perhaps need refinement, which I earnestly ask to be applied; then also the author requests it to be printed sometime.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all and each of our brothers and friends. Farewell forever. June 28, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, etc., friend and brother.</p>
