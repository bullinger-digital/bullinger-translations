      <p>Greetings. Your previous letters have been delivered to me with the utmost faith.</p>
      <p>I am glad that this has been indicated to me in time, so that I do not waste my effort in vain, as I have enough to do otherwise. However, see to it, my dear compater (godfather), that you never command, connive, or knowingly and prudently consent to any violence. It does not please me that anything should be attempted here by force.</p>
      <p>I would indicate to you many reasons in person, which it is not safe to commit to writing. I see that all those people are of the same kind and cannot or will not be corrected, unless etc.</p>
      <p>Many new things are reported here, most of which seem so unlikely that they are hardly credible, and what I recount here is not entirely verified, yet they are written to me from Swabia or Germany by friends. The towns of Swabia are holding a diet at Esslingen; for it is said that Ferdinand will descend to Frankfurt, and the electors will also come there to discuss the creation of the King of the Romans. Others think something more comical will happen, such as the kings Ferdinand and of Denmark joining their children. It is written that the princes of Brunswick, Saxony, the Margraves of Brandenburg, and others are making military expeditions. Some think knights are being gathered in support of Philip, others in favor of Ferdinand.</p>
      <p>Perhaps, if they are wise, they do not want their plans to be known to everyone. I am expecting letters from Augsburg; when I receive them, perhaps I will provide more and more certain information. The English and the Belgians are gnashing their teeth and are almost insane because of the loss of Calais, and indeed they are offering abundant soldiers and money to recover Calais again. Various things are reported about the English.</p>
      <p>Some say they are in serious disagreement, others say they are coming to France and will attempt extreme measures, etc. It is said that there is serious disagreement in Saxony between Wittenberg and Weimar in matters of religion. About which perhaps more will be said shortly.</p>
      <p>I understand that the abbot of Faversham is handing over his entire business to the Seven Cantons, as he can do nothing more. I wish your people would end this troublesome case with an amicable settlement; but this may be granted when a public diet is announced.</p>
      <p>Greet the consuls most amicably in my name; also greet Mr. Aurelius Schytarchus, Pontasella, especially Mr. Philippus Gallizius and all friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 25, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur in Rhaetia, my compater and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
