    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes to him for the first time to thank him with a sample of his abilities for the goodwill shown to the students of Kappel. Since he was admitted to the school four years ago, he has particularly strived for literary education; this benefits the church and is, as the cited ancient authors teach, of outstanding value. Many famous men can be cited as role models. While today many live mindlessly only for themselves, he adheres to the belief of the ancients that true wealth is found in education. Asks for further support of his endeavors.</p>

      <p>On literary study experience to the most learned man M. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>That I have not greeted you with any letters until now, venerable one, I have done not without great reason, namely so as not to burden you with trivial papers, partly to avoid bothering you more than you can bear. However, your singular humanity towards me, and the benevolence observed when visiting my paternal home, compelled me to greet you with a letter, lest you feel me ungrateful or neglectful of duty. For I have observed your unique interest in the students of Kappel.</p>
      <p>First, I ask that you kindly consider my request with fairness and equity. For indeed, I was adopted into the Kappel school by decree of the senate for the purpose of studying. I have now spent four years dedicating myself to literary matters to the best of my ability and the measure of the talent given from above. Indeed, to confess honestly, my mind is inclined to no other art than to enjoy literary leisure, driven by countless arguments, especially for the benefit of the church, to which all who have given their names to Christ ought to strive to be useful. For no one is born for themselves, but above all, we must seek to benefit our brothers, and today this can be done by no means more than through study. I pass over what Lucian in his Dream spoke about mechanics and with what praises he extolled παιδεία (education). It is certain to focus on more solid matters and whatever differs far and wide from these worldly things. Sallust seems to have touched on the same, writing: "For wealth is fleeting and unstable, but virtue is considered bright and eternal." Disciplines accompany, adorn, and refresh the possessor. Also, those who have reported to us the celebrated saying that art is the most certain provision everywhere do not seem to have strayed from truth and right; for wherever one may come in the world, it defends against poverty. The apostles were long content with the same when they were sent by Christ for the sake of preaching the gospel. Therefore, I cannot extol education enough, or to put it briefly, it is the only perpetual companion of the mind. Moreover, Diogenes exalted education to the heavens with this saying: it brings sobriety to the young, solace to the old, wealth to the poor, and ornament to the rich. Aristotle does not seem to have strayed far from the mark, who said that education is an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity. Who now is so foolish and who so ignorant that they do not yet perceive that literary matters hold the highest place?</p>
      <p>Come now, we will present examples of illustrious men who devoted themselves to literary matters. Aulus Gellius writes in the ninth book, third chapter of the Attic Nights about Philip, king of Macedonia, who, although he was almost always occupied with the affairs of war and victories, never was absent from the liberal Muse and the studies of humanity, but rather did and said many things charmingly and courteously, etc. Behold this most illustrious king in this matter and indeed to be compared with few. The same rejoices that Alexander was born in the time of Aristotle, educated and instructed by him, hoping he would be worthy of the succession of such a great empire. We also read about Octavian, who was so devoted to liberal studies, especially eloquence, that not a day passed, even in the field, without reading, writing, and declaiming. Similarly about Aelius Hadrian, who was so thoroughly educated in Greek letters that he was called a Graeculus by many, he enhanced the studies and customs of the Athenians not only with poetic speech but also with other disciplines: the knowledge of singing, playing, healing, music, geometry, painting, sculpting, etc. Therefore, nothing is more pleasant to idle old age than if it proposes liberal studies to itself, as we read about a certain Gallus: "We saw Gallus, a friend of your father, Scipio, dying in the study of measuring almost the heavens and the earth. How often did the light catch him at night when he began to describe something, how often did night overtake him when he had started in the morning? How delighted he was when he predicted to us the eclipses of the sun and moon long before?" etc. Oh, if only in our age our studies would flourish as they did among the ancients! Marcus Antoninus was also a student of philosophy and very skilled in Greek letters. Constantine also nourished good arts with the strictest laws, especially the studies of letters, reading himself, writing, meditating, hearing embassies, etc. Why should I mention Mithridates? Who was king of Pontus and Bithynia, he mastered the languages of twenty-two nations which he had under his rule, etc. Who would not wish to be numbered among such great men? Who would not try to imitate the lights of the world?</p>
      <p>Here indeed would be an infinite number and catalog of illustrious men; but why do I bring these to the most knowledgeable? But supported by these and many other things, the mind is not deterred from its purpose. There are many today who do nothing and are the most useless burdens of the earth, whose life and death I truly value equally and judge alike. All seek to benefit themselves, each thinks this: "Hey you, I am my own closest neighbor." These fatten the body, extinguish the mind; whose god is the belly, and like an ox to the manger, very few desire the republic to be safe. Almost no one gives effort to literary matters. For now, the common people dedicate their children to the services of the rich or princes, where they learn two great evils at once (as Erasmus says), luxury and idleness. Then, those who want their own to be well regarded, send them to learn the French language thoroughly. Oh gods, what folly of men, indeed blindness! Why do we not equally apply to Latin, when there have been so many most honorable men. Therefore, I thought it my duty to dedicate myself to the liberal arts. Aristippus thought it better to become a beggar than unlearned. The same, when asked by someone by what means his son would become better, replied, if he took care to educate him with letters. Again, when asked by what means a wise man differs from an unlearned one: "Send" (he said) "both naked to unknown men, and you will see" indeed education is the most certain provision. The same is reported about Aristippus, that at a certain time when he was shipwrecked with some of his fellow citizens, having been cast ashore, when he saw mathematical figures drawn in the sand: "The matter is safe, friends; I see the traces of men." And having entered the nearest city, he investigated who there were students of disciplines. When he met with them, they treated him with the greatest humanity. Finally, when those who came with Aristippus were preparing to return to their homeland and asked him what he wanted to be reported to his fellow citizens: "That" (he said) "they should strive to acquire such wealth for themselves, which does not perish in a shipwreck, but swims out with the possessor." Hence it was said: "The wise man carries his goods with him." Bias persuades us of this very easily, whose homeland, when it was being plundered, with everyone being advised to carry away what was theirs, he declared that he carried all his things with him. Such is the example in Aulus Gellius book 20, chapter 4, about Alexander, who preferred to excel in learning rather than in wealth and riches. Thus Seneca writes: "Studies make one illustrious and noble," etc.</p>
      <p>To this, incomparable man, to this fervor in more humane studies has not been moderate; forgive me, therefore, if I have hindered your more arduous and serious studies. Indeed, if my efforts are approved and you hope for an entrance to the inner sanctum of the Muses, come, assist this our endeavor; support it, so that it may mature in the best disciplines. Parents, Maecenas, a man born for nurturing studies, incite me to this study. However, it is not the least praise to have pleased the leading men. Therefore, if you add your vote, you will both spur on the one running and add a more eager spirit for studying.</p>
      <p>Farewell, long may you remain unharmed for the athletic church and the students; I will not miss any opportunity.</p>
      <p>You will always have me most commendable to you.</p>
      <p>Johann Jakob Wick, most observant of you.</p>
