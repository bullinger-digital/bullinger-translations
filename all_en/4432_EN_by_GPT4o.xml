      <p> Struck by sudden illness, Fabricius asked him to respond to Bullinger's letters. "We see in your letters that you are more than sufficiently concerned; for the disturbances raised against the bishop are not so great, nor will anyone cause a tumult on his account, and the cause now raised against him is not newly born, but was decreed and confirmed by all the Confederates many years ago against any future bishop. The communities now complain that what was well established is not well maintained, and they want it to be observed. Do not be equally concerned about the management of goods; they will be better managed by the communities than by the bishop, a sordid merchant and miser, no matter what those who favor him may say. - Gregor Carle, a noble citizen here, nephew of the Bishop of Constance Metzler through his sister, has been called by him to Constance, to go with him to your Baden for the upcoming assembly. Soldiers pass through here daily in groups heading to Italy; however, it is not known who calls them there. Otherwise, everything is calm in our Confederation, thanks to God, who protects us all." </p>
      <p> From Chur, on the 2nd of September, 1560. </p>
