    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger received the letter from Landgrave Philipp of Hesse [No. 2455]. It pained and surprised him to learn what the people of Zürich are unjustly accused of. Therefore, he read the letter to the council, the pastors, and the teachers of Zürich, so that they could express their opinions and respond to the Landgrave. The Landgrave should kindly accept the enclosed letter [No. 2476]. Bullinger remains, as before, committed to the Landgrave and the unity of the Church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He has not transmitted the message concerning Mayor Hans Rudolf Lavater, which was enclosed with the Landgrave's letter, for which Lavater thanks him and assures the Landgrave of his readiness to serve.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- As a war looms for the true religion, Bullinger prays to God to grant the Landgrave wisdom, strength, and success. Better to die for God's cause than to submit to idolatry and the [papal] Church! The Landgrave should be courageous and put his hope in God.</p>

      <p>Illustrious, high-born, Christian prince and lord, gracious lord, my humble, willing service along with all good things are always ready for your princely grace from me. I have received your princely grace's Christian faithful letter and understood its contents. It has deeply saddened and greatly surprised me that such things have been brought against us here in Zürich, of which we know ourselves to be innocent by the grace of God. And so that your princely grace may have all the better foundation and certainty of this, I have presented your princely grace's letter to an honorable council, my gracious lords, as well as to the entire college of preachers and teachers, my dear brothers, with the request to open these matters and write to your princely grace, which has happened according to the letters enclosed here. For your princely grace, I am wholeheartedly ready to serve and above all to promote the unity of the church, I ask your princely grace to kindly accept this my service in the best way.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Concerning your princely grace's note regarding my gracious lord Mayor Hans Rudolf Lavater, I have also shown it to him. He was very willing. He also faithfully instructed me to report his willing service to your princely grace at all times without reservation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Since now a great arming against the true religion is arising and great dangers are occurring, we pray to the Almighty that He may grant your princely grace understanding, wisdom, strength, power, good fortune, and success. The cause is just in itself. Thus, the true God does not abandon His own, even if He leads them into great danger. To die comforted in honor for God's sake is the greatest honor and the true life. To live in idolatry, in false doctrine, and under the tyranny of the corrupt church (by which I mean the pope, cardinal, and their followers) is the most cruel servitude and the most shameful death. Your princely grace should call upon God, commit to God, and be steadfast. May God preserve your princely grace for a long time and victoriously for the good of His church.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, June 27, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's entirely willing servant Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious, high-born prince and lord, Lord Philipp Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc., his gracious lord.</p>
