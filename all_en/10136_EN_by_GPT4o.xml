      <p>My friendly willing service and whatever I can do for your honor, love, and good, may it always be yours, friendly dear lord and brother-in-law.</p>
      <p>Your letter about the lamentable changes that have occurred so unexpectedly with you recently, along with the great adversity that has befallen you and my sister in such turmoil, I have understood all its contents, and it is all deeply sorrowful to me. I have also had and endured many anxious challenges on behalf of my sister in the mentioned matter; for I was always worried that some indecency and disgrace might befall her from the unruly people, which, thank God, has always been prevented. However, since a Christian office has been assigned to you by divine providence, I wish you much happiness in this, for it is a great joy to me, in good hope, that you will fulfill it for the planting of divine honor and for the benefit of human souls. Likewise, may you always have my sister in true care, and also speak much good of her on my behalf.</p>
      <p>My wife, who has been bedridden for twenty weeks now, sends you and my dear sister very friendly greetings, with heartfelt desire that you may pray to God the Lord for her and for all of us, and also always keep us in your care.</p>
      <p>Dated in Il on the 18th day of June in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your willing Johann Adlischwyler, city clerk of Rheinfelden.</p>
      <p>To the honorable well-learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, Master of Liberal Arts and preacher of the worthy chapter of Saints Felix and Regula in Zurich, my friendly dear brother-in-law.</p>
