      <p>Greetings. There was no need, dearest compater in the Lord, to send you a dead letter, since a living letter of my entire life comes to you through Mr. Haller, beloved in Christ, compater. However, I wanted to write for at least this reason, so that you do not hesitate to give letters in return to us, writing what you think about the future antichristian council.</p>
      <p>I cannot sufficiently commend the steadfastness of our people, who do not even think it necessary to deliberate anything beyond what has already been decreed and responded to the other confederates. Perhaps your people have their reasons by which they are led and think that something more precise can be answered to the demands of the Roman tyrant, whom I truly consider worthy of no response, and your people, I think, judge that it is not he, but the confederates, who should be consulted. I am very surprised, however, whether your confederates, who still support the pope's side, are so dull that they do not understand from these preludes what kind of council it will be, which has Mars leaping ahead, not Christ, the prince of peace, presiding. From which it is entirely clear that the pope is not acting seriously in what he pretends in the matter of convening the council, as he would rather involve Italy in war and stain it with blood for the sake of a single small city than consult the Christian world with a legitimate, free, and Christian synod.</p>
      <p>But I cease from this odious and detestable matter. I pray, if you have received anything about the people of Magdeburg, that you share it. This silence disturbs me; for I fear, since nothing is reported about them, that something has happened which good people neither delight to know nor report. Farewell excellently. All is peaceful in my home, to God be the glory. I wish the same for yours, whom all of mine greet most lovingly.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name the lords and brothers Mr. Pellicanus, the most honorable old man and ornament of your church, Mr. Theodor and Gwalther, and the others. Bern, July 15, 1551.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Musculus, your compater in the Lord. To the most illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his compater in the Lord, most beloved by far.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
