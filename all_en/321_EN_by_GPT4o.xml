      <p>S. 25. I received your letters from October, which you wrote on the 13th of the same month. Meanwhile, Konstanz was occupied by Captain Schnabel, in the name of Ferdinand, to whom the Emperor is said to have given it. So the Confederates have the neighbors they want; may the Lord turn it to good. Indeed, for this reason, I have always complained about Konstanz, but I found no one who complains with me; well, we have neighbors, indeed.</p>
      <p>Today I received yours, while 7 of them were in our council. What they proposed, I do not know; perhaps I will know later. I am astonished, every time I think about it, that those who do not know what faith is are dealing with the matter of faith; I am also astonished every time I think that our friends should be the Emperor's vicars in the matter of religion. Who would have thought this a few years ago? The Emperor is as much an enemy of the Confederates' name as the Turk is of the Christian name, and he has captured them in such a way that they have become, as it were, his vicars. They pretend, as you write, I don't know what; but who believes them? They lack the knowledge of salvation; who agrees with them? Something must be done, many say, to maintain concord; therefore, something must be done to lose salvation.</p>
      <p>O Lord, deliver us from evil and keep your word with us through your Holy Spirit. I also hear that they are most unjustly spreading rumors, as if they are not our very best friends, and for this reason, they have requested a meeting for tomorrow; for they want to be excused from this suspicion. We are waiting to see what will happen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Melanchthon writes that there are those who accuse him vehemently in the matter of religion (I think it is Isleb), with a public writing, and if this is the case, he must seek another refuge where he can respond safely. I shuddered at this word for two reasons, first because he does not dare under his own prince, then because the adversaries are allowed to write, but ours are not allowed to respond. And what is this injustice! These days a booklet came into my hands, which a certain licentiate (yes, indeed a licentiate) of theology has spewed out. There he defends that faith can exist without charity and that faith can exist with mortal sin; I would allow it, because he speaks of faith, as he calls it, unformed, if he did not add that he writes these things against the proud heresy. It is cruel to remain silent here, and yet no one dares to write because of the Emperor's command. What do you think should be done, lest the Lord say against us that the truth, indeed himself, has been abandoned or even denied by us?</p>
      <p>Consult.</p>
      <p>My wife finally excuses herself; if you heard her, I think you would be quite content. In Silesia, it is written that stalks have emitted blood, near Braunschweig the earth, at Coburg the pond, and this copiously and for three weeks. Strasbourg is still stuck in the same mire. I hear not a word about the Emperor, except that he was forced to withdraw from the Netherlands due to fear of a revolt, which he almost incited by imposing such a great amount of gold on the wretched people. The English are said to still be acting successfully against the Scots and the French.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with yours. Greet all the brothers and Lord Musculus; for I hear he is also with you, but still free.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, 26th of October, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, theologian, in his Lord.</p>
