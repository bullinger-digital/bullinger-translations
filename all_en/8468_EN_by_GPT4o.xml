      <p>A blessed New Year I wish you and yours from God the Lord; may He, through His Son and Holy Spirit, grant that we may fulfill and accomplish it according to His will. Honorable and gracious sir, I have received several letters from you along with the "Historiam vitae et mortis," which you wrote in your tribulations in the year 1564, which were very pleasing to me, as well as several calendars. Therefore, I thank you very kindly for the favors you have always shown me and would also like to share something with you. However, at this time, nothing new has been printed that I could present to you, but I am sending your son, who copied the "Historiam" by hand, a small New Year's gift, with my best wishes, and ask you to accept it kindly.</p>
      <p>And since you mentioned that you desire to have letters from me, but I have been traveling several times and also burdened with various tasks, you shall have more news from me in the future.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have understood from your letter how Mr. Beza has traveled to his homeland to restore his brother's children to possession. I am very concerned for the good man, for Satan has no rest in his members, and it is to be feared that when they see their opportunity, they will bring all misfortune upon him, for it is not too much for people who have forgotten all honor, trust, and faith. As it is already said, that the exiled Christians in France cannot trust and believe in the peace, they are not allowed to return to their goods, and where they can, they execute some, and when complaints reach the court, they are not helped, and only dismissed with good words, since no justice follows and many people perish as a result. Many are of the opinion that this peace will be kept and followed like the tailor, and the wounds will bleed more than ever before. Thus, four days ago, a royal envoy from France passed through here, coming from the Elector of Saxony, but what his mission is, cannot be known precisely. However, some private individuals report that he praised his king and the crown of France highly to the Elector, as well as the old friendship they have always had with the House of Saxony, and hopes for more friendship than ever before. He also requests, in case of need, to rely on him, especially since his rebels are using all sorts of practices, whether he would be willing to send him a number of cavalry for money, or at least not to let any help come to his adversaries.</p>
      <p>To this, the Elector replied that he hoped the peace with his subjects would be maintained, so that this mission would not be necessary; should or would this peace not follow, he would know how to act against the offenders according to all duty. I have not heard this from entirely credible people, but since they say so, I have not wanted to withhold it from you as I have heard it. This envoy calls himself a Count of Ruffet, and is said to be of the innermost council, and I have also dined with him here at night; for his person, he seems to me a frivolous man. I show this in a friendly manner, and would like to leave it with you.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Netherlands, you have undoubtedly heard before what great damage the water has done to cattle and people. It is estimated that about 20,000 small and large persons have drowned, as it has drowned many places and villages, especially the newly begun castle and fortress that Albanus built in Groningen in Friesland and occupied with Spaniards, which has all gone to the ground and drowned along with the garrison. It is also written from Lyon how the Rhone has overflowed so violently that it has also done great damage to cattle and people, and there has been such a great flood almost everywhere that no human could imagine. And unfortunately, it is to be feared that these are punishments for our sins, and evil omens that will bring something greater with them; may the dear God have mercy on us and come soon to put an end to our misery and distress. You are undoubtedly aware of the misery and great distress in Ferrara, as mentioned in the last letters, it has not yet ceased, so that it is believed that this city will be completely destroyed and become a desert, which is truly terrible and pitiable to hear, and thus the wrath of God is entirely kindled against mankind.</p>
      <p>The people of Venice write that the capital city of Famagusta in Cyprus still holds against the power of the Turks, but they have a great shortage of wine and grain, and if they are not supplied soon, they will have to surrender. Apart from this city, the Turk has the entire island to his advantage, and it is to be expected that he will reach further in the coming summer.</p>
      <p>Our emperor appeared here on the 29th of December from Speyer and stayed here quietly for four days, and then moved on to Prague. We have not heard any special news, as the court has kept entirely withdrawn with words, but whether this spring will bring new things, time will tell. It is said that there is a large cavalry around Frankfurt, but they do not know their lord. Some suspect that the Prince of Orange wants to undertake something again against the Netherlands; may God grant that he accomplishes it better than before. Otherwise, I have nothing to write to you at this time; I have not had any letters or news from the Tretio for a long time, I do not know what the reasons are.</p>
      <p>With that, we commend you to the protection and care of the Most High, with the request that you greet all good lords and friends along with your entire household very diligently; and hereby a shilling with the image of the blessed John Huss, which you should present to your dear son as mentioned before, with my best wishes, and accept it kindly.</p>
      <p>Given in Nuremberg on the 14th of January, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Gabriel Schl√ºsselberger.</p>
