    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger's letter [not received] filled Stancarus with deep joy. What good news that Bullinger is trying to secure a position for him with the Bernese! Should this succeed, it would be thanks to God and Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Stancarus is glad that the Bernese do not spread complicated theories in their churches, especially regarding the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, as he would never support such theories! He appreciates the pure, simple teachings of Christ, also concerning the sacraments, and just like the Bernese, he has an aversion to Lutheranism and the Papacy. Georg Frölich, Johannes Haller, Michael Keller, as well as his writings and the University of Vienna, can attest to this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger is a truly Christian bishop due to his helpfulness! Stancarus will always be grateful to him for this. Bullinger should inform him of the outcome of his efforts as soon as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Your letter was delivered to me, venerable bishop, and upon reading it, I was filled with immense joy, for you wrote that you would take care to secure a position for me with the Bernese. What could be more pleasing or more important to me? Therefore, I urge you to continue with your plan and accomplish what the Lord suggests to you. And if you succeed, I will give the highest thanks to God first, and then to you.</p>

      <p>As for the fact that the Bernese do not wish to have subtleties and complexities taught in their churches, either in doctrine or in the straightforward matter of the Lord's Supper, I praise this again and again, and I neither teach nor will ever teach such things. For I am pleased to deliver to the churches the pure and simple doctrine of Christ and the true understanding of the sacraments without complications. Furthermore, that they detest Lutheranism and Papism is something I have shared with them for many years. Witnesses to this (to name a few) are Georg Frölich, Johannes Haller, Michael Keller. My writings testify to it. The entire University of Vienna is a witness that I have no communion (Gemeinschaft) or commerce with such sects. Therefore, I love the simplicity of the word of the Lord, which the sacred scriptures propose to us.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Finally, in other matters as well, you promise me all your efforts if I should need them, which is what befits a true and Christian bishop, and you will always have me bound to you by the greatest benefit. Therefore, I will await for you to inform me of the whole matter as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>Farewell. Basel, February 7, 1547. Yours in the Lord, Franciscus Stancarus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, to be respected. In Zurich.</p>
