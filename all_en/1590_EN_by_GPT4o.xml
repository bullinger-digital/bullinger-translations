      <p>Greetings. I ask, dear compater, that you return to me, through Mr. Calvin or some other trustworthy person, the writings in German about the power of the magistrate and other similar matters that I composed at your command and sent to you; for they need to be examined and moderated more diligently, lest they cause any trouble for me, a foreigner. May the Lord preserve you and all yours.</p>
      <p>Greetings to the lords and brothers and Mr. Bullinger. Your compater, Wolfgang Musculus.</p>
