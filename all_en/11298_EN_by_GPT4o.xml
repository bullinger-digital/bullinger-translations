    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for his comforting letter and agrees with his exhortation; may God strengthen the small church [of Horburg and Riquewihr] through the efforts of their pastors and protect it against the threats from various sides. Hedio hopes that the matter [negotiated at the Frankfurt meeting] will be postponed to the next year; in the meantime, a national council will be discussed. Markus [...] has returned. Beat [Gering], once brother-in-law of Johannes [Buchser] in Suhr, is to be appointed by Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg to the evangelical Gengenbach. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>What could have been offered to me more pleasantly by you than that consoling letter of yours? For by its exhortation (I speak truly, most excellent Bullinger), I have not only become more prudent but also more vigilant, and I bear more lightly the calumnies of both Satan and the impious. For I know how many of us are bishops, but few are perceptive.</p>
      <p>Hence, it is very true what you write, that through our negligence or, if you prefer, our indolence, many can perish, but through diligence, not a few can be saved, etc. You pray to the Lord for me, that He may make the small church of this region, shaken by various storms, solid and constant through His ministers (who are almost twelve of us) and, strengthening it through His spirit, may He make it swim to a peaceful harbor, since Satan still rages among the papists. False brothers impose upon us, the magistrates seek their own, the Anabaptists tear apart the body of the church, dragging it in different directions, and even self-love imposes upon the saints. And what more? Certainly, our hope would be thin and almost despaired, unless against hope, in hope, God from the machine shone upon us. Nothing new, except that my Hedio writes that the Protestants are still waiting for the emperor's courier and hopes that the matter will be postponed to the next year; in the meantime, a national council will be discussed, etc.</p>
      <p>Markus has returned cheerful and playful, etc. Blessed is he, once the brother-in-law of Johannes Buchser in Suhr, who will be called to Gengenbach by the consent of Count Wilhelm of Fürstenberg. Certainly, it is an elegant little town and the people are instructed in the word of God, and there provisions are abundantly produced. It is, however, under the dominion of the empire and pledged to the count. Hence, he acts only as a patron.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, and greet Leo with my Megander three or four times. Kindly consider my stammering.</p>
      <p>From Riquewihr, the 17th day of April.</p>
      <p>Yours most sincerely, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed and pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the most celebrated city of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
