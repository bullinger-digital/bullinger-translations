      <p>Greetings. Today, reverend father, I have not received any of your letters; I attribute this to your immense occupations.</p>
      <p>What I had concerning the council and Italian affairs, I sent with the Italian.</p>
      <p>I have already wanted to indicate more than once that the Genoese have again dismissed the German soldier, which is evidence that they do not greatly fear a Turkish incursion.</p>
      <p>These things, which I send, were noted by Balingketus from his own. On June 29th at the 21st hour, that is, as we count, at the 5th hour in the afternoon, a certain Venetian arrived, carried by a small ship, in einem jagschiff, from Catharo (what place or island this is, I do not know; for I am without maps) announcing to the Venetian duke that an earthquake had caused a palace to collapse there and had crushed the Venetian governor or prefect with his entire family; at the same time, lightning struck a house, which they call the fortification, I mean the armory, where a great quantity of gunpowder was stored, and it killed about six hundred people.</p>
      <p>Before I sealed this, letters from my relative were delivered to me, in which he indicates that you are not well.</p>
      <p>I heard this unwillingly; but it was added, which cheered me, that there is good hope of a speedy recovery of health.</p>
      <p>If you have recovered, which I entirely hope and wish, please inform us of something certain about French affairs.</p>
      <p>Do the Genevans write nothing? Is Cond√© unjustly criticized by some?</p>
      <p>Do the papists fabricate this? What more about the murder of Ringrave, what about the valor of the English? Have the people of Lyon received the priests into the city? Is peace established? At least something about these matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, and forgive me, who do not cease to be troublesome to you so often.</p>
      <p>May all yours fare well.</p>
      <p>All of ours send you respectful greetings.</p>
      <p>Chur, July 5th, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and always to be honored father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
