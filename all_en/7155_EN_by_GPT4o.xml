      <p>Recently, I informed you that I have summoned those communities, by whom I was so wronged two years ago and unjustly fined a considerable amount, to court, as I have done.</p>
      <p>Behold, however (so that you may know what end this lawsuit of ours has reached), they indeed appeared, but they did not want to contest the lawsuit; for they did not have the slightest excuse. Therefore, in the presence of the delegates of all those communities, I presented my case, which was indeed most just and true, and it was finally judged that those communities had acted entirely incompetently with me, and therefore it was also declared that they must return to me by the feast of Saint Martin one thousand four hundred gold coins in ready money; if this is not done, then all the revenues and incomes, from France, from places subject to us, and from elsewhere, which would pertain to those communities, should be handed over to me from time to time, until I am fully satisfied; and indeed, no more convenient method could have been found by which I could be satisfied. However, the reason they judged that the full amount should not be returned to me is that many of them are those who, along with me, were fined for receiving a pension from the King of France, and not a penny has been adjudged to them so far; so that the others may be more patient, it seemed appropriate that I too should bear some burden. For it is a consolation to the wretched, as it is said, to have companions in punishment. These, then, are the proceedings in my case. What my Engadiners (people from the Engadin region) will say or do about this, I do not know; however, I think they will grumble. But the Lords of the Leagues (referring to the Three Leagues in the Grisons) have taken sufficient care that they do not cause further disturbances, and there is no doubt that if they do not obey, they will be brought back to duty; for the opinion now stands among the Rhaetians (people from the region of Graub√ºnden) that they will no longer tolerate such immoderate and pernicious license.</p>
      <p>For I believe that the decisive hearing of the case will be brought there; in this matter, some of ours seem to be deterred, because within the 13 Cantons, as they say, for one vote, the majority is expected to descend in favor of Beatus (a person or party), as they have previously also supported him with all their might, not without great loss to Lord Bartholomew. However, I am not afraid at all; for I believe all judges will consult their conscience equally and therefore will judge justly when necessary. I am waiting, however, for you to write to me about this matter sometime.</p>
      <p>Finally, I have nothing new to write, except that in 4 days, three banners of soldiers are to depart from here; it is uncertain where they will be led, although there are those who claim that an army is being prepared to invade the Kingdom of Britain.</p>
      <p>Chur, Rhaetia, July 14, 1567.</p>
