      <p>We firmly believe that Condé has been killed, unless there is some notable deception involved. All the papal minions have triumphed because of his death. But let them see that this does not fulfill Heliodorus' saying: "The sight of blood is the strength of the heart; when one sees his own blood, he is emboldened." Without a doubt, the most innocent blood of Condé will provoke many who have been more lenient towards the enemy than was appropriate.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard has suffered an incomparable loss at sea; for near Algiers or what they call New Carthage, while advancing against the Gothic rebels, a storm arose and he lost 25 long ships and cargo ships, and 20 of the most noble perished, among whom was Antonio Colonna, the envoy and commander of the fleet; 4 of the most noble were also captured by Turkish pirates, and the entire Spanish face has been miserably affected. These things were reported to our envoy in Rome.</p>
      <p>[...] so that I may continue to watch over and benefit the public welfare of this city.</p>
      <p>Chur, 1569, May 26.</p>
