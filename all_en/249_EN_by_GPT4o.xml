      <p>S. Frechtus, dearest Bullinger, along with his three deacons or rather co-presbyters, was taken into custody by the Emperor in Ulm and placed in chains with the departing Spaniards, and together with the Elector of Saxony, was led away by certain masters from the field (thus they call those Spanish or Marian centurions); where to, we do not know. I pity the brothers who profess Christ, since I know for certain that neither the doctrine nor the spirit of the Emperor, instructed by certain knowledge of scripture, is conducting this most atrocious tragedy of persecution, but rather it is said to be the mind of Granvella, who is said to have boasted of being the mind of the Emperor. The mind of Granvella, however, is the son of the father, the Bishop of Arras, whom they also consider to be the leader of all the shaven ones, not only of the foreigners and those beyond the lake and the Rhine, but also of those who dwell in our Switzerland and are not ignorant of all things. His brother is said to be acting today in Lucerne. Everywhere they say, the Emperor, our friend and neighboring ruler, promises us all things well and properly, but in reality, he will soon teach that he is as faithful to the Swiss, namely the old and hereditary friends, as he has been to the entire liberty of Germany until now. But I rejoice that Constance is not entirely deserted by yours (ours?). May the Lord grant that in that [Greek] of the furious factions, if not the first, at least the second or third may be obtained for them. For we do not ignore through whom all things are so tempered that they may not obtain their desire. The Lord foretold that for true Christians, all things in this world, which are of this world, will be adverse; but meanwhile, God must be prayed to through his son Jesus, that he may not allow his sworn army to be tempted more bitterly or severely than the shoulders of weakness can bear. Happy enough, indeed eternally happy are those whom no atrocity separates from Christ, and it goes best with those who, with the cross of the ancient churches, and thus with the cross of Christ himself, take up their own and strive from a thousand deaths from the perishable and frivolous to the eternal and with immense joy to the kingdoms filled with heavenly goods.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, God is not to be tempted, but the magistrate is to be exhorted, that whatever strength is at hand, he may oppose to their efforts, who place Ossa upon Pelion, in order to finally overthrow Jove from his seat, and let them be firmly persuaded that men of blood and deceit will not bring their days to half, if all hope is placed in God.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, August 30, 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most renowned church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
