      <p>I understand from your letters, esteemed brother, that you were not sufficiently aware of our troubles, about which I had complained to you. Because the wicked know that I am irritable, they have often and in various ways tried to provoke my anger and shake my patience. Although the struggle was difficult for me, they never achieved what they aimed for, which was to make me deviate from the path. And now I have long since become hardened to all their provocations. For the Lord has exercised me in this people within a short time, so that through many experiences I have learned how much must be endured by the ministers of Christ. The same, as I hope, who has sustained me thus far, will equip me with no less fortitude in the future. Therefore, relying on His help, I will never willingly abandon the station in which He has placed me. Nor, indeed, when Mr. Gwalther was recently here, was I preparing to yield, broken by any insults or indignities: but because the wicked had devised a plan to expel me against my will. A certain man, deprived of the use of the supper due to his unbridled lusts and many crimes, wanted to be admitted nonetheless, despite the judgment of the church: and when he openly overturned the right of the consistory with his insult, he had obtained from the senate what I had to refuse. However, because I knew the brazen face of the man, and the wicked deliberately opposed him to me, so that either his insolence would overcome me or he would incite a tumult, I warned the senate what I would do. The worse faction prevailed so that I obtained nothing fair. The next day our brother Mr. Gwalther was present: where I declared that I would rather face death than prostitute the sacred bread of the Lord to dogs, who have openly decided to trample the order of the church underfoot, not without gross mockery of the gospel. What I said after lunch, I prefer you understand from the speech itself, which our Beza took care to translate. Do not think anything was changed: I never inspected it: but it was taken from the notary, as he had taken it from my mouth. Afterwards, the matter was discussed in the senate, where, since the good cause was superior, those who desire disturbances desisted for a while, until a more opportune time for tumult should arise. However, the solemn day of the assembly is approaching, where they will undoubtedly attempt something. But the Lord will make their perverse efforts vanish. It is certain for me to rather sanction with death the discipline, which is received here by the decree of the senate and the people, than to allow it to be undermined while I watch. If they prohibit me from my duty, I will rather depart compelled, than renounce the freedom, the loss of which would destroy my ministry. Nor am I so iron-hearted that the horrendous dispersion of the flock, which I foresee, does not torment me. But while I consider what is permissible for me, I am confirmed in my purpose. You, as you do, will continue to help us with prayers, that Christ may preserve this fold for Himself.</p>
      <p>It is now the eighth day since the messenger returned from you. I cannot express in words how much this church owes to your faithful work and wise response. Now indeed, because you have spoken so lovingly and honorably in commendation of our doctrine about me and my colleagues, we acknowledge ourselves privately obliged to you for this reason, and we have no ordinary gratitude. Would that we were given to compete in mutual services. But we know you are content with our spirits. What will happen to the man is not yet known. However, as far as I can conjecture, judgment will be passed in the court tomorrow: and the day after tomorrow he will be led to punishment.</p>
      <p>In France, things are no better than they used to be. Where there is material for cruelty, they do not spare blood. In Dijon, three will soon be burned, unless perhaps it has already been done. And there is a danger that the disturbances in Scotland will exacerbate the fire. I mention this so that the wretched brothers may be commended to you. For it has been reported that seven or eight are held in chains in NÃ®mes. In other cities of France, there are many. Farewell, most distinguished man and brother, much esteemed by me. Greet diligently the fellow ministers, your wife, sons-in-law, and daughters. May the Lord always be with you, protect you, and guide you with His spirit. My colleagues send you many greetings. Geneva, 6th of the calends of November, 1553.</p>
