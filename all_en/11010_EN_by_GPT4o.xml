    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejects the criticism of the allegedly concord-hostile attitude of unnamed colleagues by referring to Megander's letter of justification [No. 965] and is surprised by the absence of a response from Luther [to the letter from the reformed cities of the Swiss Confederation]. The meeting suggested by Capito is only meaningful once the people of Strasbourg have informed Zurich and Bern in writing about Luther's stance on the [First Helvetic] Confession. Zurich continues to strive for a concord in accordance with this confession. Greetings and a request for news.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Whom you are speaking of, most esteemed Myconius, when you say: "I see some possess so little of brotherly charity that more of stubbornness shines through," I do not see. Certainly, on March 8th, Megander writes to me in these words: "Who would not take kindly to a friendly and brotherly admonition not to proscribe Bucer's Retractions, my dearest Bullinger? But this was by no means agitated by us, as I understand it was reported to you and to Leo, indeed everything was under condition, and that indeed only by some of the brothers." Thus he. Among us, I see no one becoming insolent, as far as I can judge. However, I am surprised if Luther has dismissed our messenger in such a way that he did not even add a word, whether it pleases or displeases him.</p>
      <p>Regarding the repeated meeting, as Capito writes, I fear that our people, weary of meetings and expenses, may finally say: "And what is the end? We have met so many times, we expect responses so many times, we write to Luther, we listen to the people of Strasbourg; but no one brings back even a letter from Luther, no one announces anything certain." Therefore, if the people of Strasbourg have brought anything certain from Luther or from the meeting at Schmalkalden, it would seem most advisable for them to give us a summary in writing, and then invite us to the meeting. For if a meeting is now called, our people will either not come or, if they do come, they will only listen. Therefore, another meeting will have to be called, and the expense will increase, as will the hope of the adversaries and the suspicion, scandal, and anger of our people. I wish that they would frankly tell us: "We are satisfied with your confession and response or not, and therefore and therefore we do not have it." Can this not be shown in writing? If this does not happen, our people or the Bernese might say: "We will not go there, we consider this as an answer." And if we do come and the Bernese do not, then it is again incomplete, and therefore it would be best to inform Zurich and Bern beforehand in one summary about the answer, etc.</p>
      <p>I write this to you with a faithful mind and not rashly. Continue to be ours and promise yourself from us what you would from the pious and those zealous for true and just concord. In the meantime, it is certain that we do not wish to accept anything ambiguous or obscure in this or any other matter of religion, even if all who now live condemn us. But what could have been said more openly than what we have professed in that our confession and response? In these we will be and, with the help of Christ's grace, we will persevere to the end.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with yours, with your wife, Gast, and the others. If you have any certain news from Schmalkalden, about Byzantium, the French, the Turks, or the Emperor, or even about the death of Doctor Luther, let me know.</p>
      <p>March 12th.</p>
      <p>Yours as always, wholeheartedly</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the man of most outstanding learning and piety, Mr. Oswald Myconius, Antistes of the Church of Basel, his most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
