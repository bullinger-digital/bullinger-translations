      <p>My greetings with all due respect and good wishes beforehand, dear sir and good friend. Recently, I sent to you, Mr. Paul Berner of Scherzingen, upon various requests from pious and honorable people on their behalf, to be examined for the diaconate in Turbenthal, etc., and I have since been informed that he was deemed insufficient in his teaching by you, the examiners, etc. Therefore, I now send to you the honorable and learned Mr. Martin MÃ¶ttelin's son, namely Joseph, a preacher in Winfelden, to appear here for examination, with the request to examine him according to your commendable practice and to promote him to the aforementioned diaconate; for he is praised by several honest people before me for his particular skill, as well as for his honorable character and conduct, which is why I am willing to promote and accept him for the aforementioned diaconate. And if he is deemed sufficient by you, the examiners, and you provide me with written confirmation of this, I will then proceed further with him and accept him as a deacon. Therefore, I trust you in this matter according to my good confidence; I will, if necessary, be indebted to you.</p>
      <p>Dated Altenklingen, the 9th of July, in the year 1549. Ulrich von Landenberg of Altenklingen.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned and honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher and examiner in Zurich, my dear sir and good friend, to be delivered.</p>
