    <p xml:id="regest1">Learned from Bullinger's letter of August 31 of the previous year about his illness, from which he has undoubtedly recovered with the help of Christ; his own ailments and the illnesses among the neighbors in Bohemia and Silesia, which have claimed several victims, cannot frighten Pergener, as death only means liberation from earthly burdens. He eagerly awaits the Gospel commentaries, for without Bullinger's works he would remain completely ignorant.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I received your letter written on the last day of August of the previous year, most esteemed Heinrich in Christ, in which I understand that during that summer you were unable to write due to certain illnesses and dizziness of the head, from which I hear with sorrow that you were afflicted. But I have no doubt that you have now been restored by the grace of God. Christ will preserve His faithful ministers for the benefit of the Christian republic and His church until a ripe old age. But in the meantime, we are certain that afflictions, illnesses, prisons, and chains, if they come to anyone, are not to be attributed to fortune, but to Almighty God. Some hidden infirmity, I know not what, also disturbed or rather afflicted my own little body somewhat in the past summer, but it did not lay me low. Diseases and various infirmities, by which we now see many mortals perishing among our neighbors both in Bohemia and in Silesia, might deter me, if I did not know that death is a passage to more blessed abodes and a change from a worse condition to a far better one. For I firmly believe that the souls of the faithful, as soon as they have escaped from their bodies, fly up to heaven, are united with the divine, and rejoice eternally, etc. Therefore, this life is rather a captivity and death than life; the more we depart from the world, the closer we approach God. Therefore, for Christians, to die is nothing else than to leave the world and go to God, etc.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await the Gospel commentary, which you have decided to explain to us and especially to the church of Christ; I would be plainly more ignorant than Phinonides, if God by His grace had not willed your writings to be brought to us. Whatever I have, I confess without pretense that I have received it from God and from you. Therefore, I not undeservedly pray to the best God, that He may be with you in all things.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell with the whole church and prosper in the word of the Lord. Zittau, the first of March 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Pergener and of the brothers.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed bishop of the great church of Zurich, most esteemed brother and friend.</p>
