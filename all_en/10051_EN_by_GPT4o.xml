      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Finally, though absent, I will encourage you, who are otherwise vigorous, to complete even more eagerly what you have begun. You understand, however, what I mean, for I refer to that about which we have often consulted late into the night and to which the example of many wise and pious men of both ancient and our own times encourages you. Indeed, why do we bring forth the example of these rather than the sacred scriptures? You have seen what they command, and your conscience, formed in the image of God and certainly taught by God, advises the same as all of us have consulted. Therefore, beware lest you be sealed by the Holy Spirit in vain. He indeed desires to consecrate your body as a sacred temple for Himself [1 Cor 6:19f], I say, He desires to be more familiar with you than He has been until now.</p>
      <p>For you know the heavenly sentence of Paul, by Hercules the most serious: "He who is joined to a harlot is one body with her; but he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with the Lord" [1 Cor 6:16f]. Recognize the time and redeem the opportunity, which the most sacred heart of Paul has so often inculcated; recognize the call of God and that you must awaken from the heavy sleep of the flesh; finally, recognize the call, indeed the opportunity offered to you by God so many times. The same is commanded to the exile, indeed the beggar, as to you, nor can he excuse himself by pleading poverty. Meanwhile, God has endowed you with wealth. What then? Acknowledge the benefit of God and give thanks. These thanks, however, are most praiseworthy if you obey His commands. Therefore, turn to the Lord, and He will turn to you [Zech 1:3]. But why do I say "He will turn," when you see that He has already turned to you! Therefore, hasten, for those who love, who have once seen God and have felt His sweetness, do not delay, but rush with swift course to the fragrance. For every delay is dangerous, since Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt, and the Lord asserts: "Whoever puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for me" [Luke 9:62]. What, O good God, do I hear? What does he have who does not have God? What can be imagined more miserable than this? Those who have God have all good, peace, and joy. Therefore, let no one be so foolish as to cast away and neglect such a treasure of goods by delaying or looking back. You are old, my brother, you are near death, O dearest friend of all, you see in what state we mortals are. By this very act of writing, much of my life is passing away, ignorant finally of the moment when the Almighty will take me from the living. Moreover, we have all offended the Lord more than enough, so that He now, burning with anger, considers by what dire means, by what plague or sword He may avenge our impiety. Here now, revere your old age, remember death and fate. In the inescapable time, and so now order your life, that when the avenger comes, he may not find his temple so desolate. For pestilence, famine, and sword should not deter us from wives, but rather invite us, so that the Lord may find us girded and holding lamps in our hands [Luke 12:35]. "God is," says Peter, "who knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished" [2 Peter 2:9]. The Lord Himself is our fortress, He Himself expended His Son for us, who indeed did not delay, but did everything at once for our sake. Therefore, let us not delay in a matter not so unpleasant! Paul does not think it possible that either sword or fire or death can separate any of the faithful from the Lord [Rom 8:35-39]; how much less should foul lust separate us from such a glorious and sweet Lord.</p>
      <p>Neither did the equal authority with the Father nor the kingdom of heaven move Him to come more slowly. Moreover, He knew what He had to suffer, namely, after immense laceration, after the laughter and sneers of the most impious scoundrels, finally the most atrocious punishment of the cross. He knew all this, yet He did not delay, but eager and rejoicing with joy, He rushed into the most ungrateful world. See now what we must do. We have promises, as ample as they are certain, for the prophet also testifies: "I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread" [Ps 37:25]. We also have the most illustrious examples of the saints; finally, there stands Christ Himself, born of a married, yet perpetually virgin, woman, sounding the trumpet. Would we not be rightly considered most impious and ungrateful if we did not obey Him in such a trivial matter, when He Himself first undertook a much harsher and more difficult task for our sake? Blessed therefore are all who fear the Lord and who walk in His ways.</p>
      <p>I have written this, sweetest of all friends, seized with the greatest affection towards God and great love for you, not to reproach you as you lie down, but to incite you as you run and to oppose delay and, so to speak, procrastination, for I know that the well-known saying is most certain: "What is done later is done more tepidly and with more difficulty." Take all this in good part, as it comes from the most friendly of all you have on earth. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich, on the fourth day of October in the year 1527.</p>
      <p>But also immediately show yourself cheerful to us and once again farewell.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours in every respect.</p>
