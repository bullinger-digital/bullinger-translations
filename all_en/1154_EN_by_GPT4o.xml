      <p>Soon after I sent the letter to you yesterday, I received a letter from a good gentleman. He sent me enclosed news with it. I consider it reliable because it comes to him from Nuremberg from his brother-in-law; they are prominent people and are well-informed about all matters. I wanted to share it with you; however, you should send it back to me with this messenger. May the faithful God have mercy on this cruel misery, which also affects so many pious, innocent people. Dated January 15.</p>
