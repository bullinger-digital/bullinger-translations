      <p>Through Jesus Christ, all salvation.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote to you, dearest brother, regarding Benedikt Euander, and now again about our church. We are in despair about the salvation of many. The church is disturbed by the doctrines of the Lutherans, Anabaptists, and others. For a decade, the word of God has been preached without fruit. Everything still hangs under the previous century. Ceremonies still stand with the name of the mass in the monastery. There is playing, drinking, swearing, etc., and no censures are remembered by the elders of the people. They fear the emperor. What more can I say? They hear the word of God, but do not believe. I fear it will be declared as a testimony of damnation, as everywhere, I am ignorant of what should be done, thus "do not give what is holy to dogs" [Mt 7, 6]. I would rather be with you in the fields of Zurich, if God wills. Therefore, consult, best brother, for the good, if you have anything. Unless God is present in miraculous ways, all hope falls. The magistrate is struck with fear. The miserable people hang by a thread of fortune. From Christ's command, I think we must soon depart.</p>
      <p>Write briefly, if you have time, through the bearer of this note. Pray diligently for the state of our church, and also for us. We will do the same. I wish all the brothers with you well, Leo, Erasmus Fabricius, Karlstadt. My brothers also greet you and yours, even your mother with your beloved wife: all grace.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Kempten, November 6, 1533, hastily.</p>
      <p>Veit Kappeler, minister of the word of God, your devoted.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of Zurich, a candid and most diligent brother. Zurich.</p>
