      <p>S. D. I received your last letter, most esteemed father, in which you initially promise your excellent assistance, should I write letters to our friend in Poland. I thank you for your great love, that you, being so busy, have regarded me, unworthy as I am, so kindly and fatherly. I am sending you old and new writings from various places with the letters of Mr. Lentulus himself, which he gave to me, and which I certainly could not copy as I am preparing for the Fiderina baths. But use them as you wish and, if it seems appropriate, return them at some point; for these are consigned for your benefit, and because we owe it, as Lentulus himself admits at the end of the letters. Johannes Brunner could have stayed with us; he would have been safer and, if he had wanted, could have better looked after his domestic affairs. Marius will always maintain his old position; but he also has the prefect Dietägium as his most hostile and deadly enemy. Therefore, unless nature, even when driven out with pitchforks, should return again, he ought to present himself as calm and placid above all others. He never deigned to speak to me, bearing it with difficulty that he, a citizen of Chur and far more learned than others, indeed perfect in all respects (as he thinks), should be preoccupied by a foreigner in his own country. He has now entered a very modest priesthood in the Rhaetian or Praettigau Valley by private authority, consulting no one, as he should not have the care of the minister's synod, since he (as they say) has much older letters in these parts. Our Rhaetia needs many learned men, but not jesters, οι ςσ γενοσ κακον και σξοδρα επιμςμΗτον Εριδςν Ξθμον δι ανδιψα αει εψοθσιν, as the Ascraean sings. However, our people cannot sufficiently marvel at the audacious deed against the princess of Württemberg, and as they conceive great hope that this insolence and intolerable behavior will soon subside, so many hope that the incredible patience and kindness of the most honorable council of Zurich towards that princess, especially concerning the matter of the supper, will be of no small benefit. But I am surprised that Mr. Froschouer (to whom I recently replied) has not sent his agent, if he has recovered. We fear, however, that he may again allow himself to be imposed upon by the bookseller, whom we have perceived to be wandering in Zurich. That man is flattering and humble to the point of the underworld and will not keep his word, even if he promises much freely, as long as he can return to his wife and children, whom he is hardly deprived of and lacks. He spoke with some of our merchants in Zurich that he would gladly return, provided the magistrate embraces him with their clemency; but I see what he is plotting. I will be as cautious as I can to prevent a truly great plague from falling upon us again. He has often promised reform, but he has never kept his promises and, like Proteus, he can transform himself into all kinds of wild beasts, as long as he can be carried and exercise his craft on the miserable common people. I freely declare that either I or that bookseller will be absent from this church.</p>
      <p>I have nothing further to write now, except that I have Mr. Consul Willi and his brother, the city treasurer, as my companions for bathing and that we will soon depart (unless one thing after another hinders me). In the meantime, I wish your reverence good health, which may God preserve firm for as long as possible for the glory of His name and the benefit of the church. Amen.</p>
      <p>Quickly from Chur, the last day of July 1570.</p>
      <p>Your most submissive and obedient Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul, Pontisella, Gantner, etc., send their greetings to your reverence.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and distinguished man in every kind of virtue and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief and most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord, to be honored with perpetual loyalty and singular respect.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
