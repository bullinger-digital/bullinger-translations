      <p>Most esteemed and highly respected man of God. Because Satan, in countless ways, strives to destroy this little church of Christ of ours, and, what is most to be lamented, those who ought to bring help are the very first to oppose our ministry, I now ask only this of you: if you hear anyone speaking ill of me, to diminish the honorable opinion you hold of me in your esteem, that you suspend your judgment for a while, until I have written to you more fully and shortly, and then you will understand the causes of my suspicion.</p>
      <p>However, I will write in such a way that, if you wish, I even desire that what is sent to you be read in their presence; I am far from wishing to hide. I also ask you to keep all my letters that are given to you concerning the cause of our church; for it is a matter of great importance, as you will later know; I retain copies (as it is said) of them with me.</p>
      <p>I write many things to Lelio Sozzini, but not everything; you will advise him to be silent, just as I have advised him, not to communicate anything from what I write to anyone except your esteemed self.</p>
      <p>Soon I will inform you of many things, which you will scarcely believe unless I clearly reveal them to be true. Farewell in the Lord, man of God, and pray to God for us.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, 23rd of October, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Augustinus Mainardi.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and highly respected man of God and distinguished doctor, [Lord] Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, his father and lord, etc. In Zürich.</p>
