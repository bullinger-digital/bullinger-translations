      <p>Greetings. I am very surprised that you have not written to us at all for such a long time; I have not seen any of your letters since September 3rd, and I hope you are well and not hindered by any illness. Our affairs are quite peaceful by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>The rumor about the expedition of the Duke of Savoy and the princes against the Bernese has somewhat subsided, and it is written from Bern that soldiers conscripted in Piedmont and soldiers gathered in Lyon have already moved to Scotland and against the English. Nevertheless, they remain vigilant and all stand ready for battle.</p>
      <p>We are waiting to see what the upcoming assembly, which will begin on the feast of St. John the Baptist, will bring us.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, rumors are spreading that the people of Glarus will soon be unexpectedly overwhelmed and forced into Catholicism by the Five Cantons. Many believe this fear to be unfounded, especially since at the last assembly, all the Swiss delegates seriously instructed the Five Cantons to attempt nothing by force, but only by law. If they were to attempt anything against the law, they know what a great tumult would arise throughout Switzerland; therefore, they think they will not expose themselves to such danger.</p>
      <p>As for me, I do not know what to think; I only advise that if you hear of any movement arising, you should diligently remind your people of their duty, so that they show gratitude to those who helped them in the Musso War and understand that this matter begins with the people of Glarus but must be resolved among the Rhaetians and other believers in the Gospel. I therefore urge you to be wise and to do your duty here.</p>
      <p>I hope, however, that they will attempt nothing; I nevertheless advise you to consider what needs to be done if anything arises. May the Lord grant us peace.</p>
      <p>You will keep this to yourself until something arises; nevertheless, you can confer with trusted individuals about how to prepare to help those in need and to defend your land against an invasion. For many eyes are needed, especially repentance, faith, and prayer.</p>
      <p>We hear that the Spanish fleet has been destroyed by the Turks at Tripoli and... that they are already... obtaining Italy with ships. But I want to hear more certain news about this from you.</p>
      <p>In France, it is said that the persecution has ceased and the prisoners have been released; for Scotland has frightened them, etc. In Valais, the knowledge of Christ is growing.</p>
      <p>The people of Goms (a district, called Goms) wanted to oppose piety through tumult, having wanted to rise up with the masses. However, the other districts have spoken with them so much that they have remained quiet, etc. Tomorrow a new consul will be elected among us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us and bless us, etc. All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>We hear that Coignet is coming from France to the Baden assembly; he has already written here. Greet Mr. Philipp, the consuls, and all friends, especially the French delegate.</p>
      <p>In Zurich, very quickly, June 14, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
