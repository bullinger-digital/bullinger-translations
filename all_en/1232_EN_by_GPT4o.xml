      <p>Greetings. A strange rumor is spreading about your church, which I insist is completely false, that the Lord's Day (Sunday) has been abolished due to some unknown dispute, or rather not abolished, but transferred to Friday. However, I hope that you (unless it was done against your will or without your knowledge) do not delight in such innovations, which bring much inconvenience and no benefit.</p>
      <p>Mr. Johannes Abelus, an Englishman, who accompanied Bucer to England, writes from Frankfurt that the dispute between Mr. Hooper and the Bishop of London has been settled in England, and that Hooper preached before the king and court on the second Sunday in March, indeed dressed in a linen and episcopal garment, but which is soon to be abolished by common edict, as well as other superstitions.</p>
      <p>By royal authority and parliament, a bishop will be ordained by the laying on of hands. I am expecting both a messenger and letters from him at any moment, which he promised to send. I will share immediately through the first available messenger whatever I receive.</p>
      <p>Plans are proceeding for a council in Trent to be held against us. Our Laelius Socinus writes from Wittenberg (he sends you his diligent greetings) that the learned theologians and jurists of Saxony have decided to obey the Emperor if he absolutely commands it, and to go to the council in Trent. If this is true, see how much they harm themselves, their churches, and others. Paul indeed consented to the council in Jerusalem when he had experienced treachery. But what else is that council but pure betrayal and the most cruel parricide? Magdeburg, still surrounded by siege, resists strongly. The assembly has been dissolved. The king has gone to Vienna, Austria. [Emperor Charles remains in Augsburg and does not discuss plans for peace].</p>
      <p>What I wrote in my last letter, I repeat here: the kingdom of France would be stronger and safer if it sends no delegations to the council, but responds that, in these disturbances and the fear of Turkish incursion and expedition, the celebration of the council seems inconvenient, etc. Farewell. Zurich, April 3.</p>
      <p>In Rome, it is certain that there is great suffering from famine. Wheat is sold at a very high price: the weight that a beast of burden carries costs 8 crowns. May Mr. von Burgund, Farel, and Nic. Gallasius and all other fellow ministers be safe. 1551. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church in Geneva, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
