    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for two [not received] letters from Bullinger with information about the [Regensburg] Imperial Diet. Cannot gather from the letters whether Bullinger has received Bucer's German letter [BucerDS VIII, No. 9f] [cf. No. 1483], and requests notification in this regard. Has nothing to report from Graub√ºnden, and no information has come to him from Italy either. May God protect the Protestants from the cunning of the Emperor, who works against the true religion. Greetings, also from Johannes Blasius.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocent life from the Lord. Most esteemed Bullinger, we have already received two letters from you, in which you diligently described to us the state of the Imperial Diet, and we are very grateful for this diligence of yours and wish to reciprocate if ever the opportunity arises. Whether you have received Bucer's German letter or not, I could not ascertain from your letters, but I suspect it has not been delivered; for I sent it to you over a full month ago. Therefore, please inform me whether it has been delivered. Otherwise, nothing worth writing about is happening here, nor do we hear anything from Italy. Let us pray to the Lord, who may deign to protect our people from the cunning of the Emperor, the patron of papist religion, who cares so little for the true religion that he would rather see it extinguished. Farewell. From Chur, 6th of May, 1541. Johannes Blasius, my colleague, sends you many greetings; we also wish all the brothers well. Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, his lord and esteemed friend.</p>
