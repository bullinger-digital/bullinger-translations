      <p>God grant you and yours a happy and blessed year. Especially, dear sir, I thank you most highly for your friendly letter and brotherly admonition, which you have given to my brother and me. I also earnestly ask you not to turn your mind and good heart away from us, but rather, if you notice anything concerning the welfare of the fatherland, to warn and admonish us in due time. Whatever is possible for us to promote peace and unity, we will do with good will. My lords are also very inclined to give a personal response with a double embassy, as this might serve more fruitfully and for greater unity than to accomplish this through mere writing, as the people of Basel do. However, why they do this is well worth noting, though not to be considered at this time, but rather to be put aside for the best, especially against those who would take joy in our discord. May the peace of God be with us all, and with your dear wife, etc. Please convey my friendly greetings to Rodolph Gwalther, my dear brother; my brother Alexander sends you many good wishes.</p>
      <p>Given at Schaffhausen on the 1st of January in the year 1549. Yours willingly, Martin Peyer.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in ZÃ¼rich, my especially dear sir.</p>
