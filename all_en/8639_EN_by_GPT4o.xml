      <p>S. I have nothing special to report, except that our Aretios has returned from Heidelberg. There, he negotiated with the prince himself about Ursinus; the prince writes to our people and grants him, although with difficulty, but cannot release him before the next spring; for until then, he is obligated to him by agreement. We are at least glad that he has been entrusted to us; for we do not doubt the prince's fidelity. Some from the court were conveniently present, who, if they had been present, seemed likely to impede this calling, namely Ehemius, Zulegerus, and Dathenus. Aretios also brought this bundle of letters, which I am sending to you. I write to my brother about those who were made new creatures last Sunday, that is, prefects, from whom you will learn the names of each, if it pleases you. We are saddened by the change of our Küngßfeldianus; a successor will follow him who will be far different, otherwise pious, but a man of dull intellect and little interested in the students. We hear that the plague is raging more and more in Geneva; they therefore see that they do not have this plague from witches, which they had nevertheless convinced themselves of, having burned a large number of them this year. He still lives, whose works these are; may he protect us!</p>
      <p>Your friends and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 14, 1571.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
