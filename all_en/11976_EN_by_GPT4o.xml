    <p xml:id="regest1">Greetings. In the enclosed writing [perhaps: Confessio Helvetica prior], Bullinger has publicly expressed his views and beliefs regarding the Lord's Supper, in accordance with his commentary on Matthew 26 and 1 Corinthians 10-11. Nowhere else does Bullinger find this topic treated more simply, purely, and appropriately to the Gospel, and he will consistently adhere to the view presented, unless he is taught otherwise by the [Holy] Scripture. The papal doctrine of transubstantiation is a philosophical and antichristian construct that Bullinger abhors, just as he rejects those who, although they reject the term "transubstantiation," otherwise claim like the Papists that Christ is present in an unspeakable manner in the elements of the Lord's Supper. Bullinger believes and teaches that Jesus Christ is the Son of God incarnate for humanity, who became essentially like them as a true man, that he died, truly rose bodily, and ascended to heaven, where he sits at the right hand of the Father until he comes to judge the living and the dead; he is the head of his church; he is bodily in one place in heaven, yet he lives and works always present in the church through the Spirit, especially when the church celebrates the meal according to his institution in remembrance of his death; in this meal, Jesus testifies to his dedication to the salvation of sinners; there is only one true faith, namely that the most high God is well-disposed towards humanity and has reconciled them to himself in Christ, who according to his divinity is consubstantial with God and is everywhere, but according to his humanity is only in one place, as the one Christ with his two natures; this faith makes alive, justifies, and redeems; in it alone the two natures of Christ remain unmixed and undivided, and those destroy the humanity in Christ who, against Augustine, claim that his body is everywhere; through faith, Christ works in the believers and becomes their life-giving food, even though he, as Augustine confirms, remains like the sun in a specific place in heaven; this doctrine of the presence of Christ is understandable and does not cause confusion. Christ is not divided by this, no more than by his own speaking of the departure to the Father; the whole Christ is in heaven and yet present to his church; but Bullinger has dealt with this sufficiently in his commentary on John 3. 6. 16. 17, on the glorified body in the commentary on 1 Corinthians 15, John 20 and 21, and in the 12th book of the commentary on John. So much for Bullinger's unequivocal confession about the Lord's Supper, which Macarius requested; furthermore, he refers to his books.</p>

      <p>To the most devoted and learned man, Joseph Macarius of Pannonia, a most beloved brother in the Lord, H. Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I have sufficiently, I believe, expressed my opinion and faith regarding the sacred Lord's Supper in this public writing, and I have done so as I believe. It aligns with what I have given in Matthew chapter 26, and in 1 Corinthians chapters 10 and 11, so that if I were to speak or write about this holy Lord's Supper a hundred times, I could not do otherwise.</p>
      <p>I have long and thoroughly exercised myself in examining the writings of the ancients and moderns published on this matter; but I do not find a better, simpler, and purer opinion, more in agreement with the Holy Scriptures and the primitive church, than this of ours. Therefore, I hold to this, I hand it over to the faith of our church, and with God's help, unless I am taught better by the Scriptures, I will persevere in it until my last breath.</p>
      <p>For as I utterly abhor the papal transubstantiation as a purely philosophical fiction and antichristian invention, so I also do not approve of the opinion of those who, having rejected only the term transubstantiation, hold almost everything else in common with the Papists regarding this matter, since they say that the true and natural body of the Lord Jesus Christ is substantially and corporally present and contained in the species of bread and wine, yet not qualitatively, quantitatively, and as in a place, but rather ineffably. For what else did the papist transubstantiators feel and teach?</p>
      <p>However, I believe and teach that Jesus Christ, the true Son of God incarnate for us, and true man, consubstantial with us in all things except sin, died on the cross, and on the third day truly rose from the dead with his true body and ascended into heaven, where he now sits and will sit at the right hand of the Father, until he comes in the clouds of heaven to judge the living and the dead. I believe and teach that he is the head, that is, the king and high priest of his church, who, although according to the property of his true body, is in one place in heaven and not everywhere according to the nature assumed from us. Yet he is, lives, acts, and works always most present in the church by the Spirit, with life-giving power, saving operation, and absolute authority, especially when the church celebrates the Supper according to his institution. For the Supper is an action of the church delivered by Christ, in which the memory of the Lord's death is performed, and his grace and gratuitous beneficence are praised. In which also the Lord Jesus, by the given symbols, testifies that he is wholly ours, since he has given his body and shed his blood for the remission of sins, and that they may obtain eternal salvation, as many as believe in him. For faith unites and connects us to Christ, faith justifies and gives us life. But there is only one true faith, namely, that which delivers that God, the best, greatest, and supremely good, is well-disposed towards the human race and has returned to grace with it because of Christ, who is consubstantial with the Father according to divinity, but consubstantial with us according to humanity, and therefore according to humanity in only one place, but according to divinity everywhere, one and the same Christ consisting in two indivisible natures. This, I say, faith gives life, justifies, saves us. This is the one and only true faith, which does not equate or mix humanity in Christ with divinity, nor does it evacuate or extend it through all things, nor again does it divide Christ or separate humanity in him from divinity, although it expressly confesses that the properties of the natures remain in him unconfused. But they evacuate humanity from Christ, who contend that his body is everywhere. It is necessary, however, for the body of Christ to be everywhere if it is substantially present and contained in the Supper. For, not to mention the Scriptures, did not St. Augustine say to Dardanus: "Remove the spaces of places in bodies, and they will be nowhere, and because they will be nowhere, they will not be." Therefore, lest we speak inconsistently and lest we sin against true faith, we place no bodily presence of Christ in the Supper. Meanwhile, we confess and teach that the Supper of the faithful is not without a host and without the vital food, Christ. For he works salvation in the souls and minds of the faithful; the death of Christ becomes life-giving to the believer through faith, and thus the flesh of Jesus Christ becomes food for him.</p>
      <p>The same Christ lives in his own and makes his own live in him. The sun stands in one place in the heavens, but by its power, it illuminates and cheers all mortals.</p>
      <p>Christ, the sun of righteousness, is in one place in heaven, as Augustine also says, but by spirit, power, and operation, he nevertheless acts in the faithful always, especially when the Supper is celebrated in the church according to his institution. This exposition of the presence of Christ in the Supper seems to us to be most expressible, simple, and clear, and so tempered that it neither takes Christ away from the church nor speaks contrary to true faith nor entangles the listener more than it explains with the involutions of words.</p>
      <p>By these things, we do not divide or tear Christ apart, unless he himself has torn himself apart when he said he would no longer be in the world, that he would leave the world and go to the Father, etc. Who indeed would gather from this that Christ now remains and reigns in the church with his own in a divided manner?</p>
      <p>For he is wholly with his own, although he dwells bodily only in heaven. For we enjoy the whole sun on earth, although the globe of the sun is not on earth, but only in heaven. But I have sufficiently discussed these matters in our commentaries on John in chapters 3, 16, and 17. I have also abundantly discussed the nature of the glorified body in our commentaries on 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and in chapters 20 and 21 of John and in the 12th book of the commentary on John.</p>
      <p>I freely profess these things to you (most learned and beloved brother Joseph), so that you may have my clear and unambiguous opinion on the Lord's Supper, which you requested written in my own hand, and you said you had come here on a long journey to see the church established in Zürich and its ministers, especially to hear me discussing this sacred institution of Christ and other articles of religion. You have heard. You now have my handwritten document; seek a full discussion of these matters from my books. Use these well, I pray, and adhere to Christ and farewell.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, June 20, 1544, etc.</p>
