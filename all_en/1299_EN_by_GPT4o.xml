      <p>I returned from Scotland on the 4th day before the calends of June to the Duchess, the wife of the prince, where I am spending these two days pleasantly with Joanna, the daughter of the lord, and Aylmer and Haddon, most excellent and holy men.</p>
      <p>Believe me, your book was most pleasing to the prince, and it was long and much awaited. I presented it to his highness in a large gathering of people: for at that very time many Scottish princes had gathered in Berwick, with the aim of making peace between the two kingdoms, including the Bishop of Arles and the Prince of Maxwell.</p>
      <p>I understand it was greatly approved by all, especially by the Bishop of Norwich, an Englishman, a very learned man and a close friend of our prince. Therefore, I would like you to be assured that this service of yours was praised and honorably granted to the great and illustrious prince. He would have written to you most willingly, if he were not greatly distracted by the most serious affairs of royal majesty and public matters; concerning which he wishes to be excused to you as diligently as possible through both my letters and those of his daughter.</p>
      <p>I was asked many things about you at that time, about the manner of your life, your children, and finally your whole family; but especially, what gift or favor I thought you would most rejoice in. I truly said to the prince with a firm voice that you aimed at one thing: that the doctrine of the Son of God be promulgated, that the fallen house of God be restored, and that the tyranny of the pope be condemned; nor did you ask anything else from the royal majesty, nor indeed did you hope to obtain anything different from the prince. I spoke these things to you briefly, but to the prince more copiously and eloquently, as the matter seemed to require at the time; for I was already considering what would later come to me in practice. I responded to the other things that seemed necessary.</p>
      <p>You will easily recognize the princess's zeal and respect for you from her most learned letter written to you. I truly think that nothing more humane has ever existed than this maiden, if you consider her family; nothing more learned, if you consider her age; nothing more blessed, if you consider both. Rumor has spread, and it has begun to be in the mouths and conversations of great men, that this most noble maiden is to be betrothed and married to the royal majesty. Oh, if that should happen, how happy and beneficial to the church you will consider that marriage to be! But concerning that matter, let God, the best and greatest, who alone is strong, perceives, remembers, foresees all things, and arranges all things according to His will, see to it.</p>
      <p>Haddon, the minister of the word, and Aylmer, the instructor of the daughter, honor and observe you very dutifully and lovingly. It will be your kindness to reply to all as soon as possible. Scinner is at court with the king. Wullock preaches the word of God with much labor on the borders of Scotland. Trehern has retired to the countryside from the court and enjoys especially the inner studies, that is, Greek.</p>
      <p>Finally, may you be well, and if you write any letters to the prince, always take care to have them delivered to me first. I ask you this as earnestly as possible. Please convey my very best regards to Mr. Gwalter in my words, and, if convenient, to Mr. Pellican by name. Farewell again and again, most learned man. Bradgate, 4th day before the calends of June, 1551. I am thinking of Oxford.</p>
      <p>Your most loving and steadfast son in Christ, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
