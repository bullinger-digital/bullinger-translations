      <p>Greetings. I arrived in Basel today, dearest Bullinger, by the grace of Christ quite comfortably, except that my left foot still retains its swelling, which I bear moderately until it gradually subsides. I was received by the brothers, Master Mykonius and Gast, very kindly and was taken home by the printer Hervagius, where I will stay for a while until divine providence assigns me to a certain place. One thing troubles me greatly, that here, as I had hoped, I find no letters and am still forced to be uncertain about the colleagues I left behind, my wife, and children. But this trouble must also be endured.</p>
      <p>I beg you to send the enclosed letters to Constance at the first opportunity offered by a messenger. Conrad, my companion, conducted himself excellently. May the Lord repay him. I am not permitted to write more now. I will await what you write about the people of Bern, although I think it wise to deliberate with myself for a while about what would benefit not only me but also the cause of Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. Greetings to your most honorable household and to all the brothers there.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 13, 1548.</p>
      <p>W(olfgang) Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, dearest brother and host.</p>
