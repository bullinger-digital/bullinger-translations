      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your last letter on June 17th, and it is strange that you make no mention of my last letter, which I arranged to be delivered to you by some women.</p>
      <p>It was most pleasing, however, that you have so extensively indicated what you will discuss in your Decades, and you could not have contributed a more useful work to the troubled church. You also act wisely by refuting the articles of the Interimists without anger, thus offering immense consolation to the pious in these turbulent times, as no one dares to write publicly against such a proud and arrogant book without danger. If you wish to know the most certain state of the Saxon churches, you can examine this messenger and you will hear some astonishing and amazing things. Osiander criticizes our churches in his booklets, which he published in Prussia, which I have not yet seen, but I will have them shortly. The pastors in Saxony are in disagreement and are fighting to the point of bloodshed over adiaphora. May the Lord have mercy on them.</p>
      <p>You also know that Musculus's Psalter, illustrated with commentaries, is under the Oporinus press, and Hervagius is attempting to print the works of Nazianzen in Greek and Latin, which exist, and the works of Bernhard, if he knew of certain manuscript copies, so that he could compare some things. If you know of any, I ask you to indicate them for the benefit of the students, and I do not doubt that they are hidden elsewhere, either in St. Gallen or in the Hermitage of the Virgin or in some other place.</p>
      <p>Who would not praise your excellent spectacle of the creation of the world and other matters, both for the appropriate material and for the diligence with which you Zurichers are accustomed to use above others. But what do you think of ours? It was presented with great expense by the magistrate. Farewell. June 20, 1550.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name Mr. Theodor, Pellican, Gwalther, and Frisius. I recently wrote about sending wax, but I fear you have not received the letters; if you can conveniently, send me a good Glarus herb cheese, and whatever you want in return, I will repay in good faith. Farewell again and forever.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>You know that Mr. Tragutum of Sicily is threatened by many ships. War is brewing either in Spain or in Italy. Mr. Maurus, the French envoy, came to us yesterday to start a new project. Paulus Vergerius has gone to Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian and most vigilant pastor Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his ever-praiseworthy teacher.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
