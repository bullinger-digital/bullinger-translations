      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ the Savior, etc.</p>
      <p>Our lords, the school overseers, men and brothers in Christ, dearly beloved, have decided that a small barrel of old red wine should be sent to each of you, not because they wish to repay in kind for the books donated to our library or for your exceptional care and diligence, which you have shown towards the students of our church, but to give at least some indication of their grateful and benevolent spirit towards you. The reason for the delay so far is known to Mr. Gwalther; but soon enough, if well enough.</p>
      <p>The wine is taken from one barrel.</p>
      <p>Our steward wanted the selection and judgment of the wine's quality to be left to me from all the wines. Therefore, if any mistake has been made in this regard, it should be attributed to me.</p>
      <p>If I had the palate of Frisius, I would not have erred. But I believe I have gone to the right source.</p>
      <p>The judgment of this matter is in your hands.</p>
      <p>I have inscribed your names on the barrels with both red and white chalk; they will return each to its owner. Meanwhile, farewell and live long unharmed for the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>My fellow ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>I wish health to Lords Bibliander, Martyr, Wolf, Haller, all of them.</p>
      <p>In haste, Schaffhausen, November 6, 1558. Yours entirely from the heart, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned gentlemen Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Rudolf Gwalther, Mr. Hans Fries, his kind lords, in Zurich.</p>
