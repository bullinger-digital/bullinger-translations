      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>I am sending you a copy of our apology, most illustrious Bullinger, venerable brother in the Lord, and I ask you to let me know your judgment on it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The prince holds you in the highest regard, loves and respects you. He has already made honorable mention of your letters more than once. He is truly a Christian and seeks Christ. Soon he will demonstrate with the clearest arguments that he is seriously engaged in the evangelical cause. I cannot write more to you, as I am so occupied. I returned from him yesterday, and today I must go to him again. One business leads to another.</p>
      <p>The leaders of the university are doing everything they can to maintain the old course and order of studies. Grynaeus and I, relying on the authority of the prince, are contemplating a completely different, more convenient, and more fruitful method. Pray to the Lord that everything may succeed happily.</p>
      <p>Commend me to the dearest brothers who are with you: Pellican, Leo, Theodor, etc.</p>
      <p>Enkelin was here, whom I do not yet believe to be there. However, I ask that, as soon as he returns to you, you instruct him to move with his wife and children to the village of Lustnau, for the matter is now settled. He is still lingering in Ulm. Furthermore, I beseech you by Christ to ensure that the little letter you see here is sent to Mr. Heinrich Finitz, the pastor of Wening, as I am calling him to the church he presided over in previous years.</p>
      <p>But farewell, Bullinger, esteemed by me in many respects, and forgive the brevity and haste of my writing. Such are my affairs now that I am compelled to devote myself entirely to the province I have once undertaken. Give my warmest greetings to your excellent and most chaste little wife. Our Grynaeus, a man of incomparable piety and learning, whom the prince uniquely embraces, wishes you well along with all the brothers and friends. Farewell again, my heart, and love me as you do.</p>
      <p>January 7th.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Zurichers, esteemed brother in Christ.</p>
