      <p>God's grace be with us all. Beloved lord and brother, the situation with us is very bad and dangerous.</p>
      <p>Our lords have demanded from us what we might accept or not accept in the Interim with God. We did this on June 11 and informed them that we could not accept the Interim with a good conscience and also do not advise them to accept it. Thereupon they called a council and assembly. What they decided, I do not yet know. I fear the lord will make a great disturbance among us. The emperor begins to be vehement and intends to enforce the Interim by force, and it is evident from all things that this will be the greatest ruin of the German nation. O German liberty, o liberty, in what great danger you are. Enough for you. Your letter has reached me well. I thank God, who has comforted me in soul and body through your service. I still wait, although with great danger, wanting to hold to the lord until he commands me otherwise with a good conscience, although things seem to show that I have little hope that we can remain with the pure doctrine.</p>
      <p>Therefore, beloved brother, do not withdraw your trust from me, and if I should come to you, I trust you will help me. In return, I will conduct myself in all matters so that you should be pleased with me. Pray to God earnestly for me and my troubled church; for we stand in great distress. Meanwhile, may God keep you in his grace along with your dear church, and learn to become wise from others' misfortunes. O liberty, you noble good.</p>
      <p>Greet your dear wife, Master Pellican, Theodor, and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, June 11, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, the one you know.</p>
      <p>To Lord Bullinger, faithful servant of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, dearest brother.</p>
