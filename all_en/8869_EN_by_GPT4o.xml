      <p>Greetings. In the recent weekly fairs, I sent you a letter, which I believe you have received; I responded to your last one. Now, this messenger is sent out of concern and love for you. We are indeed anxious about your well-being and peace. We wish to know the state of your affairs. Therefore, a letter is written to the honorable consul Wilhelm; I write to you. Please inform us diligently about how your affairs are; I speak of the public, not private state.</p>
      <p>We pray to the Lord that all may go well and happily. We hear from France that the marriage between the young King of Navarre and the king's sister has been arranged, yet a dispute arises through the old queen, who wants her chaplain, the mass priest, to officiate the wedding, which the young king does not want, but rather that it be officiated by his minister of the word. The king has decided and said they are to be married; and so it shall remain. However, both are to be crowned and anointed, and the day is set for May 5th in Paris.</p>
      <p>Both courts are traveling there. May God grant much grace and salvation to it.</p>
      <p>From England, I have written about the bishops of London, Ely, and the Archbishop of York, that John Jewel of Salisbury, a man of singular piety and doctrine, died in October during the visitation of the diocese, that it stands well and peacefully for the sake of religion; that the papists attempted to rebel, but were completely suppressed, the leaders captured, some judged, and the leader, the Duke of Suffolk, solemnly sentenced to death.</p>
      <p>Take care, he is now judged. The letters are dated February 17; the execution had not yet taken place. The Queen of Scots is still imprisoned. A booklet has been published about her murder, poisoning, adultery, and terrible deeds. Take care, her reward will also come. In the Kingdom of Scotland, there is no dispute in religion; they are evangelical, but quite divided, as one part supports the imprisoned queen, the other the young king, and now there is an agreement, where England declares to support those who adhere to the right. The Duke of Alba tyrannizes, he is said to fortify his borders against France; for he is in discord with England, and yet France and England are to be united. In Saxony and other German lands, the captains are said to be appointed; waiting for France and England. Thus it is written and said here and there, etc. Many such things of this kind are written and said, which I did not want to share with you.</p>
      <p>I write this very hastily in the reading room during the examination. For this week, examinations are held. May the Lord bless you and keep you and all yours from all evil.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 16, 1572.</p>
      <p>Greet all our people in order.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, minister of the Church of Chur, my beloved brother and friend.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
