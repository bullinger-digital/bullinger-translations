      <p>Greetings, dearest godfather in the Lord. Regarding my affairs, there is not much to write; they are neither worse nor better than they have been so far. Perhaps I am a tolerable man, as long as I remain here at my own expense and keep silent, which I do as long as necessity itself compels me, so that with the hope of better things, I may endure whatever loss of my means. Meanwhile, I await the counsel of the Lord, whom I know will not fail me. Perhaps there will be occasions when I may be transferred to those who will take my necessity into account. Would that there were some way to advise Mr. Gervasius, whose desolation greatly troubles me. May the Lord grant that, when nothing is offered here in Switzerland, where he may use the talent received from the Lord for the church's benefit, he may soon be recalled to his own, and I am hopeful that not only is it possible, but it will happen, that he will be restored to his own, whatever may become of me.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Mr. Schertlin came to us; he showed me a letter from a certain friend, which is as follows: "It is known from a reliable person that the Emperor is gravely ill and has already attempted four times to hold a diet, which he could not complete even once, as he is so weakened not only in body but also in mind, that he lies in bed as if devoid of hope, in such a way that even the doctors have almost despaired of him being able to be helped by human means, but expect help from God alone, so that the Spaniards are anxious about bringing Philip back to Spain, because in their cunning and prudence they see dangers everywhere and think they will be safe neither in Germany nor in Italy, while the Frenchman, whom they try to deceive, responded in such a way that they are very uncertain about his intentions" etc. This he says. Schertlin, however, affirms that the person who writes this is a trustworthy man. If you have anything about the people of Strasbourg, I beg you to share it. My people in Augsburg do not relent in their fervor for hearing the gospel; to the Lord be the glory. The spirit of the priests is rendered confused and cast down; may the Lord trouble them.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, dearest godfather in the Lord. My wife and children greet you and all yours. Bern, Switzerland, 8th April 1550.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your godfather in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his godfather in Christ, most dearly beloved.</p>
