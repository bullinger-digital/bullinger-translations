      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, dear brother, in which you indicate that you do not involve yourself in the controversy between the bishop and the Rhaetians. You act wisely and rightly; it is enough if you, in accordance with your duty, occasionally press for what contributes to the peace of both parties, but do not join the sides with hostility.</p>
      <p>What you wrote based on the report of the diligent man, Mr. Karl, is indeed sad, but very worthy of our attention; may the Lord open our eyes. You will give him my greatest thanks, so to speak; greet him most kindly. What has been transcribed by the Republic of Bern regarding the very sad disturbances in France to your magistrate, you will easily understand as a pious person; however, excuse me for not writing about these matters, about which you will be more accurately informed by your own people. Farewell forever, my brother. Strive in your prayers to the Lord, encourage the church entrusted to you to pray and repent. Greet the honorable consuls, Pontisella and Ganthner, and other good men, and especially the royal envoy.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 9, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, colleague and my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
