Bullinger promises the prompt return of the [Strasbourg] opinion [on the agenda of the Schmalkalden meeting]; Leo [Jud] writes more about it, and he himself considers it bold.

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Fries is called to us, to preside over the school, which you once supervised. I beseech you to encourage this excellent man, so that he may undertake this role with a cheerful spirit.</p>
      <p>I would have sent that rather lengthy consultation now, but some parts still needed to be written out. Therefore, I will entrust it to the next and most faithful messenger. When Gastius hears that I am using it, he will not be angry, I suppose. I will return it unblemished and with the utmost fidelity. Leo responds to the rest. I could not sufficiently marvel at that bold consultation. May the Lord strengthen us in all good. Amen.</p>
      <p>The messenger here never ceases to proclaim with full cheeks the benefits of you and your wife. May the Lord be your reward.</p>
      <p>The king of the Turks threatens Europe. The Lord must be prayed to.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily together with yours.</p>
      <p>I will also write to the Bernese, so that they do not prohibit Bucer's "Retractations" in their territory. Even if they do not please us in all respects, we will by no means prohibit them. "Test everything; hold fast to what is good," says the apostle [1Thess 5, 21]. Even the blasphemies of Eck and Fabri, etc., are offered for sale among us.</p>
      <p>4th of March, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
