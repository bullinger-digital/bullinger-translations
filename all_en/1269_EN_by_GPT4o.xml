      <p>That you deign to adorn and honor me with such a great heap of benefits, Bullinger, most esteemed brother in Christ, you have indeed rendered me as bound as can be. You have compensated my brief and meager letters with a volume almost just, and that most rich and most delightful to me as I read it. Furthermore, you continue to bless me with a double gift, namely the treatise by Mr. Calvin on the most Christian concord among you in the matter of the Eucharist, and the fifth decade of your sermons, which Johannes von Ulm handed to me last night. For both gifts, I give you the greatest thanks I can. I am greatly delighted by both. Oh, if only the most merciful God would grant that in the discussion of the Holy Supper, the entire church of Christ would aim at the same goal of truth!</p>
      <p>While reading your books, especially when something that piously affects me occurs, I will not cease to remember you and to implore God with my prayers, that He may preserve you for His church for a very long time and imbue you more and more with His Holy Spirit. As for your candid and Christian reminder of my duty, and your serious urging and religious adjuration to undertake the task; I interpret this as being done by the most holy spirit of the Lord, so that we may not act sluggishly or negligently in His business.</p>
      <p>For I feel daily how sluggish we are in the Lord's affairs, and how eager and diligent in our own.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I embrace your healthy and sound advice in the reformation of God's church all the more willingly, because it agrees in all respects with my faith, with which the gracious Lord has endowed me in these matters. For I believe that everything in the church should be pure, simple, and very far removed from the elements and pomps of this world. But what can I, the lowest in both learning and authority in this our church, accomplish? I can only strive and wish that our bishops have the same mind and faith as I do, and meanwhile commit the care and outcome of His business to the Lord. You are most worthy, my Bullinger, to whom great benefits should be conferred, who receive with such a grateful mind those benefits which are either none at all or certainly very slight.</p>
      <p>Those two young men, who have stayed with us for some time, are indeed worthy of the favor and goodwill of all the pious due to their piety and ardent zeal for good letters. The other two, who have recently arrived here, and whom you so earnestly recommended to me, we will treat with as much kindness as we can for your sake. I will not fail to convey your greetings to those great heroes and your admirers. May the Lord Jesus preserve you unharmed for a very long time, and give you spirit and strength to restore His church. Farewell. Westminster, May 5, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and loving brother in Christ, Richard Cox.</p>
