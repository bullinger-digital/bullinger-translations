    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Joachim Rheticus has decided to study medicine for a while with Konrad Gessner in Zurich and therefore asked for a letter of recommendation, which he certainly deserves. He will be able to report better than anyone else about the temptations with which he has been tested by God so far. The devil still torments him, but he is already much better than a few months ago. This gives hope for a speedy recovery, especially if the people of Zurich also pray for him. His way of life in Konstanz did not give the slightest reason for justified criticism. He acknowledges his sick condition and wants to seriously improve. Therefore, he has also become dear to the people of Konstanz. And certainly, the people of Zurich will also take him to their hearts as soon as they get to know him better. He is a significant mathematician, like hardly any other, and has successfully taught this subject in Konstanz for three months. The people of Zurich should kindly receive the tormented but decent man, in the certainty that they are thereby rendering a service to Christ himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer thanks for Bullinger's letter [No. 3085], which was handed to him by the treasurer [Gabriel Arnold], whom Bullinger also knows. Through it, he learned that there is harmony among the Confederates, which pleases him very much, especially since the opposite was claimed in Konstanz! Christ, the author of true peace, may strengthen this harmony so that the Confederates never separate from each other! It is especially important now to ensure that the council question does not cause the [Catholic] places (which are very averse to the pure evangelical doctrine) to abandon the [Protestant] ones.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] There is nothing new to report that would be of importance to Bullinger. The people of Konstanz are still waiting for the response from Augsburg [Emperor Charles V's answer to their reconciliation request].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger should inform with the next messenger whether the people of Zurich would allow a marriage between cousins. In Thurgau, there is a young couple whose parents are siblings and who would still like to marry, especially since the young man [Hans Rutishauser] has impregnated the young woman [Dorothea Diethelm]. Both families also support the marriage. However, marriages between cousins were banned in Thurgau a few years ago. Thus, the young couple is in a bind, and the honorable families do not know what to do to enable the marriage. The young couple wanted to go to Zurich to inquire there. But Blarer told them that he would first do this himself. Bullinger should now give him his advice. Since the introduction of the ban in Thurgau, there have been two exceptions that did not cause any objection. However, the couple fears that their marriage could cause discontent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer does not want to delay the soon-to-depart Rheticus. Greetings to all and God's blessing. In haste. Bullinger should inform what the Baden Diet decided in the case of Joachim Mötteli of Rappenstein.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] [P.S.] from December 5: Some councilors from Überlingen have appeared in Konstanz. Blarer does not yet know why. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Since Joachim Rheticus, led by a certain plan, has decided to devote himself to the study of medicine for a while with your Gessner (my venerable and dearest brother), I wanted to recommend him to you, as he requested (and he is also worthy of it). No one can explain to you more truly than he himself the temptations with which the Lord has tested him so far. He is still troubled by the not light annoyances of Satan, but he is now much better than he was a few months ago, so there is hope that he will soon be completely freed (if he is also helped by your constant prayers). He lived among us in such a way that there is absolutely nothing from which anyone could justly complain about him. He acknowledges his illness and contemplates serious repentance, so we have begun to love him greatly in the Lord - which I have no doubt you will also do, once you have looked into him more deeply. He is an outstanding mathematician and hardly second to anyone, which he also successfully and with not little profit taught among us for up to the third month. Therefore, I earnestly beseech and implore you to kindly receive this afflicted but pious man with your usual humanity, not doubting that you have done everything for Christ himself.</p>

      <p>The treasurer, whom you know, delivered your letters to me, for which I thank you. The news that there is such beautiful harmony among your people was most delightful, for quite the opposite rumor had spread among us. May the Lord and Savior Christ, the author of true peace, graciously provide new and effective remedies for this, so that you may never be dissolved. I think you should especially fear the council of Trent: For from there perhaps a new opportunity to oppress you will be taken, if you are deserted by your confederates, who are more hostile to purer Christianity.</p>

      <p>There is absolutely nothing new to write that would be worth your knowing. But we are expecting at any moment what will be brought to us from Augsburg.</p>

      <p>Let me know with the next messenger whether you allow those who are connected in the third degree of equal lineage to marry there. There is a young couple in Thurgau. They would like to marry each other. The boy has impregnated the girl, and both families would like them to be allowed to marry. But they are the children of siblings of the young parents and thus in the third degree. And it was forbidden years ago in Thurgau to give those in the third degree together. The good people are quite stuck. It is a very honorable family. I do not know how it could be done that they are allowed to be together. They wanted to come to you and see if you would bind them together. I said I would find out for them first. I kindly ask you to give your faithful advice on how it could be done. It is indeed (nevertheless) since the prohibition nothing less than once or twice happened in Thurgau that such people were allowed to be together, and thus it remains silent. But the good people are now worried that it might not be held well for them.</p>

      <p>But now I would not dare to delay the soon-departing Joachim any longer. Farewell with all yours, whom you will command to be greeted most accurately in my name. God be with you eternally! It stands in the old right eternally. In utmost haste. I would like to know what was dealt with on the day concerning Mötteli. December 2, 1547.</p>

      <p>Some councilors from Überlingen have now arrived, but I do not yet know what business they have with us. There is nothing else to add to this. Farewell eternally. December 5, 154[7].</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable friend. Zurich.</p>
