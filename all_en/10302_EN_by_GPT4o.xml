    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's loyal support and complains about his own situation: His enemies in the Rhine Valley want to ruin him with high compensation for the destroyed church ornaments and do not spare his wife's assets in the process. Greetings. Bullinger should write to him. His wife is at the grape harvest in the Rhine Valley. Otherwise, he feels well as an emigrant in St. Gallen.</p>

      <p>May the Lord our God strengthen you and us, grant us the joyful end to recognize both physically and eternally, etc.</p>
      <p>My beloved lord and brother, for your loyalty shown in my tribulation, I give thanks to God, who may allow me, if I am able, to repay you with my humble means, that I pray for, etc. Regarding my affairs, I hope you otherwise bear knowledge of how things have gone for us. The Lord be praised, may He grant patience to bear His good will. Knowing that I have come to this, I almost regret it, etc. And as those from the Rhine Valley see that I have nothing more, the practice is to also harm my wife's assets. For I have lost to them the compensation, which Captain Fryg of the Godshouse people, with the knowledge of several from Zurich, has done behind my back, seldom paid. Also, the images that are burned; they consider it still affects over 800 guilders. My lord Master Kaspar, the loyal one, knows both articles. In God's name, everything has its time. When He wills, may He have satisfaction, grant grace for patience, for I recognize it is just to lay His hand upon me. I have appealed it to my gracious lords of the eight places, etc. etc.</p>
      <p>Praying to God for us. Greeting Leonhard, Pellican, Master Werner, Karlstadt, Tumysen, Erasmus, and beloved brothers for me. Surely God will show us a way and separate the false loves. I pray, you will not let me out of your heart, wherever it may be good, write me comfort or otherwise, as much as possible. Greeting your dear wife and household for me. The greeting from Constance from you, by ZÃ¶ger, has reached me. My wife is at the grape harvest in the Rhine Valley with much work, for it is very busy, etc.</p>
      <p>Done in haste, St. Gallen, Saturday before Gallus in the year 33.</p>
      <p>God be praised, I lack nothing in St. Gallen, also entirely favorable lords; I am well.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Vogler.</p>
      <p>To my dearly beloved lord and brother M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his hands.</p>
