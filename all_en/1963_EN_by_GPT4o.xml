      <p>Greetings. There is nothing that I think should be written to you with great urgency, except for the one thing that I confirmed to you in my previous letters: that I hold you in the highest regard, both for your exceptional doctrine and because you have shown yourself to be a supporter of mine. I have learned from reliable messengers and letters, and I have decided to send this to you, so that you are not kept in suspense by the rumors of the people for too long and so that you have something to extract even more news from your neighbors. For although we hear many things we do not wish to, it is somewhat refreshing when we can infer future events from what has happened and prepare for those that concern us. I fear that the hand of the Lord may be upon us all, so that our crimes may be atoned for. Cardinal Pole is setting out to the Emperor with the intention of using his help and the authority of the Pope to bring England back into the Roman fold; meanwhile, he makes many promises to the evangelical princes. What do you want? Theramenes is the boot that ambition wears. Farewell. Chur, 21st of August.</p>
      <p>Your Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, dearest friend.</p>
