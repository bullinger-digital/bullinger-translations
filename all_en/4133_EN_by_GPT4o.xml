      <p>Greetings. Since I had at hand a messenger so reliable and acceptable to you, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother, I thought it inappropriate for him to come to you empty-handed and entirely without letters, even though in the meantime I have nothing worthy of you to write. I am uncertain whether I sent you our Catechism published last summer; I know that I have never published a book without sending a copy; therefore, lest you lack this latest one of mine, I am sending it. If I have already sent it before, you may give the second copy to whomever you wish; I did not want you to lack any of my works, not because I think you need them, but because I wish to demonstrate my unwavering respect for you. This dear relative of yours, who is also very dear to me, will report more.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, 24th of November, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>Winterthur.</p>
