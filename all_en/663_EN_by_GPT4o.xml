      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the churchman of Zürich, my most esteemed lord and patron, Josua Maler (Pictorius) sends his greetings.</p>
      <p>Although I am reluctant to interrupt your great occupations with my unpolished letters (most esteemed lord), yet, whenever I consider your singular kindness towards me and the young men of my order, it is indeed impossible for me not to express my gratitude to your humanity in some way through my letters, unless I wish to incur the stain of ingratitude; for I experience such great kindness from you towards me, that I can easily see how much I owe to your interest in me.</p>
      <p>Among all the many favors you have bestowed upon me, this is perhaps the greatest and most pleasing to me, that not only did you wish to support my studies while I was at home, but also, after I had to move elsewhere, you ensured that I was called to better studies. In the gymnasium of Lausanne, to which we have come through your efforts and interest, I clearly perceive how much I can progress, especially in the study of languages, which flourishes there greatly; for such care and diligence are applied in the examination, indeed the thorough analysis, of the Greek language, and especially Hebrew, and theology itself, that it seems there is nothing we cannot achieve through practice and exercise, and especially with divine assistance. Therefore, we rightly owe the greatest thanks to all of you, and especially to you, who have so considered our welfare that you have ensured we come to good studies and good men. For all, and especially Mr. Pierre Viret and Mr. Ribitti, are so well-disposed towards us that they always ask what things we need, and Mr. Ribitti himself daily privately teaches Hebrew to his relative Johann, as well as to Robert Estienne, the son of the royal printer, and to me, and reviews what we have learned, so that we hope, with the Lord's favor, to return not without profit, etc. May the best and greatest God grant that we do not disappoint your expectations or those of our parents, but that we leave the place with such adherence to your admonitions and pious exhortations that neither you regret the expenses nor we the studies, etc. May the same grant that you live long and much for the common salvation of us all, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and keep us commended to your humanity and paternal care, etc.</p>
      <p>Given at Lausanne in Savoy, August 28, in the year of salvation 1549. Josua Maler, most devoted son to your humanity, etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed patron and benefactor.</p>
