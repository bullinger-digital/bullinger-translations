      <p>When I recently wrote to our Blaurer, I could not write to you, because before I was freed from the fever, a domestic sorrow occurred due to the disgrace of my stepdaughter, which compelled me into solitude for a few days. While I was in a rustic cottage, your letters were delivered to me, which are consistent with many rumors coming from elsewhere. Therefore, there is reason for us to fear.</p>
      <p>However, the method of caution is difficult.</p>
      <p>You will partly learn how great the confusion is in France from the letters of our Beza, of which I have taken care to have a copy made for you, and I will briefly touch upon it.</p>
      <p>At Aix-en-Provence, where the seat of the parliament is, a sedition was stirred up by the papists to exclude Count Crussol, who had been sent there with supreme authority. However, he, having gathered some banners, forced them to open the gates, and ordered some of them to be hanged. The part of the faction that could escape still holds a nearby city, which is sufficiently fortified.</p>
      <p>But the lack of all resources will soon compel them to surrender: for until now they have been acting like bandits. The court itself, terrified by fear, pronounces severe sentences against the seditious, although many of the judges are implicated in the same crime. But they are spared until the commotion subsides.</p>
      <p>Marseille and other cities that were inclined to defection have been subdued by imposing garrisons. The Toulouse court would have gladly thrown everything into confusion: but the city councilors, who are called the heads of the citizens because the ordinary jurisdiction is in their hands, have so restrained the pride and cruelty of the court with a strong and firm hand that now in the suburbs there are free assemblies of the pious up to ten thousand people: indeed, fifteen thousand have given their name to the gospel.</p>
      <p>In Auvergne, the nobility is furiously persistent. Among the Armoricans, that is, in Brittany, the nobles have almost unanimously embraced the gospel, as in Picardy, but the common people cannot be persuaded. In Champagne and the domain of Sens, they are moderately inclined.</p>
      <p>The Burgundians are beginning to dare more.</p>
      <p>The king's edict is obeyed, but this spectacle irritates the adversaries more, as such large crowds proceed in order than if God were invoked in an obscure place in the city. Certainly, nothing delays the course of Christ's kingdom more than the scarcity of ministers.</p>
      <p>Beza indeed narrates how Julian tries to ruin everything at court. But whatever evil he concocts will fall back on his own head.</p>
      <p>However, he had not yet received my last letters at that time. Now, when the queen sees that help is ready, she might be more sharply aroused.</p>
      <p>I will also urge, as I have done so far, that our people do not let such an opportunity slip away, who would oppose themselves too late in extreme matters. I have already sent the advice that Beza asked from me, of which I send you a Latin copy, although I preferred to render my French response in a crude style word for word rather than strive for the elegance of the Latin language. Brevity was also my concern, provided I encompassed everything.</p>
      <p>If I seem to have conceded more to the opposing party than is fair, remember that this is not to be dealt with by wishes. Therefore, the protestation had to be adapted to the queen's sentiment.</p>
      <p>However, I had two things proposed: that our conditions, when they please the king's council, be strongly rejected by the papists, which is certain they will do. Then, if they are drawn to bear the yoke, that no council of any kind may harm us.</p>
      <p>For I deemed it more useful for us to sit there as tribunes of the people than to be overwhelmed by more opinions mixed with the senators. You will see what our Beza asks from you, and you will decide what is expedient with your colleagues, with the speed that is appropriate. If anything of greater importance happens, I will make sure you are informed promptly.</p>
      <p>Cognetus, when he arrives, will assist us in carrying letters back and forth. The trial of France will reveal the hypocrisy of those who have depended on men; the spirit of the pious will grow, and they will learn all the more to rely on one God, and at the same time, the agitation will urge them to prayers. Reading over the previous parts, I noticed that something was omitted, which I had decided to touch upon.</p>
      <p>Now, around the middle of February, a rumor was spread in this vicinity that by your advice the Bernese senate had been led to change its opinion about convening a synod. Therefore, those who were already prepared for the journey were suddenly forbidden by a new edict to move a foot. Indeed, I know you acted with a right mind; but experience will soon teach that the advice was not at all useful, nor is there any reason for you to implore my help, as I declare that everything is lost. I refrain from saying more.</p>
      <p>Recently, having been summoned to the Neuch√¢tel synod, I excused myself, lest those who pretend to desire my help should cry out that I am exceeding my limits. I am called there again; what I will do, I do not know.</p>
      <p>This I know, that you are too, too mistaken, while you think they desire the church to be well advised. Would that I were beyond the Sarmatians, since I am thus insulted so contemptuously!</p>
