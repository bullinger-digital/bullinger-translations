      <p>Every day I experience that the Lutherans, lacking in more sincere judgment, charity, and even humanity, which I say not without sorrow, hasten the just judgment of the Lord upon themselves. For many years we have endured and overlooked their barbaric harshness, which neither you nor other good men had experienced, who judged that we had sinned by responding to Luther, though not immoderately. I received the book of Joachim Westphal, and indeed of Westphal, that is, a man of crude nature, but since I received all those things of yours from Gallus only yesterday, when I was otherwise very busy, I was not able to read anything in it.</p>
      <p>I recently inspected his jumble and understood what kind of mind the man has. May the Lord forgive both him and the other plainly foolish Lutherans and instruct them with a purer and better mind. There were already enough and more than enough disputes in the church, however they might not awaken a tragedy that had been lulled in any way. But they will give an account to the just judge of all, God. We are strongly opposed by the Papists, Anabaptists, followers of Epicureanism, Arians reborn in the Spanish Servetus, and many other heresies, which tear at the flesh of Christ, his merit, and resurrection. Now the Lutherans also join. But our most holy, most powerful, most merciful God will not forsake pure truth and us. I approve of your intention to respond to Westphal's jumble. Proceed now, and do not delay the necessary work for long. Thus the slanderers and Zoiluses will understand that you do not disagree with us. However, I hope our Calvin will respond to that booklet you sent about the true faith in the supper, etc., of Westphal. Perhaps someone from our side, especially our Bibliander, will respond to him. For I, since I have not yet read it, could not establish anything certain and write to you.</p>
      <p>However, I know that Calvin has considered responding to the jumble: this he recently discussed with me in a letter. I am now writing to him that you will respond to the jumble: it is better that he himself responds to the one you just sent, which none of us have seen so far. May the Lord our God grant us to do that which most promotes His glory, the salvation of our souls, and the edification of the churches, and may He remove quarrels, contentions, and offenses - - - - - - - - -</p>
      <p>Yours and of all the pious from the heart, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Johannes a Lasco, Polish baron, most faithful and vigilant superintendent of the church of foreigners in Emden, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Greetings.</p>
