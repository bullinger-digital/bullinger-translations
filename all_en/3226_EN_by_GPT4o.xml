      <p>Through Christ Jesus, greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>Petrus Perna, now a citizen of Basel, or Socinus will show our first response to Vergerius's slanders, my venerable lord and brother in the Lord Bullinger. Matters are conducted here by our people moderately and peacefully. If Vergerius had wished to remain consistent in those things he promised you, we would not be troubled. But being bound by foreign debt, the repayment of which even those most abundant in money reluctantly undertake, they are easily changed. He did the same here, when his creditors, and among them Oporinus especially, were expecting, having aimed a poisoned dart at me and Gratarolus, he suddenly departed, not as quickly as we would have wished, perhaps to return. But believe me, he gained little favor with our senate and academy with this criminal accusation of his. But leaving these things aside, I beg you, my most esteemed lord and brother, not to disdain to respond to my recent letters nor to despise him whom you have always shown to be most dear to you by not obscure or doubtful signs; you will suffer no loss of either authority or peace here.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your dearest ones.</p>
      <p>Basel, 28th of June, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely as always, Celio Secondo signed.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, most esteemed lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
