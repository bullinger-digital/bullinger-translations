      <p>S. D. After a long and dangerous journey, most excellent men, your letter written on October 6th was presented to me upon my return home yesterday. Good God, where should I turn, what should I think, what should I do, as I find my son, in whom I had placed all my hopes for posterity, to be so degenerate and depraved? Would that God either take him away unless he repents in time, or that the earth swallow him up, so that he may not be a disgrace to me and mine, especially an abomination to the most good God. But what else, brothers, am I to do but what the Lord himself teaches? I will try everything, indeed I will leave no stone unturned, until I finally see if there is any hope of repentance left in him. But I beseech and implore you by the ancient faith, if that rascal is still with you or in your city, to first encourage and admonish him with kind words to return to the right path, and if those fail, to apply the utmost severity, and strive to ensure that, if possible, he stays with you, Lord Simler, this winter, however unworthy he may be of your house, and still devote himself to his studies. But if this remedy does not work, make sure that Jonas, with the bearer of this letter, comes straight to me in Lauingen and brings his belongings with him as much as he can. I will indeed make every effort to better form that impure man. However, I wish this threat to remain hidden from him until he comes to me, and when he departs, I ask that you lend him a single crown for travel expenses. Furthermore, you, my most distinguished Simler, send me in writing the account of the expenses he incurred with you, and also what he owes others in good faith. The money he accumulated without your and my knowledge should not be charged to me; nevertheless, I will do what is fair and what you yourselves instruct me to do. I am writing the enclosed note to the crime, not to my son, which you should not show him until he refuses to stay with you any longer without hope of repentance.</p>
      <p>Truly, I am doubly miserable, who after so many labors and hardships, now as an old man, am tormented by my own flesh. But the Lord, that heavenly Father, will bear the greatest part of my weakness; this I know for certain. Last month I wrote to you, Lord Simler, and to Jonas; let me know whether my letters were delivered to you or not. Finally, do not think for a moment that I have conceived any ill will from your paternal revelation of my son's condition; rather, be assured that I greatly praise your faith and loyalty in this matter, and I promise to be as grateful for this and all the benefits bestowed upon me as anyone ought to be.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that the honorable man Hans Geßner, who was my dear bath companion and associate, lent and provided so much to my son without your knowledge; but be that as it may, he shall not remain unpaid, yet he or another should not involve themselves further. You would have best known his needs and could have provided him with advice. Disobedience and excessive freedom and presumption cause all fathers heavy hearts through their children. I ask you to do your best, as I trust you, and I would gladly do the same for your sake.</p>
      <p>The people of Nuremberg, along with their two bishops and Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, are strongly opposed to Margrave Albrecht in the field before Plassenburg and Schweinfurt, having spent over 20 times a hundred thousand florins so far without gaining a penny's worth of benefit. It is still uncertain whether they will be bishops or bathers. The Margrave has well-manned the fortifications, is equipped with cavalry, occasionally raids the heath and roads, and his enemies do not know where to attack him, having to be as cautious of him as he is of them. I think he will keep them occupied throughout the winter until their coffers are completely empty; then perhaps he will show himself. It seems almost impossible to reach another agreement, and this war may soon spread from Franconia to Swabia. In short, everything in the empire is turning out for the best for the Turks and Spaniards. On the 23rd of November, I was in Nuremberg on very important matters, and I found nothing but misery and distress. Wit has flown to heaven; years ago, they said Nuremberg saw with the eye, and the priests made a rhyme in the year 47: Wit had Nuremberg, axlaportavit utroque, etc.</p>
      <p>I do not know who has it now. Duke Augustus is aligned with the Margrave, sitting quietly; Austria is half worried about the Turks. The imperial majesty has called a diet in Augsburg, but there is little hope of progress. In Heidelberg, an alliance has also been made among nearly similar parties, Bavaria, the Palatinate, Mainz, Trier, Württemberg.</p>
      <p>In these difficult times, I have committed myself to the pious Count Palatine Ottheinrich; there, the pure religion is free for me, and I am very satisfied with Master Michael, the court preacher, a truly pious and learned man. However, we must endure the coarse Lutheranism not a little.</p>
      <p>The prince is Christian and pious. May you all be entrusted to the grace of the Almighty and pray to our Father in heaven for me; for I am beset by many things in which no one but His divine grace can help me. Given in all haste on the 29th day of November in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Georg Frölich von der Lömnitz, counselor to the Count Palatine, now in Lauingen.</p>
      <p>Brenz has helped my lord establish a church order, it is in print; I do not know what grain it holds, but I understand he would have liked to have the matter halved.</p>
      <p>If my son is no longer in Zurich, but elsewhere nearby, direct this messenger to him. I write to him in the enclosed note how he should conduct himself; if he does not, he will find a strict father in me.</p>
      <p>To the pious, Christian, highly learned lords Heinrich Bullinger and Josias Simler, etc., in Zurich, my dear lords and friends. Zurich.</p>
