      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>Augustin Maynard, the minister of the church in Clavenna, is coming to you and the other leaders of your church. Although he is old and advanced in years, he does not refuse to endure any labor and troubles to serve the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>He himself wished that we would judge his doctrine, and he was prepared to abide by our judgment. However, in order that his confession of faith and doctrine, which we believe to be in conformity with both yours and ours, indeed with the word of the Lord, might be more approved by your judgment, we have decided to send him to you, so that you may recognize him as a man who thinks piously about Christ and as a man of proven life. With these very brief words, I wish to commend him to you, and farewell through the Lord. If there are any new matters from Italy, no one knows them better than he. We continually expect the Augsburg Reformation.</p>
      <p>Written in Chur, June 3, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful and vigilant Antistes of the church in ZÃ¼rich, a brother to his most esteemed lord.</p>
