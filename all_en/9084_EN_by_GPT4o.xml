      <p>Wednesday after Simon and Jude, October 29, from Geneva.</p>
      <p>From Paris, we have not been able to learn anything substantial; there is much clamor; yet it is certain: the Huguenots have won Nîmes (Nemauß or Nymiß) the city and have killed many priests there. In Vienna, a strong force is gathering from the Dauphiné and Narbonne; it will join the prince of Condé. To this, those from Auvergne, Burgundy, and Nevers, who have gathered at Mâcon, will join. They have taken a strong fortress last Monday and there captured the robbers and murderers who had attacked, robbed, and killed some of the refugees from Lyon, etc.</p>
      <p>The king, advised by his ruiners, began this play to suppress it, so it seems to be resolved by those who ruin him and the realm, becoming more and more enraged, preparing for counteraction, etc. There was good talk and negotiation for peace, and good means were found; but when it came to the point that both parties should give hostages and settle and secure everything, it was found that those with the king were playing everything in such a way that in the long delay, the king could prepare himself. Therefore, the matter now stands badly and in such a way that, unless God intervenes, France must be plundered and torn apart by both parties, etc. The prince of Condé is now supposed to be thirty thousand strong before Paris.</p>
      <p>I have written all these letters to Chur to Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor there, from the year of Christ 1567 to the year of Christ 1574.</p>
      <p>After his death (he died in November in the year 1574), his son Raphael Egli brought me these letters on March 28, as they are compiled here, and handed them over to me. I have thus bound them together here.</p>
