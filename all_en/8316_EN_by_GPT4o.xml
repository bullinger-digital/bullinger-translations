      <p>I greet you again from the heart, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Your letter dated [second] / 2nd of March, which just passed, did not reach our hands until the [22nd] twenty-second of July, which often happens either due to the great distance between places or the negligence of couriers. I finally received it eagerly and read it with joy, as it informed me that you are enjoying good health, although you are an old man, worn out by many labors and weakened by illnesses. I received your books on Daniel and Isaiah (in which I frequently engage with pleasure) with a willing mind; for which I am very grateful to you, and no less do all those devoted to piety acknowledge that they owe you much for these very works. When your German sermons reach my hands, I will try to understand them either by my own efforts or with the help of others. Now truly, my Heinrich, since God the best and greatest has used you for so many years as His instrument for the great benefit of His church, you must persevere in the defense of the church of Christ until the end of life, as far as age permits. Many heads of the Antichrist still remain to be cut off, which continually cause us trouble; in cutting off which, I wish you would seriously apply your efforts! The Antichrist strives, relying on the authority of his church and his councils, to assert that faith is not to be kept with heretics, namely those whom he judges to be heretics. Then he arrogates to himself the authority to revoke and withdraw subjects from the faith and obedience of their princes and magistrates and to absolve them, and commands other princes to invade, devastate, plunder, and strip pious magistrates of all right to rule, as was also evident last month from a papal bull secretly sent into our England. Finally, there are not a few papists of low rank who strive with all their might to be allowed to live according to their own and their consciences and that no account of their religion be demanded by anyone. Meanwhile, they secretly forge many wicked things and are a stumbling block to the pious by their very bad example. If you apply your efforts to these three points, you will have done a most pleasing service to Christ and the church. The schism concerning the vestments of priests among men of purer note is still growing (I say this not without sorrow). May God finally grant that we all feel the same!</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you with yours and your renowned city! Let us rejoice in the Lord and help each other with mutual prayers.</p>
      <p>From my Tusculum in Ely, 10th of July, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your brother in Christ, Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely.</p>
      <p>To my dearest brother in Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Ely requests that I respond to some questions in the bull. 1570.</p>
