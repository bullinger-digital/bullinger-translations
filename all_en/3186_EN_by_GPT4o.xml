      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Johannes Fabricius sends greetings. Your letters, reverend father in Christ, which you frequently send to me, are so full of your love and goodwill towards me that I cannot help but read them with great pleasure. From them, I can clearly see and fully understand, something I never doubted, that I am greatly loved by you, an excellent man, and, what is more, regarded and held in the place of a son, as you have never yet omitted sending me a message without your letters, despite your great occupations.</p>
      <p>I would call myself a log or rather a stump, which your remarkable kindness would not affect beyond measure. Indeed, I derive from your letters the benefit that it is credible for a man of the most serious, prudent, and mature judgment to perceive, even if he is unskilled and ignorant of all things, yet not lazy. Your letters are filled with the most faithful advice and the holiest counsel, which can make me not only more learned but also more prudent and better equipped for all ecclesiastical duties.</p>
      <p>Thus far, I have diligently toiled for some time in the most pleasant field of the Muses, from which I have perhaps acquired some knowledge, but little or no prudence. For I have often pursued the solitudes, which by nature I am fond of and which the Muses especially love: now I no longer have dealings with streams or the babbling of fountains, but with men, and indeed Christians entrusted to my care and faith. It is incredible to say how much your letters are a great help to me in this task, by whose assistance you also open an easy path and access for me to the friendships of good men, as I recently discovered with great pleasure from the letters lovingly written to me by the most distinguished man from Salis. For these services of yours to me, I owe you the greatest thanks. Certainly, the friendship and familiarity of Friedrich von Salis, a man born in the highest rank among his people, can be not only an ornament and honor but also a great advantage to me in conducting affairs. What you write about the royal envoy, it was pleasant to hear that a man of such piety and integrity, as he is praised, was sent to these regions; may he accomplish his king's business without any particular detriment to the Christian republic!</p>
      <p>I have frankly confessed to him that I, along with Mr. Philipp, am focused on this one thing, that our people may maintain their full freedom, and when he replied that faith should still be kept even with an enemy (as he had heard that some minds were alienated from the king), I responded that I could not pronounce anything certain about it because I do not involve myself in military affairs; yet I strive, relying on the authority of the divine word (of which I am a minister), to withdraw and recall our citizens from mercenary service by all means possible. Certainly, he did not disapprove of my plan. However, I told him to expect from me all the duties of a good and Christian man.</p>
      <p>As for the king's friendship with us, take this in a few words: A third part of the Confederates (the Upper League) almost agrees to renounce the alliance with the French king and to withdraw from the agreements; but with what plan, I do not see, unless they perhaps favor the emperor more earnestly. This is thought to be the result of the practices of the imperial envoys, who stayed in these regions for some time in the past months. I will say plainly and openly what I think: it is almost incredible that our people can be led away from their love of military service, since each village is its own magistrate. I think you understand me: everything is more prone to seditions than in places where a certain magistrate is appointed over the affairs, by whose judgment the bodies and fortunes of the subjects are determined.</p>
      <p>Suppose they withdraw from the agreements today: there is a danger that at the next opportunity they will again voluntarily seek them (for you know the fickleness of the common people) or, what would be worse, follow the emperor's side, which would fuel popular sedition. Certainly, I, who have not yet fully known and understood the customs of this people, will act as a spectator rather than an actor in this tragedy for a while, until I have more fully considered what will be for the benefit of the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>About our bishop's business, another time, when leisure permits. Recently, he certainly discussed with me at length and in detail about the article of justification, and although he does not agree with us in all things, yet, when I explained to him at length why we add this exclusive particle (alone), he finally acquiesced to the reasons I presented or at least pretended to acquiesce, about which more another time. Farewell, reverend father in Christ. Give my greetings to your wife, the most honorable matron, with your children and sons-in-law, the best men and most esteemed by me. Furthermore, if you ever meet Lord Gualter, Mr. Wolphius, Mr. Haller, and Mr. Collin, my father-in-law, and convey my greetings to them in my words, you will do me a very great favor.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, reverend father, and continue to love me. Chur, May 17, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. Both consuls have ordered me to send you their very best regards, and Mr. Philipp Gallicius has given me the same command.</p>
      <p>I am also sending the letters of Mr. Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, outstanding in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, tireless minister of Christ among the people of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
      <p>Zurich, by the Great Minster.</p>
