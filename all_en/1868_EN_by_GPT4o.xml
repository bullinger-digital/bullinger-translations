      <p>To the illustrious, high-born prince and lord, Lord Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc., my gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince, gracious lord, my entirely willing service along with all good things be to your princely grace, etc. After your princely grace wrote along with the given answers to Theobald Thamer's enclosed writings, which were faithfully and well delivered to me by your princely grace's servants, from which I understood that your princely grace graciously desires that diligent conference be held with the aforementioned Thamer, to see if he might be turned away from his harmful error, I immediately summoned my beloved brothers and fellow workers, servants in the word of this church, namely the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Conrad Pellican and Mr. Theodor Bibliander, readers of the Hebrew language and Holy Scripture, also Mr. Rudolf Walther, Mr. Hans Wolf, Mr. Ludwig Lavater, and Mr. Wolfgang Haller, pastors and preachers, and according to your princely grace's letter, we were all very willing to serve your princely grace, having thus read the enclosed writings and understood the unfounded and entirely absurd opinion of Thamer. However, we praised God, our Lord, who gave your princely grace such understanding and experience of the Scripture in your heart, that you are able to refute all false teachings of the aforementioned Thamer and preserve the pure truth; praying to God from the heart that He may increase His grace and spirit in your princely grace and keep it steadfast until the end. Thereupon we summoned Thamer to us, greeted him amicably, and offered him all love and friendship. And since your princely grace desires to hold a friendly conversation with him, we are willing to listen kindly. Herewith we began the matter from the ground up, asking if he recognized that the holy, divine Scripture, called the Bible, is the true word of God? His answer to this was so obscure and confused that we had to bring out his opinion from him with many and various questions. It was: if the creature and conscience did not agree with it, it was nothing. We also found that he did not concede to the Holy Scripture as he should, and we knew that he should rightly concede.</p>
      <p>But he was so obstinate, indecent, and loud, unwilling to hear what was amicably said to him, that we have never encountered such a rude man, with whom everything was lost that we discussed kindly. It finally came to the point that he freely admitted, since we do not accept his principles, creatures, and conscience, he would not accept our principle, the letter or the Scripture, which caused us not to proceed further in the conversation. We commend him to God as a poor, lost, and destroyed human being, which your princely grace's servant can tell in more detail; for we left and set him there for the conversation so that he could report to your princely grace and also see and hear all things himself.</p>
      <p>We hereby humbly ask your princely grace to have gracious satisfaction with our service; for, wherever your princely grace could show us willing service at all times, we would be well-disposed.</p>
      <p>May God graciously keep your princely grace in prosperity for the good of His church for a long time. Dated Zurich, May 7, 1553. Your princely grace's servant Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zurich.</p>
