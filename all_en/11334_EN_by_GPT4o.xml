    <p xml:id="regest1">The church community of Dürnten has been inadequately cared for over the years because their pastor, Ulrich [Zingg], is ill, and therefore they have to be provisionally served by deacons [and pastors] from the surrounding communities. Now that Pastor [Zingg] - as they have heard - has been relieved of his duties and is being provided for elsewhere with his family, they are asking to urge the council to fill the position with a permanent pastor.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, the Father, through Christ, His anointed, etc.</p>
      <p>Pious, faithful, dear lords and fathers, after brother Ulrich, pastor in Dürnten, has been severely ill, the parish and church in Dürnten have been inadequately cared for over the years and days (as long as the mentioned brother's illness kept him bedridden, receiving treatment in Zurich and spa visits), being served here and there in a piecemeal manner, sometimes by the deacon from Wald, then by the one from Gossau, occasionally by the one from Bubikon and also the one from Rüti, without proper order, which, in our opinion, has caused no small displeasure to the community and has led the church (which was previously defiled by the Anabaptists) to further disarray and disorder.</p>
      <p>Since we are reliably informed that our gracious lords, a wise council, have determined that the aforementioned Mr. Ulrich is too weak to fulfill the duties of the parish of Dürnten and other offices due to his incapacity, and have therefore undertaken and ordered to provide for him and his children as needed, but the execution of this order might be delayed, which would not help the church and might lead the people to further discontent and disorder due to the prolonged lack of a permanent shepherd, therefore, it is our dutiful request and friendly desire to you, our dear lords and fathers, to present the matter to our gracious lords and to make efforts so that the aforementioned church (which is indeed worthy of a brave, well-educated man and is endowed with a reasonably good income) is provided with a permanent shepherd without further delay. We consider this to be very necessary and beneficial, and we are also eager to repay such efforts to you and each of you individually to the best of our ability. With this, we commend ourselves to you as your willing brothers at all times, and we are faithfully entrusted to the Lord along with your entrusted churches.</p>
      <p>Dated in Bubikon from the common colloquium, July 29, in the year 1539, sealed with the usual seal and mark of our brother from Bubikon.</p>
      <p>Your all willing brothers, the servants of the church in the office of Grüningen, collectively and individually.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-educated, and faithful Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Mr. Leo Jud, and Caspar Megander, etc., servants of the church in Zurich, our dear lords and fathers, collectively and individually.</p>
