    <p xml:id="regest1">The lack of couriers and his poor health prevent him from writing letters properly. Bullinger should persuade Gervasius Schuler to depart for Memmingen soon. Blarer is concerned about Kaspar von Schwenckfeld's activities in Augsburg. Greetings. He requests the dispatch of Bullinger's writing «De Testamento». Promises further information about Schwenckfeld.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Besides the fact that I learned late that this good man would be traveling there, and now I must send a messenger to Lindau and Isny, other matters also trouble me, especially a certain severe distillation in my body, straining my diaphragm, so that I am less lively and cannot write anything to you now, my venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I ask you again and again, moved by your encouragement, to immediately send Gervasius here, whom my people in Memmingen are waiting for with the utmost impatience. I will write to Leo in due time.</p>
      <p>This Schwenckfeld is now in Augsburg, insinuating himself into the friendships of the more sensible with amazing arts. To impose more subtly, he also seeks the favor of ministers by any means he can, so that by abusing their grace and authority, he may overturn the ministry. He condemns the ministry of the word, condemns the sacraments, and with great authority, he imposes certain rare doctrines that are abhorrent to the solid doctrine of Christ on many with a very wicked mind. He boasts that if we approve of anything of his, he himself, to approve of ours, so cautiously avoids it that he wants to appear as if he has given us a great offense by any testimony of the gospel. We must diligently pray to Christ the Savior, that by the benefit of His spirit, He may maturely vindicate His most holy bride from this scab. Oh, how diligently we must watch over this altar of Christ, lest it be defiled by the polluted sacrifices of these scoundrels!</p>
      <p>But now, my brother, my heart, farewell and kindly forgive this hurried and more than tumultuous writing for your candor and love towards us. My brother with my sister, cousin, the people of Zurich, fellow ministers, and the rest who were with you, commend themselves to you. Greet the most pious and excellent man Pellican, Leo, Theodor, with the whole choir of saints, not forgetting in the meantime those two most courteous men, your companions, Utinger and Steiner.</p>
      <p>In Constance, October 30, 1533.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>But hey, my Bullinger, send, I beg you, what you recently promised to send about the unity of testaments or one testament. In return, we will send you more, which we expect to be sent from Strasbourg about Schwenckfeld at any moment.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious Antistes of the Church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable brother.</p>
