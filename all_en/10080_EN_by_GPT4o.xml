      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt, most dear Huldrych [!], that you have received my letters from Funck in Bern, in which I undoubtedly make myself so troublesome and annoying to you that you would rather never have known Berchtold than to be burdened and pressed by his ignorance, trifles, and questions. But certainly, your love for me, which I have long known, draws me back from such thoughts. Therefore, since I need and request your advice and the dexterity of your mind in many things, do not hesitate to respond either through Funck or this messenger; for there are individual matters that will be raised, to which I cannot provide satisfactory answers without long meditation.</p>
      <p>At this hour, I receive from certain parish priests that the ministers are trying to obtain an excommunication order from the senate. You have previously written to me about this matter, as did Oecolampadius a year ago at the Aargau assembly, offering it to the delegates of the once Christian city. I also spoke in Aargau on the first of August this year with Oecolampadius, and indeed we came to the conclusion that our rite of punishing the wicked did not seem so absurd to him, except that he argued that his was closer to Scripture and the word and should be separate from our function, which is to sit with judges appointed by the magistrate; for thus the authority of the church is taken away and entirely transferred to the magistrate, and we and our word are made odious because of this judicial function. But I hope the senate will change nothing unless we first receive advice from the brothers of other churches as well.</p>
      <p>Our Megander is still at rest, for whose cause I also expect you to provide a thorough explanation. However, I would like you to completely commit the previous letters to the fire, so that through others, to whom you might entrust them, no one could suspect ill of me; for I would not want to easily offend anyone.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we hear here that the people of Zurich have admitted soldiers to the King of France; if this is the case, it will immediately be over for the word of God throughout all of Switzerland. The Lord Imm Hag had ordered me to inquire the truth from you. Therefore, I implore you by our common Christ, respond to everything. Urge Pellican to also believe, if there are any of his annotations to be excused.</p>
      <p>Farewell and spare barbarism forever.</p>
      <p>28th of December.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely and at the altar,</p>
      <p>B. Haller</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his kind and honorable lord.</p>
