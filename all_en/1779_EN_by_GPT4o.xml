      <p>Greetings. There are many things I would like to write to you about, if only I had the time and ability to accomplish everything.</p>
      <p>We had elected Mr. Michael Schlatter to succeed Maurice in the diaconate; he was called by the senate and heard twice; now, as we hope for confirmation, another is summoned by the senate without our knowledge, a minister from Murten, to be heard as well. He will preach tomorrow; afterwards, the confirmation of one of them will take place. But I have now completely despaired about Michael, unless the Lord miraculously shows His power. He was indeed pleasing to all whom I heard; but all these things are hindered by the machinations of the consul's secretary and our Ethiopian. This secretary seeks those who will tickle his itching ears and who will not oppose him in promoting the French alliance; this is the sole aim of these perverse elections. Michael will suffer because he is considered a supporter of Zurich; for this man's spirit burns so much against the people of Zurich that he even said to Michael's face: "The Zurich preachers are restless, writing much here and there, involving themselves in all matters, and what do the people of Zurich have to do with us? We are as much a place as they are.</p>
      <p>They do what they want, and let us also do what seems good to us." He said this, and many others are like him. Therefore, the people of Bern want to have those who will say pleasing things to them. Meanwhile, you can imagine what I have to endure. My hatred for them grows daily, which, however, I easily despise in the Lord and through the Lord's grace. If Musculus were not there to console me, I would sometimes falter. The entire burden of this church is increasingly falling on me, which I would bear more easily if it were not for the diabolical and deceitful hatred of private individuals. I pray to the Lord, however, that He may give me patience and strength to endure such things.</p>
      <p>They will seize any opportunity to eventually expel me as well, so that I do not hinder their efforts. But the Lord will break their unjust plans. It is said here that my lords in Zurich have canceled the peace money, sending no one to the meeting, which gives rise to much talk. Dear friend, let me know how things stand.</p>
      <p>There is nothing particularly new, except that the emperor is said to have lost two assaults on Metz. The Confederates also had to defend themselves against the French at one place; however, nothing is certain. Whatever you have, let us know.</p>
      <p>As for the matter of predestination, it is spreading more widely every day. We suppress and restrain it as much as we can.</p>
      <p>Some say that Mr. Bibliander is going to write against Calvin: I pray again and again that this does not happen. Intervene with your wisdom and authority as much as you can. Calvin can be admonished about modesty in a way other than publicly. The people of Lausanne have established three axioms, to which all except Francis S. Paulinus, the minister from Vevay, have subscribed, and they can hardly bear him. The axioms are as follows: 1. God from eternity not only foreknew but also decreed, not only indefinitely, that whoever believed would be saved, but definitely, that certain people would be born whom He would save through faith in Christ, and who would never fall away from faith. 2. In the same way, God from eternity also decreed definitely that certain people would be born to destruction, whom He would never grant the spirit of regeneration and the assurance of faith. 3. The blame for damnation is to be sought in man alone, and yet we say that God's decree precedes, as it is eternal, without blame: because, although the cause of the eternal decree is unknown to us, it is nevertheless just, since God's will is the certain and sole rule of justice.</p>
      <p>You will learn what Francis's opinion is from the attached writing. We have written to both the class and Francis, urging both parties to concord, indignantly bearing that they establish new pronouncements, with which they want to harass those who do not subscribe. This is not the way of peace but of many disturbances. And I hope we have achieved something.</p>
      <p>I wanted to inform you of these things so that you might at least have a taste of what is happening here in this matter, and also better foresee future events.</p>
      <p>As I always pray, consider what I write to be of good counsel. I am always forced to steal enough time to write to friends; then I write everything to you more confidently and freely and with less diligence, because above all others I love and revere you as a father. May the Lord always be with you and keep you safe for His church! Musculus greets you; greet all yours from me. Bern, December 14, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
