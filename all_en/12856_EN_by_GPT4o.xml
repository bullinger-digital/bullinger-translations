    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer and Konrad Zwick thank Bullinger for his letter [not received], from which his zeal and love for Konstanz and the community of Christ in general are clearly evident. May God bless their joint efforts and use them for the salvation of the city. Bullinger should pray for Blarer and Zwick so that they do not undertake anything unchristian and that Konstanz remains steadfast. Much of what Blarer sees and hears makes his hair stand on end. However, there are also signs that the troubled situation could improve.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer cannot write much, as he wants to greet his relative [Peter Scher the Elder of Schwarzenburg] returning from Ulm. What he learns from him, he will communicate [with letter no. 2812].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] If Christoph Froschauer does not dare to print Bullinger's "[Brevis] institutio," then a printer in Augsburg or Basel will certainly be happy to do so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The "[Eidgenössische] Chronik" [by Johannes Stumpf], crafted with the greatest care, is eagerly awaited.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Zwick and Blarer's sick brother [Thomas], who has not shown himself for several days, send their regards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Those who have seen Emperor Charles V assure that he is healthy and lively. What Bullinger writes about [the handover of Montbéliard by] Duke Christoph [of Württemberg] to King Francis I is regarded as the beginning of a new tragedy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bullinger will certainly report immediately on the arrival of the French envoy [Guillaume Du Plessis, sieur de Lyancourt] in the Confederation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger should take care of the old, dejected Hans Schöner and enlighten him about his Augsburgers. Schöner requested this in his last letter, but Blarer does not get around to it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings and blessings. The people of Zurich should pray fervently for the people of Konstanz.</p>

      <p>Greetings. My cousin and I received your letters, full of your zeal and love towards us, with the utmost gratitude. From them, as often before, we clearly understand how much our public affairs and the common cause of Christ are dear to your heart. We greatly hope that the most gracious Father in heaven will mercifully assist us in our utterly ruined affairs and will happily use your efforts as His chosen instrument for our and our republic's certain salvation. Oh my brother, come on, do it! Intercede with Christ for us with fervent prayers, so that we do not undertake anything unworthy of Christians, but remain beautifully and perpetually steadfast in this city of Konstanz. Certainly, seeing and hearing many things, I shudder all over! Meanwhile, however, my spirit rises to some hope, believing that we will someday see a better state of our affairs. May the Lord increase it in me and in many other holy members of Christ with His spirit and preserve it until His day.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I cannot add much to this, as my dearest relative, returning from Ulm, must be greeted by me; whatever I learn from him, I will diligently write to you afterwards.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>If your Froschauer is not able to print your "Institution," I do not doubt that there is someone in Augsburg or Basel who can and will be most willing to do so.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>We eagerly await the "Chronicle," which you write about, crafted with great diligence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>My brother, due to his weaker health, has not appeared for several days. However, he sends you many greetings in the Lord, along with my excellent cousin Zwick.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Those who have seen Emperor Charles V affirm that he is in good health and lively. What you write about Duke Christoph and the Frenchman, everyone considers to be the beginning of a new tragedy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I do not doubt that you will inform us as soon as possible about the magnificent French delegation to you, when it arrives.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I commend to you the afflicted and truly pitiable old man Schöner, and I earnestly and repeatedly ask you to explain to him something about his Augsburgers. He requested this from me in his last letter, but I can do nothing at all.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>May your household be well, and may the Lord kindly bless it. May all friends and brothers, your ministers in the Lord, be well. We here desire to be most accurately and always commended to the common Savior Christ by the prayers of all of you. February 12th.</p>
