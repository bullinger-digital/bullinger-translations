      <p>In the year 1550, on the 5th of April, from Frankfurt am Main.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most esteemed Mr. Bullinger. I do not know where Florian has gone. Mr. Johannes a Lasco is staying in Bremen and has not yet been to Poland, as a citizen of Bremen known to me has reported; if you wish to write to him, I will take care of it diligently. It is true that Florian bought books from me, which he left in Antwerp.</p>
      <p>I am not returning the letters; I will keep them; perhaps he will come or eventually indicate where he has gone. I give great thanks for the books sent to me; I will share them with a friend who is sending these to you; I ask that you convey your opinion and mind to him, so that he may finally be freed from doubt. I myself will offer your book to the senior archbishop and my most esteemed brother; both are still in good health. I will also offer your works to Caesar. I am surprised that Mr. Montius has sent nothing to you; I intend to remind him in my letters. They say the dispute between the French and the English has been resolved; nevertheless, the matter of religion proceeds. Caesar is preparing a journey to Germany, well-equipped with military forces. So far, being involved in various matters, I have not been able to send more detailed letters; if someone else comes along, I will write more diligently. Offer all my diligence to Mr. Gesner; I have sent letters to our doctors; I will send a response from Cologne as soon as possible. In the meantime, may you and all yours be well, and use me as your own. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient Johann Birckmann wrote. To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed lord and friend. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
