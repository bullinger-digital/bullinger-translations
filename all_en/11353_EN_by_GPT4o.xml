    <p xml:id="regest1">Has just returned [from Wildbad in the Black Forest] and has read Bullinger's letter [No. 1305]. Since the Strasbourg [mediators] leaned towards the opinion of the pastors, the council bypassed them when issuing [the new university regulations], but Myconius was still able to implement changes before he went to the spa; he does not yet know the latest state of the university reform, but it seems more important to him for the church how one can counter [Karlstadt]. Welcomes the postponement of the Nuremberg religious discussion announced by Emperor [Charles V]. Thanks for [Vadian's "Orthodoxa et erudita... epistola"]. The success of the spa treatment, which Adam [Frey] will report on, will only become apparent in a few months; Myconius praises Frey's piety and recommends him. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I finally read your letters on the day I returned here and wrote this. After the people of Strasbourg seemed to favor us more than the university (although they wanted it to remain intact), all action was taken away from them. The council then decreed and confirmed with a seal what it wanted to be valid. There was something intolerable to me, so I did not stop until I could be content together with the brothers, otherwise I would have left; more on this later, when there is leisure. Soon I left, to be free from such great disturbances, even if only for a while. What they have done in the meantime, I have not yet understood. They are reforming the school, and Mr. Grynaeus is present; something will be done. I have always cared less about the university; that thick-headed Saxon disturbs me greatly as he is a despiser of all good people, not to say worse. How to deal with this, we will consider. The contention is not private, but of the church; however, it is necessary to gradually come to his correction, who does not want to be reproved by anyone for his misdeeds. This is in your ear.</p>
      <p>About the Nuremberg assembly, the emperor wrote to the electors, who were consulted in this matter, that due to his wife's death he can do nothing now, but will act properly in the future when there is an opportunity. The evil is interpreted by the good as hidden; however, it seems to me that the abolition of this assembly is beneficial, so that it can be known why the adversaries cannot even bear a council.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I thank you for the booklet sent; for I can do nothing else. If you knew how much I rejoice over such gifts, I know that you would also rejoice. The Lord will someday reward you for all these benefits.</p>
      <p>I am here quite healthy from the baths. They say that the virtue is not felt immediately, but after a few months; I therefore expect what they will achieve. But our Adam will tell more about them. I ask you, for the Lord's sake, to have that man recommended; having been around him for a long time, I judge him pious and therefore worthy, to whom all good people should be of assistance. He used the bath and other remedies in such a way that he always preferred the will of God. To him who acts from the heart in such grave misery, the Lord seems undoubtedly to be present as a father. Do also be present for him, wherever a just opportunity is given.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours always in the Lord. Greet Pellican and Theodor in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, September 19, 1539. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most pious and learned Antistes of the people of Zurich, his in the Lord.</p>
