      <p>Greetings. For your diligent and faithful writing service, I give you the greatest thanks, my esteemed and dearest Bullinger. I had not yet finished reading the English catechism when a good brother was present, about to set off directly for Augsburg, through whom I thought it should be sent to a particular friend, with whom I also gained not insignificant favor in this regard. Then, when you mentioned the articles, I thought there were some others printed outside of this catechism.</p>
      <p>I received your sermons long ago and I am surprised if I have not already informed you by letter and given thanks, which I would now also do dutifully, if I were not ashamed that after so many and such frequent benefits bestowed upon me, I am always dealing with you in words and with the gratitude of my heart (which I truly testify), meanwhile, I do not seem sufficiently concerned about returning thanks and competing with you in deeds on equal terms. But what, I ask, should I do? I am so entirely indebted to you that I am clearly not capable of repaying the matter, as I owe you almost my very soul. Certainly, I will never cease to implore the Lord, the Father of lights, with indefatigable prayers of the heart, that, since every good gift and every perfect gift is from Him, He may also abundantly supply you from the inexhaustible treasure of His heavenly riches, whatever can rightly be wished for you, both of carnal and especially spiritual goods, and in me too, as it is not now, so it will never be, that I may see an opportunity to gratify you, I will strongly ensure that I free myself from any suspicion of ingratitude, however slight.</p>
      <p>For the shared news, I am grateful, and I would write diligently to you in return if I had received anything from friends beyond what you write, except that the son of the Emperor, unless intercepted by the Genoese forces heading towards Corsica, is not thought to be coming to Germany at this time, and that the imperial diet is believed to be postponed to the Ides of January, which is more desired by the princes than by the Emperor.</p>
      <p>It is also written that John Frederick has settled with Augustus in such a way that he retains the electorate and the domain, which his brother previously occupied, except for some castles and a certain sum of money to be paid to him for an unknown number of years, and that the electorate will return to the eldest son of John Frederick if Augustus dies without offspring. It seemed good to the Lord to keep this prince, His servant, under the yoke of stricter discipline, so that He may make him truly glorious in time.</p>
      <p>You are not unaware that Jacob Sturm, that man of incomparable prudence, the honor and ornament of the Strasbourg republic, has passed away. If he had had as much spirit in the city and at the diets in advancing and defending the cause of Christ as he had counsel and authority, the condition not only of the people of Strasbourg but of all the cities of the Roman Empire would be in a much better place. But God does not grant everything to one person, etc.</p>
      <p>Now my mind shudders at what you write about Servetus. I hoped that all his blasphemous doctrines would be extinguished by fire along with the author; but it has been so from the beginning of the world that nothing ever so absurd, so impious, so alien to all decency and humanity has been handed down by anyone that it has not found admirers and zealous followers. May our Savior and Avenger Jesus Christ exercise His church with these evils in such a way that it suffers no loss to orthodox and apostolic doctrine, but stands eternally unshaken on the solidity of the rock against the gates of hell from the right and the left. Amen.</p>
      <p>This Schwenckfeld has long insinuated himself into the court of the Prince of WÃ¼rttemberg with his marvelous arts and has infected the minds of many nobles with his sweet poison in a pitiable manner. He also has not a few disciples elsewhere in Swabia, whom he has driven mad, and among these are certain women who are stubborn to the point of madness, who are not ashamed to say that they have learned nothing of Christ from us until now and were entirely in darkness until that heavenly light shone upon them from Schwenckfeld's most Christian doctrine, although he teaches or writes nothing good that has not already been most clearly written by our people, and what he spews against us are either affected calumnies or so weak that I greatly wonder they can seem strong to men otherwise not of poor judgment. May Christ the Savior soon suppress this wild vine devastating His vineyard and inflame the minds of all to the pursuit of sincere and simple Christian truth, lest we soon see more than enough curious, superstitious, and even blasphemous people. Farewell, my soul, venerable and dearest brother, with your whole household, whom mine greatly bids to be well in the Lord. May the brothers, your fellow ministers in the work of the Lord, greet you, along with the other most learned professors of your school, Pellican, Theodor, etc. I commend myself to the most holy prayers of all of you. I earnestly beseech and implore you to be present as a certain divine presence to our Johann Ulmius, wherever the matter may require. My Funck respectfully greets you and commends himself to you as much as he can. November 22.</p>
      <p>You receive here a letter from our elder Fuchs, who has married a virgin twenty years old, himself now in his sixty-fifth year, which we should strive to obtain from the Lord with pious prayers that it may be happy and fortunate for him.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable brother and friend.</p>
