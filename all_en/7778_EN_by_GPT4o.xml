      <p>Today, at last, our letters have been delivered to us, reverend men, most honorable lords, and dearest brothers, dated the ninth day of the previous month, full of that charity and humanity with which you have long embraced us without ceasing.</p>
      <p>We had already previously received the fruit of this your charity, which we trust will be such that the Lord, whom we know to be the aim of this your kindness, will abundantly repay you on that supreme day, when he will wipe away the tears of his own. As for us, what alone is possible for us, we have gratitude, which we can in no way repay, and to your most ample and truly Christian senate for such great benefits, which we know and acknowledge to be not insignificant, as we are not at all unaware of your domestic burdens, and to you also, honorable brothers, who have been the instruments of the Lord and our most merciful father in this matter, in reminding the minds of the pious senators, nor shall we, with God's favor, be lacking in our duty in turn, in whatever matter it may seem fit for you to experience our effort. Blessed be the Lord, who, as our piety knows, has united us in the communion of religion in all things and in all ways, and also those through whom your church was first, and then also this ours, however it may be, was born in the Lord, so that we may altogether wish, hope, and even predict that this union of ours and of those who will succeed in our labors will be perpetual in the same Lord. However, concerning the affairs of France, we hear nothing yet but joyful news, so great is the kindness of our God, and certainly the cruelty and indeed the impiety of our enemies is such that they are execrable even to the true papists, and it is to be hoped that their judgment is not far off. Yet because our victory is placed under the cross and we greatly fear that ours too may not entirely conduct this war of the Lord as befits the saints, but many also, as happened in both previous wars of the Lord, provoke the wrath of God (so difficult is it to handle swords with uninjured hands), because finally, wherever the matter turns, the kingdom is pressed and will be pressed by such a horrendous calamity, and would that it may not be utterly crushed, we do not cease to be concerned about this matter, nor do we doubt that the same happens to you.</p>
      <p>May the Lord our God therefore hear our common groans, most honorable lords and dearest brothers, and soon grant us to sing the triumphal hymn of his clemency, if it can be done without bloodshed; if not, may he make it so that we nonetheless celebrate his glorious strength and immense power both with our mouths and hearts. Meanwhile, may the Lord heap his blessings upon you more and more, as we hope he will do.</p>
      <p>Geneva, February 11, 1569.</p>
      <p>Theodor Beza, most devoted to your piety, in his own name and in the name of his fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, and to the other ministers of the same church, our most honorable lords and dearest brothers.</p>
