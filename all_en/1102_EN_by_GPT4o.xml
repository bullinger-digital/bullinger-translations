      <p>Greetings. After Blattner finally passed away, having been bedridden for 14 days, I and all my family are now in good health. Hester, the daughter of our Musculus, has also recovered, as you will undoubtedly learn from her own letters. Salomon Siberus has been elected to Blatner's position, who is there with you at the house of the provost; I am recalling him through this public courier by the authority of the senate and at the same time, I am expressing my gratitude to the lord provost for his kindness towards us with the same authority. For the senate itself had written to him not long ago, and now did not want to write again, but instructed me to do so. Another will soon be sent in his place.</p>
      <p>The plague is now somewhat less severe. Only 17 from the number of students have died; from this, you can estimate the rest. Otherwise, I cannot write anything new; for apart from what I have from Mr. Musculus, I have nothing new. He himself writes to you, from which I believe he conceals nothing of all he has. Recently, he sent news from Hungary; meanwhile, Schertlius wrote to him about how the people of Basel ordered him to leave. He also sent some points of reconciliation that the Emperor prescribes to the people of Magdeburg and Bremen, which he, however, sent back there before I could know them; otherwise, I would have sent a copy to you; they are very harsh, as can easily be guessed, and once accepted, there is no hope of salvation for them thereafter.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I think you have more than this, which I also ask you to share with us through this messenger. They say the council will be continued around the next Lent.</p>
      <p>Although they may try to continue it, the Lord will scatter it. Our ecclesiastical and scholastic affairs are quite well.</p>
      <p>The magistrate has renewed most of the old mandates and prescribes that they be read publicly once a year in each parish. Certainly a pious work, provided that a just execution follows.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing now, unless you want to hear about a horrendous and almost unheard-of crime. In FÃ¼ssigny, in the part of Savoy that the king has, some scoundrels came at night to a castle, knowing that the nobleman had cash in the castle, and knocked.</p>
      <p>The gatekeeper opened for them. They asked for the lord; it was around or after supper time. When they entered, they stabbed the gatekeeper at the gate, went up into the kitchen. There were 6 people by a fireplace, men and women, whom they all strangled. The lady was in childbed in a separate room, with her maidservant with her. They heard some commotion; the maidservant ran with the child she was carrying on her arm, wanting to see what it was, and they caught her on the stairs and also stabbed her; however, nothing happened to the child. The lady heard the maidservant scream, also ran out, and came straight into their hands, who also cut her down. Meanwhile, the lord, who was in a separate place, noticed what was happening, locked himself in a stronghold in the castle, as noblemen commonly do. Since they could not get to him, they found about 4000 crowns, which they carried away with them. And now one of those scoundrels is captured in Morges by my lords, and one is also caught in Geneva, who came there under the guise of the gospel, having been there for a good time, heard all the preaching and teaching, but was a great thief, having stolen much in France.</p>
      <p>After I wrote this, behold, Musculus, remembering the points prescribed by the Emperor to the people of Magdeburg (for he had sent back the copy sent to him by Schertlius, and I had asked him to send it to you), noted these things, which I send here. You have their summary, you see what the eagle seeks, how it leaves nothing of the prey.</p>
      <p>May the Lord destroy him badly, as he deserves. This is what I had at present. Consider everything favorably and greet your wife and children in my name, to whom my wife also sends many greetings. May the brothers, Gwalther and the others, also be well. Bern, December 6, 1550. The treasurer and Hagius especially greet you.</p>
      <p>Your [servant] in the Lord, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful antistes of the church of Zurich, his lord and venerable compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
