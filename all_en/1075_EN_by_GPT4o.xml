      <p>I received your letter on the 5th of October and delivered it to the prince on the 6th of November; indeed, it was most pleasing to him (to put it in one word). For it was written by you prudently and very honorably; and in such a way that I do not know whether anything could have been written more prudently or acted more honorably by you: for I myself read it to the prince, and I have long since easily noticed what great and illustrious men think of you: therefore, I know for certain that it was done rightly by you. The reason I kept the letter with me for so long is this: I wanted to translate the book on the most holy Christian marriage, which you once wrote in German, into Latin for the sake of practicing style during the past summer, and to give it, newly copied, to the prince's daughter, who is very well instructed in both Latin and Greek letters: this very plan of mine was strongly approved by Schinner and Wullock. Therefore, as soon as I came to London, I offered the letter with the book to the prince (for the daughter was then absent), and I understand that the matter is well received. The prince will write to you within a few days; he wants the letter to be sent there along with mine.</p>
      <p>I will take care that you do not doubt that they are delivered correctly and diligently; only you must bring the promised solution to completion shortly. But I do not doubt that you are now wholly engaged in this; therefore, there is no need for me to urge you further. I hope your plan regarding Warwick remains valid and firm: for it is greatly approved by our prince; and since they are most closely connected by familiarity and use, they will be even more firmly united by zeal for religion in this way. I do not yet have the full and perfect title of earl; but when Schinner sends letters to me along with his, it will be taken care of to be delivered to you immediately. There are quite significant and illustrious monuments of Warwick's goodwill and willingness towards you. First, he took care to have your books translated into English at his own expense, and many of them. Then he received Huber in good faith, my (or rather your) Alexander, to be and to be most recommended to him for your sake: although nothing has yet been done because of the very serious matters that have long existed between Ullum and Huber. But the matter will be carried out at last; and indeed, as I hope, very rightly and very shortly. For Huber's controversy with the bishops about divorces seems to have a good and happy end, nor can the bishops further bark at that excellent man in this matter. However, Huber feels nothing other than what you all have approved with pen and words. Therefore, the rumor spread about him is false, that he thinks a marriage once adulterated cannot be restored or renewed either by the intervention of the magistrate or by the will of the spouses.</p>
      <p>So much for this. There is nothing new now that I can write to you. For everything here is safe and tranquil, except that some movements about the French in Calais are heard here.</p>
      <p>It is certain to us that they attempted to build a rampart on the borders of the English, but were most bravely repulsed and prevented by the same.</p>
      <p>The French sent an ambassador here to excuse themselves the day before I came to London. He was indeed heard and treated (as I hear) kindly, but secretly not judged sincere and just by them.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the English know well enough, or rather very well, what to believe about our Frenchman.</p>
      <p>It remains for you to be well, most excellent and learned man. The Earl of Ireland, a contemporary of the king, a young man very devoted to you, greets you; likewise Schinner and Wullock, men excelling in much learning and piety. You will have done very rightly in my judgment if you send a copy of the future decade to the prince's daughter; among other things, you will elicit letters from her, and those most learned. Let the form of the inscription be this: To Lady Jane Grey, daughter of the Prince of Dorset, etc. But you, with your great prudence, will easily consider what is expedient for you to do. I would like you to hand over this example of the disputations to Mr. Otto Werdmüller: he is indeed of that kind of man to whom I wish to show myself dear and mindful. If you wish to know anything about the order of our studies and readings, you will learn each detail more subtly from Gwalther's letters.</p>
      <p>Oxford, hastening on St. Martin's Day, 1550. Johannes von Ulm, truly your son and disciple in Christ.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the Church of Zürich, his lord and most revered patron.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
