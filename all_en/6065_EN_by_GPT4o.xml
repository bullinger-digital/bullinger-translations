      <p>Highly learned, dear Mr. Bullinger, now someone comes to me and tells me that someone... said at your table that the little book I sent you is Schwenckfeldian.</p>
      <p>But believe me, the one who let the little book go out does not know how to speak of Mr. Schwenckfeld. It is another man and he is a Netherlander far away from Cologne.</p>
      <p>I believe, when you have read it, you will find it differently, and I ask you to read it, the first and this one, and to reveal to me your findings at a convenient time; for certainly it did not originate from Mr. Caspar Schwenckfeld nor was it derived from his teachings. With this, may God protect you.</p>
