      <p>Greetings. Recently, most excellent man, I received that work of yours, truly divine and very necessary, especially for our age, and I immediately gave thanks for it, promising your kindness the greatest thanks, if only I could do anything, whatever it may be, to your favor, I would always do it most willingly. But I hear that my letters have not been delivered to you; therefore, in return, I have and always will have the greatest thanks for that book and will pray to the Lord that he may continually grant you the strength of his spirit (as he has kindly done so far) and keep you safe, so that you may proclaim his name and glory more widely with your mouth and pen and prove yourself a faithful minister and steward of his mysteries (as you have done so far) and that the good Lord may always be present with all your wishes. Amen. Furthermore, I have returned the writings of Servetus and wish to have those which Mr. Musculus composed on this matter, as well as the responses of the Bernese and Baselers regarding the case of the Geneva consistory or excommunication. From Mr. Vergerius's writings, I understood that he received your books. What I wrote about the corruption of gifts is as follows: our most honorable magistrate decreed in these days with a very serious decree that in the future no citizen should accept any gifts, presents, etc., from kings, emperors, princes, etc., which is confirmed by an oath. Indeed, this law existed once before, but it was forgotten; now it has been restored. More people protested than I ever would have thought; all were summoned, among them Mr. Peyer; but he denied receiving any gifts or pensions; if any are given, they are given for his ability, and our magistrate allowed this, but nothing beyond that. Thus, many are pained by the decree now reinstated, that one should not give or take more than 5 from 100 guilders.</p>
      <p>I have no new matters to write about. Our bloodthirsty countrymen are preparing for the most unfortunate military service to be hired by the French. Some things are reported among us about the English, namely that they have gained victory against the queen, many Spaniards have fallen, they are in agreement among themselves; that they do not want any king other than an Englishman, etc. You, if anything of this sort has happened, undoubtedly know, and I wish your kindness had enough leisure that I could be informed about these matters. Farewell with all pious and learned men, always keep me recommended to you. The one who offers you this letter returns to me. Schaffhausen, March 14, 1554.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Jakob Rüeger. To the most learned and virtuous Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed brother and lord.</p>
