      <p>Greetings. I am brief so as not to double your trouble, dear brother.</p>
      <p>For I know that Mr. Trechsel writes extensively on this matter, which I commend to you in every way.</p>
      <p>I hear that Poland is ablaze with dissensions and abominable questions about the Trinity.</p>
      <p>I see that Satan aims solely to make the preaching of the gospel infamous with blasphemous doctrines and to scatter the church with dissensions.</p>
      <p>You are more experienced in this matter than others.</p>
      <p>Therefore, help the brothers who are asking for your assistance.</p>
      <p>I have enclosed the letters they sent to me with this.</p>
      <p>I am entirely averse to these blasphemies and the disputes of these men.</p>
      <p>There is much talk here about the peace made in France. I am indeed waiting for your letters or those of our friend Jonvill, from which I hope to learn the most certain and, hopefully, happy news.</p>
      <p>The Muscovite, having entered Lithuania with a large army, has taken Płock by force and struck terror into the Poles, who are now said to be all in arms.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for us for a long time! May Mr. Jonvill be safe with Budé and the other brothers.</p>
      <p>All the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 12, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
