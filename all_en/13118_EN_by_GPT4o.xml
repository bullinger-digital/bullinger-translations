    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] A distinguished Swiss confederate and supporter of the Pope [...] reported in Konstanz that the Augsburg city clerk Georg Frölich (who is still staying in Konstanz) had written to a Zürcher (Johannes Haller or another) that none of the promises made to the people of Augsburg [during their reconciliation with Emperor Charles V] are being kept. However, in such transmissions of news, the name Frölich should not be mentioned to avoid putting him in danger!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] From Augsburg, the arrival of Duke Wilhelm V of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, Duke Heinrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg, and Queen Maria of Hungary is reported. Soon, so many foreigners will be staying there that, due to lack of space, citizens will have to be expelled from the city! Landgrave Philip of Hesse is to be released from captivity shortly. The Emperor is also taxing princes who are not evangelical. Thus, he demanded 50,000 guilders immediately and in cash from Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria. During the handover of money, the [Salzburg] ducats handed over were not exchanged at a favorable rate, and the Bavarian councilors were scolded. Much is being written about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The [princes] have agreed to the continuation of the Council of Trent. The imperial cities, however, have submitted opinions on this matter, to which they have not yet received a response. They have neither voting nor seating rights in the Imperial Council and are merely informed about the decisions of the other estates. This suits them well in this matter, as they did not have to consent to it! But God will prevent the implementation [of these decisions].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer wrote this after his letter enclosed here [No. 3067]. Bullinger should pray earnestly, for the devil gives no rest. If God does not intervene, there will be a rift between the Swiss confederates and the other [Germans] on the council issue. Truly, a very dangerous situation! But nothing worse can happen than losing one's earthly life!</p>

      <p>A distinguished Swiss confederate, who is a supporter of the Pope, said here among other things that the city clerk of Augsburg, who is currently here, wrote to a Zürcher that nothing is being kept of what was promised to the people of Augsburg. It would be good if what the good man writes to Mr. Hans Haller or someone else is not spread further; it might very soon lead to great disadvantage for him.</p>

      <p>It is also written from Augsburg that the Duke of Cleves, the Duke of Brunswick, the Elector of Brandenburg, and Queen Maria have arrived there. And such a crowd will be there that the citizens will be driven out of the city because there is no space. Also, it is expected that the Landgrave will soon be released. Furthermore, the Emperor taxes other non-evangelical princes just as well. He has taxed the Duke of Bavaria 50,000 guilders. They had to pay immediately in cash, and the ducats were not accepted at a favorable rate, and his councilors were scolded for it. Much is being written about this.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the continuation of the Council of Trent has been approved, except that the cities have submitted some writings to the Emperor about it, but have not received any further decision, as they have no vote or session in the Imperial Council, but are only informed of what the other estates have decided. This suits them well in this matter, as they have not consented to it. Until it comes to execution, God will intervene in some other way. They are instructed. On the 5th day of November 1547, in haste.</p>

      <p>I have written this according to the enclosed letter. Praying and pleading earnestly, for the devil is very restless. The council will awaken all discord and division among you confederates and others, if God does not prevent it. It is truly a subtle (treacherous) poison. May God preserve us in eternal life! It cannot go worse here than that we lose the wicked hat, etc.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
