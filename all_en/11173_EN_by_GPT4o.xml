    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes only now, as their matter remained in suspense for a long time; after fifteen days of waiting, it became apparent that [Peter] Kunz did not want to acknowledge what had been decided in Zurich, and the council also paid little attention to it. Nevertheless, they want to leave no stone unturned and are now on their way [to Geneva].</p>

      <p>Greetings. The reason we have refrained from writing until now is that everything was so uncertain for us that we could not report anything definite. Even now, since the matter cannot be recounted without complaints, I would prefer you to know this one thing from me: what we have experienced did not flow from our wishes, but it did not poorly meet our expectations.</p>
      <p>Besides the fifteen days of delay, which were not without great tedium, there was also much annoyance because none of the matters that were completely settled and concluded in Zurich were acknowledged by Kunz. And yet, to seem as if he had a good cause, he thundered against us with much force, as if it were already established that we wanted to backtrack and deceive the brothers. Therefore, it remained for the council itself to be the authority in all matters: in making decisions, they did not take much account of what had been granted to us in Zurich with the great consensus of all. Nevertheless, we decided to accept any conditions rather than not try all ways to satisfy the church. Now, therefore, we are setting out on our journey, which may Christ prosper. For as we look to Him in our actions, so we commit the outcome to His providence. But my companions are in a hurry.</p>
      <p>I am now forced to interrupt the letter, barely begun. Farewell, sweetest brother, and most esteemed by me. Greet your colleagues most lovingly for me.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 20, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my dearest brother, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
