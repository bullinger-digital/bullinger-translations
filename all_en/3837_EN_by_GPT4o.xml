      <p>Greetings. After receiving the bundle of letters, I received yours written on the 8th of this month, along with a letter from the legate of the Rhaetians, in which he indicates that our Fabricius, whom I would not have expected, ranted much in a sermon against the King of France and the alliance. And since I do not doubt that he has explained the reasons and the whole matter, I will add nothing else except to ask you to kindly advise him on how to deal with that many-headed beast and the minds of those who are quite ready for sedition and disturbances, so there is no need for anyone to pour cold water on it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, all the ancients abhorred speed in punishing crimes and interposed delay. Of those because of whom the conversation arose, there is one who, if his name does not lie, had a noble father who was one of my closest friends and a man of great integrity and reputation, whose family would be permanently marked if he were someone else, and this matter cannot serve as an example, since the murder was committed in Italy and by strangers, whom the king would undoubtedly not want to support. Whatever the case, the magistrate should have been advised privately, not the people publicly, where matters of safety and those pertaining to the correction of morals are concerned, and there is great hope for the gospel throughout France, and not everything should be demanded with utmost severity. These things for the better according to your prudence.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, January 12.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
