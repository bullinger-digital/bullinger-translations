    <p xml:id="regest1">Frey thanks for the sending of the writing [„Antiquissima fides“ or „Der alt gloub“]. Frey has passed the writing on to [Peter] Fuchs, as [Diethelm] Keller had already sent him a copy dedicated to him. - Regarding the [Protestant] cause, Frey laments the madness of the once so valiant fighter for the Gospel [Luther]. The [Catholic] opponents are confident in their cause, especially as they perceive a reversal among the [Protestants]. Bullinger's compatriot [Johannes] Aal [in Solothurn] often emphasizes from the pulpit that the [Protestants], who already banish each other as heretics, will destroy themselves with their own weapons. Frey has books by [Aal] at home; in them, Aal is entirely recognizable. However, Frey believes that those who take offense at the [disputes among the Protestants] are "children of perdition." The only thing that matters is not to cause offense oneself. He admires the moderation demonstrated by Bullinger in his writings [in this context]. - Gwalther also writes excellently. His [„Apologia“] is admired in Biel. - The day before, Frey's wife [...] gave birth to a son, who was baptized today at the request of the mother-in-law [...] with the [first] name of the father-in-law [Leonhard...]. Frey is doing well, even though his relatives [...] remain upset [because of his Protestant views]. Bullinger should pray that he becomes a faithful and steadfast servant of God. The indecisive, neighboring [Bernese?] hate [the people of Biel] because they stand by the truth. However, Frey was able to successfully assert himself against one or the other. - The reason Frey writes so rarely is due to the lack of reliable messengers. - Greetings, also from [Valerius Göuffi], Michael [Schlatter], and [Jakob] Würben.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I have received, dearest father, the booklet you sent me, for which I have nothing to give in return. You continue to overwhelm me with benefits, and I am obliged to you.</p>
      <p>May the Lord, for whom we live, himself repay you. However, I have given this booklet (since Mr. Diethelm Keller had sent a similar one signed with his own handwriting) to my friend Peter Fuchs, whom you instructed to read it, in your name, and I have also shown him your writings.</p>
      <p>As for the cause itself, I lament the notable madness of that once valiant soldier of the Lord in the Gospel, who now demolishes with such great impotence of mind what he had scarcely built. Paul is read to have restored with all his might what he had destroyed. This one tends in the opposite direction. What now of our adversaries? They think their cause is the best when they see us gradually returning. Certainly, I hear your compatriot Johannes Aal frequently emphasize such words from the pulpit: "Did I not always forewarn that these little men would eventually destroy themselves with the same weapons with which they now rage against us?</p>
      <p>They now proscribe each other and testify by mutual accusations that they are heretics, and they do not know where to turn." I have books at home. You recognize Johannes Aal in full. However, I judge thus: Let the children of perdition be offended and perish, as long as there is no stumbling block from us! There is indeed the utmost modesty in your writings, which delights me greatly. You do not know what that modesty accomplishes among our people. Therefore, I beseech you, let no harsher writings come from our people with your knowledge. For what if we rage with the insane ourselves?</p>
      <p>Our Gwalther has also written most elegantly and piously, so much so that those among us who have read it are very amazed and highly praise God. May the Lord strengthen him and increase his most abundant gifts. Amen.</p>
      <p>But how long will I keep silent to you about what the Lord has done for me? The day before I wrote this, I received a most beautiful little son from my wife, who today (at the wish of my mother-in-law) received the name of Leonhard, my father-in-law, at the sacred font. Furthermore, the Lord has granted me an abundance of all things with which I can support my family; for which I see what I owe, but you, pray for me that I may become a faithful and constant servant of my Lord. Let my relatives rage. They will never prohibit me from the sun or the mercy of God. Our neighbors also continue to pursue us with hatred because of our constant confession of the truth; but like waves and quicksilver (Quecksilber), they now roll up, now down. They change into all forms. Yet I, trusting in God and the holy truth (I glory in the Lord), having met with one or two of my equals, was easily superior. Praise be to the Lord God.</p>
      <p>Come, sweetest father! You say I write rarely; therefore, at length! Certainly, a reliable messenger is rarely given to us, and I have often found that neither your letters nor ours are cared for. These are the things that seemed fitting to respond to your letters, sweetest father.</p>
      <p>Those whom you greeted through me also greet you, as well as our senior, and my dearest co-father Michael and Mr. Würben. You will greet your wife, children, and your whole family in my name. Farewell, and love me as usual.</p>
      <p>Biel/Bienne, 6th day before the Ides of April 1545. Yours sincerely, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, his father, always to be highly respected.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
