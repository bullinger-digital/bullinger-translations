    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has received Blarer's letter from October 27 [No. 2645] and completely agrees with him. God have mercy on us!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] On October 30, the Zurich council gathered the councils and citizens and informed them about the meeting [of the Four Protestant Cantons] in Zurich. It was decided to inform all the communities of the city and the region of Zurich about the dangerous situation and to communicate what the Zurich council has negotiated so far with the Confederates and others, and what the Pope [Paul III], Emperor [Charles V], and [the Schmalkaldic League] are seeking to achieve. It should be made clear that this war is about the faith and the freedom of Germany; that the Zurich council wants to adhere to the word of God and the [evangelical] faith and will assist the [Protestant] city cantons and their neighbors with help and troops as needed; but that it also wants to maintain the alliances and peace with the Nine Cantons; and, since the matter concerns everyone, rich and poor, that it has ordered assemblies throughout the Zurich area to find out whether it can count on the communities or not. For this purpose, a written "presentation" was prepared for reading.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On October 31, the guilds were gathered, who unanimously encouraged the council to continue acting so bravely and piously and to assist the [Protestant] Confederates and neighbors if they were attacked by the Emperor, Pope, and other enemies of the truth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] From [November 7], the regional assemblies will be held in the counties, lordships, and localities of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In the meantime, preparations are being made, and troops will likely be raised within 14 days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Blarer should ask Konrad Zwick to write to the [Schmalkaldic] war council in Ulm regarding a soldier in Captain Heinrich Richmut's troop. It concerns Wolfgang, the son of Mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater. The latter is an honest man and very well-disposed towards the Schmalkaldic League, as Blarer knows. Bullinger fears that the top commanders will pay Wolfgang poorly and not consider his background, while they grant honorary pay to others (to whom he is equal). However, this is only a suspicion. The captain [Richmut], his lieutenant [...], and his standard-bearer [...] are otherwise good people. This request should not be to their detriment. The war council [in Ulm] should look into this matter and grant Wolfgang the honor he deserves. It is not about the money, as Wolfgang is wealthy. He did not become a soldier for the money, but out of zeal for the cause. His father (without whose knowledge he went to war) knows nothing of this letter. Bullinger writes on his own initiative, as he is convinced that proper treatment of the children of such honorable people brings good. Wolfgang is Captain Richmut's bodyguard.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings to Mayor [Sebastian Gaisberg], [Thomas] Blarer, and Konrad Zwick.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I have received your letter, sent on October 27. I am always of the same opinion as you. May God have mercy on us.</p>

      <p>And since there is nothing else in your letter that requires a response, I inform you that on September 30, the council and citizens were gathered. Everything that was discussed on that day here has been reviewed. The council and citizens have decided to inform all the communities in the city and the region about the dangerous situation; what the council has negotiated so far with the Confederates and others; what the Pope, the Emperor, and the Empire desire; so that it is understood that it concerns the German nation regarding faith and freedom; that the council recognizes and unites to adhere to the divine word and true religion, to faithfully support their Confederate cities and neighbors with assistance and military aid as necessity demands; that they also want to maintain alliances and peace with the Nine Cantons, etc.; and, since the matter concerns everyone, rich and poor, to hold assemblies in the city and region to understand what can be expected from them. A written presentation has been prepared to be read to the communities.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Yesterday, all the guilds in the city were gathered, etc. It is remarkable how bravely and unanimously all the people have pledged that the council should continue bravely, not deviating from the word of God, and to assist the pious Confederates and neighbors against the Emperor and Pope and whoever wants to oppress the truth; for this, they are willing to risk their lives and possessions and to show themselves as pious, obedient subjects by offering everything they can.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>On the coming Sunday and following days, assemblies will be held in the counties, lordships, cities, and regions.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In the meantime, preparations are being made vigorously, as it is expected that troops will be raised within 14 days, etc.</p>

      <p>My very friendly request to you is that you speak with your cousin, my dear lord Junker Konrad Zwick, to write to your war council in Ulm about a young man in Captain Heinrich Richmut's troop. His name is Wolfgang Lavater. He is the son of my lord Mayor Lavater. You know well that his lord and father is a very honorable man and well-disposed towards the Empire. However, I fear that the commanders in charge of the regiment might treat the good, honorable young man poorly with the pay, not considering to whom he belongs or who he is. They might give honorary pay to others, which he would also deserve and not remain undeserved. I suspect. I pronounce nothing certain. Otherwise, the captain, lieutenant, and standard-bearer are good men. But perhaps they do not consider this. I do not want this to be a disadvantage to them. Therefore, my request is that the war council inquire and ensure that he is considered with honor. It is about honor, not wealth, as he is otherwise well-off. He went out of zeal, not for money. Now, his lord and father know nothing of what I write here, as the young man also went away without his father's knowledge. I write this solely out of my own initiative and for the good of the matter, as I believe that treating the children of such honorable people well can bring good. The mentioned Wolfgang Lavater is Captain Richmut's bodyguard.</p>
