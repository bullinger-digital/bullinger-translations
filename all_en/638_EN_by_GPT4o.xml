      <p> S. The copies of our Epitome along with your letters, most learned Bullinger, have been delivered to me, for which I am grateful to you. I am here among wolves and scorpions; they want to have sound doctrine and the gospel of Christ, but in such a way that you do not touch or criticize the abuses and superstitions, which the [Greek] Interim has confirmed for us again. No one is unaware of whether this can be done. I have already been reprimanded several times by the magistrate for having touched on certain sacred matters of the papists, about which, however, no mention is made in the Interim, such as indulgences and pilgrimages and the like. Thus, I satisfy neither them nor myself, as it is decreed for me not to deviate even a hair's breadth (as they say) from apostolic and Christian doctrine. May the Lord be with me and strengthen my resolve. I had also decided to abstain from marriage after my wife's death; but behold, while I employ maidservants for domestic services, I am accused everywhere of fornication, which I feared would happen, even if it is most falsely done. You know how this affects doctrine. Therefore, I see that I must take another course of action and give no opportunity to the slanderer, which I understand even St. Paul wanted. Furthermore, upon remarrying, the papists threaten me with the removal of my office, which, however, will not be in their power. If it does happen, where should I go, what business should I conduct?</p>
      <p> My hope is in God, who will stir you and those like you both to give advice and to provide assistance. Indeed, I would be inclined to devote myself to civil law or trade; but there are many things that hold me back, especially since I would like to continue teaching the doctrine of Christ (as I have done so far), as far as it is allowed; for this reason, I will not turn elsewhere unless all options have been tried, and if it pleases the Lord to use my work, He will place something of this kind in my hand. Thus my affairs stand; I am tossed about and endangered for the sake of doctrine and marriage. However, I will not move from here unless driven away, so that I may not seem to have deserted the church rashly. The people listen to me gladly, and the sermons are very well attended. The magistrate is indecisive and strives to please men. You, my best friend, remember me and write back. There is nothing new with us. We hope that neither your regions nor ours will have war this year.</p>
      <p> Farewell and convey my greetings to all those there who wish me well.</p>
      <p> Given at Kempten on August 18, 1549.</p>
      <p> Your Thomas Naogeorgus.</p>
      <p> To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, doctor of the church in Zürich, his intimate friend. Go to Zürich, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
