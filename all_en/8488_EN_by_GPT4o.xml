      <p> Greetings. I would write more frequently; but I have nothing worthy of you; besides, the matters of lesser importance I write to my brother, so that he may communicate to you those that seem relevant. All is silent in deep silence. Even the people of Geneva write nothing. Everyone is now occupied with that charity and the unusual scarcity of resources, although, if we compare our situation with others, we see that we are blessed above the rest. The merchants from Augsburg, who pass through here, tell us astonishing things about the calamity of those places. Yet these are deserved by our sins; may the Lord have mercy on His poor! Meanwhile, there are various rumors about the conscription of soldiers, which is happening everywhere in Germany, though no one yet knows for what purpose or for whose use these are intended. In neighboring Burgundy, we fear some evil; for the governor of that province has been removed from office, and the Spanish reinforcements are increasing. Alba soothes the neighbors with good words, so that they suspect no evil. But these seem to be the most certain beginnings of disturbances. The Byzantines, who have so far still enjoyed the freedom of the empire, greatly fear that they may be deprived of their accustomed freedom and that the greatest evil of the inquisition may be imposed upon them. Our Gerard von Wattenwyl already regrets that, having despised his homeland, house, religion, and the distinguished dominion he had in the county of Neuchâtel, he preferred to transfer his affairs to Burgundy. But this is the just judgment of God; He is accustomed to punish us through those very ones for whose sake we depart from good and truth and whose friendship and affection we prefer to the love of God. Private matters are moderately well. I saw the instructions given to your envoys sent to Basel, in which I wrote to my brother what I wish to be corrected, if the occasion arises. </p>
      <p> Meanwhile, I eagerly await what has been done; I have indeed heard how the envoys were dismissed, but what happened afterward, this I still do not know. If only there were someone like Nägelin there, who would not only soothe this sore but completely eradicate it! It pains me to hear that you are continually troubled by the pains of kidney stones; for I have also often experienced how sharp they are, although now for two years I have been much better in this regard than before. Thus the Lord wishes to stone us with those little stones; for what does it matter by what we are finally killed, as long as it happens in the Lord. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Both consuls and treasurers, Hagenbuch and my father-in-law, as well as Josua Wyttenbach and the physician Schöpfius, send their greetings to you. I pray for the health of your family and all the brothers there. </p>
      <p> Bern, February 12, 1571. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. </p>
