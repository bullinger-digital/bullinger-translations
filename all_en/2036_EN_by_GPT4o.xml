      <p>Greetings and Best Wishes. Although nothing comes to mind at the moment, most distinguished Bullinger, that I think should be added to the letter of our Sulzer (who will recount how the affair of Servetus was handled among us), nevertheless, since you are eager to know what books have been printed by the Basel printers for the past Frankfurt market: the Oporinus press has given us the book of Ioannis Dugonis Philoini Tilianus or on the science of dying well, Musculus's explanation of the Decalogue of God's commandments, the book of Engelbert, Abbot of Admont (who lived under Rudolf of Habsburg) on the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, the oration of Cydonius on despising death and the mockery of the pagan philosophers by Hermias the philosopher with the translation of Raphael Seyler, Postel's book on origins, Brusch's history of ancient Laureacum, which Wolfgang Lazius, the royal historian and physician, writes was stolen from him, the New Testament translated by Castalio, Ptolemy's book on astronomical predictions interpreted by Philipp Melanchthon, the canons of all councils collected by Ioannes Sagittarius of Bordeaux, your Theodore's prophecy of the Roman monarchy and the oration on restoring peace in the German kingdom, Cuspinian's consuls and some other previously printed works. The Froben press, however, occupied with reprinting the Church Fathers, has only given the complete works of Angelo Poliziano and the Psalter of Campensis, and is now occupied with the works of Philo Judaeus translated into Latin by Sigismund Gelenius, for which I am now preparing an index. Functius's Chronicle will not be completed before the next fair. Therefore, if anything from the enumerated list pleases you, let me know in your next letter, and I will send it as soon as the opportunity arises. Farewell. Basel, October 15, 1553.</p>
      <p>Greet on my behalf Mr. Pellican, my uncle, to whom I do not have time to write now, Bibliander, Gwalther, and the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Yours, Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, dear friend and brother.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
