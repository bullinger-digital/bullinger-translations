      <p>Greetings. I received the letter you wrote on April 18, esteemed sir, whom I honor in many ways.</p>
      <p>Today I also received a letter from Wolfgang Haller in Amberg, in which he, among other things, requests that I inform you that he has not received any letters from your side within the span of a year. Therefore, on his behalf, I ask you to satisfy him in this matter and respond to his letters. If your Haller thinks it appropriate to send letters to him, and if it cannot be done more conveniently, he should send them to me, and I will easily ensure they are delivered to Amberg and that they are certainly and safely handed over. I am surprised that the judgment against the Nortvoldienser has been delayed so far; I have always observed that many inconveniences arise from such delays and untimely clemency. Thus, the judgments of the Rhetoricians do not please me any more than you write that they please the common people. Certainly, nothing should be decided hastily, nothing should be concealed out of fear, nor should evil be done so that good may come of it. This often comes to my mind and no less in our time...</p>
