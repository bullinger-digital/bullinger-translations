      <p>S. I hear that Savoy is attempting to form an alliance with the Swiss Confederates, but I cannot quite understand the purpose behind it; if it is done with any deceit, great caution should be exercised. Even if it concerns the Allobroges with sincere intentions, it should still be considered carefully to avoid any rash commitments. I am very eager to know your opinion on this matter.</p>
      <p>I have no news at the moment, except that someone of certain reliability writes to me: "We have no new tidings at this time, except that the imperial majesty still firmly and steadfastly adheres to their opinion and intention and does not wish to deviate in any way concerning the holy religion, and thus has parted from the princes. It is to be expected that something different will soon occur and be seen, etc." I wanted you to know this. Many things are indeed reported from France, but all are doubtful.</p>
      <p>However, it is confirmed for certain that the Constable has left the court, and the Cardinal of Lorraine holds the first rank of favor and esteem with the king. The burnings of the saints are frequent and horrible.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest lord and brother. Basel, September 4, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Greet your colleagues and professors in my words.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
