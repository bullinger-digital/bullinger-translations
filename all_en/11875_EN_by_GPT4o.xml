    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends [letter news], which were also communicated from another source, back with thanks. Apart from the arrival of some bishops and abbots, there is nothing to report from the Imperial Diet at Speyer; [the Protestants] will probably only send envoys when Emperor [Charles V] arrives. In the current situation in Germany, only repentance helps; it would be desirable for the magistrates to introduce a godly spiritual and secular censorship; the council of Konstanz is attempting this and is urging the pastors to express their opinions on the planned reorganization; Blarer asks Bullinger for a strictly confidential opinion. Praises his restraint towards Luther and Cochläus; if the rumor is true that Theodor [Bibliander] wants to write against Luther, Bullinger should prevent him from doing so. Fears it could harm the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] if Bullinger dedicates his writing against Cochläus [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei... libellum... responsio“] to him. Greetings. [Enclosure:] Requests confidentiality in a confidential matter: C[onrad] Zwick invented a seemingly very effective "war equipment" a few years ago; Blarer asked him for confidentiality, yet the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] and [King] Ferdinand have learned that a well-known Konstanz citizen named Zwick has invented something like this and want to know more; Zwick has agreed to negotiate with the "inventor." Zwick hopes for great benefit for Konstanz from this art of war; even without it, he managed to obtain an [imperial] privilege for the city at the Imperial Diet in Regensburg [1541]. However, Blarer has concerns that the invention would not only be used against the Turks, as the royal negotiators assured, but also against France and others, and that the promises made to the city of Konstanz would not be kept. Therefore, he suggests that someone from the Confederates should negotiate with Zwick, or perhaps the French envoy [Hans Wunderlich] or the Zurich council, as he does not expect much from the imperial cities in this regard; Bullinger should send him a confidential opinion and burn this request. Due to the urgency, he asks him to include in his reply the message that he has learned of the Konstanz invention and asks for more information; this enclosure would be shown by Blarer to Zwick, who would certainly notify Bullinger and not undertake anything further for the time being. May God guide them on the right path in this matter! Urges a prompt response, as he fears that [Zwick] might be sent to the Imperial Diet [at Speyer] and his secret could be extracted from him there.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The writings you sent to us, Bullinger, brother and venerable and dearest beyond others, we now return to you with this message, but in such a way that we express our greatest thanks to you. Although we had already received these from others before, your service is no less welcome and timely, which your faith and diligence have accomplished as soon as possible. Continue as you do; I will also continue, as I have nothing else now outside of these matters that I greatly wish you to know.</p>
      <p>We have not heard a word about the Imperial Diet at Speyer, except that some bishops and abbots have gone there to pave the way with papal tricks and to [the Emperor]. I do not think any of our people will be present until they understand that the Emperor has arrived. For they do not want to waste time and effort, which they complain they have done so often with great sorrow.</p>
      <p>What you wisely advise at the end of your letter, many good and most devoted men to the Christian republic ponder deeply and strive to thwart those execrable attempts with whatever means they can, wishing they could do so as successfully as they do piously. Certainly, the Lord will be appeased after all the enormous crimes of Germany by a single repentance, which unless he obtains through his word, the whole world will fight against us and emerge victorious, as we have despised the Lord of the world with such obstinacy after so many great benefits. Let us therefore urge this with the most holy persistence day and night, if perhaps the stiff-necked race of men may be bent to the obedience of faith and even some unwilling ones may be snatched away, lest they perish with Sodom. And would that our magistrates here would contemplate such a well-constituted republic, whose ecclesiastical and civil censorship would so please the Lord that he would turn his wrath away from us! And indeed, ours has now begun to entrust such a matter to us, the ministers of the church, a most beautiful but very difficult task, that when we daily proclaim in his administration what we desire, he may be certain that if he follows it, he will obtain the Lord's abundant blessing and escape his impending wrath.</p>
      <p>You see, my venerable brother, how great the difficulty of this task is, both because it extends so widely and is almost infinite, and also because in many things you cannot establish anything from the Lord's word or its analogy. Add to this that countless matters arise that are far removed from ecclesiastical ministry, so that we have thought this province should be declined by us, and yet, since they so greatly desire to hear us and understand our opinion even outside our ministry as other good men, we could not, nor should we, deny our service.</p>
      <p>They desire to learn from us how a government in spiritual and temporal matters may and should be arranged so that it is comprehensive and similar to God's word and thus pleasing to him, so that he, if it is lived according to it, will relent his wrath and impending punishment; wishing therefore that we would establish a complete, comprehensive reformation, how all things in ecclesiastical and political matters should be conducted; for they intend to arrange themselves in God's will in such a way that they may also be a good, better Christian example to other authorities.</p>
      <p>How heavy and unequal this burden is to our shoulders, you can easily see, although we embrace, respect, and adore this singular kindness of the Lord towards us with all our hearts, and we do not think it happened without his special providence that these matters were referred to us, hoping that a window will be opened from here for many good and Christ-worthy things in his church. In order not to lose this hope, it seemed good to all my fellow ministers, the ministers of this church, to also consult you and hear your opinion on all these matters. Therefore, my Bullinger, most esteemed brother in Christ Jesus, I implore, beseech, and adjure you by this very Christ and by that spirit of yours, which greatly desires the welfare of all the churches of God, and by whatever else you can be moved, not to fail us here, but to indicate what seems to you, or rather what seems to the Lord through you, in all these matters. It is indeed a subject worthy of careful polishing, and it was long overdue that the chief pastors of the churches should think of restoring stricter discipline and propose and even press and inculcate the absolute archetype of both censures to the princes and magistrates professing the gospel, so that even if they did not accept it but perhaps relegated it to Utopia with Plato's republic, they would still have freed their souls before the Lord and their faith on that day. With how much more willing a mind we now rightly do this, after the Lord has kindled this desire even in the least of the principal cities of Judah, Bethlehem, to establish all their affairs according to his will. Therefore, Bullinger, lend your helping hands, being persuaded that, as is the case, you will greatly benefit the Christian republic by this name, if by no other. If it seems good to you to refer part of this labor to your other ministers, do so in such a way that no one understands it is for the use of our city, but either of your own accord or at the request of certain friends, whose names should remain silent, you are attempting this. For there are not light reasons why we absolutely do not want anyone to find out; indeed, our senate has solemnly adjured us not to say anything to anyone except those who know how to keep silent about this.</p>
      <p>For there are those who, if they understand that it originated from us, will dislike it for this reason alone. So much do they despise the name of priests, with which they gladly stain us, who are not at all such. Moreover, since we ourselves also justifiably have some doubts about the constancy of our people, we think it better that these things be done secretly, so that if they do not follow the prescribed rule but, like mountains in labor, produce a mouse, they may do so with less ridicule from all, although we have confidence in the Lord that, since he has begun, he will also perfect the good work, where you will assist us diligently and perpetually with your most fervent prayers to our heavenly Father.</p>
      <p>Regarding Luther and Cochläus, nothing now, except that I reverently kiss your modesty of spirit. The Lord, I know, will one day declare how unjust these men have been to us. There are those who affirm that our Theodor is going to write against Luther; if this is true, I beg you, by all means, to prevent him from doing so, lest from these sparks a most serious and inextinguishable fire arise.</p>
      <p>I fear that your writing against Cochläus may not rightly be dedicated to the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied]. You know the old man is otherwise burdened with great hatred, which I greatly fear will be more depressed by this reason by those who seek opportunities; for although you are not sacramentarians, you are nevertheless considered as such by that dregs of men, who immediately cry out that you conspire with those to whom you dedicate your books. I only warn you of this; you will more prudently decide what is expedient here.</p>
      <p>But now farewell in Christ Jesus, always esteemed and more than dearest brother to me, perpetually remember us in your pious prayers before the Lord. Greet your whole household, then the venerable and best friends Gwalther, Pellican, Theodor, and the others. All of ours greet you, especially my brother with Conrad Zwick.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Out of special great trust, which I have in you, I must open a matter to you, with a very sincere desire to keep it secret until further notice of all things; for much depends on it, as you yourself will think, after you have noticed it.</p>
      <p>My particularly friendly, dear cousin Conrad Zwick discovered a wonderful war equipment a few years ago by special divine providence and has kept it secret with him until now. But recently he has taken two experienced and very knowledgeable men in military matters into his confidence and let them see this art. They both agreed that if it were used unexpectedly, no people, either on horseback or on foot, could withstand it according to all human calculation, and that it would require very little cost considering the great benefit that could be achieved with it against the enemy.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have continually urged him to keep the matter secret until perhaps a general need arises, where such a thing could be used to great advantage. Nevertheless, the Landgrave and Ferdinand have learned that there is someone here in Konstanz who knows such an art, and that this person is well known to my cousin, and so the king through an intermediary and the Landgrave through his own secretary have earnestly negotiated with my cousin and requested that he would negotiate and promote that the inventor reveal the art to them, with great assurance that they would spare no cost and would graciously agree with him. My dear cousin has now taken some time to consider and has promised to negotiate with the inventor.</p>
      <p>But I notice well in my cousin that he hopes to obtain great things from the Emperor and the king, which could be not only beneficial to him but also remarkably advantageous to the common city of Konstanz, as he then, at the recently held Imperial Diet in Regensburg, also obtained a very useful privilege against all expectations of my lords without this art.</p>
      <p>But I find this undertaking very worrisome and dangerous; for it does not sit well with me for many reasons to deal with these lords. For even if these lords commit themselves in writing to use this art only against the Turks, as the king's negotiators have let it be known, they are not to be trusted any more than that, as soon as they gain control of this art, they would use it to their advantage against the nearest enemy, such as the French and others. And even if they promised our city of Konstanz much peace and other great benefits, it would still be in their will to keep or not to keep, and thus this great gift of God could turn to significant disadvantage for others.</p>
      <p>Therefore, as I consider all the circumstances, I cannot see how this matter could be approached so that the end, which my dear cousin aims at, could be achieved, since he is most concerned with the benefit and common welfare of this city of Konstanz, as perhaps now someone from the Confederates might engage with him in negotiations; for in that place he might also hope to achieve something beneficial for himself and the common city. Although, when I also consider how the matters of the Confederates stand, I must worry that it may also be in vain. Moreover, it occurred to me that you have acquaintance, as I have learned from your previous writing, with the French legate, and therefore I think whether something could be negotiated through him or the lords of Zurich, to which I would then truly, if it also seemed good to you, gladly and in every way with requests and exhortations do the best towards my dear cousin. For with the imperial cities, I cannot think that anything fruitful could be achieved for many reasons, since they are not all united and also among the evangelicals many are attached to the Emperor. Therefore, it is good and highly necessary that this matter be used primarily for the honor of God and the benefit of pious people, and in my opinion, not a little depends on it, so I ask you most earnestly and brotherly as one in whom I have so far felt great care for common matters, to inform me of your opinion and how you think the matter should be handled, and to do so promptly, before and before you speak or deal with anyone about it, that you also burn this my letter as soon as you have read and considered it; for not a little trouble may arise from such a source.</p>
      <p>And since the matter does not tolerate delay, I consider it very good that you have written to me in a separate letter your opinion and consideration in this matter, as follows, and placed it in the letter:</p>
      <p>It has come to you in confidence and great secrecy that there is someone in Konstanz who has invented a strange war device. Your request is that I would learn about it and let you know if it is so and who the person is; you would like to know this for some excellent reasons, which you will write to me about later.</p>
      <p>For such a note I would then show to my cousin, from which it would then follow that he could not suspect you in any way, as if the matter had come from you; likewise, I would have reason to ask him to agree to entrust the matter to you. And if he then does not want to let his name be known, he would still not refuse to show you the matter, which, if it happens, he would then, as I sincerely hope, proceed on his own and at my exhortation to other places and await your reply.</p>
      <p>I write all this to you from a brotherly heart, in which we are meant for each other, with a request that you would heartily pray to God that he may graciously bring this matter to his honor and the benefit of his believers, and also enlighten us both through his spirit as to what is pleasing to him, so that we may be means to his praise. It is indeed in my heart a not insignificant matter, from which much good could come if at some time the right measure and way are found.</p>
      <p>If you now consider something useful in this, do not delay in it and spare no messenger's fee; for I fear my cousin might be appointed to the Imperial Diet, which I would gladly prevent if possible because of this matter; for the presence of great lords and their good words often blind and deceive the judgment of many pious people, although I assure myself of all good things for my dear cousin as a man of God; yet we are human, easily deceived.</p>
      <p>In great haste; I have only just decided to write this to you. May the faithful God truly grant grace for the expansion of his kingdom.</p>
