      <p>Pious, honorable, especially gracious lord and trusted, dearest friend. I learned yesterday with great sorrow, which also kept me from sleeping last night, that you are once again intending to cast off the burden that God has laid upon you with the heavy office. If this were so, no greater sorrow could befall me and other believers in these miserable times, for your sake and for all of us. For I know well that God will punish you no less than Jonah and others. That would grieve me deeply. And I pray to God that He may protect you and yours from all sorrow.</p>
      <p>God has powerfully placed you in the office with His hand, against your will, and has kept you there until now. He has also given you grace, so that you have managed it well and are beloved by all the pious and the entire community; all the pious also rely on you and look to you, hoping that God will help us through you.</p>
      <p>If you were to abandon us all in these dangers, when you have experienced how faithfully God helps you, and depart to seek your rest, you would bring upon yourself the enmity of God and all the pious, and open the door to all adversaries and wicked scoundrels. And whatever is ruined thereafter, it will be said: if Mr. Müller had trusted God and done his best, this would not have happened. He bears the greatest blame for it.</p>
      <p>But if you remain faithful to us and do not flee from us, you will retain the favor of God and all honest people; they will not curse you or speak ill of you, but will pray to God for you. And God will also help you faithfully.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beseech you, as your pastor called and ordained by God, also as a willing servant, for the sake of God and His people, if you have taken any resolution to tear yourself away from the office, that you submit yourself under the yoke of God, not faint-hearted, but brave, in these dangerous times, placing your trust in God, in His word, in His church, and in His forsaken people, as all the pious trust you.</p>
      <p>Understand this from me in the best way. For you should trust me, who wishes you well from the heart, who also watches over the flock of God from the heart. For their sake, I ask you to do your best as before.</p>
      <p>And heed this my admonition well. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Master Heinrich Bullinger sent me this letter on Friday, the 8th day of December in the year 64 before noon.</p>
