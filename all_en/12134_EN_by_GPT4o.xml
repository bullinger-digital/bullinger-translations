The [Zürich] are asked to comment on this, taking into account the piety and preservation of the church. - If the [Neuenburg] could not assist the [Zürich] in the past, it is not due to ingratitude, but to a lack of means and opportunities.

      <p>Greetings. You can easily understand, men both esteemed for their learning and piety, how diligently the brothers who teach Christ here strive for peace and concord. This is in dealing with one who has been among us for several years, who opposes whenever the mention of discipline arises. Although everyone else accepts it and acknowledges the benefit they derive from it, he alone condemns it and claims it is contrary to the word of God. We have waited a long time, and many efforts have been made with writings and examples proposed by us, and sometimes by others who have dealt with the dissenter in our assembly, but nothing has been achieved. Finally, so that nothing might be left untried in bringing him to true concord, he was asked whether he would submit to the judgment of the churches. When he agreed to do so, we gave great thanks to God. Several churches were asked, as we also asked yours, with letters sent to Kaspar Megander, who was the author of our discipline here through the Spirit of the Lord. A letter was also written to Bullinger, the great pastor along with Kaspar of your church. While we have received responses from others, not so from you. Hence, we fear that our letters may not have reached you, or if you have perhaps decided to reply, your letters may have been intercepted. Therefore, the brothers instructed me to write to you and send a brief explanation of the discipline we use, along with the objections of the dissenter, who believes our discipline will be overturned if his objections stand. We therefore ask you in the Lord and implore you through Christ, that it may not be burdensome for you to give your judgment on this matter, and then to do what you judge useful for preserving true peace and concord among us. Provided that piety is preserved and the churches are maintained, the brothers are ready to do everything to prevent any dissension from growing and reigning among us. If we have received much from you and have given nothing in return, please do not think it is due to ingratitude, nor that we lack the spirit to do well by you: but rather that our strength has not matched our desires and the opportunity has been lacking. And while we commend all churches to the Lord, we do not hold you among the last in our memory of your services, wishing that Christ may enrich you with all spiritual gifts, so that you may more and more illuminate the glory of Christ and the gospel in this perverse age, and recall as many as possible from error to the path of truth, not only inviting all to better things with holy exhortation, but also drawing them by truly Christian example.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily with the churches entrusted to you, for whom we wish all good things. Neuenburg, February 22, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Farel, in my own name and that of the brothers.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished men, pastors and doctors of the church of Zürich, as learned as they are very pious, in Zürich.</p>
