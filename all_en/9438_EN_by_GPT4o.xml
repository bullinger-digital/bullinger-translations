      <p>S. Recently, most honorable and reverend lord and godfather, we had, according to our solemn custom, a convocation in our Glarus region, and among other things, it was reported by almost all the brothers that Lord Abraham Sartorius in Buobikon is denouncing and accusing good men and brothers among his listeners, as if they are seeking sacred ministries and better conditions elsewhere and are soon to abandon their churches; therefore, he is strongly requesting that they make an effort to replace him in one of these positions; for he considers himself entirely devoted to Glarus and is solely focused on and contemplating day and night how he might return to that region. And although he had already learned from some that they were indignantly bearing his plan because of the scandal that arises from it, he has not yet relented, but continues to send letters to men of the highest authority and especially to the senatorial order, most of which they themselves have seen and read and could still show if necessity required it. They believe he is doing this to create such disgust and hatred for one of these men among his own people that he might be removed from his church sooner and he himself might succeed in his place. For he knows that the appointments do not belong to the magistrate, but to each individual church or community, and that they have the power to hire and dismiss such a mercenary as he presents himself. He recently attempted the same with the people of Schwanden, whom he threw into such suspicion against the good pastor Jacob Frank through his vain letters (for he was said to be seeking another position elsewhere) that the bailiff Schuler, incensed with anger and indignation, called him into his house and sharply reproached him, asking why he intended to desert his church so clandestinely.</p>
      <p>And when Jacob, to whom this was entirely foreign and who was well aware of his own innocence, responded modestly and excused himself, the bailiff believed him and calmed down, and only then did he provide him with Abraham's writings to read, saying that he had written similar things to many other men in our dominion. Later, when I happened to meet our treasurer, I informed him of Abraham's plan and asked him, on behalf of all the brothers, to excuse us before the most honorable senate if the matter came to that; for we are innocent of this fault and will, as we have done before, await legitimate calls from God and our princes. Then he, while promising to do so diligently, voluntarily told me that he too had received many letters from him after his departure from Betschwand, all of which similarly urged that as soon as one of the positions in the Glarus region became vacant, he should be promoted to it. Therefore, all our brothers and fellow ministers unanimously instructed me to inform you, honorable lord and godfather, as our singular father and patron, of this injustice and to earnestly and strongly request that you, by your authority, exhort and admonish him to be content with his lot and leave us and our churches alone. We did not want to accuse him otherwise; hence they instructed me to inform you alone. It would be a sorrow to us if any harm should arise and befall him for that reason. Therefore, we all earnestly ask you again to deign to exhort him either in writing or even orally, if he should happen to come to you; and he will desist if he is wise; then we will also be well advised, and you will do us a most pleasing service. We would have written ourselves; but since he has made little of the pious and holy admonitions of the brothers, they thought he would do the same in this matter, and we considered it most advisable for you to admonish him with your gravity. I received your most delightful letters, which you sent to me on August 14, with great joy. For these, I thank you immensely, and the brothers and fellow ministers of our region all ask you to always faithfully communicate with us what is new, and they all unanimously greet you most dutifully and pray for God's blessing on your old age.</p>
      <p>My wife, along with the whole household, also wishes you and yours well. Hastily. Glarus, August 28, 1573.</p>
      <p>Johannes Hugo on behalf of the brothers and fellow ministers of the entire Glarus class.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned, and faithful master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich, my dear lord and godfather.</p>
