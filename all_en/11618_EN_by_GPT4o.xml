    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not want to bother Bullinger with trivialities and writes to him only when he has noteworthy news. When Ruprecht von Mosham recently stayed in Konstanz, Blarer implored him not to obscure the teachings of Christ; he also criticized Mosham's unrestrained remarks about the Pope, Luther, and the Lutherans and made him understand that his endeavor was hopeless. Together with [Johannes] Zwick and others, he enabled Mosham to have a hearing, in which Mosham presented various confused views on Luther, the doctrine of justification, and Christology. Mosham received money from the council; he rode to Strasbourg to continue printing his book there, which had been prohibited in Bern; Blarer admonished the educated man, whom he feels sorry for, once again. Thanks Bullinger for his writings and wishes for a good completion; Leo Jud's Bible translation is commendable and should find more imitators. Recommends Wilhelm [...]. Greetings. Sends a letter [Peter] Bufflers about the Turks with a request for return; plague and the threat of the Turks are the reward for ingratitude. The plague in Konstanz.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my venerable and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that I should not trouble you, a man wholly devoted to public duties, with my trifles, unless I wish to sin against the church of God. However, whenever there is something that you should know or that might be of interest to you, I cannot restrain myself from disturbing you, even when you are very busy.</p>
      <p>Recently, we had with us that dean, Ruprecht von Mosham, who, in my judgment, is exactly as you described him to us. He first conferred with me in private, where I earnestly implored and entreated the man not to obscure and entangle the simple doctrine of Christ with his insolent words and opinions, rather than illuminate and explain it; this is not the concise word to which the common understanding can penetrate.</p>
      <p>Then, I no less diligently dissuaded him from that excessive license of insults, with which he so unchristianly attacked the Roman pontiff as well as Luther and the Lutherans; for, as far as the matter of purer Christianity is concerned, he could teach nothing better than they; we also do not agree with Luther in all things and have not sworn by his words; yet we recognize the man of God, whom the heavenly Father used as a most chosen instrument in bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom of his Son, etc. I do not doubt that he is driven by zeal for God, but I also know that he is laboring under a severe temptation, from which I will also diligently and earnestly pray to the Lord that he may be delivered as soon as possible. This counsel is not from the Lord, as can be gathered from the fact that he finds no one anywhere who is a solidly learned man willing to add his support here; none of these efforts succeed, although he has tried almost everything; he has wasted so much of his resources, time, and intellectual energy here in vain and will continue to do so.</p>
      <p>After all this, when he realized that he could not persuade me to agree with him, he strongly urged that I ensure all the fellow ministers were present, which I initially refused for many reasons, but later, overcome by the man's persistence and impropriety, I arranged. With our Zwick and others present, he wanted to discuss the matter thoroughly and from the very beginning, as they say; but since it was market time with us and everyone was hurrying to other things, I asked him to be brief. There he said many things against Luther, who had fallen most disgracefully, especially in the article of justification, who did not distinguish between the law of faith and works, who was inconsistent; then he brought forward many things to prove that faith alone does not justify, nor is faith the work of God in us, but Christ himself is, and there he inculcated many trinities and unitrinities, reading out some axioms he had written, from which I wanted to write down these few things that I could catch from the reader's mouth, so that you might clearly understand how much this man's theology differs from the modes of speaking of all the ancients and moderns: "Justifying faith is the spirit of God. Just as the word of God is unitrinitarian, so faith itself is also unitrinitarian, because the spirit is homoousios with God and is unitrinitarian. This spirit justifies and saves; for as the word of God is God, so the word of Christ, which is faith, is Christ, so the word of the spirit is the spirit. Just as the word of God, namely Christ, is God, so the word of Christ, faith itself, is Christ; so the word of the Holy Spirit, namely charity itself, is the Holy Spirit, and these three homoousian and consubstantial words are one, and each of them is unitrinitarian. God alone, who justifies and saves, is unitrinitarian; the one word of God that justifies and saves is unitrinitarian. In sum: Just as God the Father justifies and saves through one word alone and in one word alone, which is Christ, so Christ, the Son of God, justifies and saves through one word alone and in one word alone, which is faith; so also the Holy Spirit justifies and saves through one word alone and in one word alone, which is charity. And just as God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, these three are one (1 John 5:7), so the word, faith, and charity, these three homoousian and consubstantial words and names of God, though distinct in form, are one in substance and essence, and each of them is unitrinitarian; ἓν μόνον καὶ τρίσμονον πνεῦμα ὡς μόνος καὶ τρίσμονος λόγος etc. To say that faith is the work of God is thrice impious, blind, and false. Otherwise," he says, "it would follow that only a creature justifies and saves us," and that against Osiander, etc.</p>
      <p>I write these things to you briefly, since he affirmed that he did not present these to you, except that he communicated some things to our Pellican. Otherwise, from my fellow ministers in the Lord, he received no other judgment than what I had previously given.</p>
      <p>We advised him to leave here in a timely manner, meanwhile obtaining from the council that some gold coins be counted out to him, and he went directly from here with five hired horses to Strasbourg, hoping to be able to complete the printing of his book there, of which he had arranged for some sections to be printed in Bern, and would have completed everything, had the council, being informed, not ordered him to leave with the work unfinished. Furthermore, as he was leaving, I repeatedly admonished him to change his mind and not to expect to obtain anything from either side in this manner, as he was alienating both by writing sometimes ambitiously, sometimes so hatefully. We pity the man greatly and pray for a good mind for him from the Lord as much as we can, since we observe a pious heart in this man and an uncommon learning combined with a knowledge of languages.</p>
      <p>For the literary gifts you sent us, we thank you very much, and we pray with all our hearts to the Lord that you may successfully complete the work you have begun. We greatly approve of Leo Jud's project of translating the Bible. We wish that all those learned in the holy languages would strive for this; for there is no one who does not see something either unknown to or overlooked by the predecessors, and from all these versions, one notable one, in which either nothing or as little as possible is lacking, seems likely to emerge for posterity, if there is any future. Therefore, in our name too, add encouragement, so that he may never stop, but continue as he has begun. We will diligently supplicate our Lord God, the author of this good, for success.</p>
      <p>We warmly commend this our Wilhelm to you and yours; he seems to us entirely worthy to whom we may entrust the flock of Christ, since he is so experienced that he is not ignorant of Satan's thoughts.</p>
      <p>But now, my more than dearest Bullinger, farewell again and again, along with your most holy wife and the excellent men Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Megander, and the others, to whom you will convey our most abundant greetings in our words, and together with them, you will intercede for us with Christian faith at the throne of grace. All of ours commend themselves to you, especially my brother with his sister and our wife, both Zwicks, and the others. I send to you the matters concerning the Turks, which that Buffler from Isny wrote to me, but on the condition that you return them. The plague is now raging a little more severely with us than it has hitherto, and since this evil is now spreading everywhere, and at the same time the Turk is exerting such great forces against us, I see nothing but soon a miserable barbarism and devastation in our adorned and polished Germany. Thus indeed is deserved by our execrable ingratitude, whom neither the evangelical blandishments nor the threats of these evils move in the least. May the Lord have mercy on us, in whom again farewell.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, October 6, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed and dearest lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
