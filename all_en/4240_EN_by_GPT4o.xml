      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Today I wrote to you, my brother; now I write again, especially on behalf of this Maternus, who brings you this letter, a most holy and learned man. He was for some time a companion of Mr. Peter Martyr, and now he plans to see Italy. I have dissuaded him in every way; but since he has decided and requested letters of recommendation, I commend him to you as a man worthy in every way, whom good men should favor and promote. You may have Italians in the Valtellina to whom you can recommend him, who can assist him with advice and writings.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, receive and promote him in such a way that he feels our recommendation has greatly benefited him. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 22, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Maternus Eccilius of Silesia.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, his dear compatriot and brother. Chur in Graub√ºnden.</p>
