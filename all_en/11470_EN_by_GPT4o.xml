    <p xml:id="regest1">Grynäus has departed for Worms - Amerbach is to follow him in three weeks - and has the task of defending the [First Helvetic] Confession on occasion, without engaging in negotiations. Myconius wished that Bullinger and Vadian would also be sent; this would unsettle the opponents and strengthen the unity [of the Protestants]. Osiander wrote to Strasbourg, stating that arsonists had confessed to being in the pay of the Pope. King [Ferdinand I] demands the enforcement of celibacy from the bishops, which causes unrest among the priests; of the three mandates shown to him by the pastor of Rheinfelden, the one from the bishop [Philipp von Gundelsheim] was suspiciously reserved. [Wolfgang Wissenburg] has been promoted to doctor through the laying on of hands; the same form of promotion was denied to Grynäus. Mayor [Jakob Meyer] requests that the envoys be urged to negotiate persistently in Rottweil.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Herr Grynäus has departed for Worms with the consent of the magistrate, alone; Amerbach was supposed to go with him, but for certain reasons, he has been granted three weeks, after which he will also leave, I believe. Grynäus has been instructed to be an observer, since our people have not been invited to the assembly by the confederates and others. If the opportunity to speak arises or is offered, he should primarily ensure to defend the confession written and made by all of us here together with the people of Strasbourg; he should not involve himself in new doctrines.</p>
      <p>He carried with him a caution signed by the scribe's hand. I write this so that no one may say we have defected from you again. You know what the main points and languages are everywhere; therefore, I wanted to be cautious with these few words, so that nothing of this sort could be spread about us.</p>
      <p>Could your senate not send someone in the same manner? But consider: This matter would terrify the adversaries and greatly increase the friendship of the princes and cities. These two reasons are indeed of great importance to me. I wish that you and Consul Vadian were with Grynäus, even at the cost of my own goods, however small they may be. May the good spirit inspire you, so that, having made a decision, you both may be sent off with peace! I see what fruit would result from this, even if not a word were allowed to be spoken in public. Nevertheless, do not think from this that I expect any good from the adversaries. For I know that what they do pertains to defending their own interests and to destroying ours, indeed those that belong to Christ. But this is the fruit I look to: the concord of the true church and thereby the terror of the members of Satan. I know how much they fear our concord, how much they rejoice and are uplifted by dissension. Come, may the Lord mercifully (as he has so far) support and protect us.</p>
      <p>Furthermore: Osiander wrote to Strasbourg that arsonists captured by the Landgrave confessed under torture that the Pope was the author of such a horrendous evil and had spent a huge amount of money on these rogues, and that certain German bishops were aware of this.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there is a mandate from the king to the bishops to force the priests to dismiss their concubines; for he and his brother no longer wish to bear the name of pimps, which some princes and Lutherans have often thrown at them. The poor priests are tormented, running around, consulting, so that if you saw them, you would be compelled either to pity or to laugh. A pastor from Rheinfelden was here; he had three mandates, one from the king to the bishops, another from the king to the priests, and a third from the bishop to the priests. All are written severely except for the bishop's mandate; for it almost flatters and asks them to comply, so that no bad suspicion may arise with the king and princes from disobedience concerning themselves and them. There are various interpretations; you too interpret what you think lies beneath.</p>
      <p>Finally, we now have a new creation; it was created through the laying on of hands, which was most stubbornly denied to Grynäus, even though he agreed to the same. Divine, what it is. We prescribed that form, otherwise we did not want to have any dealings with the doctorate. Now we wait to see what will happen; for they did not want this doctor without reason.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and Theodor, to whom I wish these things to be common. The consul had asked that you remind the envoys who will go from you to Rottweil to act steadfastly; if they have not left, please remember his request. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Basel, 5th of November, in the year 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Os. Myco.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Herr Heinrich Bullinger, brother in his Lord.</p>
