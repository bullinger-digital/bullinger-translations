    <p xml:id="regest1">Heard from Hans Mutschli in Bremgarten that the people of Zurich had agreed to a judicial decision regarding the mandate dispute at the last Diet in Baden, because they had not been supported by the Bernese Diet envoys. Asks Bullinger for more precise information, as he learned from Peter Im Haag in Bern that Zurich acted against the will of the Bernese and the Baslers.</p>

      <p>My very friendly greetings and always willing and tireless service to you, gracious and beloved brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Today I was in Bremgarten and there I heard from our good lord and brother, the mayor Mutschli, something that astonished and seemed unfair to me. It concerns the matter of the past day, which was held just before Christmas in Baden. He understood some words from you, which perhaps our lords from Zurich encountered from our lords from Bern's council envoys, namely that they stood without help and completely without advice or comfort, and thus submitted to the judgment for such a reason. Now, however, since I was in Bern at Christmas and understood something quite different from my lord Vennrich Im Haag, which completely contradicts this, and I would like to write to him that, since the matter and the rumor is among you, and I am not so sure about it, my friendly request to you is that you inquire more precisely about the matter and such talk and report it to me, or only to my aforementioned lord mayor. For I say this: If our council envoys from Bern handled it this way, they did it on their own and not on the recommendation of my gracious lords, nor did they present the truth in Bern. And therefore, since you also hear the rumors and the talk in Bern, this was told to me by my lord Vennrich Peter Im Haag himself on the last past Christmas day. For when I sat with him in his house in Bern for two hours and asked him about such a decision of the day, he answered me that he knew nothing about it, he had not been among the envoys, but they had the recommendation that they should stand by those from Zurich, and that they should not stand at all and completely with the five places in any judgment, for such a judgment could be endured by us just as well as by them, because our mandate is sharper, and if it came from you, it would be next to us as well. And with this, he showed me both the mandate of my gracious lords and also that of those from Zurich, etc. After this, in the evening, he met me at the cathedral and called to me and said: "As you told me today, so it has happened." But I had told him that I had heard that those from Zurich had submitted to the judgment of the five places. And further, he said: "May God truly have mercy! I think that God is completely against us. I hardly know what we should expect from those from Zurich. They do not seem to be steadfast, for when the five places wanted an answer from them, and they did not have the authority, they sent more authority behind them, and after that, when the authority came to them, they submitted to the judgment, and that against the command and will of our envoys and those from Basel, which now weakens us badly. Yet they still have it before them that they alone submitted, thinking they had not acted against the peace of the land," etc. Such, dear Master Heinrich, was told to me by the aforementioned truthful man himself. From this, you can well understand what a cunning devil is at work in the matter, for the great complaint and concern in Bern, as I have also heard from others, is that those from Zurich do not want to be steadfast, and the situation is very good in Bern, etc. With this, truly entrusted to the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>Given on January 8, 1533.</p>
      <p>In place of brother Andreas Rappenstein, it is well.</p>
      <p>Your always willing Hemmann Haberer, steward, in Hallwil.</p>
