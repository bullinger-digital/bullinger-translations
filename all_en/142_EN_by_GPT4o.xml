      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. For a long time, I have not written any letters to you, dearest Bullinger, for the reason that Johannes Blasius, my younger and more eager colleague, often writes to you and communicates those things that need to be shared. Therefore, I think it unnecessary for both of us to trouble you, who are dedicated and occupied with better matters. But now, the venerable father, Master Augustin Mainard, bishop of the church in Klosters, a man well-deserving of the church of Christ, has requested letters from me, so that he may have the opportunity to approach you and a more convenient access may be opened to him, although your piety and innate kindness are so well known and recognized by me that anyone who rightly teaches Christ and promotes His gospel is always and by himself sufficiently pleasing and acceptable to you. Therefore, kindly receive this pious and honest man, as you are accustomed to do. A certain controversy has arisen in the church of Klosters, as you will hear from both sides. Make an effort with your fellow ministers to resolve it, so that a more serious offense does not arise. For those Italian temperaments are prone to contention and difficult to appease. Their disputes and contentions could eventually bring harm and loss to all of us and also to the gospel. Indeed, they have asked us to take up their cause and controversy for resolution. But since our learning and authority are both small and limited, and since we felt that both parties were eager to go to Zürich, we advised them to proceed to you, where there is sufficient learning and authority. Therefore, receive and treat these men with your usual candor, as you know and are accustomed to do. We have nothing from Italy; if you have anything from Augsburg, share it with us. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From the Chur of Rhaetia, on the first of June, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man in piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church in Zürich, his most revered lord and brother.</p>
