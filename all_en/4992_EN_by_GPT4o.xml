      <p>Greetings through Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p>A month has already passed since I gave a letter to a certain Martin to be delivered to you, most esteemed sir, from which you could only conjecture about the state of our church as we now see it after the departure of Mr. Martin, but you could not fully understand it.</p>
      <p>Nor is it surprising, since even we, who are present here, could not fully understand what was happening with us or where those accused wanted to emerge. We are now, my lord Bullinger, like poorly connected members, full of suspicions, full of detractions, so that not even a guest is safe from a host. At the funeral of that most illustrious and renowned man, worthy of eternal memory, our preachers, with a truly prophetic spirit, predicted that the death of such a great man would portend some notable disaster for our churches. And their prediction was not at all mistaken.</p>
      <p>For what then seemed like a riddle, we now see with experience as a great evil before the eyes of all the faithful Christians.</p>
      <p>With that charioteer of Israel dead, we are now like a shattered chariot, whose pole is broken, axle fractured, and wheels scattered. But from where did this evil suddenly grow so strong; I will tell.</p>
      <p>I will tell truly before God and briefly. On the twenty-first of September, a synod was held in Władysławów, as I had previously written to you. To this synod came Blandrata with his patrons and Mr. Lismaninus, and after various deliberations, when each of them saw that they had fallen into suspicion, Lismaninus, against the will of all the ministers and most of the church guests, was held in confession of faith throughout this time, he can bring even greater ruin to the churches. If, I say, he continues to follow in their footsteps.</p>
      <p>I write and narrate these things truthfully and I know I expect hatred and dangers from many, yet for my faith towards my God and your churches, I could not remain silent. Furthermore, I ask you to temper your advice with your wisdom and to use these letters in such a way that you do not endanger me here with the others who honor you as friends. But if you were to ask me, who is somewhat acquainted with the condition of this kingdom, how to counter these dangers, then, if asked, I would modestly respond: We must, man of God, first implore divine mercy and not neglect any means that can be given. I would judge it necessary first to diligently investigate this confession and its hidden retreats. If it is not a matter of such importance that disturbances should arise, I would think it best to remain quiet, especially in this turbulent state of the church, we have enough disturbances with other sectarians, and rather gather strength against the papists. But if this confession breathes paganism of three gods and Arianism to the insult of the Son of God (for these are the two things to be feared from them), this pestilence of the human race should by no means be tolerated, and it would be necessary not only to act with letters and writings but also with your own messengers from both the Genevan and your churches. Indeed, it would be necessary to rouse the pious princes of Germany to send their envoys to extinguish this sudden fire. I do not doubt that our people would be moved by this matter.</p>
      <p>It is indeed a matter not of great but of the greatest importance. Satan is vigilant here and strives, and truly Mr. Calvin writes in that preface that such men are cunning, they penetrate the houses of the great and insinuate themselves to pave the way for their blasphemies. Therefore, most esteemed sir, your help is implored by the afflicted church here.</p>
      <p>If you have accomplished anything worthy of the memory of posterity, here indeed you now have the most ample field in which your faith towards the Son of God and your most intense love can run forth. But here are these illustrious men, citizens of our churches, whom you should rouse with your letters. First and foremost, the captain of Margemburg, the carver of the royal table, Stanislaus Miscovius.</p>
      <p>This man is renowned, prudent, and detests such innovations of restless men. Please, encourage and exhort him above others, as much as you can.</p>
      <p>The second is the castellan of Biecz, Johannes Boner, a renowned and prudent man, but I see that they strive to preoccupy his ears. The third is the palatine of Poznań, Martin Sborowius, almost the first in the kingdom after the king. These two, along with the captain of Margemburg, could do much to serve the church of God.</p>
      <p>The fourth is the illustrious palatine of Vilnius, Radziwiłł, known to your people by reputation, to whom they run as to a fortress. I do not doubt, however, that the Lord's right hand will guard him, provided you do not fail him with your letters. But neither should the ministers be neglected.</p>
      <p>Therefore, write to Felix Cruciger, Stanislaus Luthomirius, Jacobus Sylvius, Gregorius Bresinius, Stanislaus Wardesius, Martinus Crovicius, a pious and most upright man. All these are good men, pious and lovers of God, but Satan will not sleep.</p>
      <p>I fear that Satan may sift us and tempt some of these, although they have hitherto persevered strenuously in the confession of faith, which we embraced from the beginning. I say, you should warn all these with your letters, and if it later seems to us that you should also send envoys, we will inform you in due course. For now, it does not seem to me the right time.</p>
      <p>Your excellence can inform learned and pious men about all these things, suppressing my name, however, for many useful considerations. For I would prefer that action be taken with them in the name of the whole church, not in the name of one. Meanwhile, if I can in any way, I would not want to fail the church of God.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if it seems right to you to assign me something, I will strive to ensure that nothing is lacking in me. For I am here to serve my Lord God and His church all the days of my life. I wish you and yours to be well.</p>
      <p>Given in Kraków, 1561. Given on the 28th of September. To the most illustrious and pious, learned... most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, superintendent of the church of Zürich, to be reverently honored as lord and brother.</p>
