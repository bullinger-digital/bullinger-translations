    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer recommends the in every respect excellent [Georg] Frölich, who has long wanted to see Bullinger and who undertook this journey mainly for that reason and not so much because of his son [Jonas?], who is being educated [in Konstanz] by [Jakob] Funcklin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Since Frölich had wished that Funcklin would accompany him [to Zurich], Blarer recommends [Frölich and Funcklin], although Bullinger does not actually need a recommendation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Bullinger should enjoy their visit. Otherwise, there is no news; [Frölich and Funcklin] will report themselves.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Bullinger should take joy in Frölich's visit with happiness. Greetings, also from [Thomas Blarer] and [Konrad] Zwick.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Here for you, my venerable and more than dearest Bullinger, is our excellent Frölich, a man of solid piety and not commonly educated, who has gathered great wisdom through much experience (having been involved in the most extensive public affairs for a long time). I will say nothing of his most candid manners and a certain rare humanity of the man, by which he immediately and most pleasantly ingratiates himself into the minds of good people, even in the course of a single hour's meeting. He has long held an impatient desire to see you and to delight himself with you in the Lord. Therefore, he affirms that he has undertaken this journey not so much for the sake of his little son, who is being educated here by my dearest Funcklin, but so that he might later proceed to you from here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I would commend both to you as my own soul, if I had not so often experienced your dutiful humanity and most humane dutifulness towards friends and all your people towards men of this kind. However, our Frölich wished that Funcklin, a truly holy young man and dearer to me than a son, a distinguished minister of our church, would join him as a companion on the journey, which he agreed to do without reluctance.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Therefore, enjoy them in the Lord and be assured that men of God (which they truly are) enter your house not without the accompaniment of great happiness. Furthermore, there is no need for me to add anything now, since they will be living letters for me with you, making you more certain of all our matters with good faith.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell, my soul, most esteemed brother in Christ, and rejoice happily with our Frölich. Greet your household with all the brothers and friends. Our people, especially my brother Thomas and Zwick, send you many greetings and commend themselves to your pious prayers. Farewell again. In Konstanz, 24th of September, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I assume you have received those letters, which I arranged to be delivered to you in these days by the young Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man of God, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
