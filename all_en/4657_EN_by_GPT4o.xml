      <p>S. D. I received the enclosed letters, which I am sending, from Geneva from our honorable brother, Mr. Calvin, and Beza. In Mr. Calvin's letter to me, there was nothing worth mentioning, except that he wrote about certain dangers threatening them, both from the Duke of Savoy and the King of France, although I believe they have been given an opportunity to excuse themselves. I have long since excused them in letters written to the legate, which I know for certain have been presented to the queen; for there are those who place all the blame for the incited sedition on them. He also writes about his response given to Hesshus, of which he sent a copy, but only one.</p>
      <p>He adds some things about the Polish brothers, who are certainly very troublesome and annoying to us; for they continually propose so many questions that hardly many can solve them, and sometimes they look for a knot in a bulrush. I have written so much and so often that I am completely exhausted; I understand that Mr. Calvin, being worn out, no longer wishes to respond to them, and certainly, even if entire books are written for them, no end to their demand for more detailed answers is yet seen. I beg you to return Beza's letters promptly, so that I can share them with others of mine as well.</p>
      <p>You see all these things agree with what Hottomann recently sent. In Piedmont, the region of the Duke of Savoy, many prodigies have recently been seen: the sky burning as in some regions here, three comets; it rained blood; a fiery spear was seen; an earthquake terrified everyone, as if the noise of chariots was heard, and other things in other places, etc. These remind us to lift up our heads; our redemption is drawing near.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>I received your letters, and there was no need for such elaborate and lengthy thanks, etc. Zurich, February 9.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow in Neuch√¢tel, the envoys of Bern and Savoy will meet, etc. 1561.</p>
      <p>May Matthias be safe; share with him the matters of France. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Master Ambrosius Blarer in Winterthur.</p>
