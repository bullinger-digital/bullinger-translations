      <p>Greetings. Your letter was finally delivered to me on the eighth day after I had returned home. It was not Roystius himself who brought it, but Rosetus. Since he found the master without our help, I think he was less concerned about delivering it. Nevertheless, we both courteously offered him our services. Regarding your booklet, which you mention there, I wish, my dear Bullinger, that when we were recently there, it had not been burdensome for you and your colleagues to discuss the whole matter with us calmly: certainly, some progress would have been made. For I did not come prepared for a theatrical performance, which displeases me no less than it does you. Not to mention Farel, whose nature you also know to abhor ostentation.</p>
      <p>But we wished to discuss with you in a friendly manner, far removed from the desire to argue, those things on which we are less agreed. And indeed, that would be the best way among brothers: which we would have found fruitful, unless I am very mistaken.</p>
      <p>For as far as the sacraments in general are concerned, we neither bind God's grace to them, nor transfer the office or power of the Holy Spirit to them, nor place our confidence of salvation in them. For we explicitly profess that it is God alone who acts through the sacraments, and we attribute all efficacy to the Holy Spirit, and we testify that this action is only apparent in the elect: nor do we teach that the sacraments benefit us in any other way than by leading us to Christ, so that we seek in Him whatever good there is. I truly do not see what in this doctrine you could rightly desire, which teaches that salvation is to be sought from Christ alone, makes God alone its author, and affirms that it is perceived only by the secret operation of the Spirit. Yet we teach that the sacraments are instruments of God's grace. Indeed, since they are instituted for a certain purpose, we deny that their use should be idle.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we say that what is symbolized there is offered to the elect, lest God be thought to deceive the eyes with a false spectacle. Thus, we say that whoever receives baptism with true faith also receives the forgiveness of sins from it. But we add an explanation, lest anyone ascribe the cause of their salvation to baptism, that this forgiveness comes from the blood of Christ. Therefore, it is conferred through baptism only because it is a testimony of that cleansing which the Son of God obtained for us by shedding His blood on the cross, and which He offers to be enjoyed by the faith of His gospel and perfects in our hearts by His Spirit. We feel the same about renewal.</p>
      <p>In the supper, when the signs of the body and blood of Christ are offered to us, we say they are not offered in vain, but that the thing itself is also assured to us. Hence it follows that we eat the body of Christ and drink His blood. In speaking this way, we neither make the thing out of the sign, nor do we confuse both together into one, nor do we enclose the body of Christ in the bread, nor do we imagine it to be infinite, nor do we dream of a carnal transfusion of Christ into us, nor do we establish any other such fiction. You say that Christ is in heaven according to His human nature. We also confess the same. The name of heaven sounds to you like a distance of place. We also willingly accept this: namely, that Christ is distant from us by the interval of places. You deny that the body of Christ is infinite, but is contained by its circumference. We agree, indeed we freely and openly testify to this. You deny that the sign is to be mixed with the thing. We diligently remind that one should be distinguished from the other. You sharply condemn impanation. We subscribe.</p>
      <p>What then is the sum of the opinion? When we see bread and wine here on earth, our minds should be raised to heaven to enjoy Christ. And then Christ is present to us while we seek Him above the elements of this world. For it is not right for us to accuse Christ of deceit, which would happen unless we feel that the truth is exhibited along with the sign.</p>
      <p>And you also concede that the sign is by no means empty. It only remains for us to define what it contains in itself. When we briefly respond that we are made partakers of the flesh and blood of Christ, so that He dwells in us and we in Him, and in this way we enjoy all His benefits: what, I ask, is either absurd or obscure in these words? Especially when we explicitly exclude whatever delusions might come to mind. And yet we are criticized as if we have deviated from the simple and pure doctrine of the gospel. But I would like to know what that simplicity is to which we are to be recalled. Recently, when I was with you, I pressed the same point, but I remember, as I think, that nothing was answered. Nor is this said by me so much for the sake of complaint, as to make it known that we are suspected by some good men for no reason.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I noticed long ago that we are burdened by that communication which we have with Bucer. But I ask you, my dear Bullinger, by what right should we estrange ourselves from Bucer, when he subscribes to this confession of ours which I have set forth? I will not now extol the rare and many virtues by which that man excels. I will only say that I would do a grave injustice to the church of God if I either hated or despised him. I am silent about what he has deserved of me privately. And yet I love and honor him in such a way that I freely admonish him whenever it seems necessary. How much more just will his complaint about you be considered? For he once complained that you forbade the use of the sacred supper to the young men of Zurich who were living in Strasbourg, although no other confession was required of them than your own. I truly do not see the reason why the churches should be so divided in this part. But what is the reason why pious men should be angry with us if we cultivate friendship with a man who professes that he is by no means standing in the way of being your friend and brother?</p>
      <p>But since this is the crux of the matter, show, if you can, that I am hindered by my association with Bucer from freely professing what I feel. Perhaps I seem so; but I make the matter itself a witness. Therefore, let us not be so suspicious where it is not necessary.</p>
      <p>Moreover, when I came to Lausanne, I advised the brothers to send to Haller as soon as possible: for I hoped they would obtain all fair things from him.</p>
      <p>And indeed Haller did not disappoint the hope I had given. However, Jodocus and some Ebrard, a brother of giants, who were sent, attacked so fiercely that they were soon forced to retreat. The cause of such great anger was that I had gone to Zurich. As if it were not allowed for me to be moved by the danger of a nearby church and to seek an appropriate remedy among brothers. Jodocus said threateningly that he knew what I had done with you. And I boasted that I had done nothing that was not worthy of my faith. But why should I recount to you the insolence and insults of both? So, in summary, know this: the two brothers, both very learned and serious and wise, were so struck that they thought they should leave early. Behold fraternal gentleness. However, it is worth mentioning a few words from which you may estimate the beginning and the end. At the very first meeting, instead of a greeting: Who stirred up these tragedies? When it was answered that they were known to have originated from Zebedee, then Ebrard exclaimed: Indeed, that good man, because he exposed your deceptions, is indignantly slandered by you. When the brothers asked to be shown those deceptions: We have, he said, the Bernese disputation, from which we judge you and all your things. I ask you, my dear Bullinger, if this is how it is to be done, what have we gained by shaking off the tyranny of the pope? Recognize also how apt was Jodocus's question: who called me to preach at Lausanne?</p>
      <p>Finally, to respond to the first with the last, the brothers were ordered to leave and take their Calvinism and Buceranism with them. And all this with almost furious rage and insane clamor. What harsher or more savage thing would you expect from the papists? But if we patiently endure this intemperance of raging, the Lord will not leave it unavenged.</p>
      <p>In Paris, and in many parts of the kingdom, the cruelty of the impious has been rekindled. The king himself proceeds in his fury. Thus is fulfilled that: without are fightings, within are fears. Although Jodocus not only stirs up fears within us but also open fights. But let our very small number spur us to union.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man and brother to be honored by me, together with your colleagues whom I wish all to be diligently greeted in my name. Also, many greetings to your wife and the whole family. May the Lord Jesus protect and guide you all. Amen. Little joyful news is announced about the state of Constance. May the Lord look upon them and deliver them from the jaws of the lion!</p>
      <p>Geneva, 6th day before the Kalends of July 1548.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>If it seems appropriate, you will rather suppress this letter among yourselves than let it ignite a greater fire in Bern; for the impotence of some is indeed remarkable.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, brother and most esteemed and dear fellow minister.</p>
