    <p xml:id="regest1">Was together with Fridolin Keller and Hans Schmid in Baden, where they were told how Thomas, the servant at the Rüden, wants to put his son as a monk into the Wettingen Monastery, which would be detrimental to the reputation of Zurich. Therefore, asks Bullinger to take action against it and to inform the Zurich council.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>My Master Heinrich, I want to inform you that Mr. Fridolin Keller, Mr. Hans von Dällikon, and I were in Baden on St. George's Day with the great council. We were earnestly informed by some from Zurich, who were on a trip to Baden, and thoroughly learned and understood that Thomas, the steward (manager) at the Rüden, intends to put his son into the Wettingen Monastery to make him a monk, and plans to have him wear the habit within eight days. This is entirely detrimental to the holy gospel, also contrary to our lords' mandates, detrimental to the city and country, and a scandalous outcry in Baden: "Look, look, those from Zurich are starting to put their sons into the monasteries. It will soon become something else, etc." Therefore, my Master Heinrich, let this disgraceful matter concern you, to oppose it and to inform our lords earnestly, etc.</p>
      <p>Given in haste, Friday after St. George's Day.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Michel Häcker, pastor in Buchs, your always willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the pious Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Grossmünster in Zurich, my dear friend and brother.</p>
