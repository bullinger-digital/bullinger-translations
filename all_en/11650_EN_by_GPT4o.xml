    <p xml:id="regest1">Can only write a little in haste; [Martin] Bucer has departed for Cologne to assist Archbishop [Hermann von Wied] with church reforms; may this endeavor succeed; Blarer suffers from his inadequacy and is weary of earthly life. Greetings. Finds no time to write to the deserving [Rudolf] Gwalther. Requests the return of the "Dialogus [Neobuli]" through [Gregor] Mangolt.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have no time to write much to you now, most esteemed Bullinger, except that Bucer left for the Archbishop of Cologne, who is an elector of the Holy Roman Empire, about a month and a half ago. The Archbishop has been contemplating and laboring over something evangelical for some time now, so we must rightly pray to the Lord that he does not bring forth something unfortunate or, as many do, produce something monstrous, with the purity of the word being tainted by Pharisaic and Papistic leaven. Ah, how today Christianity is exceedingly strange and prodigious among many, so far removed from its genuine and original sincerity, that neither Christ nor his apostles would recognize it if they were to return. May the Lord have mercy on us, whom you will intercede for with persistent prayers for me, a miserable and in many ways afflicted sinner, that He may take me away from myself entirely and restore me wholly to Himself and His most holy will. Oh, how miserable I am, who daily struggle with my flesh, so that I often almost despair, seeing myself so far removed from the character, diligence, labor, and zeal worthy of my function. Ah, my dearest brother, pray with me to the heavenly Father, that the most fervent love of His Son may ignite and consume this lukewarm heart of mine with its devouring flames, so that I may be a burning and shining lamp in His house. I am very weary of this life, since I see that I make no progress, or certainly very little, in subduing my flesh, in which there is nothing good, to say nothing of the grave whirlwinds and dangers of all things in our present time, which miserably exercise us, and which also so consume all good people that they anxiously look for a way to escape as soon as possible. Come, O Lord Jesus, and deliver us from evil! In Him, my brother, farewell well and perpetually. All of ours greet you; you are to greet for us the most learned and best men Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and Megander most carefully, and commend us to them diligently. My wife and I bid you and yours farewell. I would have written to Gwalther about us now, if it had been possible in any way through the many affairs that now press upon me. You will fulfill my part with the best man and dearest brother and bid him farewell in the words of a more than loving brother and mine; as soon as the duty allows, I will not be ungrateful with all the diligence I can. Farewell again and again, my heart and soul in the Lord. February 28, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer. I earnestly ask you to return that dialogue, which you know, through our Mangolt, and be careful not to forget it.</p>
