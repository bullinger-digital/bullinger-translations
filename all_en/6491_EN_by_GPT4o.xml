      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father and His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, etc. Since it is certain that nothing is more intolerable before God and pious men than ingratitude and treachery, for which reason, lest I myself be accused of this vice with the reproach of the Christian name, which God forbid, I have been anxious for a long time, most learned and excellent men, to pay your Excellencies the money for which I pledged my faith to you, which our Peter Sebastian Tarnow, while he was traveling there, had borrowed, namely forty Joachimsthalers, leaving a handwritten note in my hand with your Excellencies.</p>
      <p>But since I have been able to accomplish this by no means, as I wished, due to the lack of faithful and certain couriers, or at least to send letters to your Excellencies, now at last, indeed later than is proper, I send that very money and I have, give, and will continue to give thanks for this service and such great beneficence most worthy of Christian men, to your Excellencies. But so that I may be certain it has been delivered to your Excellencies, I would like to be informed by your Excellencies as soon as possible by letter.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I and the Christians here with me, entrusted to my care, will be mindful of such a great benefit both before God and men, as long as we live.</p>
      <p>We wish all your Excellencies to be well and happy. Amen.</p>
      <p>From the town of Radziejów in Poland, June 22, in the year 1565. Your Excellencies' most devoted Andreas Prażmowski, pastor of the church of Radziejów, by my own hand. To the most illustrious and learned men in the church of Zürich, most faithful ministers of the word of God, brothers and lords to be honored with the highest respect.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, Switzerland.</p>
