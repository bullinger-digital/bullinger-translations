      <p>Greetings. I received your letters with those miscellaneous news and the sad state of the churches of Christ, most esteemed man and eternally venerable father to all of us. I also shared this with the good people I knew, so that they might more fervently commend the afflicted crowd of the faithful in their prayers.</p>
      <p>I give you eternal thanks for your labor and care, which you kindly undertake for us in sending such matters. I wish the opportunity to repay this service would present itself soon. Our most esteemed council did not gladly hear that the controversy of the Rhaetians and especially the House of God has been placed in the arbitration of the bishop, whether he wants to wait until the Martin fair or not, as if this whole matter had not been unanimously postponed until now. And whatever the bishop has written to your people so far, he has done against the agreement and convention, and yet the whole matter is now placed in his arbitration by your most esteemed council and others (whom they so often call their most merciful lord). But what do these things concern me? I prefer to remain quiet and not involve myself in either party, especially since I am too weak to deal with these and other matters with any benefit. However, I am somewhat troubled when I hear of some offenses due to favor towards those who do not wish well to you or us from the heart. This is sudden.</p>
      <p>All greet you most dutifully, especially the consuls and Pontisella. We have no new private news from Italy.</p>
      <p>Your most submissive servant, Tobias Iconius. October 5, 1567.</p>
      <p>When I had finished this and communicated this news to Captain Carli, also greeting him in your name, he came to my house two hours before dawn to write something back to you and inform you.</p>
      <p>First, he reports, "that he has been secretly informed, both orally and in writing, that the entire apparatus and military preparations in France and elsewhere are intended for nothing other than for the sake of faith, to overthrow the churches and believers of Christ there and elsewhere. But to make it less noticeable, the queen has made the lords of Condé and Andelot, etc., who also led the war for us, the leaders over the troops, so that our people and the Swiss might be more easily brought down under the pretense of resisting and fearing the power of the Spaniard; and yet the Spaniard and the king together with the Guise (as is well known) are one, and they have secretly forged a plan together, as will follow.</p>
      <p>That it is a bloody plot against our religion must be inferred from the fact that now, under the aforementioned pretense, foreign soldiers have been brought into the country, whereupon the lord of Condé and Andelot, etc., have been deposed and are no longer leaders, but others; likewise, other Frenchmen have been accepted, and they are strengthening themselves, but those over whom these lords were set have also been granted leave. Thus, the leaders on our side have been removed from the board by Guise's cunning, whereby one must well perceive what else is hidden in the sack. And this plot, he says, has undoubtedly been made, as he and others were in France and helped seal and confirm our alliance with the king, where the Spaniards together with the Duke of Alba were present with great jubilation, where there were feasts and banquets, so that it seemed as if some barrels of gold were being distributed. Now, to further confirm this poor matter, Captain Wilhelm Travers writes from the camp (which is most certain, yet it is not our profession), he fears it is all about faith, if it takes long. Mr. Carolus also says that he recently spoke orally with the mayor of Freiburg, named Bärenman, who perhaps thought he was of his religion: 'Bet or I will wager with you, if it does not soon become different with the lord of Condé and Andelot, etc.' Mr. Carolus asked: [Why, how so?] He replied: [Because.] The king (without priests much more, with whom he is surrounded day and night like a brother of St. Jacob with shells) has decided by himself to issue a mandate that any prince who wants to obey him should sign this command; whoever does not do so, thereby one will recognize those who are ours, and against them one will proceed, etc. But so that, when the plot is revealed, no one may rely on the help of German princes, the Spaniard is constantly in strong preparation and is also strengthening himself powerfully from day to day, so that when the princes rise, he may sit in their nest as a neighbor. He also says that it is secretly trusted that one does not fear without reason, it is all just a pretense, what the Venetians are doing on behalf of the Turk and have now captured his envoy. It is all, one fears, directed there, so that they with their power, which they are preparing, also stand against the pope against us, while they otherwise hang behind everywhere. It is also certain that the Count of Schwarzenberg is being hired with 8000 horses by the Spaniard, so that heaven and earth may fall together as soon as one blows the trumpet. God comfort his own. These things, he says, have come to him in such a completely trusted way, as written before, that he must believe it, although it may turn out otherwise; I wish you all the best. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>As soon as the plot proves to be true a little more, he says, he will be with hands and feet to dissuade our soldiers by honor and oath.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and esteemed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most celebrated pastor of the church of Zurich, his most faithful lord, his revered father.</p>
