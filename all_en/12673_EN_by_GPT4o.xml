    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Apart from the news transmitted by the [Konstanz] council to the [Z端rich] council, there is nothing to report; moreover, Blarer does not always have messengers available. The [guild] master Hans [...] from Isny did not deliver Bullinger's letter and did not take his other letter with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] One must deal wisely with France and England to avoid provoking God further.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blarer is pleased to hear that the Z端rich council is taking strict action against the [Swiss] mercenaries [who misbehaved at F端ssen], as this can restore the good reputation [of the Swiss]. Especially the St. Gallers and their captains [Hans Blum, Ottmar Fridbolt, Christian Vogel, and Konrad Glintz] have behaved badly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger will have learned that there has still been no [proper] battle with the Emperor [Charles V]. However, during the last skirmish [on October 4th and 5th], there were more than 3000 casualties on both sides.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Upon withdrawing from their camp [near Wemding], the German mercenaries of the Emperor left [leaflets for the Schmalkaldic army] in several places, urging them to obey their rightful leader and to repent. [The enemy] leaves nothing untried to win over [the Schmalkaldic League]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] He has besieged the Palatine Lauingen, perhaps even already conquered it, and occupied all the bridges over the Danube, so that [the Schmalkaldic army] must march to the [southwest] located Ulm to cross the river and come to the aid of Augsburg, which the Emperor now threatens with a feigned siege, while in reality, he only intends to reach the [northeast] located cities of Ingolstadt and Regensburg unmolested. He is leading [the Schmalkaldic League] by the nose and probably using the services of traitors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Should the Emperor winter in Germany again (which he would only do for the sake of his brother [Ferdinand I]), he will probably set up his winter camp near Regensburg. However, Blarer is more inclined to believe that the Emperor will move to Italy. To better withdraw his troops, he distances himself from the [Schmalkaldic League]. His Italians are reluctant to be in Germany. Moreover, their wintering there would be very costly. But if he goes to Italy, he saves money because he can then furlough the Italian mercenaries and only keep the German mercenaries (who will be more loyal to him there than in Germany). He also knows well what will come his way in the spring, especially since the intentions of France and England are not hidden from him. Furthermore, should Pope [Paul III] distance himself from the Emperor or even die while he is in Germany, all of Italy could turn against him. Therefore, it would be more advantageous for the Emperor to spend the winter in Milan. In the spring, he could then recruit new Italian mercenaries and move to Germany with them, while leaving the German mercenaries in Italy to maintain order there. He could also easily retreat from Italy to Spain. However, if he stays in Germany, it would be to his disadvantage. For if, among other things, the Pope were to abandon him (especially financially), he would find himself in a very difficult situation because it would not be easy to bring money from Spain to Germany. In any case, God will probably continue to chastise [the Schmalkaldic League] with this enemy until they improve.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Hopefully, God will be able to achieve something with the newly mustered mercenaries by the [Schmalkaldic League], who are fewer and not as rowdy as the others [recruited during the summer]. For the previous large number of soldiers probably hindered God from accomplishing His work.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The Emperor will have pushed for the conquest of the pass [Ehrenberg] so that he can reach [Italy] all the better and more safely. Now [foreign] mercenaries are staging a maneuver at Bregenz so that the Emperor can retreat to Italy unnoticed. But as soon as he reaches the Adige, his troops at the pass and near Bregenz will cause a stir, only to cleverly disappear themselves without the negligent [Schmalkaldic League] noticing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] What will [the Schmalkaldic League] do afterwards? The Papists will certainly have reason to fear. May God have mercy on this rabble, which is now so confident of victory, when its ruin is imminent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Blarer is curious about the assembly [of the Protestant places in Z端rich]. May God grant it a peaceful outcome!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Bullinger should pray for him and send greetings to all good friends. [Thomas] Blarer and [Konrad Zwick] also send their regards.</p>

      <p>There is, dear lord and trusted brother, nothing with us except what has been written to you by ours to yours. The messengers (as eagerly as I desire it) are not always available to me; otherwise, I would write to you about everything I knew. Master Hans from Isny did not deliver your letter to me. He himself took your letter with him on the way. He says he wants to handle it properly and for the best. It is well arranged with him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>With France and England, we want to act as best as we can. God, the true father, may always prevent us from provoking Him further and from new things in His wrath. There is already too much of the old evil, etc.!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>That your lords act in such a manner against the mercenaries pleases us well, for thereby the bad reputation is restored when one sees how the authorities are inclined in such a case. The St. Gallers, especially the captains, have behaved very badly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding the battle with the Emperor, you will now know well that it is nothing. But the last skirmish has cost many lives on both sides. It is estimated that more than three thousand have remained on both sides. It is a serious jest!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The imperial German mercenaries, as they withdrew from their camp, left letters here and there, so that when ours came after, they would find and read them. In them, they admonish them very highly and urgently not to be against their rightful, orderly, and natural lords, considering their cause better, and what would eventually follow. For the Emperor will not relent and will put everything into it. They should return while the gate of grace is still open, and other such things. Thus, this people leaves nothing untried that might serve to make ours defect, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>So you know that he, the Emperor, has besieged the Palatine town of Lauingen, which is otherwise called Lobingen, and perhaps conquered it, and now all bridges over the Danube, so that ours must now march to Ulm to cross over; all this happens according to plan. For the Emperor aims to bring ours far up the Danube, so that he can safely come back down to Ingolstadt and Regensburg and they do not lie in his way. Therefore, he now pretends as if he wants to march to Augsburg and lets it be known as if he wants to besiege it, while he has nothing less in mind at this time. But these are his swift plans, with which he leads ours by the nose according to his will, as he has done so far and undoubtedly has had good treachery from ours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I firmly believe that the Emperor will have his winter camp in Regensburg and around there, if he wants to winter in Germany - which he would only do for the sake of his brother. But I am reluctant to believe it for many reasons, rather suspecting that he will aim for Italy. Therefore, he distances himself from ours, so that he can withdraw more safely, etc. The Italians are very restless and unwilling here. So a great cost would arise for him in the winter if he wanted to stay here. Otherwise, if he can enter stately, he can then furlough the Italians with grace and save great expenses, and keep the German mercenaries with him, whom he can trust better inside than outside. Also, he knows what he has to worry about in the coming spring, and the plans of France and England are not hidden from him. Should the Pope also fail him or (as is likely every day) die, and the Emperor not be in Italy, he would fall into great misfortune and all of Italy could defect (since it is already very peculiar inside), which is more convenient and less dangerous for him to go to Milan. There, I think, will be his winter oven. If it seems good to him in the coming spring, according to the situation of all things, to move out again, he will make fresh mercenaries inside and leave the German mercenaries inside, so that they offer their foreheads if any unrest arises inside, etc. If it does not seem good to him, he can then easily send himself back to his advantage, into Spain. But if he stays outside this winter (which I do not believe), he will certainly do it to his great, excellent misfortune. For he will have much, much to fear in the coming spring. Then the Pope can also leave him in hindering matters. Then he would be completely in the sack and shot, especially if he left him without money, since he cannot easily bring it from Spain. But, as with all this, God will probably continue to fret and exhaust us with this enemy, as has already happened to some extent, until we want to learn manners.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I hope that the fresh country folk, which are now being made anew, which are not so shameful and reckless, will put in honor, and God will let something be accomplished, however little it is, against the other crowd. For I cannot quite assure myself that this great heap will do anything together, while God cannot, as he usually does, perform his wonders in it. We truly lie in the way and err in it, so that he cannot come to his work. The matter must be advanced differently!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I think the Emperor has also pushed for the conquest of the pass again, so that no harm may meet him there and he may come in all the more safely. Likewise, the mercenaries at Bregenz are also looking for a move there, so that people here above are amazed and otherwise have less worry. But when withdrawing, as soon as the Emperor will have reached the Adige, one will see, then those at the pass and those at Bregenz will show an action and leave a stench behind them, especially since we handle things so negligently.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Well, if the Emperor withdraws from the land, I would like to see what ours will do about it! For all Papists will be very badly frightened, and their hearts will completely fall. God have mercy on this wretched rabble and enlighten them with his knowledge. They now glory and triumph in their mind. They want to think they have conquered everything; they do not know that their ruin is at the door.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I am eager to hear what the coming day will bring. God willing, that it will end well and peacefully in all things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Herewith entrusted to the Lord for the best. Pray with faith, and always, for me. Tell all good lords and friends many, many loves, services, goods, and greetings. My dear brother and cousin send you all love with good Christian services. Dated October 16, 1546. Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
