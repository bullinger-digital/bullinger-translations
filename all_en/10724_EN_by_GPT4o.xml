      <p>Grace and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>You may perhaps wonder, most learned man, why I have burdened you, who are occupied with more serious matters, with my importunate letters. But you will cease to wonder once you understand what has compelled me to write. You certainly know what has happened in recent days with the Anabaptists in the parish church of Laufen. Among their number was the bearer of this letter, who, although he did not swear to their beliefs, nevertheless hosted them and, driven by some madness, sometimes followed them until he was forced to recant with an attached monetary penalty, which he could by no means pay nor can he. This was the sole reason why he was forced to leave his young and uneducated children. For whom nothing remains except begging. For this reason, he asked me for letters of recommendation, hoping these would be beneficial to his misfortune. Although I abhor the madness of those people, I am prepared to exert all my strength to bring them back from their erroneous beginnings. Therefore, so that no opportunity is given to the man to further his madness, I have been asked to ask you, out of your innate benevolence, to ensure that he understands that my recommendation has been of some benefit to him, expecting a reward from God, since I cannot repay you. I would have written to some senators, whom I know to be very favorable to me, if I had not feared that the man, as is their custom, would return to his folly.</p>
      <p>With these, farewell most happily.</p>
      <p>Done in Schaffhausen, November 25, 1535.</p>
      <p>Ludwig Oechsli, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
