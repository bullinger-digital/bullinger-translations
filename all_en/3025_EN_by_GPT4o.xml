      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. I received the bundle sent by you, most excellent Bullinger, along with your letter dated September 12th. I sent it to our prince through Doctor Alexander Puer, at the same time recommending you in my letter, so that he may recognize an old friend. If he responds to you, you will receive the letters addressed to you through me shortly, or if in another way, you will understand, as I hope, that his spirit is not alienated from you. He is now cheerful and playful, having something to do. He congratulates himself on the future successor, if by the grace of God he survives, the majesty, namely that he was born from the leaves of the Chatti, etc. May it be fortunate and auspicious for both the church and us. I hear from those who were present at the contract and betrothal that it was ensured by written and signed letters that after the death of our prince, neither the Chatti nor Duke Christoph will dare to change even a little in the matter of religion among us, etc.</p>
      <p>We therefore congratulate both the church and ourselves, so that we are not forced to put a linen garment over a woolen one and make an outer garment from an undergarment, so to speak, and to sing evening prayers in Latin or alternately in Latin and German, and to change good hours into bad canonical hours or other superstitions, etc.</p>
      <p>Nothing new, except that arsonists in the territory of Hanau have consumed many houses and villages with voracious flames. Ferdinand is gathering foreign money against the force of the Turk and has pawned certain towns in the Austrian provinces among us. In Colmar, three prostitutes with an old mother abbess are kept captive in a dark prison. They have practiced strange witchcraft. Three skulls and other unknown things were found there, testifying to the murder of some people.</p>
      <p>Heinius will inform you of my health.</p>
      <p>Greet your family, Bibliander, Gualther, and the other fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Our people greet you. Farewell happily.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, September 28, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished doctor of Christ Jesus and still the bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, to the brother and lord to be respected.</p>
