    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer does not fully trust the admonished Joshua [Bullinger], who is delivering this letter, and therefore writes only a little. What his cousin [Konrad Zwick] recently negotiated with the [Zurich] mayor [Johannes] Haab, Zwick, who does not regret his journey [to Griesenberg], has communicated to Bullinger. - [Enclosure:] From the Diet [at Worms]: [Charles V.] insists on the extension of the Turkish aid, but has not been able to achieve anything so far. He will only approve the "Determinata" if the Council of Trent also decides on them. However, the [Protestants] insist on it; among them [Frederick II of the] Palatinate and [Hermann von Wied, Archbishop of] Cologne. [Joachim II of] Brandenburg might also join them. - At the [Diet], only Elector Frederick is present among the secular princes, and he has been there for three weeks. He has declared himself ready to give [Charles V.] an account of his faith and the distribution of the Eucharist in both kinds. - The two preachers in Worms [Leonhard Brunner and Hieronymus Brack] continue to preach, albeit under great danger. - [Charles V.] wants to make the Bishop of Augsburg [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] the Imperial Governor, which displeases [Frederick II of the] Palatinate. - [Charles V.] and Ferdinand I. have informed [the city of] Ravensburg through Count Hugo von Montfort[-Tettnang] and [Hans] Philipp Schad that they must furlough their two [evangelical] helpers [Konrad Konstanzer and Sebastian Kromer]. - [Ferdinand I.] has furloughed the bailiff of Ravensburg, [Hans Wilhelm von Laub]enberg zu Wagegg. One of his courtiers stayed in Konstanz. - [Paul III.] has sent [Charles V.] a large sum of money through [Cardinal Alessandro] Farnese.</p>

      <p>Here is Joshua, your nephew from your brother, whom I commend to you, so that you may encourage him to good conduct. I allowed him to leave with a small provision, and since I somewhat doubt his fidelity, I do not dare to write more to you through him. My cousin has faithfully reported what he recently negotiated with the mayor Haab, and he cannot regret his journey.</p>
      <p>News from the Diet.</p>
      <p>The Emperor insists earnestly that the collected money be distributed to all the estates of the empire and that the aid be approved for another 6 years; but he has not yet achieved any of this.</p>
      <p>He presses most urgently that they agree to the "Determinata" (as they call it), which the Council of Trent will conclude. However, our people refuse this outright. The two electors, Palatinate and Cologne, have also decided that they will not do it briefly. It is thought that Brandenburg will also oppose it; yet it is uncertain. There is no secular prince there except Elector Frederick. The elector has now been there for about three weeks; he is eager (zealous, courageous). He has reported to the Emperor that he is willing to give a full and thorough account of his faith and the distribution of the Eucharist in both kinds.</p>
      <p>The two preachers in Worms are still preaching in the city, although there has been strong pressure to stop them, and they must endure great danger and suffering because of it.</p>
      <p>The Emperor intends to appoint the Bishop of Augsburg, who has become a cardinal, as a governor in the empire; the Elector Palatinate will not concede this, because according to the imperial order, this office belongs to him.</p>
      <p>The Emperor and the King have informed the people of Ravensburg through Count Hugo von Montfort and Philipp Schad that they must dismiss their two helpers; they have taken time to consider this. The King has also given the bailiff of Ravensburg leave, so that he may deal with it with God. A very honorable nobleman from Laubenberg zu Wagegg has been here.</p>
      <p>Given on the 18th of June, 1545.</p>
      <p>Let us cry out to the Lord!</p>
      <p>The Pope has sent the Emperor a large sum of money as a gift through Cardinal Farnese.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his own. Zurich.</p>
