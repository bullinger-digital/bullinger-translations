      <p>S. Since the messenger is ready to depart, I cannot write much; as I have only just now been able to learn of my lords' decision. The messenger arrived on Friday; the letter was read on Saturday, but there were few council members present, so they told the messenger to wait until today. Thus, it was decided in a well-assembled council: since we had previously resolved before the cantonal councils and communities of the other places how we would conduct ourselves regarding the council, they thought it unnecessary to deliberate further on this matter; for otherwise, we would have to make a new decision every time a papal envoy arrives. They do not wish to do this; they wish to remain firm in their decision and therefore not attend the council, nor do they wish to trouble us, the servants, further in this matter. This is also roughly what is written to my lords in Zürich, and we, the servants, all generally think this is the best course of action; otherwise, we would never be at peace if we once deviated from this.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we thank you for your diligence and friendly correspondence, and if we were also required to give our response, we would have nothing else to say than what is generally elucidated in your reply and as we know those who hold the council are bound to the pope by oaths, that they do not wish to be present where anything might be discussed that could be detrimental to the Roman See, so we are obligated to our Lord Jesus Christ and wish, as much as the Lord grants us grace, to follow that we are not present where anything is undertaken and discussed that is contrary and detrimental to His glory and truth.</p>
      <p>I have no particular news at the moment that you do not already know. In a few days, I wish to be with you myself, God willing. If my lords had attended the council, I would have delayed; but since they did not, I hope to come sooner.</p>
      <p>With this, I commend you to God. We greet all the brothers in return. Dated Bern, July 13, 1551. Your willing Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dear lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
