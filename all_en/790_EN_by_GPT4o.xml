      <p>Greetings. I am sending to you a book on the origin of error, translated into French, which I would have sent earlier if a reliable messenger had been available. I regret that it was not printed in better characters; but this was done so that the book would be smaller and could be carried around more easily. For the printer is trying to accommodate the French people, for whom it is an unpardonable sin to be caught with such books. Regarding our affairs, the state of the church and school, and also your agreement, I will write at another time when I have more leisure, which I hope you will not disapprove of.</p>
      <p>All of ours send you their most dutiful greetings. Greet your colleagues and fellow ministers in my name. Farewell. Lausanne, the first of January, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Pierre Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zürich church, brother and most esteemed fellow minister.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
