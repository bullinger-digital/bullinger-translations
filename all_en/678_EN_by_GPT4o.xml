      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man in the Lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, the highest and most vigilant pastor, dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. It has pleased you, most learned Bullinger, and your most upright colleagues, to communicate this your and Calvin's harmonious confession, or rather agreement, to the ministers of the word of our church, and you request that our opinion and judgment on this matter be communicated to you. Although it is not necessary for us to testify this in writing. For you know that we do not differ in any of your doctrines of the Holy Scripture, which have been published and proclaimed in writing. Since the Scripture is harmonious, it is necessary that the interpretation be harmonious. In your mutual agreement and that of Calvin, everything is clearly expressed and there is no controversy. Although many malevolent detractors have proclaimed that Calvin, a faithful minister of Christ, has imbibed Bucer's spirit in the sacramentarian matter, especially in the last edition of the Institutes of the Christian Religion, which even good and learned men judge to have treated this matter rather perplexedly, now by the grace of Christ he has repented and now thinks well, who indeed among the pious, most learned Bullinger, would not most worthily praise, promote, approve, and agree with this mutual agreement, except those who are led by a spirit of vertigo? We confess with you that the sacraments do not confer grace, nor contain grace in themselves, nor do they exhibit what they signify, but they signify. Likewise, the sacraments are instruments, and certain visible forms that have outwardly the image of the thing that is worked inwardly by the spirit. Likewise, the eating of the flesh of Christ is none other than spiritual and of faith. For by faith we eat the body of Christ when we believe that the true body of Christ was given for our salvation, and his blood was shed for our cleansing: we acknowledge no other. And we confess that unbelievers partake only of the sign, but not of the thing itself, like Judas. Likewise: the words of the Lord, this is my body, are significant. For they take on the names of the things signified, like circumcision, covenant, paschal lamb, sacrifices, baptism. Here names are given to signs. Likewise, we confess that Christ, after the resurrection, ascended to heaven, left the earth in the truth of his body, now resides in heaven as in a place, and will not descend except for judgment, but by his power, by which he is Lord and Savior of all, he works and lives in all churches, especially in the action of the supper. Likewise: God and Christ, similar in substance to the Father, are to be worshipped not in bread but in heaven, as the heavenly teacher has prescribed the form of worship for us.</p>
      <p>We hold, profess, and testify this summary of your mutual agreement from a sincere heart before God and the whole world, all of us laboring in the word of the Lord in Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, most illustrious Bullinger, your memorial in the 3rd book of Kings: copied by me with the articles copied by our Jacob, we return with immortal thanks; for you have done a most pleasing and least regrettable thing, may the Lord repay all the benefits bestowed upon us with interest. As soon as you complete the 4th book of Kings by the grace of God, make sure I receive it through some faithful person; I will return it in good faith promptly. Farewell, and may what you are about to undertake in mutual agreement succeed happily. I beg you by Christian charity, do not be angry with me for the uncultivated lines written. Again, farewell in the Lord, my dearest Bullinger, with your most excellent colleagues, whom I greet most dutifully in the name of all of us, and always pray to the Lord for us, and have us and our church most commended to you perpetually.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, 17th September, Year 49.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Linggi. Yours most obediently from the heart.</p>
