      <p>Greetings. As soon as your letters were delivered to me, reverend father in Christ, (I received them on the first of January in the early morning), I thought no delay should be interposed, so I devoted all my efforts to ensure that our church would not suffer any harm.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I asked Mr. Tscharner, the consul, for he is now at the helm, through letters, to meet me at my home (for I have not gone out for eight days due to a cough and such hoarseness), which has completely blocked my voice.</p>
      <p>The consul was present.</p>
      <p>I explained the whole matter in his presence.</p>
      <p>Thus, we agreed among ourselves that he would call the senate from the pulpit and, by the common consent of all, instructions would be given to the guests, if any such person arrived, to make their judgment known to the consul, for the purpose that this old man would be brought before the Chur senate, for two main reasons: lest, if he had insinuated himself among the Italians, he would be expelled from there with difficulty, and secondly, lest anything inhumane would seem to be done, as he would be forced to go and return over the Alps with his wife and children at a time of year already unsuitable for travel.</p>
      <p>These things were done; but the old man is nowhere to be seen, and I hardly think he has passed through.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I thought, as the matter is and as we first thought Mr. colleague and I would do, that he had gone to Vergerius; he directed his journey to Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>About Dario and Camillo, I have already written to Mr. Zanchi and will write more.</p>
      <p>Our bishop received from Como not the complete acts of the council, but the last and penultimate sessions, the eighth and ninth, I mean.</p>
      <p>He sent them to me, as he had promised to do; I read them and sent them back.</p>
      <p>Most of them are very ridiculous, especially the decrees on marriage; I laughed at the absurdities of men; I copied the main points of the rest, while you have the complete ones.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Martinengo writes that he will send them shortly; he also noted down the main points of the decrees.</p>
      <p>As for the mention of the index, it is as follows: those fathers gave the task to certain persons to examine our books and to refer the heretics to a single index, which would later be published.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new besides this.</p>
      <p>I am sending Mr. Martinengo's letters and at the same time others addressed to you; I see that due to the negligence of the messengers, yours have been on the road for too long, and I doubt what fault caused this.</p>
      <p>If I find no one else, I give them to the carriers; they travel slowly and are sometimes more negligent, although they promise much and amply.</p>
      <p>I still retain your writings with me, until we are certain where Ochino has stayed.</p>
      <p>There were letters added concerning Julius, which were sent with Mr. Martinengo; I ask you to ensure they are delivered.</p>
      <p>We wish you all to be well and healthy for many years to come.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>Chur, January 3, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your observant Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
