      <p>God be with you, dearly beloved son. I have received your letter along with the beautiful and good gifts. I ask you to thank my gracious lord and brother-in-law, the bailiff, in the most friendly manner, with the assurance that I wish to deserve all of it, as much as possible, etc. Tomorrow night, God willing, both mayors will dine with me, the city clerk, Junker Jakob RÃ¶ist, the lord of Kyburg, Thoman, brother-in-law Walthart, etc.</p>
      <p>And since you are coming home on Friday, I will refrain from writing further about what I have from France and elsewhere, marvels. Greet Susanna, Elsbethli, etc., for me. All my people greet you. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given on Wednesday after Magdalene around 10 at night, 1567.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, preacher at Berg.</p>
