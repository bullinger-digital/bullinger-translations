      <p>Pious, honorable, etc.</p>
      <p>My willing service and all good things be with you from me at all times, etc.</p>
      <p>What I have, I have listed herein, also the peace, printed at the Palatinate in Heidelberg, from where it was sent to me; for the Landgrave of Hesse once again sent a messenger to me with several questions about religion for an answer; he traveled through the Palatinate and also brought me a letter from there, etc.</p>
      <p>When you have read the peace, send it back to me in over 8 days.</p>
      <p>It is otherwise said for certain (I do not know if it is certain) that the Confederates have dismissed Ludwig Pfiffer or some other leaders to turn something concerning the king himself, and when they were let into the hall, they saw Conde sitting on the royal throne as the king's majesty's deputy.</p>
      <p>This is said to have amazed them and brought them sorrow, etc.</p>
      <p>Whether it is true or not, they have now seen how they oppressed the Condé with their wars, etc.</p>
      <p>So good is God and so powerful, He does not allow Himself to be overcome by any arrogance.</p>
      <p>Now all sorts of news are also coming, written on April 3rd in Rome, April 12th in Venice, and April 20th in Milan.</p>
      <p>They are strange matters; God will make it well.</p>
      <p>I have no more time to write; take it for good, and may God be with you.</p>
      <p>Greet the good gentlemen and friends for me.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, May 7, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours at all times, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable Joachim Bäldi, former Landammann of Glarus, my kind, dear lord.</p>
