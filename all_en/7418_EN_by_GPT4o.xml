      <p>Greetings. If I did not consider you, most humane lord father, both by nature and long experience to be tireless and most patient of all troubles, I would not trouble you with my very frequent letters. Although I know how impudently I act, and how often I distract you from more serious matters beyond what is proper and my duty. However, I humbly ask that you kindly consider these things I write, since they come from a mind not ill-intentioned, but eager to learn and most loving of you. Recently, I wrote about a bundle of letters that flew to our legate through his courier. Today, Lord Karl approached me and explained to me from the mouth of both the legate and the interpreter the content of those letters: The King of Spain has miserably complained in letters to the French about the criminal intent of his son Karl, that he came led by 60 men to his father and had a small bomb under his cloak for the purpose of parricide; however, before he could undertake the crime, the plot was discovered. All were captured, and among the accomplices of the crime, one was flayed alive, another cut into four parts, another subjected to another kind of punishment, etc. As for his son Karl, it was decreed that he should be bled 2 pounds, then walled up and deprived of light forever.</p>
      <p>There is various discussion about this punishment or rather about the deed itself. For it is known that Karl is not opposed to the evangelical cause and the Christian princes in Spain. Hence the Pope fears something; under such a pretext of parricide, he wishes to remove this prince from the midst, lest anything in the future might hinder his plans, etc. Thus they also defame the Count of Condé as a rebel and aspiring to the throne, so that under this pretext they may overthrow such a support of truth, etc. - Then they affirmed that the French severely warned the Scots to immediately release the Queen of Scots detained for robbery; but the Scots not only disregarded this song or crowing of the French, but also thought of murdering the queen and, unless their spirits deceive them, have already punished her with death. Thirdly, it was written that the Queen of England has renounced Karl of Austria and has already chosen an Englishman as her king and husband. - Moreover, the Turks have written to their brother, our legate, not to be surprised if he receives rare letters from him; for he is following the Turkish court, which is solely focused on recovering the provinces of Arabia and Egypt, which have defected from him, and to this end, the Emperor of the Turks is now striving with all his might, etc. - As for the balls intercepted by the elector, they say they belonged to Genoese merchants; and that they received money wrapped in various kinds of silk from the Spaniard, namely 100,000 and 50,000 crowns or luterem gold and regäl, all of which they will take care of as best as possible and perhaps from the lease for a certain sum of money, which the merchants themselves will be forced to return with the rest. These are the things with which I did not want to trouble you at present. May Lord Jesus always preserve you for us, lively and unharmed. Amen.</p>
      <p>Quickly. Chur, March 16, 1568.</p>
      <p>All good men here cannot sufficiently marvel that your most ample council denied their just service to Lord Vogler in the case he has here. He requested an advocate from you; this was denied to him. He requested at his own expense; but most of you distrust. But there is no need for distrust regarding the present controversy he has with Karl, our mint master; for he has now requested a delay anew and seeks ways to escape not without great bribes.</p>
      <p>Vogler wishes to conduct this case of his, which is plainly just, in the most upright manner. In such violent attacks by the adversary mint master, he deserved to be helped; but when the tree falls, anyone gathers wood.</p>
      <p>To the most ample man Lord Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the Church of Zurich, his lord most worthy of perpetual fidelity.</p>
