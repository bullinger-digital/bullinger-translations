    <p xml:id="regest1">Comte feels strengthened by Bullinger's concerned participation; he would have preferred to die with his own, but the Lord allows him to bear a part of the burdens that the Church has to endure. - Bullinger should comfort the father and the other survivors of the deceased young Zürcher Jakob Kriech, whom Comte had taken in and trained on Bullinger's recommendation. - Comte will eagerly read Bullinger's ["Brevis ἀντιβολή"]. In the meantime, he would also like to review Cochläus' ["De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae autoritate"] and ["Replica brevis"] in order to gain more benefit from Bullinger's ["Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio" and "Brevis ἀντιβολή"]. The messenger [Jakob...] should bring the books for payment. - Comte is pleased with Bullinger's request for the translation of the writing ["Warhaffte Bekanntnuß"] against Luther into French. However, he is also aware of Luther's [significance] and the current social and political conditions. Therefore, the greatest caution must be exercised. Comte leaves everything to Bullinger's wisdom and judgment. - Greetings to all colleagues.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I am truly very refreshed when I understand that I, a man of no importance and almost a worm of the earth, am of concern to a man who today is either the foremost among Christian scholars or has very few equals. May Jesus Christ always preserve and even increase this affection of charity in you until you grow into that perfect man. Therefore, I am still here, venerable Antistes, and the Lord did not wish to take me away along with my own, evidently so that I might still bear some part of the labors that exercise the Church of Christ, fighting in this bloody and mortal arena, although I would have much preferred to fall asleep with my own. But it was not seen fit by the Lord, who, since he even has the hairs of our head numbered, does nothing concerning us without his wonderful and eternally to be adored providence. To him, therefore, be honor and glory and thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, among my own, whose falling asleep in the Lord I remember, is also Jakob Kriech, that young Zürcher, whom you so diligently recommended to me, and whom I so carefully and dutifully took care to nurture and educate. Therefore, I earnestly beg you, since these are also your responsibilities, to console the father of the young man and his other relatives; but now grief does not allow me to write more about him.</p>
      <p>I will read your second response to Cochläus as eagerly as I am accustomed to marvel greatly at all your writings; then I will write back to you, as the Lord will grant me concerning both. In the meantime, I am very eager to see the earlier book and Cochläus' "Replica" with you, so that by diligently comparing matters from both sides, I may later be able to gather greater benefit from the reading of your writings. Therefore, you will arrange this for my sake, so that this messenger of mine may bring those books to me, to whom I have also instructed to pay the price.</p>
      <p>As for what you ask, that I translate into French what you write in German about the Lord's Supper to Luther, I am very glad; for I desire nothing more than for all your writings, truly pious and learned, to become known to more people, although I think it should not be neglected who Luther is, what the customs of our age are, what the plans of the princes are, what the state of the republics is, how varied and different the opinions of those who even boast of the known truth of the gospel are: one says, another denies, and a third thinks it should be put into deliberation.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I think the greatest caution must be applied in handling this whole matter, especially since it is of such importance that you will find none equally great today in the entire Christian republic. But let all these things be entrusted to your singular prudence and judgment.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily and well, Antistes, always to be respected by me. Lausanne, 9th day before the calends of February 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours by vow, B. Comte Donzarensis.</p>
      <p>I greet all your colleagues, always to be admired for their doctrine and piety, in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most learned, most serious, and most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a man and lord always to be honored by me.</p>
