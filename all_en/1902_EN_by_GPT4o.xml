      <p>Greetings. On the day your letters reached me, I was so tormented by pain and fever that, by the doctor's order, it was a disservice to my servants if they reported even the smallest matters to me.</p>
      <p>After I began to recover gradually from that long illness, though I cannot say I have fully recovered, I read the letters from my friends, among which yours delighted me greatly. For I am devoted to you not only for your learning and piety but also because you show favor to our affairs by publishing certain booklets under my king's name and by writing private letters. I wish, however, that some opportunity may be given to me, by which you may find that what I assure you in words is indeed true in action. You will forgive me if, with my health not yet fully restored, I respond so briefly to your most delightful letters, and if, perhaps, I am delayed by so many engagements, you will call upon me to repay with interest what I now promise. - I am very sorry to hear of Philipp Melanchthon's passing. I lived very closely with him in Wittenberg fifteen years ago, and although I was never his student, I benefited so much from his advice and companionship that I always regarded him as a teacher. I see that the Wittenberg school, unless supported from elsewhere, will soon collapse. I wish that this otherwise great man had stood more firmly in the final act of his life, having cast aside the terrors of astrology, although he had endured so much misery and indignity that the once vigorous and lively Philipp was no more. - Regarding Duke Moritz and the other princes, although I have learned from experience that nothing is so absurd that it cannot be believed about them, I do not think it will happen that they will plot against my king with such a servile scheme; indeed, my dear Bullinger, I free you from all fear concerning this matter. That robber Albert will do what he can; but we are not lacking in strength to resist, and I am encouraged by the rumor of the emperor's death. I see that the letter has grown longer than it should, and I am weary from writing in such a state of mental weakness. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur, 14 days before the Kalends of July. Johannes Fraxineus, Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>"From Johannes Fraxineus, Bishop of Bayonne, a French envoy to the Rhaetians."</p>
