      <p> As I previously suggested a deadline of 14 days to your honorable wisdom, within which I might provide a final answer, an honorable council of my lords from Zurich has decided: since I am bound to them by oath, coming from Kappel, I should remain silent and say nothing until further notice. Meanwhile, both councils have unanimously elected me as their preacher in place of the late Master Huldrych Zwingli. I hereby inform your wisdom of this, so that you are not further delayed, and I also express my highest thanks to you, honorable and wise lords, for your loyalty and love, which you have shown to me. I will never forget this day and your kindness. I also humbly ask you, gracious lords, to kindly consider this letter as my recommendation for my position; for he was a parish priest in Bremgarten, conducted himself honorably and appropriately, and is also well-informed and learned in the matters of God, so that you will always be well provided with him. </p>
      <p> Herewith etc. </p>
