      <p> Greetings. I have already received three letters from you, dear brother, and I do not think it necessary to respond to each one individually, nor do I have the leisure; therefore, please accept the brevity. First of all, I thank you, the honorable councilors, and Mr. Bonet for your diligence and labors. I also ask you to convey my congratulations to the newlyweds as warmly as possible and to wish them blessings from the Lord, and to greet them as familiarly as possible. What the magistrates of Basel wrote extensively to our magistrate, I have summarized briefly and sent to you, but with the condition that you return this paper after 8 or 14 days. Besides that, we have no certain news, except that those who come from Geneva and Bern affirm that Lyon is besieged by Mr. d'Assier and Movano and is being heavily attacked. But whether this is true or false, I cannot say. You will soon have a clear understanding; for some of your men, about 7, passed through here the day before yesterday. They say they come from the first Confederates and that more will come; they have moved from Zug to Lorraine after Christmas. When asked if a battle has taken place, they would neither confirm nor deny. They are like beggars, not having a penny, and are very miserable. They speak of miserable conditions and that they are not paid. Yet nothing certain can be extracted from them; they quickly depart. I think it will soon be the case that the impudence and bold and reckless confidence of the interpreter will be confounded and restrained. Time brings roses. You will greet the three councilors, Mr. Karl, Mr. Pontasella, and other friends, including Ganthner. </p>
      <p> What [is the matter, that Vogler and Wisenbach are disputing... I do not] understand and with [whom] they have [a dispute] etc. I wrote this in great haste. </p>
      <p> Farewell forever with all the pious. </p>
      <p> January 9, 1568. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my lord and dearest brother. </p>
      <p> Chur. </p>
