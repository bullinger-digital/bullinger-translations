      <p>Greetings. Since I am now thinking about giving some response to Brenz, I write less frequently and briefly. You will forgive me for this; for my strength is daily declining, and the sorrows from public calamities do not allow me to do what I once could. Nevertheless, you should continue to write letters frequently as usual. If anything is absolutely necessary, I will write diligently, God willing.</p>
      <p>On the 7th, a proposal was made: if the four powers, the Pope, the Emperor, the French, and the Spanish, accept the Council of Trent, the five places are hopeful that the people of Glarus will also accept it according to their previous promise, and if there is any dispute in this matter, it should be resolved according to the terms of the alliance. The four places have accepted it: Schwyz does not want to accept it, but demands that as soon as the council is convened, Glarus should dismiss their preachers and accept the old faith. On June 24th, the people of Glarus held a meeting and agreed: "They want nothing to do with the council, therefore no one should hope for them to accept it; but whatever else, reserving their faith, they are willing to be found doing, and they demand to be protected by the law. The four places say they do not want to force them from their faith, only to deal fully with their unrest. The proposal says there is no danger; for their previous promise means nothing more than that if the common Confederates accept a council, they will not separate. The people of Glarus demand whether Zurich and Bern will advise and protect them if anything happens to them because of this. Messengers have ridden to Zurich and Bern to seek more support. Tomorrow the citizens will meet here about this. I pray to God that what is found will be good and right. The plan is: as soon as the middle ground is accepted, the people of Glarus will be reinstated; if the people of Schwyz do not agree, they will be reminded according to the alliance that they should support Glarus according to the law of the alliance, etc.</p>
      <p>Thus we wait to see how it will go, full of anxiety. Therefore, you too pray to the Lord; for we are in the world and among the children of this age; unless the Lord helps us with His mercy, some evil is to be feared; but not in vain; what we have not deserved, we will still deserve. The hail and storms have terribly ravaged Lucerne, Schwyz, Zug, and have also struck badly in Meilen, Mur, and around there. May God grant us a merciful end.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>I received these letters through Gassentzer here, he came from Heidelberg, etc. The last day of June 1564.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you. Send back to Beza soon. Yours always.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
