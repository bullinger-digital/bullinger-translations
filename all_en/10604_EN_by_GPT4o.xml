    <p xml:id="regest1">Against the machinations of the Catholic cantons and for the preservation of the Reformed faith, a closer alliance of the cities, especially Bern and Zurich, is urgently necessary. Many believe that an initiative in Zurich would be fruitful, while others think a later time would be more suitable, when Bern is no longer in distress over the Geneva matter. Sensible people now advise Bern to document the threats and machinations, then a delegation in Zurich could achieve much. This delegation should then present something like the following: Because people have the right to remain in their true faith, but because federal and peace treaties do not guarantee anything in matters of faith and the eight Catholic cantons have allied, it would be useful and right for Zurich and Bern to support each other; should the Zurich council have concerns in view of the intrigues of the Emperor and Catholic princes, it should bring the proposal to the rural population. However, if Bern is attacked beforehand because of Geneva or other matters, it should call upon Zurich as fellow believers for help with a delegation. Many [in Zurich] stand for the word of God and the fatherland, will not abandon the city of Bern, and will advocate for the old unity.</p>

      <p>How highly necessary are unity, loyalty, love, and friendship among the cities, lands, people, and estates that have accepted the Gospel of Christ, as long as the practices, deceptions, and schemes of those who protect the cursed papacy of God continue. For we can perceive from their conspiracies and agreements what they have undertaken against the truth, against pious, honorable, upright people, and all authority. Therefore, it is only fair to oppose them so that the truth may remain among us, and discipline and honor may be planted. However, their splendor, deceit, and wantonness grow, binding them to the wicked, while those attached to the truth are divided among them. Therefore, it is highly necessary that the cities adhering to the Gospel, especially Zurich and Bern, make agreements, friendships, and unity with each other, so that the opposition may feel some heartache and the truth may prevail.</p>
      <p>However, whether at this time something of this kind should be brought to Zurich, many good-hearted people believe it would not be unfruitful, while many others think it might be more appropriate at another time; namely, when the honorable city of Bern is not in such danger as it is now with Geneva, so that the adversaries cannot claim that they are only being sought when needed, etc.</p>
      <p>Many good-hearted, honest people now believe that if it were heard that the Emperor was coming to the land, and in the meantime, one also took note of the deceptions and practices, what was thoroughly and specifically found, recorded, and then a brave delegation from Bern sent to Zurich, much good could be achieved and obtained from such a command.</p>
      <p>The delegation might present the following opinion for the common faith and common welfare: Since it is the duty of pious, upright people to plant divine truth, discipline, and honor, to protect and maintain wives and children, indeed the descendants, in honor and truth, and since alliances and peace treaties do not particularly bind in matters of faith, and the five places, Fribourg, Solothurn, and the Valais have a special understanding, what each party should and could assure the other - it is useful, good, and fair, since Bern and Zurich are of one faith, to decide what each party should assure the other.</p>
      <p>However, since great schemes and dangers are associated with the faith, where some points, as mentioned above, from the Emperor and practices of the Catholic princes, the nobility, and papal intentions might be brought, and if an honorable council of Zurich would not like to open up for itself, that this should then be brought before the rural population, in good hope that the rural population, favorable to the Bern authorities, would give a brave, honest answer.</p>
      <p>However, if in the meantime, before this could be brought, a city like Bern were attacked because of Geneva or other matters, it would be considered good, also by good-hearted people, if a brave delegation were sent down to inform a city like Zurich of the situation and to urge that a loyal watch be kept over the Bernese territory, to protect and rescue those who come into danger.</p>
      <p>Since Bern seeks nothing else in this matter than the honor of God and the fatherland, etc.</p>
      <p>There are many honest, upright people who will faithfully support everything that serves to promote God's word and to preserve the fatherland, and will not depart from an honorable city like Bern, also helping and advising how, over time, through suitable means, old unity and loyalty may be renewed.</p>
