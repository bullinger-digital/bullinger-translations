    <p xml:id="regest1">Rümlang has not written to Bullinger for so long because he did not want to burden him with the great disputes within the Bernese [Church].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Only God knows what efforts Rümlang has undertaken [in the fight against the Lutheran party of Bern]! He himself cannot put into words how many humiliations he has endured (to the amazement of not a few!) to protect the innocent youth with all his might from the untenable [Lutheran] falsehoods.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[Simon Sulzer, Beat Gering, and Konrad Schmid] had resolutely set out to banish the Zwinglian doctrine from the Bernese schools. They resisted Rümlang at the beginning of his [tenure as headmaster at the Bernese Barfüßer College] because he rejected many of their [Lutheran] sophistries in the German schools as well as in the Latin school, by undoing [Martin Bucer's interventions] in the children's catechism of [Kaspar Megander]. And when [Sulzer, Gering, and Schmid] preached divergent falsehoods [to the children] from the pulpit during the [Bernese Disputation], Rümlang opposed them so that the Christian truth would at least be preserved among the youth!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The [Lutheran pastors] insisted that Rümlang be forbidden to teach about the sacraments. However, he could always count on the support of the Bernese council. After all, he was appointed by them as headmaster to rebuild the Bernese [school] that lay in ruins! Therefore, he used every opportunity during his lectures to drive out the [Lutheran] heresy from the youth, especially when he suspected he was being eavesdropped on [by Sulzer's, Gering's, and Schmid's followers]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">He also often protected his colleague Nikolaus Pfister from the frequent hostilities [of the Lutheran pastors] and did not allow them to drive a wedge between the two of them. He had seen through their cunning! When they realized they could do nothing against this solidarity, they became bolder and even accused Rümlang and Pfister before the Bernese council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">They regretted that they could not prevent the dismissal of the two Zofingen pastors [Johannes Ulrich Göppel and Benedikt Schürmeister], whom they had incited to Bucer's heresy. They were also annoyed by the Bernese council's decision that they could henceforth only examine the orthodoxy of candidates for a pastoral position in the presence of the Bernese schoolmasters and recommend them to the council. When they could no longer achieve anything in Bern itself, they convinced many [pastors] in the Bernese countryside of their [heresy]. Rümlang now intends to summon these [misguided pastoral colleagues] to disputations to easily bring them back to the right path.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">In Lausanne, too, Bucer's view gained entry into the local school through the influence of Johannes Calvin. The Lausanne [pastors and scholars] were instructed by the Bernese council to justify in writing those of the Lausanne theses that appeared suspicious to Jodocus Kilchmeyer, Johannes Wäber, Pfister, and Rümlang. They translated their explanations into German and presented them to the council, which feared, due to the numerous Bible passages cited therein, that the [aforementioned Zwinglians] might not be able to completely refute the arguments. Nevertheless, it was decided that Kilchmeyer, Wäber, Pfister, and Rümlang should examine and assess these statements carefully: They rejected them as lies and deceit! Sulzer, Gering, and Schmid protested loudly and asserted the agreement of these theses with biblical doctrine. However, Kilchmeyer, Wäber, Pfister, and Rümlang did not respond immediately as usual. Instead, they were commissioned by the Bernese council to present their written judgment in the presence of all [pastors]. And so it happened.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Rümlang, on behalf of the Zwinglian party, prepared a corresponding refutation in which he clearly exposed the errors and the incorrectly used Bible quotes of the Lutheran party in the necessary detail. Everyone should clearly recognize their deceptions! Rümlang did not hold back with words, as much was at stake not only for both [parties] but especially for the truth of the Gospel. His arguments were well received.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">The negotiation was conducted with great seriousness, which is why the Small Council of Bern took two days for it despite its many tasks. Subsequently, the matter was discussed just as long before the Bernese Great Council: The council wanted to put an end to this dispute. Fortunately, the truth prevailed! When the Bernese councilors recognized the cunning of [Gering, Sulzer, and Schmid], their patience was exhausted. Angrily, they dismissed the [three] from their offices because they had violated [the Bernese Disputation].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">When Rümlang travels to [Zurich] at Pentecost, he will bring the writings of both parties. However, Bullinger can already learn more about these events from the Bernese envoy [Hans Rudolf Graffenried].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">Bullinger should now advocate for Johannes Haller to be sent to Bern. This would strengthen the bond between Bern and Zurich and ensure that the Bernese church recovers through [Haller's] beneficial work. Rümlang cannot express in words how necessary this is! He does not want to receive baseless excuses [for a rejection of Haller's appointment], especially since, as a Bernese compatriot, he is obliged to obey the Bernese council. They mean him no harm, especially since the Bernese, like the Zurichers, belong to the Lord. The Zurichers should not only consider what they owe to everyone but especially what they owe to God and the Bernese in this request.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">All of Bern longs for Haller! Everyone already wished for him [in October 1547] when the Bernese made their first request and were therefore very disappointed by the rejection of the Zurichers. In view of the difficult situation [of their church], the Bernese (just like the Augsburgers [in November 1545]!) want to receive [Haller as pastor] and thus ask again with hope [for Haller's dispatch to Bern]. Bullinger should therefore advocate for his dispatch to Bern. This will also benefit the Zurichers! The Zurich [pastors] should not only consider the here and now but view the request from a high vantage point! The anticipation of the new preacher will indeed eliminate the bitterness of the [Lutheran Bernese] who still need to be won over for the Gospel. Should the Zurich council reject the dispatch, the Zurich [pastors and scholars] must make it clear to them that it would promote God's work. It is God's will that the Bernese church (as before) can only be restored with the help of the Zurichers! God will richly reward the Zurichers, especially since the Bernese will be completely devoted to them in their gratitude.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">Jodocus Kilchmeyer, who has not received Bullinger's letter [due to his preaching activities], has no time to respond. However, he sends the following message to Bullinger: The Zurichers should promote harmony with the Bernese and support it by sending Haller. They should also treat the Bernese as themselves so that they become one community. [Thus far Kilchmeyer].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">The Bernese are recommended to the Zurichers! Greetings and best wishes to Bullinger and his family.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord God. May it abound in all heavenly knowledge! Amen. Most vigilant and upright patron and brother, dearest Bullinger, the reason I have not written to you for so long is that I did not want to make you more troubled with our rather unfortunate disputes, which I knew would most bitterly disturb and vex your candid and gentle heart.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I cannot express in words how many sighs and groans it has extorted from me to see the truth endangered. God knows. However, I am certain that I have cast myself into the utmost and most abject humility, not without the admiration of many, and have thrown myself down into the very dust, so that at least the innocence of the youth, as much as could be preserved by my efforts, might be vindicated from these evasions and vain deceits.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>With brazen foreheads, they had impudently resolved to banish the truth from the schools in the manner of Julian. At the outset of my tenure, they resisted me because I had undertaken to purge the catechism, where they first sensed that I was refuting many of their futile and feeble arguments in German and Latin, namely in the German public schools and the Latin school. I did not want the public confession of the whole truth to be lost, and although they thundered vanities from the pulpit, the truth was nevertheless preserved among the tender youth and the young plants of the church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>They pressed that I be forbidden to teach about the sacraments. However, the prudent magistrate, who was well aware of my simplicity and integrity, and who had also appointed me to the school so that, as much as was possible through me, I might restore the fallen and repair the ruins, was always favorable to me and stood by me. Therefore, I confidently used every means to completely uproot and eradicate the ingrained cunning opinion from the youth, and that openly in lectures, and even more so if there was suspicion that listeners were present.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>They often mistreated my colleague Nikolaus, a faithful and honest man, whom I defended more than once, from whom they often tried with cunning to alienate me. But having detected the deceit, I did not want to concede anything to them. Therefore, after they sensed our constancy (which they succumbed to), they completely despaired, so that their rashness or insolence turned into extreme and savage rage, so that they were not ashamed nor did they hesitate to openly attack the magistrate and us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>They were indeed grieved that those whom they had incited and spurred on to Bucerism could not be preserved from being deposed by the ministry. Furthermore, they were very displeased that the right of calling, promoting, and examining was taken from them unless we, the schoolmasters, were present, and that they had to present no one to the senate unless approved by our vote. Therefore, when their cunning was circumvented by us, and they could achieve nothing, they attempted it in the countryside, where they infected many not without success. However, I will write to them and arrange disputations, and I will easily reconcile them, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Indeed, the people of Lausanne, not without Calvin's suggestion, had also introduced Bucerism into the school. After the senate discovered this, the people of Lausanne were compelled to substantiate the conclusions, which we had set aside as suspect, with proofs that they could confidently defend. This was then translated by us into German and heard by the magistrate, who was indeed gravely offended that so many passages of Scripture were cited. He also feared that we might perhaps not suffice to refute all of them! However, the decision prevailed that we should examine everything and, after weighing each one, either approve or disapprove with our vote. Dr. Jodocus, Weber, Nikolaus, and I rejected them as spurious and false. Sulzer, Battus, and Conrad approved them with wondrous praises, claiming they exuded nothing but genuine and very Scripture itself, and wondered why we opposed them. However, we reserved our judgments, who always hasten our judgments! But we were ordered to report our opinions in writing to the senate, with all of us present. We did so.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I did what I could on our part. For this task was assigned to me. After the business was completed and the refutation, which was quite extensive (though I did not want to issue a more concise one unless it was more intricate), was expedited and heard, it was approved. In it, I wanted the fallacies and truncated sentences of Scripture to be openly exposed, so that even the more ignorant might grasp all the deceit. For the greatest danger threatened either side, rather the evangelical truth. Therefore, words were not to be spared.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Finally, we ourselves were heard, and all the writings with the utmost seriousness. For the senate, in its greatest occupations, devoted no less than two days to this matter, and afterward, the same cause was similarly handled for so many days by the diacosii, as they desired with all their studies and efforts to have this contention removed. The truth prevailed (rejoice!) and falsehood was confounded and fell. The pious magistrate perceived all the deceit. Therefore, he was incensed against them, and his patience, often injured, was almost reduced to fury! Therefore, they were deposed from the ministry as traitors and perjurers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I will bring with me all the business of both parties at Pentecost, God willing. Our envoy will recount and report everything to you more precisely, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Now, may you be willing to be present in Bern! The people of Zurich cannot be bound and obliged to our hearts with a greater benefit than this, which we demand. Ensure that we do not suffer rejection, so that the wounded minds among us may be gently treated and healed with pious remedies. Indeed, there is more necessity in this matter than I can express in words. I do not want to hear common and frivolous, not to say childish or uncivil, excuses. We have educated; we must be obeyed! We desire peace for him. You are all lords and we are yours. Consider rather what you owe not only to all but particularly and especially to God and to us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>For we all ask for Haller: the nobles and the common people together. His name has been esteemed among us since the previous request, and it was quite painful that we were not heard. We do not want to be postponed by the Augsburgers, especially with much greater danger imminent, and therefore we ask again earnestly, promising and hoping for success for ourselves. If we are safe, it will also redound to you. Urge that he may migrate from you to us! Do not feel with the common people, who only regard the present. You, being prudent, weigh this matter more deeply through all circumstances! Endow us with this victory achieved! With this joy in hearing the new preacher, the bitterness of those who still have ill will among themselves will be eliminated. You all learned ones, approach your magistrate, who, even if he would refuse, at least persuade him, so that God's business may be promoted. God wills that our affairs, as before, so now, cannot be restored without you and your assistance. You will receive from God an abundant reward, unbeknownst to you, and we will be rendered to you most devoted and ready for all your services.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Dr. Jodocus received your letters, in whose name I also write this to you, who is now occupied with sermons: Ensure that Zurich and Bern are one church! Help our labors! Support them so that they may be more and more advanced every day! This will happen if you do not deny Haller. Ensure that those who are yours are also ours! Ensure that the same right is in us, which is granted to you in yourselves! From this, it will happen that you will be ours and we yours, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Have us commended and be safe with all your family. Farewell. Given hastily, April 28, in the year, etc., 48.</p>
      <p>Yours truly devoted, Eb. von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant, learned, and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, primary ecclesiastic of Zurich, his brother in Christ and always to be respected lord and patron. Zurich.</p>
