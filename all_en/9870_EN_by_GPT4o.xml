      <p>Greetings. It does not seem necessary to me that all examiners be convened, as the work of only a few days is required. And as for me, I would like you to decide with Mr. Haller about sending someone there today, so that he may begin the journey at dawn tomorrow; for the days are now short, and the journey is quite long. And it would be preferable for the one who is sent not to arrive there on Saturday night, but, if possible, at least around noon, so that he can speak with Isaak, consult about giving the sermon, and prepare himself for it.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gwalther.</p>
