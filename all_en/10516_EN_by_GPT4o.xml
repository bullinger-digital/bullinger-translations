    <p xml:id="regest1">They are in complete agreement with the Zurich Confession; it also corresponds to their printed confession [from January 1534]. With reference to the opponents' claim that the people of Basel have a communion without Christ, the people of Strasbourg prompted the drafting of a new confession. This is somewhat shorter than the Zurich one, but is in complete harmony with it. The people of Strasbourg agree with it; however, Bucer is absent. That faith is what matters in communion must be evident to every true Christian. The opponents deny them faith, and this is only based on slander, without knowing their books, which they indeed despise. The people of Basel hope for concord, which the brothers in Strasbourg are striving for.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace through the Lord.</p>
      <p>We have diligently read your confession, even though the time was short, and we do not approve it now for the first time, but we have also confessed it long ago to God and in a booklet published in German, to the world, and not many days ago to the brothers in Strasbourg, who elicited it with written letters, especially with this word, in which they wrote that it was almost being spread throughout Germany about us, that we have a communion without Christ. Unable to endure this, we were compelled to make a confession about the sacrament of the Eucharist as if anew. It is in all respects, as far as the mind is concerned, equal to yours. The exposition is shorter, yet in no way differing from yours. Now the people of Strasbourg have also approved our opinion about the presence of the Lord in the supper and about the whole matter of the supper with letters and the signature of each one's own hand, except for Bucer, as you know, who was not at home. But who does not know, at least the pious, that where faith exists, there Christ truly is? On the contrary, where there is no faith, there is no Christ either? Therefore, if we are faithful when taking the supper, it is necessary that we have Christ present and eat him, while we take the bread and drink the wine. We have noted this indeed more than enough from the said word, that our adversaries in this cause utterly deny us the faith of Christ. For otherwise, they could not judge our supper so wickedly. But what is this malice to deny faith to those who teach Christ so sincerely, indeed who dare to boast with Paul that they "know nothing at all except Jesus Christ and him crucified" [1 Cor 2:2]? They seem to despise the books that are written and are being written by our people. For they do not read them, yet in the meantime they believe the informers, and whatever these report, they seize upon and affirm. Therefore, what else could they say but mere slanders? The Lord will judge them one day without a doubt. It is ours to unanimously pray to God through our Lord Jesus Christ, that he may grant sanity of mind to those who lack it, and defend those who have it. Then indeed, no one can doubt that such concord will follow in the church, as the brothers in Strasbourg have long sought with good zeal. May the Lord preserve us all forever!</p>
      <p>Farewell always with faith safe and unshaken.</p>
