      <p>Most Serene, Most Mighty King. To Your Royal Majesty, I offer my dutiful, most humble service in all obedience beforehand. Most Gracious Lord, at the special, manifold request of many pious believers, I have, with God's help, written 16 books this past winter against the Anabaptists and all re-baptizers, to defend divine truth and for the benefit of simple people, who are easily led astray by the sects. I hereby send Your Royal Highness a copy, not because I believe that Your Royal Majesty needs any warning, but solely because our adversaries accuse us of many sects in these lands, and Your Royal Majesty sees our innocence and true faith and is a gracious king and lord to us, as I also humbly request that Your Royal Majesty, out of noble kindness and mildness, graciously accept this my writing and book from me, a humble servant, and have it graciously recommended, as I also humbly and willingly offer myself, in whatever way Your Royal Majesty might find it possible to favor me, that I am always ready. Almighty God, etc. On the 1st of May, 1560.</p>
