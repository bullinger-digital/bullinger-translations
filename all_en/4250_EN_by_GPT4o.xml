      <p>Greetings. I am truly almost entirely astonished, my most esteemed and dearest brother in the Lord, at this extraordinary and inexhaustible generosity of yours towards me, which brings me excellent gifts one after another, while in return I see or hope for nothing anywhere by which I might be able to respond even a little to such abundantly flowing kindness, except that I heartily congratulate you on this happiness, that in this way your waters are channeled outwards and from your own store you have what you can distribute to others with such ease. My condition, however, is served, as I, always needy and empty, receive what is given by you. But the one whom I always use, I now also substitute in my place, Christ Jesus, so that with his unfailing blessing of all good things, he may be most present to you and your household, so that what you do, you may do most happily and for a long time in his house. The book you sent, I have not yet read thoroughly, but only touched upon (however?), and the title itself convinces me enough that here too, as in all things, you have done a great service to the Church of Christ, since all your works always have more in the background than they promise on the outside and on the very frontispiece. Then your letters brought me very joyful news, when you write that Wilhelm Stucker has moved into the house of our Hubert to be a companion to my son; this certainly delighted me greatly, as I hear that young man is placed beyond the common lot of this age by the sanctity of his morals and his indefatigable zeal for piety and letters, and I entirely hope that my Johann Gervicus will be provoked to holy emulation by his companionship, since it matters so much with whom young men live.</p>
      <p>Now that also, how you love both me and mine, is a great proof, that even though you are almost never overwhelmed by such a mass of business, yet those things which you think we want and which pertain to us, never escape you, so much so that you made mention of the Burcherici business at the end of your letter; indeed, if we were to give ourselves to you as servants, we would never have done enough to equal you. But that one thing we will strive to obtain from the heavenly Father through Christ the Son with faithful and perpetual prayers, that he may love, cherish, support, and govern you and yours eternally and bless you with an abundant and perpetual flow of heavenly and earthly goods. Farewell, my venerable and sweetest soul, and greet your household with all friends and brothers, the most learned men, reverently and lovingly, and commend me to the Lord continually. Again and again, farewell.</p>
      <p>In Winterthur, on the first of April, 1560.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Ambr[osius] Bl[aurer].</p>
