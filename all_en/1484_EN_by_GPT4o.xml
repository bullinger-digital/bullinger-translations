      <p>Bullinger's aphorisms on predestination.</p>
      <p>Aphorisms on the causes of human salvation and damnation from the consensus on the sacramental matter of the ministers of the churches of ZÃ¼rich and Geneva.</p>
      <p>The ultimate goal of a blessed life is for humans to reach God and become His children, so that God may be all in all.</p>
      <p>However, one reaches God only through Christ, who is the end of the law and whose knowledge undoubtedly encompasses the entire essence of the gospel.</p>
      <p>For He took on our flesh, so that by the right of adoption, He might share with us what was naturally His own. Indeed, it is solely by the benefit of His death that we are reconciled to God, renewed by the Spirit in the holiness of life, and ultimately attain righteousness and salvation. This happens when, by faith, we are grafted into the body of Christ, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, we are first considered righteous by the free imputation of righteousness, and then regenerated into a new life. Thus reformed into the image of the heavenly Father, we renounce the old man.</p>
      <p>Christ the Savior does not truly impart His life to us and produce such effects in us unless He is our head, and we are united into His body and become one in Him.</p>
      <p>And this is the spiritual communion we have with the Son of God, while His Spirit dwelling in us makes all believers partakers of all the good things that reside in Him.</p>
      <p>Indeed, for the purpose of testifying to this communion, both the preaching of the gospel and the use of the sacraments, holy baptism, and the sacred supper have been instituted. These recall to humans the death of Christ the Savior and all His benefits, and what is pronounced by the mouth of God is confirmed and sanctioned as seals, inciting gratitude, and are exercises of faith and pious life. Finally, they are bonds and marks and tokens obligating us to Christian profession and fellowship.</p>
      <p>However, we must attribute the entire work of our salvation solely to God, who effectively works by His Spirit where He sees fit, and Christ Himself, acting within, makes a person a partaker of Himself: for the instruments, namely the word and sacraments, which God uses as aids, will be of no benefit unless God fully accomplishes all that pertains to human salvation.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we diligently teach that God does not indiscriminately exercise His power in all who receive the sacraments and the external word, but only in the elect. For just as He illuminates no others to faith than those He has preordained to life, so by the secret power of His Spirit, He ensures that the elect receive what the sacraments and the word offer. For when the signs are administered equally to the reprobate and the elect, the truth of the signs reaches only the elect.</p>
      <p>What is said about predestination, election, and reprobation, which are actions of the most holy will of God, is accepted in such a way that nothing doubtful or ambiguous is left in the matter of salvation:</p>
      <p>God the Father of all, a lover of mankind, and the same towards all without respect of persons, wills all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. And it is the eternal counsel of God, the best and greatest, to bless, justify, and sanctify humans, forgiving sins in the sole mediator Jesus Christ, His only-begotten Son, out of mere grace, for the sake of the Son Himself, who, made man and having suffered and died, atoned for the sin of the whole world, through faith in the name of Jesus, not by merit or works which man himself does: but to condemn the unbelievers for their sin and guilt, because they did not receive the Savior offered.</p>
      <p>Even this faith is given by the heavenly Father Himself, so that no one may boast before God, in respect of His most beloved Son. He also allows the faithful to be exercised with various trials, like Job, for their salvation and the glory of His name, yet He does not allow them to be tempted beyond what they can bear.</p>
      <p>For the insertion, nourishment, and preservation of faith in the minds of humans, the wise and good God alone has destined His word contained in the sacred books, as well as the sacraments and the entire ministry of the church.</p>
      <p>Hence, whoever is saved is saved by the mere grace of our Lord God the Savior. But those who perish do not perish driven by fatal necessity, but because by the free choice of their own will, they rejected the grace of God the most generous Father offered in the Son.</p>
      <p>If our dearest brothers, Mr. Johannes Calvin and Hieronymus N. and others, feel this way, they indeed agree among themselves and with us, who retain this consensus in good faith, and with other orthodox and catholic [believers]. And it is merely a verbal conflict, which Christ and the chorus of all saints, the common salvation, and the very difficult times of the Christian church command to be laid aside as quickly as possible.</p>
