      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Zürich church, my lord and father to be honored with perpetual loyalty.</p>
      <p>Greetings. You will be surprised, I know well, my lord and venerable father, whom I must honor, revere, and observe above all, what has driven me to write to you and how I dared to interrupt you, overwhelmed by the waves and storms of the most serious affairs, with these my importunate and foolish letters, when I had the opportunity to speak with you in person and a more convenient occasion could have presented itself. For I know how arduous and full of danger it is to write to a leading man burdened and occupied with greater cares, as I have been taught by that most wise guide of youth, who among many other moral precepts says: "Approach a leading man very rarely." But when you kindly, as you usually do, understand not only the reasons for my counsel but also the authors of this my supplication, you will grant pardon to me writing to you and to the author compelling me to do so. Last year, when I was returning from Marburg, a very frequented emporium of good letters, Mr. Konrad Pellikan received me with hospitality, with the humanity he has towards all students, and for more than a year he not only treated me most kindly but also instructed me and greatly promoted and increased my studies, which he would have continued to do, had he not been hindered by the abundance of grandchildren, sweetest pledges, old age, and a serious illness. Therefore, he not only advised me to look elsewhere for convenient lodging in a timely manner, but also offered his help in this matter. As I was considering and pondering for a long time to whom among the learned I should especially turn, to whom I should reveal this matter, and whom I should humbly ask to deign to receive me with hospitality, behold Mr. Pellikan, watching over me with vigilant care, said to me: "What if," he said, "you were to solicit Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the father and patron of all students, whom I know for certain to favor you greatly and always wish you well, about this matter and humbly and submissively express to him your singular desire to live with him? I am persuaded that you will not suffer a refusal. He does not have a large family, he has sent away all his sons, and you could be to him as a cupbearer, a servant, a footman," etc. Although I have always greatly valued the company, conversation, and familiarity of learned and good men (for these are the greatest aids and supports to one aspiring to true and solid learning, whence also the sons of the prophets in the Old Testament were called those who had joined themselves to such), yet I have never considered nor do I consider my service, which is certainly very small, to be of such worth that I should think myself to be received with hospitality by such a great man. Therefore, giving him the greatest thanks I could, I excused myself honorably as unworthy of such a thing happening to me. But he, out of his paternal love and favor towards me, insisted and urged: "Indeed, something must be dared," he said, "not all hope is to be cast aside, an attempt must be made; a letter written to him will not be ashamed." What should I do here, whom should I especially obey or comply with? my rustic and timid modesty or the venerable old man and father piously and well advising me? If I comply with myself, I might justly be accused of stubbornness, ingratitude, arrogance, and finally of attributing too much to myself, as if I did not need the help and assistance of others. Therefore, if anything is to be done or has been done wrong here, I thought it better and more honorable to err on the better side. Therefore, I ask and beseech you, my lord and father, venerable for many reasons, that you, not so much moved by my supplicating letters as persuaded by the words of the author not to be disdained, deign to admit me into your most honorable family; I willingly offer all my service, industry, diligence, and fidelity to you, my lord and father to be honored, and to all yours, ready to carry out and execute your commands and orders with God's favor. Meanwhile, I do not wish anything to be diminished or deducted from the just price to be paid, but I will consider myself no less affected by the greatest benefit and highest honor. If you make me the master of my wish, which my mind towards you does not at all allow me to doubt you will do, you will render your virtue combined with the greatest humanity more illustrious, and me, your little client, bound to you and yours forever, and you will have affected me with divine benefit and highest honor. May the best and greatest God preserve you for us in these storms and tempests of the greatest affairs for the glory of His name and the benefit of His church perpetually unharmed. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, from the house of Mr. Pellikan, in the year of salvation restored through Christ 1555, the day before the Nones of November.</p>
      <p>Your reverence's most observant Josua Finsler.</p>
