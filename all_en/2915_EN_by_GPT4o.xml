      <p>Dear brothers in the Lord Jesus Christ, I have received your friendly and Christian letter and understood from it that you have thought well and diligently of me, as you wish to appoint another in the place of the pious and godly old man, Mr. Pellicanus, and indeed I know that I have in no way deserved such great honor.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I attribute all that you have done in such a friendly manner to your virtue and Christian spirit. Therefore, you should not doubt that your calling has been entirely agreeable to me. However, our school, along with its council, has been remarkably burdened. Therefore, they have tried to deter me in many ways so that I do not consent to you who are calling me. But since I value the reconciliation and unity of religion and faith more highly than all other things, I persist in my intention. And when I was asked by an honorable council what my will and opinion were, I did not hold back but gave them to understand that it would be most pleasing to me if they would kindly grant me leave, not because I am ungrateful or forgetful of their kindness. For I can well recognize how much I am obliged to serve this city, from which I would not allow myself to be torn away if I could reconcile my teaching on the sacraments with their preachers. But since there is no hope of that, I have declared that I desire to go to the place to which I am called by my dear brothers, and have also complained to an honorable council on this occasion that our teaching on the Lord's Supper is here in this city so immoderately and shamelessly slandered by the preachers, and mentioned that it surprises and troubles me that they allow no one in their school to teach and dispute publicly on this article and yet permit such contentious and embittered sermons in the churches. In summary, I have personally approached this matter twice and several times through other mediators and intermediaries, and have fully hoped that the matter might be resolved within these four days. But as of today's date, an honorable council has answered me that they can well recognize that I have not insignificant reasons to request leave from them; yet they think that in such an important matter nothing should be undertaken hastily and thoughtlessly, and have therefore asked me to willingly await the final answer for another month, with the promise and assurance that they will either meet me with such conditions that I may remain with them with a clear conscience, or allow me to dispose of myself according to my desire to you. Which I could not refuse to an honorable council (to whom I am then much obliged and in which I know many are of our opinion and faith) with any honor, since they also reported that they had reasons why they could not give me a final answer at this time. Therefore, I have consented to such a delay according to their request, though not without burden and displeasure. Yet I want you to be of good cheer; for I will not fail to use all my efforts so that your calling does not go unfulfilled; a month will soon pass. Therefore, I will dispose of myself to you at St. John's, if God wills, who then (as I hope) will grant grace that the matter may be settled.</p>
      <p>I have also written to a wise and brave council of Zurich, with what high thanks I accept this calling.</p>
      <p>Yet I ask you to kindly arrange this even more diligently in my name. Herewith I thank you, my dear fellow brothers, to whom I would have gladly written each one individually; but due to business (since I am constantly overwhelmed by my good friends and patrons because of this matter) I have not been able to do so this time. Therefore, I ask you to excuse me to them; for I will answer them as soon as possible or perhaps come myself sooner than they think. I have detained your messenger for two days, perhaps longer than was proper; yet it happened because I thought the matter might be settled within these three days. Therefore, I ask you to take this delay in good part and ensure that he does not hold it against me, etc.</p>
      <p>Dated at Strasbourg on the 7th day of May 1556. Yours in the Lord, Peter Martyr.</p>
