      <p>Greetings and blessings. I received your letters, dear brother, and I also accepted your apology; therefore, do not doubt my dedication and love for you. Egli returned and preached about the generosity and humanity of the people of Davos.</p>
      <p>I gave thanks to the Lord, whom I pray will enlighten him, so that he may promote the glory of the divine name and the salvation of many; he will ascend at the end of April. I pray that you thank the councilor, both of Chur and of Davos, in my name.</p>
      <p>Our magistrate (for he writes to him) kindly received the letters and praises their kindness and steadfastness, etc.</p>
      <p>I received the document sent through Joachim.</p>
      <p>I am now sending another, which I mentioned recently, and there is no need to return it.</p>
      <p>I hope you have received my treatise on the Ubiquity of Heaven and the Body of Christ. Be present for the brothers who are laboring and affected by troubles through the bishops; the Lord tests us, but does not abandon us, he does not want us to be idle. That Martin, the troublesome man, I would simply or precisely remove from office and order him to leave or deal with the church so that it would dismiss him. You must certainly commend the last to me, I then acknowledge the companions better.</p>
      <p>It is better to be finished in time than later and too late with disgrace and harm. The Lord be with you. March 28, 1561.</p>
