      <p>My friendly greetings and my constant readiness to serve you and to your good pleasure.</p>
      <p>Dear Heinrich, good friend, know that I, along with my wife and household, am in good health, praise be to the Lord. I always wish to hear the same from you. Furthermore, know that I have nothing special to write to you about at the moment; nevertheless, I have written this so that I am not considered negligent.</p>
      <p>The people of Soest and Münster still hold firmly to the Gospel, as I wrote last time. The Bishop of Münster intended to force his subjects with violence. However, he failed and has postponed his intentions until the next council. There was something printed about this council among us, but it was suppressed again.</p>
      <p>Also, it has come to pass among us that some of the spiritual prelates pay little attention to the papal ban.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Phrysemius was appointed and deputed as a chancellor of the Bishop of Cologne but has recently passed away.</p>
      <p>I request, dear Heinrich, that you send me Zwingli's praiseworthy work "Institutions on Educating Children in Piety," and whatever he has annotated on the prophets, and if he has commented or annotated anything on the Psalms, as his Psalter is highly regarded among us. And write to me what each item should cost; I wish, God willing, to settle it honorably. Or write to me so that I can pay for the same by purchasing books here.</p>
      <p>Additionally, a strange book by Heinrich Agrippa von Nettesheim was given to print. However, it was prevented by the theologians. This is the same person who wrote the "Declamation on the Vanity of Sciences."</p>
      <p>I wish to have my humble writing received well, and also to have prayers from you, that you do the same. If you have nothing special, write the same as I have done now and do not let old friendships fade. And greet your dear wife and Herr Hans, your brother, for me.</p>
      <p>Given in Cologne, in the year 33 on the Monday after Laetare Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Theodericus Bitter von Wipperfürth.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my special good friend, to be delivered in Zurich.</p>
