    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should not have paid the messenger who was tasked with delivering the testimony [for old Ammann Hans Vogler the Elder]. However, the [St. Gallen] people are grateful for it. The rest was paid by the council. Bullinger will be shown more gratitude on a suitable occasion because he was so helpful to the delegated councilors of St. Gallen (including Vadian) in Bremgarten [during the Diets in the summer of 1531]. - The visit of Johannes Fries and his companions [Christoph, Georg, Hans Ulrich, Heinrich, and Petronius Grebel] [in St. Gallen] pleased everyone. Surely [Fries] has already told Bullinger what was entrusted to him. - Vadian will inform [Johannes] Stumpf of a date for a meeting [in St. Gallen]. In the meantime, he is diligently working [on his "Small Chronicle"] to keep his promise [see above No. 2159]. - He asks for reliable news about [Charles V]. It is said that he, along with his brother [Ferdinand I], has even made himself unpopular with his estates. It is evident that he is not only trying to promote his religion but also to deprive Germany of its freedom. The fact that some remain vigilant comforts Vadian. He further hopes that the Swiss cities will prove to be good neighbors [to the threatened estates in Germany]. A rider sent to a place near Ulm reported in [St. Gallen] that the Seven [Catholic] Places [Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Zug, and Glarus] had promised [Charles V] not to oppose him. Therefore, the [Catholic] places will not come to the aid of the [Protestant] ones if they are attacked because of their faith. Vadian had replied to the rider: Even if the [Catholic places] abandoned the [Protestant ones], the latter would seek help elsewhere and still remain their allies. - "Apelles" (the saddler [Melchior GÃ¼gi]) and Hans [Widenhuber] are about to go to [Zurich]. Vadian recommends both. Bullinger should urge Froschauer to take care of the bill for [the picture of the city of St. Gallen]. Vadian will reward [Froschauer] for this with his eager [participation in Stumpf's Chronicle].</p>

      <p>Greetings. There is no need for you to pay the messenger for the testimony, and I truly wish that the expense had not been incurred by you; however, since it pleased you to do so, we must accept your kindness. The rest was covered by the council, which is very eager to honor you for your exceptional generosity, which you showed to me while I was on a mission and to some other members of the senatorial order in Bremgarten; and the gratitude for this past favor remains strong among those who remember. Therefore, do not doubt that greater things await you, provided the opportunity arises for us to show our gratitude. - The safe arrival of our Friesian friend with his entire entourage greatly delighted us. I know they boasted about being treated magnificently here; however, their unexpected arrival meant that they were not received according to our true intentions or their merit and our unique goodwill towards them. I believe he has already told you some things I entrusted to him. I will inform our Stumpf of the time when we can meet. In the meantime, I do not spare my pen, much less my spirit, to fulfill my promise. - If you have any reliable news about the Emperor, please let me know. It is said that he, along with his brother, is suffering from great hatred even among his own estates, and no one is so dull-minded that they cannot see that his slippery and cunning efforts are not so much aimed at supporting his religion as they are at ultimately reducing the ancient freedom of Germany to servitude, thus capturing two hares with one hunt. I am very pleased to hear that some are vigilant and ready to act, whom I greatly desire. If we must fight for our altars and hearths in the manner of the ancients, then surely life itself must be risked to prevent the endangerment of freedom. There is great hope that the Swiss cities will not be bad neighbors. A mounted messenger stationed at a place near Ulm has reported that the seven places of the Confederation have promised the Emperor not to oppose him with any stroke of faith. Therefore, they will not even help us with a fist if anyone attacks us in the name of faith. This is the state of the faction. However, I would respond: If you wish to let us sink, then we will seek help where we trust to find it, and nonetheless remain your Confederates, etc. Furthermore, our Apelles the saddler, whom I commend to you along with our Johannes, will appear there. Truly, advise Froschauer to take care of his work; I will reciprocate with my diligence. Farewell. St. Gallen, June 8, 1545. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed bishop of the city of Zurich, lord and friend to be especially honored.</p>
