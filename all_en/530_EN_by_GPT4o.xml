      <p>My dear brother-in-law Peter Schär has now written through his servant about how it is rumored among them that a large fresh army is supposed to come into the country; yet no one knows how or where it will be used, except that it is suspected that the Confederates (Swiss Confederation) must be attacked. Therefore, Claus von Graufeneck, who had intended to buy a seat in the Confederation and had already inspected several, has written that no further dealings should be made on this matter; the situation seems to be changing.</p>
      <p>I cannot know if he has any solid basis for this; he is a Württemberg court master. But little is known at this court about what the emperor has in mind; I hope to dear God that he will grant this land a little more peace and quiet until his time is fulfilled and the measure is full; there is still some good found in Judah, as it is written, etc.</p>
      <p>Mr. Peter Bufler tells me that he has received fresh letters from Austria (where he conducts his business), in which it is written to him how a great Hungarian nobleman has risen against the king, and it is surprising to me; for the king has accepted servants and sent them down shortly, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, that a great plague has come upon the Turk's people, and that he is said to have been badly beaten by the great Sophy, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, his brother-in-law writes from Nuremberg how Magdeburg and the Saxon cities are still brave and active in all things. But Duke Hans of Saxony, the captured elector, is said to have approved the Interim and therefore now has a very gracious emperor, often rides to court, and the Spanish guard, which was in custody, has been abolished. I hope and trust in dear God that there is nothing to it, and that he will not have let this dear man fall in such a manner; for it would indeed be a particularly great and heavy offense. I have always hoped that the Lord God would bring him forth again and make him glorious, as I still do not doubt, if he remains steadfast in his bravery.</p>
      <p>In Memmingen, they are daily expecting the Interims, who are supposed to come and destroy what little is still upright; it is my great sorrow. The town clerk there, Jörgen Maurer, has been given leave; but I cannot yet learn for what reasons. He has now been suspected for some time as a traitor; I do not know if the good man is being treated justly or unjustly, I want to assume the best. He initially showed great zeal and accomplished much good among his own.</p>
      <p>The wretched Doctor Velte in Constance is causing such great scandal and disgrace from the pulpit, he is so embittered that I cannot be written enough about it, and that people are becoming more and more annoyed with him, and those who initially listened to him are now very reluctant to be at peace with him; for they can no longer endure the asinine behavior and hide the rogue; he breaks out like a raging madman, runs around and also pours oil on the fire with the chief, which already burns too much. His highest art is to praise and boast of himself and to shame, defame, and mock all others. He openly says Luther, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Bucer, Schnepf, Blaurer are all nothing but ignorant fools, understanding as much about the scriptures and knowing as much therein as a goat in the ABC; he says he will make a book, where the true foundation will be seen. All the sermons he gives in Constance, he will have printed. Oh God, that he would do it; but they are nothing but his great fables, with which he blinds the world, and his foolishness will soon become apparent to everyone.</p>
      <p>The pious children of God are truly in great distress there, lamenting and sighing heartily. May the Lord God soon hear and refresh them with much grace, etc.</p>
      <p>The colonel in Constance has, in the name of royal majesty, set a day for my dear brother, cousin Conrad Zwicken, and the others who have not yet been dealt with, on May 28th, when they are to appear before him through their lawyers with full authority without delay, for he wants to deal with them on behalf of royal majesty. Be aware, they will send the lawyers, but not with full authority. There are many speculations about what will be dealt with them; since it is to be assumed that they will not agree to move into the city, it is thought perhaps better and wiser to fine them some money and to admonish them with a strict duty never again to act against imperial and royal majesty, which would be a serious matter for them; for perhaps you would not accept them among you if they were thus obligated, although, if it came to that, which God forbid, that imperial and royal majesty waged war against the Confederates and they then sat in a Confederation, the duty would cease and the natural right of defense would apply again, and this would now be a new negotiation, dissolving the previous duty.</p>
      <p>With us preachers, I think, they will not deal at all, but rather let us hover, give us to the devil, and perhaps even start against us, that we are not tolerated in a Confederation anywhere, also what everyone still has in it, that it is taken from him, also what everyone has set in the lake; for no one wants to deal with us, as we are considered heretics. But we will resolve it thus. The Lord God will arrange it for the best; therefore, you will help us earnestly with faithful hearts to call upon God, etc.</p>
