      <p>For the little book sent, I give you the greatest thanks, most distinguished Bullinger. Our Germany is almost speechless and mute now, to such an extent that it dares to confess nothing of those things which are according to duty. I do not doubt that all things about the plan and progress of the King of France are known to you. The Constable, the Duke of Nevers, and Guise entered Metz on April 4th with an army of 12,000. They stormed and plundered the Gorsam Abbey near Metz, defended by one hundred Imperial foot soldiers, killing all who resisted.</p>
      <p>The King himself follows with larger forces. Maurice, with his conspirators, has left Augsburg and ascended along the Lech River; where they are going next, we cannot yet know for certain.</p>
      <p>Wars, dreadful wars. In England, great assemblies of all orders are currently being held, in which I hear the best laws are being established both for religion and the public state of the kingdom. I hear that there is enough agreement between the Emperor and the King of England, so that mutual exchange and commerce are conducted between both dominions. I am troubled among various thoughts of the mind about what this war will bring us. The Council of Trent is continued. There are 25 Spanish bishops present, about the same number of Italians, and all the Germans have left except for one from Chur; however, all have been forced to leave vicars and procurators who carry on the proceedings.</p>
      <p>The session scheduled for March 19th has been postponed to the first of May. From our side, the annulment of all decrees has been demanded, and a new discussion and examination of controversies, which I hear has been denied by the Emperor's envoys and the papal representatives, who refuse to redo what has been done. At this time, we see an attempt at an alliance between the lion and the fox; but I hope no counsel against the Lord will prevail. I ask that you commend me to Bibliander and your family. Farewell. Strasbourg, April 16th, 1552.</p>
      <p>Christopher Mont.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man, Mr. Bullinger, President of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
