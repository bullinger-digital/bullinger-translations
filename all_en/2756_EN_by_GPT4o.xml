      <p>Greetings. If you are well, it is good; we are all indeed well, thanks to God. In the entire town, no one has been sick for a whole week. From Italy, we hear nothing except that the Pope is moving his armies against Tuscany and the Kingdom of Naples. These times will give you great insight into explaining the Apocalypse, which I have long heard you have in hand and are publicly expounding with great praise and our hope. For we will read, we do not doubt, what you have explained.</p>
      <p>This past summer, a certain young man was here with us, whose wife is a relative of Mr. Konrad Gessner, who is not received among you because of the very fact that he has taken a wife. We replied to him, when he was here, that there is currently no vacant position for any German preacher, but perhaps there will be on the Feast of St. Martin; we will write to him and call him if there is any vacant position. With this hope, he may come to us on the Feast of St. Martin; therefore, I would like you, out of your kindness, to tell him that no position has yet been found for him and that he should not incur the expense of coming here; we will indeed keep him in mind, especially since you and the same Gessner have written to us on his behalf, and when we have found something, we will write to him. I wrote about certain books, if the bookseller wishes to bring them here; if you have a response, please give it to me, so that I may write to him, who ordered them to be bought for himself, to send the money on the Feast of St. Martin. Your elder Traversus sent to me, asking me to excuse him to you for not writing to you. He can write absolutely nothing nor hold a pen with his fingers; for his right hand has swollen and grown. He greets you most dutifully; he conducts himself with utmost integrity. When the preacher is not at home, he preaches himself, indeed at home; they flock to him no less than to the church. Friends send their greetings. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, a man to be greatly honored by all the pious and learned.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 22nd of October, 1555.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in kindness, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, to be honored by all good people. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
