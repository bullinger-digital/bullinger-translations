      <p>[...] you have been entrusted with a young boy; I also promise that I will not be ungrateful.</p>
      <p>If you have any reliable news from the Diet of Speyer, let me know. We have no news, except that the Turks are said to have requested passage through Italy from the Venetians, and the Frenchman is hastening towards Milan after the Spaniards have been driven out of the Piedmont region. How true these things are, I do not know; however, there are those who sell them as the most certain truths.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 20th February in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Basel, most esteemed brother. Basel.</p>
