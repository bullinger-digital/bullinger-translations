<letter xml:id="file5038"><body><div><p>On the twentieth of this month, which was a Monday, we arrived in Ilanz in the evening, as our lords, the envoys of the Three Leagues, had preceded us by a day. I promised myself all things joyful, except that an internal Satan had already been unleashed, who struck me with blows for several days, which caused me great anxiety. But by the grace of God, we broke this versatile demon with patience and constancy, and I would even say prudence, if it did not seem too arrogant to say so. I was anxiously expecting your letters and those of Mr. Coignet on the same day, which I knew were on the way.</p><p>On the same day, the foreign envoys presented their proposals again in a large assembly. The following day, the twenty-first, had barely dawned when, behold, your letters and those of Coignet were auspiciously delivered to me; for the messenger who brought them had traveled all night. That day was designated for deliberation.</p><p>However, I, having several ministers with me, spread this news like trumpets throughout the small town within half an hour. The senate convened an hour and a half later.</p><p>There, Mr. Coignet's letters, which contained the same information, were read in the full senate.</p><p>It is incredible to say how much that news encouraged the good and dismayed the adversaries. This matter quickly reached the ears of Angelo Ricci, who, to downplay this news, also produced letters from his pocket, which were read in the senate at the intercession of his supporters. But our consul demanded that the date of the letters be inspected.</p><p>When this was done and Ricci was selling old news as new, his letters were dismissed with a hiss. On the same day, a senate was also granted to us ministers and the Italian brothers.</p><p>They listened to us very attentively; we modestly refuted the pope's insults, briefly explained the doctrine, and offered ourselves for a debate. "If the pope," we said, "so greatly thirsts for the salvation of our souls, as he professes, he has cardinals, bishops, and very famous doctors, he abounds in money and wealth; we poor little men, as you see us here present, lacking in all things, rely on the support of the word of God alone and yet do not shy away from the fight," etc.</p><p>You understand the rest. - On Thursday at the second hour in the afternoon, a response was given, the summary of which you will understand from the records, which I send to you here. I would indeed have wished that they had refrained from us by the holiness of the pope; but since the senate was also mixed with papists, this had to be given to their ears. For 18 men, to whom this task of responding was entrusted, also consisted of papists. I am informed by certain and reliable sources that Ricci, if he had obtained what he was pursuing in the name of the pope, would then also have publicly proposed his own matters, which he had long been secretly handling. But after he saw that he could achieve nothing in the foreign matter through the papists, who had drained the papal legate with money and persuaded him that they could do everything (the Philippian and papal factions were united in zeal and will), he also gave up hope for his own matters. For how much each envoy hoped, the outcome testified.</p><p>For when they received the response on October 23 at the second hour in the afternoon, the papal envoy could not contain himself, but openly attacked those with words who had given him hope of victory; finally, gnashing his teeth, he bit the chain he wore around his neck and indignantly departed from Ilanz with Angelo Ricci at the fourth hour in the evening. Here you have the summary hastily written by me.</p><p>I write all these things and also the records to France; therefore, you will kindly ensure that they are delivered to Mr. Coignet as soon as possible by post. - I preached there a second time.</p><p>Almost all the neighboring priests were present. After the sermon, they greeted me very kindly and openly admitted that I had spoken the truth, even though I had said many things against the sacrifice of the mass. But as far as I can see, there is great hope in the name of the mass being dismissed.</p><p>Henceforth, I will not hesitate to write to them familiarly and, if any books are published, to send them to them as well. One of them affirmed that he had read your books on councils. - The bishop has also published his business, rode up with great pomp, thinking he had it all tied up. But he achieved nothing, although the matter was handled quite roughly, so that there is concern that the God's House might come together. For, to put it briefly, the bishop's business was postponed with the knowledge of the two Leagues until the upcoming St. Martin's Day. In the meantime, both sides were to remain still.</p><p>Our people complied with this; but the bishop thought that since foreign lords were involved, he might come to a good agreement through the mediation of the two Leagues; therefore, he also published all this in the God's House without our knowledge, with an earnest request that they would finally settle the matter. Therefore, when the God's House came together in Ilanz, it was evenly divided. One half wanted to settle the matter (not believing how the bishop's people had run around Ilanz and with what seriousness they had handled it); the other half wanted to stick to the previous decision. It came to the point that a mayor had to decide.</p><p>The bishop complained about this, and the matter came before the two Leagues.</p><p>They initially held friendly talks with our people, offering to help settle the matter, so that enough would be done for them by the bishop. But when our people persisted in their undertaking, the two Leagues also let it remain with the previous decision. The bishop did not expect this; for he thought that the Two Leagues would admonish our people by honor and oath; therefore, he was very angry. His people openly said that the Chur people wanted to be lords in the God's House; our people, on the other hand, openly called the others liars. This caused some disturbance; but it was quickly settled.</p><p>Thus the bishop, who had ridden up with great pomp, rode back here to Chur at night around 8 o'clock with great humility on Saturday. Now I think it will be settled on St. Martin's Day; for it costs the bishop an unspeakable amount of money. That is what is happening: no one is with him, except those who lie daily in the kitchen.</p><p>But it also costs this city a great deal, because all those who are sent to the meetings on our side are paid from the common city treasury until the final decision of the law. The bishop has let it be known that he wanted to tire us out; but our people have also let it be known that the city of Chur, God willing, still has enough money to support a beggar prince. - This is the summary.</p><p>Thus far it has gone.</p><p>May God grant that it ends well.</p><p>I think on St. Martin's Day they will lay into it heavily and settle the matter.</p><p>If the evangelicals themselves had not given us such great resistance, it would have already been done with the bishopric; for then we would have had more peace before the pope.
