      <p>S. D. I am very glad, reverend and most esteemed lord, that you were pleased with the book of the princes of Saxony and the judgment of our most illustrious prince and Mr. Philipp Melanchthon, which I sent to you.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it is possible to recognize from that book the source of all evil and offenses that emanated from the Worms Colloquy. For the books sent to me in return, namely the Catechism and the 44 sermons on the prophet Jeremiah, I am grateful, and even more so because they have come from your very fruitful and cultivated workshop. Such fruits do not grow among us; I do not know whether I should blame the soil and the climate, but I am more inclined to believe that our ignorance and laziness are to be blamed. I have not yet been able to learn what the judgment of the prince of Saxony is about your book, but I hope to hear soon either from the most illustrious Prince Philipp or from his eldest son Wilhelm. For the entire court is moving here while part of the Kassel Castle is being demolished and rebuilt from the foundations. I will inform you of what I learn.</p>
      <p>I also hope to hear something about the reform of our school shortly after the most illustrious princes arrive here. But if I observe that all my efforts are being hindered and nothing or little is corrected in the school, then I will think again about going elsewhere.</p>
      <p>I had greatly wished to move to Lausanne, both to be closer to you and for several other reasons. But the most illustrious prince has delayed me.</p>
      <p>However, I have learned that if a similar opportunity arises again, it should not be reported to the most illustrious prince. I am here almost overwhelmed by hatred and envy, and it cannot be said by what means some people continually cause me trouble, and since I see everything tending primarily to hinder the course of sacred studies, I grieve and am distressed beyond what anyone would believe.</p>
      <p>But perhaps more on this matter another time.</p>
      <p>Now about your son Johann Rudolf.</p>
      <p>He came to me, about 20 years old, as he himself tells me; what could I do for someone of that age? He often confessed that he was neglected in Strasbourg and deeply regretted not coming to me sooner. I did not fail him in explaining certain things privately, nor in encouraging, urging, and other such duties, and he even kindly listened to me when I rebuked him more harshly, being otherwise of pleasant manners and a tractable nature. As for the progress he has made in literature, you, who cannot be deceived in this matter, should judge. I am indeed well aware of the diligence I have applied.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you can learn about the expenses incurred and his debts here, as far as I could ascertain, from the account on the attached paper. I briefly express my opinion about the young students, not doubting that the other professors, unless I am mistaken, will agree entirely with this sentiment. My wife greets you and your whole family and prays for your happiness.</p>
      <p>I ask that my greetings be conveyed in my name to the most distinguished men Mr. Peter Martyr, Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, Lavater, Simler, and others.</p>
      <p>Farewell. September 25, 1559.</p>
      <p>Andreas Hyperius, yours as much as he is.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, most esteemed lord. In Zurich.</p>
