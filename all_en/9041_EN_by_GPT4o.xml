      <p>[...] when Albert von Stetten, the young lord Jörgen von Stetten's son from Augsburg, was in Bourges in France with Dr. Hotman, we were worried that he might have perished. However, today, by the grace of God, he has returned to us and speaks of great distress and cruelty. God has helped him and Dr. François Hotman escape from it. The believers there had their houses ransacked and plundered, and many believers were stabbed. As he left Geneva, he saw the two sons of the late Admiral, whom God also helped, along with many others. He reports that Montgomery has gathered several thousand believing soldiers and has gone to La Rochelle, etc. I have not yet learned more details; however, he says that in Paris about ten thousand were murdered; this is the common report, and in Lyon many more than have been said. We hear daily more lamentations, and I wonder what kind of hearts and consciences those have who want to side with the murderous king and people. Surely all the righteous blood that has been shed since Abel will come upon them.</p>
      <p>I suppose that with you, as with us, it is forbidden to roam and ordered that everyone be armed with armor and weapons without delay. God be with you; may He protect and shield us.</p>
      <p>Dated Sunday, September 28, 1572.</p>
      <p>Greet Susanna and the children. Since Conrad wanted to go out to you, I had to write this to you. All our people greet you.</p>

      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
