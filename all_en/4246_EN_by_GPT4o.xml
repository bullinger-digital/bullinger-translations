      <p>Greetings, a man most highly esteemed by all learned and good people.</p>
      <p>I know that our beloved brother in the Lord, Johannes Faber, has written to your kindness about matters worthy of knowledge, which is why I refrain from bothering your kindness with my unnecessary writings. However, he wanted me to write this myself: I took the little horse into my house from the moment your Christoph left here, kept it in my stable for five weeks, and it was completely healed; because the blacksmith soon found a small bone stuck in the little horse's foot after he had shod it while it was still in his house. After five weeks, when the horse was completely healed and had regained its strength, we offered it for sale with saddle and bridle for four guilders; but no one wanted to buy it. The young nobleman Caspar Salis and others said they wouldn't take it even as a gift and that it should be kept over the winter; because hay is very expensive here with us. So we waited to see if anyone would still want to buy it.</p>
      <p>When we found no one to sell it to, neither for a high nor a low price, and it had become quite nice, Master Faber persuaded me to keep it and pay for it when I could. So I kept it for the price we offered to others, namely for 4 guilders. From this, I gave the blacksmith 14 batzen for having the horse for 14 days and for his labor with the horse, I also gave him 8 batzen. I am to pay the rest this summer, as soon as I can.</p>
      <p>I have lent the little horse to a citizen who is now on his way to Basel and will be with you on Friday; because he says he wants to buy oats from you. There you can inspect the little horse, and if your son wants to keep it himself, he may do so; I gladly leave it to him; he shall have the choice. I have been verbose; but Faber ordered me to write the whole matter.</p>
      <p>Consider all things well.</p>
      <p>I am well with the whole family, thanks to God.</p>
      <p>I had forgotten this: remember Willingius Svevulus, who once, when he left here, accused me of something unknown to you and elsewhere. My mind did not deceive me; I perceived the man to be full of ambition and not at all benevolent to us all, I mean to the Rhaetians and the Swiss, as I wrote to you then. Now I do not doubt that you have heard how insolently he behaves in Ulm, like a croaking frog.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, most esteemed of men, and do not cease to love your Philippus. From Chur, March 25, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours in integrity, Philippus Gallicius. Truly to the great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people. In Zurich.</p>
