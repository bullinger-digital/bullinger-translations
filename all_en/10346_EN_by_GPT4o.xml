    <p xml:id="regest1">Was pleased with Bullinger's letter. Through the friendly manner in which Bullinger has taken up his problems, he has become even dearer to him. Recommends the bearer of the letter, one of his students. The cheeses should be sent at a favorable opportunity. He has no time to write to Theodor Bibliander. Greetings to him and to Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Your letter delighted my spirit for two reasons: partly because you, even when very busy, did not disdain to respond to mine, and partly because I see that I may achieve my wish, provided it is within your power. You have been dear to me, even though previously unknown, to the utmost degree, and henceforth you will be much dearer, because you undertake such a task for the sake of a friend who has only moderately deserved it, so that you are thought to be more likely to neglect your own affairs than those of a friend.</p>
      <p>The adverse health condition I had been suffering from has somewhat subsided. I am somewhat restored to myself. May the Lord deal with us in a manner worthy of His own name and glory, and beneficial to us.</p>
      <p>That young man has been my student for two years now. Therefore, having found him to be a messenger of such certain faith, I desired that he should approach you and deliver the letter.</p>
      <p>As for those little cheeses, let them come whenever it is convenient and suitable. I will pay the price in good faith.</p>
      <p>At present, I cannot be more verbose nor engage with you further, being surrounded by a thousand businesses. For these reasons, I do not have the leisure to write back to Theodor, as would have been appropriate, but please convey my many greetings to him at the earliest opportunity, as he is a great man who will soon return my writings with interest. Above all, greet Pellikan, the most candid, learned, humane, ingenious man I have ever seen or heard, and a supporter of the learned. I am now being called away by the sound of the hour to instruct my students.</p>
      <p>May the Lord strengthen, confirm, defend, and guide you and all the preachers of the city of Zürich, as is worthy of His most holy gospel. Farewell with your entire family and love me in return.</p>
      <p>January 13, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Ludwig Lopadius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the people of Zürich, a remarkably dear friend and brother.</p>
