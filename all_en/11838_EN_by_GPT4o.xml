    <p xml:id="regest1">He has not withheld any news from him, but has given these - in a copy from Leodegar [Hirsgarter] - to the pastor of Wald [Martin Manhart] [No. 1785]; only Bucer's communications about the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] he kept to himself, as Bucer writes extensively directly to Bullinger through [Christoph] Froschauer [No. 1789]. Emperor [Charles V] advances in Luxembourg against the Frenchman [Francis I], who has taken Luxembourg among other cities; the loss of Thionville would be severe for the Emperor; in the [Electorate] of Cologne, the passing Spaniards and Italians have expressed their hatred for the Lutherans and devastated the land, but spared the people; the mandate [against Hildesheim], which [Johannes] Gast sends, proves the godlessness of the Emperor, even if [Ludwig] von Reischach defends him. Theobald Nigri writes that the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I] is besieging Krakow; if this is true, Saxony would be in great danger; according to a pamphlet, Italians are said to have betrayed Gran, and Stuhlweißenburg is also said to have fallen.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You do not rightly accuse me of negligence, my dear Bullinger; for on the day you wrote your last letter, I also entrusted mine to be delivered to you (although copied by your Leodegar) through the pastor of the village of Wald in your jurisdiction. If he has not delivered it, please inquire; for I sent everything I knew for certain. Furthermore, Bucer had mentioned certain things about the Cologne affair, which I withheld, because I knew Bucer himself had written much more extensively to you through Froschauer, whom I do not know if he has returned.</p>
      <p>The Emperor advances in three columns against the Frenchman in Luxembourg, who has taken and burned most of the towns in the Duchy of Luxembourg, recently even Luxembourg itself. Thionville remains, and if he occupies that town, the Emperor will have a task in that region. The Spaniards and Italians are nothing if not persistently malicious. As they passed through the Electorate of Cologne, there was this outcry: "Maza, maza Lutherans!" They devastated everything, yet spared the people. From the mandate sent by Gastius, you will see the impiety of the Emperor. Although our lord and friend von Reischach defends him remarkably.</p>
      <p>Moreover, M. Theobaldus Nigri had written that Krakow is besieged by the Turk. I hope for better things. Nothing is more terrible than this; for without difficulty, it would be an entry into Saxony. And a pamphlet circulates about the betrayal of certain Italians against Gran. They claim that Stuhlweißenburg has also been captured.</p>
      <p>These are the present times. May the Lord protect His word. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, on the first of October in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned D. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
