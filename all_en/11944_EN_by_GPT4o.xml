    <p xml:id="regest1">They hope, with Bullinger's help, to find a successor for Johannes Wäber, who was called to Bern, and ask for information about Johannes Haller; they expect from a preacher not only scholarship but also an exemplary way of life. In addition, they want to know whether Haller is obligated to Zurich and could be taken away from them again. Bullinger should report to them in writing about Haller's age, his experience in the preaching office, and his talent. They ask for the assurance that he would be left to them if necessary and not recalled without significant reasons.</p>

      <p>Revered, highly and well-learned sir, our tireless willing service to you.</p>
      <p>Especially gracious sir, your manifold goodness and demonstrated friendship towards us have once again encouraged us to seek your revered help and advice, so that we may, in place of Mr. Johannes Wäber (whom our gracious lords have called to them up to Bern, as you well know), obtain and secure another pious, diligent, faithful, and learned proclaimer of God's word through God's and your help. And it is conveyed to us by honorable people that one among our beloved lords of Zurich, named Johann Haller, who is a native of Bern and carries a commendable testimony of his teaching and life from your reverence, is hoped to be able to serve our church beneficially and fruitfully. Since we have no knowledge of his actions and conduct, we earnestly and insistently request your well-learned reverence to thoroughly inform us, in all confidentiality through this messenger, our council friend, about his skills, conduct, and life; for you carry high experience and knowledge of all the necessary qualities that a faithful teacher in the gospel of Christ needs to have, and how our church lacks one who not only instructs us with learning but also leads and improves us with an unblemished example of his conduct, for it is indeed the truth that no leader can beneficially and fruitfully lead his entrusted church and proclaim the word unless he has gained great respect and authority through the acquired knowledge of his honorable conduct, as it is inherent to every person to first demand the same from those who wish to teach and correct us, likewise also from his household, so that all of them are patterned after the rule of Paul, so that from all of them good example and model may flow and reach us unlearned and simple, ignorant laypeople.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is also our request to understand whether he is in any way bound to you, our dear lords of Zurich, in authority and duty, that you have the power, upon your request, to recall and take him back, which would be very undesirable and inconvenient for us, should we win favor and love for him and then have to let him go, as has happened to us with Mr. Johannes, which we cannot blame on our regular authorities; otherwise, it would not be allowed.</p>
      <p>In addition, we would also like to understand what age he is and whether he has preached before and whether God has granted him the grace to teach and proclaim His holy word, and that he has a good manner of speaking, and we would like you to inform us in writing about this matter, so that we can consider it and then act accordingly. We request this of your reverence, beyond which you are rendering a work pleasing to God, our Lord, to willingly serve us to the best of your ability.</p>
      <p>Given on the 23rd of April in the year of our Lord 1544.</p>
      <p>Your reverence's willing servants, the mayor and council of Aarau.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear sir, we request you to inform us whether, if we intend to recruit the aforementioned Mr. Haller, and if he is somewhat bound to you, our lords of Zurich, that you would kindly allow our church to retain him and that he may not be taken from us without significant cause and thus have nothing at all to do with him.</p>
      <p>To the revered, highly and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher and proclaimer of God's word in Zurich, our especially gracious and dear lord.</p>
