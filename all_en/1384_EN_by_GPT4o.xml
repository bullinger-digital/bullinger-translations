      <p>Because I once composed (and am still transcribing them) the last ten epistles of Paul along with the seven canonical ones poetically in French verses, I gladly use your commentaries on the thorny and more difficult passages. Therefore, because they please me greatly, I congratulate you and thank our God for the gift of His Spirit bestowed upon you. Among other things, I gladly read the irrefutable proofs you make regarding the Epistle to the Hebrews, that it was indeed written by Paul, although some are attempting at this very time to persuade otherwise. I also gladly read what you write and feel about bishops or presbyters in Ephesians 4 and Titus 1.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I beseech you, always continue in this opinion, which is pure and, if I am not mistaken, praised by the true pious. Confident in your gentleness and meekness, I will ask you that, if your Decades are ever reprinted, you remove from the title this word "archipresbyters" (as I once asked you); for it was enough and more than enough if only "deans" remained. And would that (because the papists have deans) instead of "deans" all classes would use some other inferior term in imitation of him (whom you also cite elsewhere), who, rejecting all those magnificent titles, wished to be called the servant of the servants of God. You know very well that fear arises gradually and that the papacy once had its beginning in this way; for after bishops or presbyters were called brothers, pastors, elders, teachers of the people, presbyters, bishops (which are their true names), these titles succeeded: lords, most reverend, most pious, most venerable, most observant, most excellent, most holy, cardinals, archbishops, patriarchs, archdeacons, archipresbyters, and also the pope, who is the antichrist.</p>
      <p>In our French language, some ministers of the word are no longer called brothers, bishops, presbyters, etc., but by many (who would rather remain silent about such titles) are called: monsieur le preacher, messieurs les preachers (and their wives) madame and mademoiselle and other worldly and magnificent titles (Frisius can interpret them for you), which suit princes and magistrates and their wives. Presbyters are to be honored with double honor; but I believe that you are not unaware that Paul and Peter do not mean these titles, who, writing to presbyters, call themselves presbyters. Christian man, confident in your humanity (as I said), and because I love your writings and those of your associates and embrace them, I write this to you, not because I wish (I, unlearned) to teach you, but to pray as a father. I also greatly rejoice in that agreement on the matter of the Eucharist, and would that all regions felt the same; it would be good if you sent many copies to the bishops of England (and elsewhere), lest now that Peter Martyr is dead, some ravenous wolves invade in the future.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor among us about a promised marriage between the King of England and the daughter of the King of France. You know that unions with unbelievers are prohibited in every way; therefore, the pious are amazed at the King of England and his council, but they conjecture that the Englishman would never have done this unless he had set some articles for mitigating (or rather completely removing) the persecution of Christians in France. It is held for certain here that the pope has excommunicated the Parmesans along with their assistants (who are French) never to be absolved. Oh, would that France with its king did not care to be absolved by that charlatan. It is also said that the Turk is planning something against Rome to capture it.</p>
      <p>Many other things are reported, which are in doubt; but Mr. Morelet, the king's envoy, will soon return, from whom more certain things will be heard about everything, to the glory of God, as I hope. Meanwhile, farewell well in Christ and, forgiving me, use my work wherever it seems fit to you, in the Lord. May the Lord keep you and all our church. If you will greet all your pious assistant ministers (and other learned and pious men) by name in my name, you will do me a most pleasing thing. Basel, August 26, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your humble brother Eustorgius or Hector de Beaulieu. To the pious and faithful man Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
