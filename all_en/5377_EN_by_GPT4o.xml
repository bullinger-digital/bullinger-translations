      <p>From Lyon, 24th June 1562. Lord Davannes, commander at Dijon, has strongly besieged Mâcon (Mattisch - gouam) and fired 1602 shots with large cannons, opening the wall and defenses to 14 steps, yet he did not storm it and withdrew in disgrace. This lord had blocked the roads all the time he was in the siege, intercepting all letters, so we here could not have any accurate account of the events for a long time. Now a courier has come here (to the governor in Lyon, Lord de Sol); he brings a detailed report, and another one comes who says confidently that he was there and witnessed it. The Duke of Guise, along with his lords and troops, has left Paris, taken his powerful vanguard, and with them moved to a place between Paris and Orléans, with good hope to accomplish something brave and to take the place. However, Prince of Condé, along with his lords, has handed over or assigned to Lord de Gramont 4000 selected arquebusiers and 1200 of the best, most courageous horses. With them, Lord de Gramont has joyfully advanced in the name of God, and both forces, those of Guise and Gramont, have fiercely begun to skirmish, which has led to a battle and fierce fight, where the vanguard held bravely; but God has given victory to Lord de Gramont, and very few from the vanguard have escaped. Lord of Guise himself was badly shot, Lord of Danville captured, and the great marshal, Lord of Saint-André, a great enemy of God, remained dead on the field. The artillery was captured; the camp of Guise has retreated 8 miles.</p>
      <p>The old governor of Lyon is lying with 12000 strong before Avignon, the Pope's city, to avenge the disgrace and murder that happened to those from Orange, and many of ours are said to be among those who were so shamefully treated; they have received their deserved reward. May God grant further grace.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
