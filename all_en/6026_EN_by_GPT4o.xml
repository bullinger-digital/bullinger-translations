      <p>God be with us all! Friendly, dearly beloved lord and brother, I understood well enough that it would be convenient for your dear sister and especially for you at this time if she, along with another appointed person, would take care of the church in Leutmerken and leave you in peace, without you having to preach further; because at this time (and as things stand, and since little is being said to the Five Cantons, and they, while they can hold the sea with five hands, are letting little be taken from them) these people are being set, especially when they have some appearance, that must go through.</p>
      <p>I was concerned about how they would act, as you are a man in exile, not having your rights and yet preaching in their territories, that they would not tolerate it, etc., and one might possibly take you into custody, as these people do what they want as long as God allows them to.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if I were in your place, I would stand still for a while and let another take care of the parish until your dear sister could better investigate the matter, etc.</p>
      <p>For I write this out of my own good opinion; because the people are very restless and arrogant. May God grant them to recognize and improve! Now you may do what you think is best. I just received a letter from Mr. Beza from Geneva, but it contains nothing but complaints about the treason committed against Geneva, and that the affairs of France are proceeding complicatedly. However, Viret writes to me from Lyon that the affairs of the French church are not bad; the letters are dated the first of January. There are three cardinals in France who are trying everything, two sent to the court by the pope, the one from Ferrara and the one from Santa Croce; the third is the very devil himself, the Lorrainer, who is acting in Lorraine and devising amazing plans, having many at court.</p>
      <p>May the Lord destroy the counsel of the wicked!</p>
      <p>By sheer luck, I managed to catch this messenger who is leaving, to whom I handed these hastily written notes, so as not to send nothing. For the edict of Emperor Maximilian, I give you great thanks, which I hereby return.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on the day of Charles 1564.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours.</p>
      <p>Yours truly.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Leutmerken, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Leutmerken.</p>
