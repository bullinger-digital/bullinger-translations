      <p>To the most distinguished and esteemed man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most revered friend and lord, I, Friedrich von Salis, send my greetings. I received your letter, most revered Lord Bullinger, dated November 25th of the past month, and indeed it was by far the most delightful of all, as it came from someone whom I uniquely revere, love, and implore. Therefore, I give you special thanks for valuing me so highly that, setting aside your own affairs, which are far more significant, you deign to refresh me from time to time with your truly delightful letters. But indeed, as you seem to accuse me of a longer silence, since I have not written to you for a while, it is only fair, and I ask you to excuse me in this matter; for it is not my fault, but the treachery of the messengers, that you receive my letters more rarely. For I wrote my last letter to you on October 29th of the past month, and I find that it was not delivered to you; for in it, among other things, I was also diligently thanking you, just as I do now, for your most elegant sermons on Jeremiah, which you gifted to me. This gift was indeed most welcome to me (and equally well-received by my esteemed father-in-law and Lord Peter Bergomati, as well as other friends with whom I shared it), and this is why I did not mention these sermons in my last letter to you. However, I suspect that my last letter was lost due to the negligence of the messenger, who did not deliver my letters, which I had entrusted to him, to Chur. But in the meantime, I confess, most revered Lord Bullinger, that I am deeply indebted to you for writing that you are not without discomfort in being deprived of my letters for a longer time, since you love me and all that is mine, and the less I deserve that you love me or desire my most unpolished writings, the more I thank you and attribute all this to the singular purity of your mind, and I will strive diligently so that you may not justly accuse me of a longer silence in the future. Furthermore, what you write about my little son pleases me greatly, and I congratulate both my son and myself as his father, and I thank my God that he has found you as a patron and nurturer, who so kindly, indeed truly paternally, supports him, and may that same most excellent and greatest God repay you and yours; for I confess that I cannot return equal or worthy thanks. But as you write that you do not particularly praise the idea of young men having money secretly to spend, I gather from this that you also do not praise my habit of sometimes including one or two coins in the letters I write to my son. But, most distinguished lord, I would like you not to believe that this is done out of fear that my boy lacks something and therefore I wish to provide assistance (I am well aware that you will not allow him to lack anything necessary); but this is done solely so that he may have a memento of me. However, it was not unpleasant for me to hear that the boy is frugal, as you write, and does not spend even the smallest amounts of money without your consent, and I take this as a good omen that he will someday be a worthy manager of family affairs. For those who are imbued with such qualities from a young age will preserve them, etc.</p>
      <p>As for his clothing and attire, as well as his other necessary matters, arrange them according to your discretion.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have nothing new to write.</p>
      <p>Everything is quite peaceful with us, except that a certain disease is spreading here, which soldiers coming from Italy and passing through here have brought with them, from which many, indeed, have died here and almost everywhere in the communities through which they have passed. They call this disease "den langen siechtag" (the long sickness); may the Lord heal it!</p>
      <p>From Italy, I hear nothing except that the Duke of Ferrara is, as I understand, sheltering around 12,000 infantrymen in winter quarters, including Rhaetians, Swiss, French, and Italians, as well as several squadrons of cavalry. The Imperialists, however, are staying in Parma and the surrounding areas, as it is said.</p>
      <p>It is believed that the war in Italy should be renewed in the coming spring. May the Lord arrange everything according to His good pleasure!</p>
      <p>From France, we have absolutely nothing. I do wish to hear what the Swiss envoys have achieved with the King of France, and I sincerely wish for their most successful outcome, so that the Christians in France may be well advised. The little book on the baths, which Mr. Gesner or you on his behalf requested from me, I will bring with me (such as it is) after the next Chur fair, as I wrote before. I thank Mr. Johann Herter, the steward, for the efforts he expends on my son every day, and I will be grateful to him in person when I arrive, according to your judgment. But since I have been quite lengthy so far, it is fitting that I sound the retreat.</p>
      <p>Farewell, then, my most illustrious and delightful Lord Bullinger, along with my son and your entire family, as well as with the most distinguished men, your sons-in-law, whom you will kindly greet in my name. Likewise, I pray you will greet the venerable and learned elders, Mr. Bernardino Ochino and Mr. Peter Martyr Vermigli, as well as Mr. Walther, Mr. Frisius, and finally the entire assembly of illustrious learned men, to whom I sincerely wish to be commended. Once again, farewell, my most revered lord, and may the most excellent and greatest God keep you safe for us for years as long as Nestor's! Given in Samaden on December 15, 1557.</p>
      <p>The same who above is most devoted to you, Friedrich von Salis. Postscript.</p>
      <p>At the very hour I wrote this, some merchants arrived from the Duchy of Milan, asserting that it is certainly affirmed there that a fierce battle was fought a few days ago not far from Paris between the French and the English, and that about 12,000 fell on the French side, and about 8,000 on the English side, and that the victory, however, was with the English, and on both sides, notable men and nobles fell, as it is said that in the army of the most Christian king, the Duke of Guise, Lord de Brissac, and many other distinguished princes are missing.</p>
      <p>But in Philip's army, they say that the Marquis of Pescara fell with 13 leaders of great renown, and that the Duke of Savoy was wounded with quite dangerous injuries. But I hope for better things, as I consider this report to be false; however, if anything of the sort, as the merchants reported, is true (which God forbid), you would surely have already been informed by the letters of friends. Once again, farewell much, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and esteemed man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my always most revered and esteemed friend and lord. To the highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my especially dear lord and friend in Zurich.</p>
