    <p xml:id="regest1">Confirm the receipt of the letter [No. 836] and praise the zeal of Count Georg. Although Erasmus Schmid could have been well used in ZÃ¼rich due to the shortage of pastors, the council has once again released him for a certain period to complete the reform work in Riquewihr. They commend themselves and Schmid to the Count.</p>

      <p>The grace of God and the peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with Your Grace at all times, high-born prince, gracious lord.</p>
      <p>We have received Your Grace's letter and praised God, who has given you such a noble mind, so inclined and eager to promote His honor. We also pray to God that He may increase His grace in you, and also bring such brave Christian endeavors to a good end.</p>
      <p>And although we would have reluctantly missed M. Erasmus, our dear lord and brother, and could have well used him here with us, as we are exhausted of learned and capable persons, the Almighty has graciously arranged it so that he has been released by our lords and superiors, to the praise of God and to Your Grace's special pleasure, to serve you and to provide for the church in Riquewihr for a certain time, in the hope that Your Grace will be helped, so that eventually the begun work of God will be completed energetically and especially, that with Christian mandates all offensive vices will be abolished, and that open idolatry and intolerable abuses in the church of God will be removed according to God's word and God's order will be established in place of the abandoned heresy, as is fitting for your duty, pleasing to God the Lord, and as all God-loving kings, lords, and rulers have also done before Your Grace, thereby obtaining eternal praise before God and the world, as Your Grace undoubtedly has good reports from all kinds of true histories.</p>
      <p>With this, we further humbly and most earnestly ask Your Grace to graciously commend our beloved lord and brother, M. Erasmus, whom we have always found worthy of all honor, honest and faithful, along with all those who preach the name of Christ. We do not doubt that God will richly reward such a well-pleasing service to Your Grace and your land and people. If we can serve Your Grace, we will not spare ourselves to please Your Grace in all humility.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, the last day of June.</p>
