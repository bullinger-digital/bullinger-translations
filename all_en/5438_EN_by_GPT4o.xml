      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Your letters have greatly saddened me, both because of the acceptance of Castalio against the ecclesiastical laws and because of the recall of our soldier. Initially, I wrote a letter in German, which you can show to Mr. Steiger and trusted individuals: if it is still possible to prevent this certainly bad matter. I beg you, however, to use such prudence that he, being contentious as he is, does not take the opportunity to attack and disturb me. I do not like dealing with such heads.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I cannot abandon the common cause of the church. If, however, with this writing you cannot prevent the senate from wanting to confirm his appointment, I advise you to request a clear exposition of faith from him or to examine him: especially on the matter of the Trinity, Servetus, whether Anabaptists and sectarians are to be punished. Ask what he thinks about the Anabaptists, about free will and election, whether he believes all are indiscriminately chosen? Does he believe those who teach that faith alone justifies are teaching correctly? He should also be without fault.</p>
      <p>It is said that he believes such perfection can be attained in this life that we satisfy the works of the law.</p>
      <p>In short, I fear that he may harbor many prodigious doctrines. Therefore, examine everything diligently.</p>
      <p>May the Lord repay those who place such scandals to disturb the churches. Farewell to you and yours.</p>
