    <p xml:id="regest1">Welser thanks for Bullinger's letter from March 12 [not received]. He is convinced that [Johannes] Haller will be successful [in Augsburg] and is willing to support him in this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He hopes that God's word may remain pure despite the behavior of the Lutherans, who court the papacy regarding the Eucharist, the veneration of images, and confession. He encloses Melanchthon's [“Oration at Luther's Funeral”] and also the report [by Justus Jonas and Michael Caelius] on Luther's death. In the [report], the Eucharist and absolution are honorably emphasized, where all honor should belong to God alone, through whom Luther received all good things, while everything else, by which he might have tried to ingratiate himself with the papacy, does not need to be praised. It would be good if Bullinger could ensure relaxation [in the intra-Protestant disputes] with Melanchthon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- In the last letter from Speyer, the presence of Emperor [Charles V] and Elector Palatine [Frederick II] was mentioned, while they were still waiting for Landgrave [Philip of Hesse]. The Emperor announced that he wanted to establish peace in the empire at the Diet [of Regensburg]. Nevertheless, various intrigues are being woven, and the Pope [Paul III] is also urging his council in Trent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- At the [Schmalkaldic League] meeting scheduled for April 1 in Worms, the [Schmalkaldic] League is to be extended for the preservation of the truth of Christ. May God protect us from the Italians and Spaniards!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Welser also thanks on behalf of his wife [Barbara, née Adler] for the greetings from the [Zurich] mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater] and sends greetings to them and Bullinger's entire family. In view of the actions of the Antichrist, may the Lord let the evil intentions of the [opponents] come true upon themselves.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [Johannes] Haller will report how the Spaniard [Juan Diaz], who converted to Protestantism, was murdered in Neuburg [on the Danube] at the instigation of his brother [Alfonso Diaz]. The perpetrators [Alfonso Diaz and Juan Prieto] are imprisoned in Innsbruck. If the papacy tries to maintain itself only in such a way, one must have pity on it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Christ, with the offering of my willing service, I send to you, dear Herr Bullinger, in advance. I have received your Christian letter from March 12 and thank you for your friendly and gracious will. May the Lord reward you. Please also pray for me, that He may keep me in His grace through the merit of Jesus Christ until the end. I am confident in God the Lord, that Herr Haller will accomplish much good here. Whatever love and friendship I can show him in the Lord, he will find me willing.</p>

      <p>I hope that God the Lord will keep His word pure and that the Lutherans will not be able to change it. They court the papacy with the Eucharist, images, confession. You also have here how Luther died, what Melanchthon preached about it, where he is highly praised for the Eucharist, absolution is announced, where yet all honor belongs to God alone. For the good he has done, he received from above, the other, which he wanted to strive for himself, without doubt, to reconcile with the papacy, does not need much praise, more pity. It would be good if you, dear Herr, could find relaxation with Herr Philipp Melanchthon. It would benefit the truth and all churches.</p>

      <p>In the last letter from Speyer, the Emperor was still there, the Elector Palatine with him, they were waiting for the Landgrave. His Majesty graciously announced that he wanted to establish peace and tranquility in the empire at this Diet. But alongside this, there are all sorts of intrigues; the Pope and his council in Trent do not rest either. Time will reveal it. The Lord must preserve us! We will do as much as the Lord grants us grace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>On the first of April, now the day in Worms, I hope the alliance will be extended again (even if His Majesty had something else in mind), so that the truth of Christ may be preserved. For one owes more to God than to men, and the Antichrist's empire cannot be tolerated by any pious Christian and righteous people. For God the Lord will protect, shield, preserve, and guard us from the yoke of the Italians and Spaniards. May the Almighty grant us this graciously through the merit of Christ, amen!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I thank you, also my wife, for the friendly greetings from my fellow mayors. Likewise, to you and yours. May dear God richly reward you all. Please also greet both mayors friendly in return. So you know from us all in the Lord and yours as well. Christ, our Redeemer, help us together in His kingdom! Pray for us; we will do the same. For the world is deceitful; Satan stirs diligently in the Antichrist. Therefore, pray from necessity, that the Lord may break their evil plans, let them fall on their own heads, what they have intended for others, as they are otherwise not worthy of any mercy from the Lord.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>As a Spaniard, who accepted the gospel, was murdered in Neuburg at the instigation of his brother, you will hear from Herr Haller. The perpetrators are imprisoned in Innsbruck. If the papacy cannot maintain itself otherwise, it is to be pitied!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>And with this, in haste, I commend us all to the grace of the Lord. Dated Augsburg, the 2nd day of April 1546.</p>
      <p>Your willing Hans Welser.</p>
      <p>[To the reverend and highly learned Herr Heinrich Bullinger, leader in the word of God in Zurich, my dear lord and good friend. Zurich.]</p>
