      <p>Greetings. A bundle of letters from Augsburg by Mr. Vergerio was brought to me these days, most learned man, which I was about to send to you, when by chance his nephew presented himself, to whom I will also entrust the remaining letters that you sent to me, which I have kept until now due to the lack of messengers. Moreover, most kind man, it is written to me by good men that I am being spoken of very badly among many, as if I were the greatest adversary of the people of Zürich, particularly in the matter of the bridge, about which your most honorable council and ours had long since agreed (which I wish would happen immediately), unless Mr. Zimpert and I were inciting our magistrate to worse. But Mr. Simpert excused himself long ago; now, when I hear that I am also being added, I too needed an excuse. However, the only thing that comforts me is that those who know me will never believe such things; for what perversity and utmost ingratitude (than which nothing worse or more wicked can exist) would it be if I wished or hoped ill for the people of Zürich, among whom I was treated most kindly and that for several years, and to whom I owe almost everything of mine, from whom I also received my most chaste and beloved wife, part of my possessions, and who also uniquely focused on this, as soon as I was called here, that there would be greater familiarity between our church and yours, who would be ready to expose my life for them if necessity required, who sometimes assert them so much that they say I am a Zürcher, not a Schaffhauser. Who then will believe that I wish them ill or incite others against them? No one indeed, nor will anyone ever find me to be against them, as I love them and wish them well from the heart. Through your humanity, most excellent man, I beg you to act on my behalf and defend me from this injury; if I can do nothing else, I will at least pray to the Lord for you constantly.</p>
      <p>For Mr. Felix Renner and Lampert Zender heard at some banquet, where learned and distinguished men were present, such things being babbled about me and Mr. Simpert, to whom I would have written if I had had enough leisure. But I trust you will vindicate me from this slander, wherever your humanity is with good men and something about this matter is discussed.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, about German affairs, I have nothing to write except what is undoubtedly well known to you: namely, several princes of the empire and with them Margrave Albrecht have united in a league; four of them have been selected, who alone will handle the entire cause without the knowledge of others.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand has been added. The commander of the army is Christoph, Duke of Württemberg, Schertlin is the lieutenant. They will prevent Philipp from being elected as Emperor upon his arrival. The Frenchman sent a large amount of gold to the Margrave, which was transported through our city; he stands on the side of the French, he is an adversary of the Emperor.</p>
      <p>The reason: when the Emperor had allowed him to proceed to demand from the bishops what they owed, and he had begun to accomplish this, the Emperor secretly wrote to the bishops that he was compelled by necessity to permit this to the Margrave; therefore, he urged them to resist as much as they could either by law or by force. When the Margrave noticed this, he defected from the Emperor again to the French, although some say he was never an adversary of the French, except when the city of Metz was besieged, to which he was compelled by the treachery of the French. He has now gathered a new army, 4000 well-equipped cavalry, as many infantry as are contained in 20 banners. He also writes that he will soon have either 8000 cavalry. The pretext is the assertion... the restoration of German liberty. I fear that private interest intervening will disturb everything; the plan is that the Frenchman does not attack the Emperor's forces in one place, the princes will attack him in other places. They write to the Emperor and the people of Augsburg themselves, not to come to any assemblies with more than 300 men on horseback and on foot. Who knows what the outcome of these tumults will be; nowhere is faith safe. Among us, many are breathing war; arms and men are clashing here. May the Lord therefore have mercy on us in such great confusion of affairs and direct all plans and undertakings of all to the glory of His name and for the sake of asserting the tranquility of the church. The English are asking the French for auxiliary troops and a sum of money; this was denied, but he promised to provide soldiers to be paid from his own stipend for their aid. You, most kind man, may you deign to write what you have. Farewell and live well. Hastily. Schaffhausen, April 20, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Jakob Rüeger.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and virtuous Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy and faithful Antistes of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
