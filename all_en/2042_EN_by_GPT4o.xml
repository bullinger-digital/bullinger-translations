      <p>Greetings. You have done us a pleasant and beneficial service by informing us of the matters taking place in Geneva and sending us your judgment, even though we were not unaware of these matters. For we had heard from someone of no small literary reputation returning to Italy; but he, favoring the cause of Servetus, presented everything more favorably. Therefore, it was useful and necessary for us to hear the truth of the matter from you. Otherwise, we have seen more than once in our Confederation those who, many years ago, spewed forth this diabolical heresy, clearly revealing it. You will still see more things that ambitious and restless minds will bring forth, refusing to humbly and simply walk the same path with others. Otherwise, you have responded to the Genevans, by Hercules, no less aptly and prudently than piously and Christianly. Would that all those who are learned in Basel do the same, and that this evil may have no supporters there, so that it may be completely eradicated! This is not to punish unbelief, but to prevent such a pestilent poison from spreading among the people. Meanwhile, I am using the help of my sons in writing letters; for I myself cannot write due to the pain in my leg, and I am using the medicines brought from Clavenna through the intercession of Mr. Vergerius, through which I am now beginning to feel better. If we had to act against the cunning Italian papists, I would prefer Vergerius to be here rather than elsewhere; but who among us, who are preachers in the Confederation, can awaken us from the sleep of avarice and impel us to teach diligently, rebuke severely, and exhort sacredly, so that we do everything not superficially?</p>
      <p>Indeed, we speak no lies, but nevertheless, as the saying goes, we are like donkeys, neglecting those who need it most, lest we lose the goodwill we have poorly gained.</p>
      <p>But lest I bore you (judge the lion by its claws). Farewell and continue to love us in return. Comander and the others you know greet you.</p>
      <p>Given at Chur, on the 19th day of October in the year 1553. Your courteous Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
