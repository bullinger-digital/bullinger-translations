      <p>Greetings. Receive, my dearest brother and most esteemed lord, the copies of these letters. I thought that they contain things which you absolutely ought to know. Therefore, I took care to have them copied by my son-in-law.</p>
      <p>More detailed letters will be brought by Mr. Thomas Lever, the Englishman, whom I entrusted with them yesterday to be delivered to you. Mr. Crispin, our friend, was conveniently present, to whom I wished to give these. Farewell. ZÃ¼rich, the last day of September, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
