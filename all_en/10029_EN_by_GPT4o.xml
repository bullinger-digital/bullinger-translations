    <p xml:id="regest1">Makes critical remarks on a communion writing by Bullinger sent to him, which seems too polemical to him, shares the argument from Ex 12:11 important for the symbolic doctrine of the Lord's Supper, and answers a question about worship among the Hebrews.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ.</p>
      <p>What you wrote about the bread of the Eucharist against Bartholomew, dearest brother, is pleasing, but I fear that you have wasted oil and labor. For unless they believe, they will not understand, and you are telling a story to the deaf; if they believed, there would be no need for more arguments. We must pray to God to awaken their minds, to illuminate the darkness, to draw them inwardly. And we were once darkness, but now by His grace, we are light [Eph 5:8], "who works all things in all" [1 Cor 12:6]. Therefore, I ask you to change certain words, with which you might seem to attack a brother too harshly, into milder ones, not because they are not worthy of such words, but because other things are fitting for us, unless you are dealing with the most deplorable and impious. "A bruised reed he did not break" Christ, "a smoldering wick he did not extinguish" [Isa 42:3], whom you wish to imitate in this matter. And there are those who wish to be led, not forced. However, while you separate the body from the divinity, while it is given, be careful that the adversary does not understand it differently than you intend and seeks your head from your words. For I do not understand how the divine nature could have left the body it once assumed, yet I do not doubt that only the body suffered, not the divinity. But what is this against him who argues that the body united with the divinity is to be worshiped? I write this not to support their side, but because I see the danger that he who tries the matter with these people with sophistries may be refuted by the sophistries on which they most rely.</p>
      <p>I would never trust myself to these Syrtes nor would I ever grant that the body is here, since "the flesh profits nothing" [John 6:63] and the expression is figurative: "this is my body" [1 Cor 11:24], that is, "this signifies, represents my body"; for this is not foreign to the sacred scriptures. But the strongest place to confirm this is found in Exod. 12 [11]: "For it is the Lord's Passover, that is, the passage." You see here "is" is used for "signifies," for the Lord had not yet passed over, but was to pass over the following night. And the lamb was not the Passover, but signified the Passover. Thus Christ had not yet been betrayed, but was betrayed the following night [1 Cor 11:23], of which this bread was a memorial and mnem[em]osynon, nor was it the body, but signified the body to suffer.</p>
      <p>"Schaha": In Hebrew means "to worship," to bend the knee or bow the head, to fall to the ground. Do not torment yourself, I bother you with my ineptitude, but take it in good part, dearest brother in Christ, in whom may you always fare well.</p>
      <p>From ZÃ¼rich, April 20, 1525.</p>
      <p>Your Leo Jud.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
