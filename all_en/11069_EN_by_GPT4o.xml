    <p xml:id="regest1">It would be - especially in the current situation - hopeless if he were to ask the [Bernese] council to admit a [foreign] boy into the Brugger scholarship. Bucer is said to have been asked [by the council] with whom he wanted to negotiate; based on his answer, further actions would then be determined. Megander urgently requests once again, in view of his untenable situation, to provide him with a house [in Zurich]. The woman, about whom Leo [Jud] wrote, is a deceitful gossip who not only slanders him and Berchtold [Haller] but has also caused trouble in Basel.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Regarding the admission of the boy from Bruges into our scholarship, since it is certain that it cannot be obtained, there is no point in referring it to the council, especially at this time. The matter does not seem worth attempting.</p>
      <p>As for Bucer's response, I understand that the man was answered in this way: When he not only mentions us but also other Swiss churches in his writings, the lords want to know whether he intends to act with or against us; once this is understood more broadly, they promise to consult on what to do.</p>
      <p>As for my own situation: I certainly cannot express in words the labyrinth I am constantly in. My situation is so complicated and inextricable that I see no way out. Therefore, I beg through Christ that you help me out of it. There are certainly those who, by running up and down diligently, try to make everyone an enemy and adversary to me; for this reason, no one who is not deaf does not understand. Therefore, I beg through Christ and our mutual friendship and brotherhood, that you take care of my house, that is, promise it in the manner prescribed above. Once this is done, I will return home and move my belongings either to Pinder's house or some other place. Help me, I implore you; necessity is pressing.</p>
      <p>The woman, about whom Leo recently wrote more, is vain, frivolous, deceitful, slanderous, seditious, a disturber of the republic, unjust not only towards her husband but towards all of us. I never thought of her, let alone Berchtold, the things she falsely accused us of. From this, you can easily infer that all the rest is also fabricated and maliciously concocted. It is indeed true, as she narrates, that she has pestered me at home with these trifles more than once. But because I know the woman, I have always considered her worthless and still do. In Basel, she stirred up a completely different and entirely diverse tragedy. She is a slanderer and a lying woman, whose words are not to be trusted. Are they satisfied with her? O division, o heresy, how hateful and hostile are the factions that arise from you! Megander would never have believed this unless he had seen it with his own eyes and almost experienced it through the cross.</p>
      <p>Hurry with the house, and you will soon have the matter narrated before me.</p>
      <p>July 27, in the year 37.</p>
      <p>Your Megander.</p>
      <p>To his dearest friends and brothers Bullinger and Leo, preachers in Zurich.</p>
