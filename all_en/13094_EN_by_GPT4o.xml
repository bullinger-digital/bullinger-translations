    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Through a letter from Mayor [Hans Bodmer] and the council of the city of Lindau, Count Georg was asked to mediate in the matter of Hans Vogler the Younger, as can be seen from the enclosed manuscripts from Lindau. Hans Vogler the Elder is to be appeased in his anger, for he has withdrawn all support from his son Hans Vogler the Younger because he married [Maria Grafner] in Augsburg against his will.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Since Bullinger is unlikely to object to mediation and his admonition will probably resonate with the father, he should intercede with him on behalf of the two young people (whose honorable life is confirmed by the authorities in Lindau) so that the father gives up his resentment, does not get too upset about the wife's modest fortune, and thus no longer causes offense! Count Georg also wrote to him in this sense. The son (just like the Count) will be grateful to Bullinger for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Count thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received] with the news, some of which was already known to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Johannes Bugenhagen published a writing [“How it fared with us in Wittenberg”] about the events that took place during the war in Wittenberg, and about the reopening of the university by Duke Moritz of Saxony. Bullinger will have already received the writing.</p>

      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard, etc. Our greetings to you, dear friend! We wish to inform you of our gracious intention, that we have been approached by the mayor and council of the city of Lindau regarding Johann Vogler the Younger (as he has married a woman in Augsburg against his father's will and thus fallen out of favor with him, so that he no longer wishes to offer him any help or support) with special diligence (as you can understand from the enclosed copy of their letter) to mediate, so that the father's firm anger may be turned away.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Since we suspect that you are inclined to help calm such matters, as they have already happened, and since the elder Vogler will not easily escape your influence, you should, on behalf of the two young people (who have a good testimony of their honorable character and life from the people of Lindau), present the best case to the father, so that he may let go of such resentment against the son, not focus too much on the wife's modest fortune (since she is not particularly wealthy), but rather consent to the marriage to avoid greater offense, as we ourselves have also written to him at length and advised him to consider, trusting that he will, to please us, show himself more lenient towards the son and not give cause for further discord; to which you should also contribute and be inclined to promote the matter for the best. In doing so, you undoubtedly perform a truly good work, for which the young Vogler will undoubtedly be grateful to you; and we are inclined to show you our gracious will.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We have also received your letter along with the recent news (some of which we had previously known). We thank you for it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It has been published by Pomeranus how the events in this war at Wittenberg unfolded, as well as how Duke Moritz restored the university, etc. We assume you have already received the same.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>With this, we commend you to God. Dated Basel, the 17th of October, in the year, etc., 47. G. Count of Württemberg, etc. To the well-learned, our dear friend, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to be delivered.</p>
