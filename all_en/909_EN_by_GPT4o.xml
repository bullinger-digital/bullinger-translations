      <p>S. Hilerus and Bumann owe here; people come to me and ask that, while I write to you, I also remember them; for they trust that through you they can be paid more quickly; that is, if the debtors are reminded by you. They had decided to send collectors; but I prevented this by promising to do as you see, so that the expenses would not become greater. Among them is one who says he is known to you and even familiar; he is a bathkeeper, Rudolf Berchtold, convinced that you will do something for him, provided you receive a reminder. Indeed, I do not willingly abuse you for such trivial matters nor do I want you to comply yourself; send a reminder and it will be enough.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new except about the people of Strasbourg. The bishop prevailed upon the Emperor, so that he wrote to the magistrate not only to receive the priests but also to protect them along with all their abominations. The deadline for the restoration of the mass was the Sunday of Exaudi; but it has now been postponed until the feast of Pentecost.</p>
      <p>The same people of Strasbourg say that the Emperor is certainly on the way and they complain that his arrival will be unfortunate for them and not only for them, but also for all of us, for the word of the Lord and Christ in the heavens.</p>
      <p>Today Dryander told me that the Pope is sending two cardinals to the Swiss, but for what reason, he says he does not know. If you have any certain information, let me know. Farewell with your family in the Lord. In Basel, hastily, May 22, 1550.</p>
