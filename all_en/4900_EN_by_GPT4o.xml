      <p>Bustan Pasha has died, leaving 40,000 crowns to ransom those who were captured at Djerba, because he said that the plague would continue in Byzantium as long as they were detained. Seven million were found with him and went to Suleiman, and Eli Pasha, a Slav by nationality, was appointed in his place. The Duke of Sessa will soon return to Milan with his wife.</p>
      <p>The Pope is considering going to Bologna; Cardinal Puteus will be for the Pope. There is not much agreement among the papal nephews, as the Italians see the Germans being preferred over them. There is talk of marrying Philip's sister to the Duke of Ferrara.</p>
      <p>The subjects are being demanded 300,000 crowns by the Florentine. Duke Alba will return to Italy with John of Austria, who is to be designated as the Prince of Siena.</p>
      <p>Bergamo is being fortified or rather deserted, with the citizens pleading in vain. Everything is conducted under the counsel and authority of Sforza Pallavicini.</p>
      <p>It is said that 28 ships with troops from Spain are to arrive in Genoa. The Three Leagues are writing to the Three Confederates, saying they should remove the preachers from the MÃ¼stair Valley, or they will not let it go unchallenged; for they are in danger, as their own are also being led astray. Therefore, a meeting is scheduled in Chur on August 28.</p>
      <p>Thus, these men eventually dictate to everyone, not just the people of Glarus.</p>
