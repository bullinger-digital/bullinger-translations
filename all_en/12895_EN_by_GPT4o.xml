    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The Abbot of St. Gallen [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee] is engaging in malicious plans against the city. He has once again invented a new reason for accusation, claiming that St. Gallen intends to tax the monastery subjects who are involved in the linen trade, which the city has no intention of doing. The Abbot pretends that he was prompted to take this step by the subjects. However, the people of St. Gallen know from a reliable source that the Abbot has encouraged the peasants to make such complaints through his officials, and even threatened those who, out of goodwill towards the city, refused to complain. It is also known that the bailiff [...] of a locality [...] urged those present to raise their hands if they were in favor of proceedings against the city. When no one did, he scolded the citizens and told them to think of their advantage and raise their hands. This accusation by the Abbot is purely attributable to envy. The monks are envious of the prosperity of St. Gallen. It annoys them to see how well the city manages without them. Therefore, they shy away from no trick or slander. In this, not only religion but also the old enmity [between the city and the monastery] plays a role.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Vadian did not want to withhold this from his good friend and asks him to also inform the mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab, as well as other confidants. They should also know that the people of St. Gallen want to bring the matter before the Diet [in Baden] if the Abbot does not cease his intrigues. They are only striving for their rightful claim and want to prevent further slanders and threats. It is not about any gain for them. Bullinger knows what Vadian means. They hope for a just judgment but fear the opposite.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] May the Lord protect His own from the snares of the devil!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S.:] If Bullinger, as Vadian wishes, shows this letter to the mayors, he should present a copy of it, as if he had translated Vadian's writing from Latin, so that no one, except Bullinger and [Itelhans] Thumysen, sees what Vadian has noted in the margin.</p>

      <p>Our abbot is engaging in all sorts of schemes with his crooked plans against our city of St. Gallen. He has once again invented a new accusation, claiming that we intend to unfairly burden his monastery subjects involved in our linen trade, which is not the case, nor will it be. He pretends that he was prompted to take this step by his subjects. However, we have learned from reliable sources and have no unfounded reports that his officials have incited the peasants to make such complaints and have even threatened some who, out of goodwill towards the city, refused to comply. For instance, a bailiff brought the matter before a community and supposedly said: "Whoever agrees that we should complain against the city, raise your hand," etc., and when no one wanted to raise their hand, he supposedly said: "Raise your hand, may God punish you! Don't you consider your own benefit and advantage?" etc. But (as true as God is our savior) it is nothing other than envy of the prosperity of a city, and the monks cannot bear to see that we can manage without them, shying away from no calumny or slander. This is not only about religion but also about old inherited hatred and enmity.</p>

      <p>I did not want to withhold this from you, my most trusted friend, with the request to inform the mayors Lavater and Haab of the same and other confidants, and that they should not expect anything else from us than that we will bring our rightful claim to light (if he does not desist), so that we may enjoy it justly. We desire (God knows it) to bring nothing into our hands that we have not previously had and paid for with great effort. We only wish to be content with high gratitude in these matters and to be willing to earn all honor and respect with body and goods, so that we may be upheld and saved in that which we justly, fundamentally, and honorably have right and reason, and that we may be protected and prevented from being treated with treachery and deceit. You understand, as I understand; we wish for sincere knowledge to be given to us, we fear the sordid.</p>
