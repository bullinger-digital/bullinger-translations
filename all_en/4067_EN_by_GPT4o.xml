      <p>Greetings. Concerning those things which you wrote to me at the end of August and about your book, I am grateful, as it was not burdensome to read what came to my mind about those matters in which I often noticed errors in the Kingdom of France, which perhaps you would not approve of, if (but?) the place of love were to be felt. When I have added some things which seem to me to be changed in customs, I will send them.</p>
      <p>When I understand on what occasion your writing was presented, I will inform you. I have great hope in the King of Navarre; but, as Terence said, I do not fear, if it is in his power, but the force, so that he may be able to bear it.</p>
      <p>I have received that the day of judgment concerning the complaints of Germany has been postponed to the month of March, and in the meantime, it has been obtained from the ecclesiastics that those who wish to be of the evangelical name in their dominions, if they do not want to suffer them with them, will be allowed to migrate with all their possessions wherever they wish. But sometimes promises do not correspond to deeds.</p>
      <p>The envoys have been exchanged for the Bavarian and Württembergian, Madrutius and Georgius Palatinus, and it is not certain whether they will seek France or accomplish anything.</p>
      <p>The envoy of Savoy, who was with the Five Cantons, promises much to himself about them; he left here today. The other, who was with you, is also in great hope; may all be happy and prosperous.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Martyr, Gwalter, and Ochino. Farewell. September 4th.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
