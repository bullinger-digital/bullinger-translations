    <p xml:id="regest1">Opened and supplemented the letter [HBBW XIII, No. 1772] that had been left due to a lack of messengers. Emperor [Charles V] has taken Geldern from the House of Cleves, and even the city [Amersfoort or Geldern?] was handed over to the Emperor; despite the peace agreement with [Duke William], the war against [King Francis I] continues, and nothing good is expected from the [Imperial] Diet [at Speyer]. Requests a statement on the restitution of church property. Bullinger should write more often and take care of his health.</p>

      <p>After these letters had been hidden for a long time due to a lack of messengers, I opened them and added this appendix. You know that Emperor Charles V has conquered Geldern and it was redeemed by the Duke of Cleves, the city was voluntarily left to the Emperor by the Geldern, meanwhile, peace was arranged with the Duke of Cleves, but the war with King Francis I of France continues, and nothing good is expected from the Imperial Diet at Speyer.</p>
      <p>If only you would write to me about the restitution, which is indeed rejected here by those who usurped the church's property at the beginning of the Gospel!</p>
      <p>Farewell, love me, which I would indeed feel if you would write more often in a few words at the fairs and take care of your health.</p>
      <p>In haste, in the year of Gregory 1544.</p>
