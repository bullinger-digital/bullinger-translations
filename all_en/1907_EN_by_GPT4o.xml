      <p>S. D. There was certainly no need, most illustrious and esteemed sir, to apologize at length for the brevity of your letter - letters written by someone who is ill seem sufficiently copious, indeed too lengthy; they are sufficiently polished, which prove themselves to be written with the utmost humanity and erudition -; on the contrary, I thank your kindness not so much for the most learned letters as for your utmost benevolence towards me.</p>
      <p>I have indeed dedicated the book "On Perfection, which Christians have in Christ" to the most powerful King of the French, because it seemed most fitting that a book written about Christ should be dedicated to one called the Most Christian; I took care to have it translated into the German language and then into French and printed, and thus I sent it bound to the prince through our Morlet of blessed memory; but even today I have not understood whether the king has received it.</p>
      <p>However that matter stands, about which I had no doubt, than the health of the king, I certainly loved and love France sincerely, both because it gives us so many martyrs of Christ, thus providing a certain argument that it has more true believers than any other nation, although in the meantime I do not approve of the persecutors and those making martyrs, and because it fosters honorable studies and has many most learned men and has greatly aided the cause of piety and letters. And for that reason, I certainly envy the most flourishing kingdom of France for those worst advisors, who are authors to the king of not good things, for which I greatly fear he will suffer disasters and bring the wrath of the Lord upon the otherwise illustrious kingdom.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on him and on all of us. - How pleasing is your judgment about Philipp! For I have always been pleased by the man's piety and erudition; but that excessive admiration for astrology in him greatly displeased me. Concerning Maurice, nothing further than what I recently wrote, I still hear. They say that the Emperor, the truculent beast, is not yet extinct, who they say is ascending to Trier. I send to your piety a booklet as a token of my respect for you.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell in Christ and keep me commended to your piety. ZÃ¼rich, 23 June 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Bullinger.</p>
