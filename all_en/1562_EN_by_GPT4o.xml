      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received your letter today, which mentions that for three years you have been inclined and still intend to publish a treatise in Latin and also in German under our name, if it were not for these dangerous times, etc. We express our gracious thanks for your humble disposition towards us and graciously inform you: although we, like all Christians, still bear the common burden of flesh and blood, and therefore must recognize ourselves as poor sinners before God, yet by His grace (praise be to Him) we have always and continually sought nothing dearer than the welfare of ourselves and our subjects, especially the salvation of souls through the promotion of God's word and His church among them, as the dear God has so far fatherly and wonderfully protected and preserved our people in this, and we heartily pray that He will continue to do so graciously, so that everywhere, without burden and fear, the eternal may be placed before the temporal to God's honor and the salvation of souls.</p>
      <p>And if you intend to attribute such a treatise to us, it is our gracious request to arrange matters so that the German follows the Latin immediately, and above all, that the preface you place on us and attach to the mentioned book be sent to us for review before any of it is arranged for printing or published. You should not understand this to mean that we are in need of your teaching, for we consider you much more above us and not useful to us in this regard, but solely because we perceive your Christian intention in this matter, that the preface on our behalf should be without excessive praise and commendation, and that you are reminded and informed by us for this reason alone, and not perhaps otherwise from a well-meaning inclination you bear towards us, that in this matter the measure from others may be overlooked and we may be understood or interpreted by them, we know not how and to what ambition. For, as the saying goes, too much praise and commendation is often considered a mockery by many; we are all children of Adam, etc.</p>
      <p>So you undoubtedly know already that we do not seek ambition in such matters, of which you should have this our letter as testimony and excuse. Therefore, we wish you to accept our good and gracious opinion (subject to your correction) and understand it in the best way from us.</p>
      <p>We will also then send you the preface, which we wish to have unadorned, along with our title according to your request. We would not withhold from you a gracious response to your letter requesting this.</p>
      <p>With that, may God bless you. Dated Schaffhausen, the 6th of February, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich, to be delivered.</p>
