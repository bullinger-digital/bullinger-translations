      <p>Greetings. Regarding what I recently wrote about the permitted passage of Gonzaga, I have meanwhile understood that it was done on the condition that he may pass without any armor or war equipment, if he wishes. Since he does not wish to do so, he will lead the army by another route into Lower Germany, namely through the Adige Valley. We have also received letters from Augsburg in the meantime, which indicate that Johann Friedrich, Duke of Saxony, passed away on March 3rd, and that his wife died nine days before him. Also deceased is Arnold, the treasurer of Duke Otto Heinrich, whom you know. We have nothing else from Augsburg, except that they write about the diet convened by the Emperor, which they nevertheless hope will not take place. Duke Christoph of Württemberg set out at the beginning of this month for Hohenrechberg, the castle, because the nobleman there, called Utz von Rechberg, stabbed two peasants. The Nurembergers are also supposed to be lying before Blasenburg, have conquered Ruchenpalm, are weary of the war, and are in great concern about the Margrave.</p>
      <p>In Ulm, they have a preacher again, who is quite Lutheran, and they hold three religions in succession in one church. This is written by Onofrio Hürus to Blaurer, who himself was there. The same writes many favorable things about England, but not very certain. He writes that Schertlin has indeed reconciled with the Emperor, but not yet with King Ferdinand, which is different from what was spread here about him; he has again placed a preacher in Burtenbach, where his lordship is. Since we received these things partly from Augsburg, partly from Blaurer, I wanted to share them with you, although I assume you have these and many other more certain things. Today, three new senators were elected, among whom Wolfgang von Erlach succeeded his brother Johann Rudolf, whom he will also (I do not doubt) surpass in prudence, and certainly now far excels in humanity.</p>
      <p>Questor Haller, our Musculus, and Schlatter, as well as my wife, send their greetings to you; may all yours be well.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Bern, March 28th. I write nothing to my brother; you will greet him from me and can share what seems appropriate.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his dear lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
