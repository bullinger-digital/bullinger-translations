      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I asked Mr. Celius about Mirandola, who said he had heard from merchants that the Barefoot Friars had established a chapter in Mirandola; many monks have come, brought armor, mostly chain shirts and breeches on donkeys; they have become many, among them some Spanish mercenaries, who wanted to open the city to others at night and hand it over to the imperial troops. This was discovered, the monks were captured at night, the war monks were hanged along with other monks. But Celius is expecting letters and perhaps you will hear a more certain story about this matter from Mr. Vergerio soon. Thus we see everything being done through treachery and deceit.</p>
      <p>I also wrote in my first letters about the bishops of Trier and Cologne gathered at Koblenz, and that is true; the Elector Palatine of the Rhine and other bishops, etc., have joined them and sent envoys to that assembly. What do you think they are consulting about? About making peace, about Ferdinand and Philip making peace. The Emperor is burdened by the Lord's plague, so that he does not know where to turn, although he does not cease to persecute that Lord nor does he want to give Him His own glory in these plagues.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the courier asked me to inform you that he has taken good care of the letters, even though he did not give them to me; for he happened by chance to meet the one to whom they were addressed. Nor do I want to keep this from you, even if it is ridiculous, today in our slaughterhouse no ox or cow was slaughtered; we will observe tomorrow the Lenten fast, ascending to heaven, where we do not need these carnal things. Farewell. Basel, May 6, 1551.</p>
      <p>Mr. Naogeorgus sends you his most respectful greetings. Please convey my greetings to Mr. Theodor, an excellent man, who is undoubtedly deeply saddened by the sudden death of Eleazar. Farewell forever. You will undoubtedly receive letters from Mr. Myconius.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, parish priest in Zurich, my kind, dear lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
