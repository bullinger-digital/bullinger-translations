      <p>The Lord Jesus Christ, our only savior, bless you, most illustrious prince and most gracious lord, and keep you and yours from all evil! I hope that our letters entrusted to the noble man, Mr. Belovacensi, have already been delivered to you.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on July 10th, the most noble Mr. von Montaigü, a knight of the order, came here, who among other things requested that if I received any news about the King of Poland, I should promptly inform you, my prince, whom I honor with perpetual respect. And I was able to conveniently accomplish this through our fellow citizen, who was about to set out to you, most gracious lord.</p>
      <p>Therefore, three days ago, noble students, certainly excellent men, two from Riga in Livonia, and a third from Holstein in Denmark, returning to their homeland, came directly from Padua. When they visited me for the sake of greeting and were asked by me, they indicated that the King of Poland was expected in Venice on July 11th. The Duke of Ferrara had arrived there to accompany him as far as Milan, from where he would soon hasten through Turin to France; he had been escorted by Emperor Maximilian from Vienna in Austria to Venice. They added that the king, having deceived the Poles, had escaped to Vienna with swift horses. However, I narrate these things to you, most gracious lord, with the same faith with which they were told to me. Yesterday, indeed, some Swiss military leaders passed through here to Solothurn to Bellevreium, the royal envoy, to receive money, as they say, with which to hire soldiers, whom they will lead to France for the king within a few days, about 6000 in number. Indeed, the magistrates of our most ample republic have promptly sent that supplication to all the Swiss orders, which they had received to be sent last week from Mr. Montaigü, and as far as I know, no response has yet been received. The one who brings this to your grace, Georgius... blius, is a citizen of our city, born of very honorable parents; his grandfather, a senator of the order and formerly the prefect of the county of Baden in Aargau, fell bravely in our war at Kappel, which our republic waged against the Five Cantons, along with other very pious men. This young man burns with singular zeal for the true religion and for you, the most illustrious prince, and desires to serve you and be received into your court, if it is convenient. Therefore, I commend him to your grace as diligently and earnestly as I can; he is a young man of integrity, not degenerating from his ancestors, so that I hope he will be diligent and faithful in all things. If I can serve you, most illustrious prince and most gracious lord, in any way, I will show myself ready in all things.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most gracious lord, together with all yours. Zurich, July 18th, in the year of our salvation 1574.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your grace, Heinrich Bullinger, Minister of the Church of Zurich, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious prince and lord, Lord Heinrich de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, his most gracious lord.</p>
