      <p>I was late in being informed about the messenger's departure, as I was about to start reading; for this is how I must speak, because now the pain in my foot, now in my whole leg, scarcely allows me to crawl slowly; indeed, I can hardly support myself unless I lean on another's arm. It is now almost the fourth hour after noon, and tomorrow the messenger also departs, who is waiting for my letters to Beza and some others. I ask you, therefore, venerable brother, to forgive my brevity, although, if there were more leisure and I were more eager to write, I do not know whether I would be doing anything worthwhile by narrating the affairs of France.</p>
      <p>For I am sending letters from our Martyr, which, I believe, will inform you more certainly of the whole matter, and he himself will soon explain to you in person whatever has been done. I had long suspected that the devil was secretly plotting in Germany, which has now finally become apparent, and three months ago I had diligently urged the King of Navarre to beware of the plots against him. How little I have succeeded, because I am reluctant to commit it to paper, I prefer that you learn from Mr. Martyr, when he has returned there. He had promised wonders, and to gain more trust, he did not hide that he had been tempted, but had rejected its demands in silence. And yet I have been written to from Germany that at his request five theologians were sent, who are now at court, unless perhaps they have been dismissed, because they arrived late after the whole action had been broken off. What if God frustrates the treachery of that wretched man, who sells himself to the pope with nefarious services, who nevertheless holds him in derision. But soon we will know something.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man and brother to be esteemed from the heart. May the Lord always be with you, guide you, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>I pray much health to all the fellow ministers, to your wife, and to the whole family. Geneva, 5th of November, 1561.</p>
