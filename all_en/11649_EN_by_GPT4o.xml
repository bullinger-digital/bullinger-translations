    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a portrait medal of Oecolampadius; has received comparable gifts only very rarely. There is no news from the Imperial Diet [at Speyer], although Dasypodius promised to write in place of the absent Bucer. Hans von Utenheim reported that Metz has accepted the Gospel; [Mathias] Limberger wrote the same about a city to which he had been called; it is rumored that Duke [Wilhelm?] of Bavaria has joined the Schmalkaldic League, and near Speyer, an imperial courier is said to have been attacked and killed. German mercenaries reported that Pope [Paul III] had forcibly taken the city of Siena, which was sold to him by Emperor [Charles V]. This letter is also intended for Theodor [Bibliander]. Myconius was able to persuade [Sebastian] Münster to accept the [theological] chair; the [doctorate] title will only be required from him in a year.</p>

      <p>S. Believe me, most esteemed Bullinger, I am utterly speechless regarding my duty to express thanks. What can I say to not only express some form of recompense but at least to show my heart, so that you understand how grateful, how great, and how splendid it seems and is held by me!</p>
      <p>I am not accustomed to such gifts, and therefore yours is greater than I can express. The late Lord Grynaeus of blessed memory gave me a gold coin after the death of his first wife, and a certain other person gave me a silver coin with the image of Erasmus when he returned from the Diet of Speyer. I have never received anything else from friends, neither gold nor silver. Now you give me the likeness of Oecolampadius, a holy man, which I cannot adequately value, let alone express or even magnify. It is commendable for three reasons: that it is silver, that it is the image of Oecolampadius, and that it is from Bullinger, and the last is so significant that I cannot express it. Therefore, I beg you by God to forgive me if I now say nothing except: I give you immortal thanks, and: I acknowledge myself to be greatly indebted to you.</p>
      <p>Nothing has come yet from the Diet. In Bucer's absence, Dasypodius promised to write everything, but so far he has written nothing except what I reported in my last letter.</p>
      <p>From the nobleman Hans von Utenheim, we have learned that Metz has accepted the Gospel with all its territory. Limberger, the preacher from Frankfurt, writes the same about a city whose name has completely escaped me, to which he was called to instruct it. There is also a rumor that the Duke of Bavaria has joined the Schmalkaldic League. Finally, they say an imperial courier was robbed and killed not far from Speyer.</p>
      <p>These days, German soldiers came from Italy announcing: After the Emperor sold the city of Siena (Hohensên) to the Pope, and the citizens took it badly, the Pope, through treachery, broke into the city with Germans who were in Florence, up to 200, and occupied it not without bloodshed.</p>
      <p>These things are to be shared with Theodor, which I could barely write in my spare time. Add that Münster has been persuaded to lecture. Here I attempted something until I composed my mind. The title will be deferred for a year. What will happen then, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours through Jesus Christ. Amen. Basel, February 22, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
