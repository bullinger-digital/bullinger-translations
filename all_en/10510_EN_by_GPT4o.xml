      <p>Greetings from Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear brother, the reason I have not come as you wished is due to many hindrances. Firstly, I wanted to wait for our late cousin Jakob. Unfortunately, he was attacked near Varese by three robbers on our land, who assaulted him with force, stabbed him in the chest and neck with a dagger, stripped him down to his shirt as he was found, and took 200 crowns from him, etc. Now, as I have heard, Heini is handling the matter, as I have written to them and offered consolation as a friend, etc. But Aunt Anna, instead of mourning her brother's death, is more concerned with money, and now wants to send a servant to me for 5 guilders, and the Martinmas rent has just been due, which greatly burdens me. I sent her 4 guilders, and to her shame, a silver cup worth 1 guilder, so that she may be more secure, as I have not been able to find any other means so far, nor could I find anyone. The money was given to me by Stoffel, who unfortunately sold me a cow for 8 guilders and 1 ort. God is testing me, etc.</p>
      <p>I am sending you here 2 guilders from the Hasyn; send them to her. Also, Kambli from Stampfenbach sent me a message for 3 measures of grain, of which I know nothing, I swear to God; I do owe him 1 guilder and 1 bucket of wine from the sour year. As soon as the roads are passable, I will come. Write back to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes.</p>
      <p>Written in haste.</p>
      <p>I cannot buy you a sow here, they are too expensive and too large according to the mother's word. Be assured, you may find one elsewhere. As soon as I have a transport opportunity, I will send the peas to Anna.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his brother in Zurich.</p>
