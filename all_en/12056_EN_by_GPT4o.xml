    <p xml:id="regest1">He feels compelled to disturb Amerbach to present the following matter to him: Accompanied by his brothers [Adrian, Joachim, and Fridolin Hospinian], the [Basel] Leonhard Hospinian [very confused and heatedly] informed the [Zurichers] that he wanted to leave Basel and travel to Hungary, as he had been tormented for three years by a lawsuit with [the councilor] Franz Conrad [Schmid, known as Glü(n)er]; his brothers therefore turned to [Bullinger] to dissuade [Hospinian] from his plan, so that he would not leave his wife [Anna Schaffner (Curio), née Meyer zum Hirzen] and children [Barbara, Emanuel, and Regina Hospinian]; however, Bullinger could not achieve anything in a conversation with Hospinian, in which the brothers and relatives were also present and assured Hospinian of help and advice in the Zurich council; upon Bullinger's inquiry, Hospinian named the names of his Basel friends, namely Mayor [Theodor] Brand and Amerbach; therefore, Bullinger asks Amerbach to help Hospinian, furthermore to forward the letter [not received] he sent to Theodor Brand regarding this matter and to discuss the issue with him. He requests a response through the same messenger; may Amerbach forgive Bullinger's boldness; God will reward him on the Last Day.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Indeed, I would not willingly trouble your excellence, most distinguished man, with my plainly unrefined letters, unless the matter I am about to present to you compelled me by its gravity to send these to you. A truly good man, your fellow citizen Leonhard Hospinian, has come to us and, with much agitation and fervor, revealed to his brothers, certainly most honorable men, some plan of his to leave Basel and seek Hungary. He added no other reason for his decision than that he has been tormented for nearly three continuous years by a lawsuit with a certain Franz Conrad, while in the meantime the case itself is quite clear and simple, and Hospinian demands nothing unjust. What more is needed? The brothers, most honorable men, come to me seeking advice and asking me to dissuade the man, who is most stubbornly clinging to his plan, from abandoning his wife, children, and homeland. So I call the man. He is present. He explains the case in many words. He also adds his plan. I indeed attempted to dissuade the man from his conceived plan, but in vain. The brothers and relatives stood by, promising him mutual assistance: "The most distinguished council of the city of Zurich will not deny advice," they said, "assistance and letters to the most honorable council of the city of Basel." Finally, when we presented all these things in vain, I asked whether he had friends in Basel who were familiar with this case and whom he trusted wholeheartedly, and when he responded that he had not a few, among the foremost the most distinguished men Mayor Brand and Mr. Amerbach, I immediately began to write and asked him to stay with us for a while, until I could write to both. He agreed and is waiting to see what I can accomplish with you. Now, therefore, through the Lord Jesus himself, the Hospinian brothers beseech you, and Bullinger, most devoted to your name, also beseeches you, to assist the unfortunate man, so that at least once an end may be put to the lawsuit. You can do much in this matter among the best people, and you will perform a task as honorable as it is useful. I have written about this same matter to the most distinguished Mr. Theodor Brand, to whom I beseech you to deliver this letter, to confer with him on how the best man can be advised. I certainly thought it my duty as a Christian man to restrain one rushing into open danger and to exhort you, through Christ the Lord and Christian charity, to assist me as well. The Lord will repay you on that day. I also ask for a response from you through this messenger. I beg your humanity, most distinguished man, to consider this my boldness kindly. In the meantime, I offer myself and all that is mine to you and yours. Farewell, most distinguished man and most esteemed lord. Zurich, October 10. Year 1544.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich, yours from the heart.</p>
