      <p> Greetings. I thought you had received the letter of November 23, which you now see inserted in this paper; however, the person who claimed he was going to Zurich went directly from here to Biel via Baden and sent the letters back from Aarau, so that you might not attribute this delay to my negligence. Now we eagerly desire your letters again and again amidst such a variety and inconsistency of rumors. The abbots have had a serious meeting. </p>
      <p> The Abbot of Muri has been here; but why he is in Thayngen, no one knows, except that they are supposed to pay a levy. It is said that the King of Navarre has died, that 30,000 men of the Duke of Guise have been slain and he has retreated, and that the Prince of Cond√© has taken Paris. Philip has burned two Englishmen, whereupon the Queen also attacked and sank five of his galleys, drowning those on board, and has also challenged him to an open fight, etc. Furthermore, the latest troops, who have now marched there, have almost been completely routed by those lying in Lyon, and prominent leaders have been killed. Moreover, a mandate is said to have come to you from France, which the King has issued, in which he strictly urges all his subjects and commands them to assist him, so that the foreign troops may be driven out of the country; for he sees well that the enemy is aiming at the kingdom and the crown, and if they obey him in this, he will then allow them freedom of religion, etc. I earnestly beseech you again and again to briefly inform me of what you have heard about all these matters. Farewell. </p>
      <p> All of ours greet you, Matthias and Huser, etc. December 3, 1562. </p>
      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blarer. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and in every way most beloved lord and brother. </p>
