    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich thanks for Bullinger's letter from September 4th [not received] and for the commentary on Luke. He will either personally deliver the copy intended for Mayor [Hans] Welser or entrust [Johannes] Haller with it. Frölich has never quarreled with Welser, but regrets that a person at the head of such a significant community impairs it so severely, even though he is otherwise friendly and sociable. However, he lacks consistency and courage. Furthermore, his wife [Barbara, née Adler] is worse than Jezebel! Since Frölich criticized her in the presence of [Johannes] Haller for her poor treatment of Michael Keller and other honorable men, she no longer wants to see him. Consequently, her husband also no longer dares to associate with Frölich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Since August 17th, Frölich has sent three letters to Bullinger: twice via Constance [No. 2537 and a letter not received] and once via Lindau [not received]. A fourth letter [No. 2561] will have meanwhile been delivered to Zurich by the Augsburg city messenger [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Frölich does not know the amount [of money] that the Abbot of St. Gall [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee] paid for the fight against the Schmalkaldic League, nor to whom and when the money was paid out. However, the Augsburg envoys [at the meeting of the Upper German cities] in Ulm claim that the abbot as well as the Bishop of Constance [Johann von Weeze] gave money to the Emperor [Charles V.] for the war. It is further said that the Abbot of Weingarten [Gerwig Blarer] received 6000 gold pieces from [Blarer von Wartensee]. This information is said to come from intercepted letters of the Papists.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- From the message that Frölich recently entrusted to the Augsburg city messenger, Bullinger learned that the Emperor does not want to attack. It remained so, even though the [Schmalkaldic League] challenged him to battle for four days and killed about 800 men in the process.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Maximilian von Egmont, Count] of Buren, is joining the Emperor with 4000 horses and 12000 soldiers. This [Dutch] army crossed the Rhine with the help of the Archbishop of Mainz [Sebastian von Heusenstamm] and others. The Emperor will likely only dare to attack after the arrival of this army. The [Schmalkaldic League] has retreated from Ingolstadt towards Donauwörth to conduct musters and pay their soldiers. Due to the advantageous position of the imperial camp already mentioned in [No. 2561], they could not have achieved anything in Ingolstadt anyway. Additionally, they lacked provisions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The [Schmalkaldic League] has 80000 men. Therefore, one must be frugal, as the war is unlikely to be concluded this year.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The zeal of the Confederates is appreciated, even though their leaders are considered incompetent. More experienced ones are needed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- The Tyroleans were able to recapture the fortress and the pass of Ehrenberg due to the indecision of the [Schmalkaldic League]. However, this is not very serious as long as the [Schmalkaldic League] continues to hold the well-fortified Füssen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- In summary: Everything depends on the future main battle. May God grant His victory!</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your letter dated September 4th and your commentary on Luke today, dearest and most esteemed brother. I thank you as much as I can for this sacred book until I can repay you. I will personally deliver your book to Mayor Welser or entrust it to Mr. Haller to do so. He will undoubtedly embrace such a generous gift with a grateful heart. I have never had nor do I have any quarrel with him; what I wrote was compelled by truth and necessity. However, I could not help but be deeply grieved that someone who should lead such a significant community should stumble so disgracefully. May the Lord lead him back to the right path, which is still possible! He is a sufficiently humane and approachable man. If gravity and constancy were added to these virtues, he would be a venerable man to us. However, his wife, Isabele, is more troublesome, having sworn that she would not stay in the same inn where I am. Hence, Welser does not dare to call me to him or have anything in common with me, solely because I reproached her in the presence of Haller for her foolishness and sins against good men, namely Michael Cellarius and others. Let this be said to you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have written to you three times since August 17th. Twice the letters were sent to Constance and once to Lindau. Meanwhile, our city messenger will have delivered my fourth letter to Zurich.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding the contribution of the Abbot of St. Gall against our people, I cannot specify how much money, to whom, and when he gave it. However, our envoys, when they were still in Ulm, counted this abbot and the Bishop of Constance among those who gave money to the Emperor for this war. They also said that the Abbot of Weingarten received 6000 gold pieces from the St. Gall Abbot. However, our envoys cannot fully explain where this information came from, except that they say it was revealed through some intercepted letters of the Papists.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I recently wrote to you in a summary through our city messenger that the Emperor has not wanted to take any action so far, even though our people have been challenging him for four days before his fortifications, shooting at him and killing over 800 men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Now comes the Lord of Buren, bringing over 4000 horses and 12000 soldiers. They have crossed the Rhine with the help of the Archbishop of Mainz and other priests at Bingen. And when they join the Emperor, he will then feel strong enough and perhaps want to attack.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Our people have moved back five miles from Ingolstadt towards Donauwörth so that they can muster and pay the soldiers. They are now waiting and seeing what the enemy might undertake against them or they against the enemy. For in the aforementioned advantageous position, which lies hard by the city of Ingolstadt and the water, it was not possible to dislodge them. There was also a great lack of provisions.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>We, on our part, have a remarkably large force. And I can confidently tell you that when it all comes together, there will be gladly and well eighty thousand fighting men on horseback and on foot. Therefore, and so that there is no lack of money, one must be frugal. It is to be feared that this war will hardly come to an end this year.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I tell you that the Confederates are dear, valued people to us. And their good zeal is well felt. Nevertheless, their leaders are not highly regarded. Therefore, other and more experienced ones must be found in the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Tyroleans have recaptured the castle and the pass of Ehrenberg due to the negligence of some of our people. However, it is not of great concern as long as we can hold Füssen, which is well fortified.</p>
      <p>In summary, everything depends on a main battle; whoever wins it will have the land and people. May the almighty, united, strong God give and grant us, who look to and wait for Him, His victory, strength, and grace. Amen.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of Zurich, most connected lord and brother.</p>
