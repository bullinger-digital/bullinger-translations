    <p xml:id="regest1">Francesco Negri, upon departing for Chiavenna, left his son with a friend, but this friend is now sending him to his father; Bullinger should ensure that he arrives safely in Chur, where Comander will take care of his further journey. News from Regensburg can be gathered from a report by [Beat] Gering to [Theodor] Bibliander; the behavior of the Papists will result in even their followers recognizing their inferiority. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Francesco Negri, an Italian man, married a wife here, from whom he had this young man, whom he left here entrusted to a friend when he went to Chiavenna. This friend, now tired of him, is sending him back to his father, who is quite unfit for such a journey. I commend him to you, my dear Bullinger, and for Christ's sake, do this service for his excellent father, so that through your efforts he may reach Chur; there Comander will return him to his father within two days. If you order anything or if there is any difficulty in execution, you will find in this aging and somewhat withered body a spirit that is not sluggish.</p>
      <p>From Regensburg, our Gering to Bibliander. The main point is that through many tricks the Papists have managed to make even their own followers understand that their cause is inferior.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers and lords, especially Bibliander and Pellican. Strasbourg, July 10, 1541.</p>

      <p>To the most learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, beloved brother in Christ.</p>
