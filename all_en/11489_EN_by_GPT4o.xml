    <p xml:id="regest1">The letter bearer was recommended by [Johannes] Sturm, who knows him from Paris; he would like to get to know the Zurich church and will probably return to Basel soon. Grynäus will report on his own situation later; the new decree regarding the issue of the doctorate could make his stay in Basel unpleasant, but Christ will guide him. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Sturm recommends this man to me for his simplicity and piety, having once been his companion and associate in Paris. He wishes to get to know you and your church.</p>
      <p>There is no support from the homeland. I commend this man to you, as he seems to be the kind of person Sturm describes. I believe he will return to us shortly. We will then also make an effort to help and alleviate his poverty as much as we can.</p>
      <p>I will write to you about my affairs; right now, I certainly cannot. There is a new decree regarding my doctorate. The Lord keeps me from leaving in anger. You, as is fitting, will have compassion for all the afflictions of the churches.</p>
      <p>However, I see that the essence of Christ is to be able to deal with even the most unmanageable person. But may Christ Jesus instruct us with his Holy Spirit, so that we may be able to say and do everything worthily in his name.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers most diligently. Farewell. May the Lord preserve you all in his spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your S. Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
