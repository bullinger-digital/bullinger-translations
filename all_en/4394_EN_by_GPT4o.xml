      <p>Greetings and blessings. I send you, dearest brother, the writing of Mr. Matthias Schenck, for which I give you great thanks. I also give thanks to God, who has deigned to bestow his spirit in such abundance upon this man, and I pray to the same, that he may use his gifts rightly and remain steadfast in the Lord. But what kind of letters are those from the Augsburg assembly? I would have expected greater charity and moderation in that assembly. How perilously, O God, does your church labor, which is governed by such minds! I would have expected such letters not from the serious pastors of the churches, but from the frivolous deponents of the bean-counters.</p>
      <p>How corrupted has the language of those announcing the gospel of peace become! Lord our God, have mercy on us and temper the tongues of those announcing your truth. Amen. I sent to you the printed supplication of the people of Jena and the conspirators.</p>
      <p>I entrusted my daughters along with the letters to you; they were delivered to the wife of our brother Mr. Sardenus; for he was in the house of Josias, my son-in-law.</p>
      <p>However, since I do not have another copy, I cannot be without it for long, nor do I alone have authority over it; for it also belongs to my fellow ministers, and now it will be necessary to use it. Therefore, I ask you to return it promptly; since you requested to at least inspect the booklet and therefore I sent it to you, I did not think I would be without it for so long.</p>
      <p>In Valais, the gospel is taking root excellently; the seven cantons would like to suppress it. In Baden, on the last day, the thirteen cantons wrote a warning that they are united and do not begin anything violent, etc. The seven cantons, namely the five with Freiburg and Solothurn, did not inform the other six cantons of their intentions (as is customary and traditional); they secretly sent messengers to Valais. The five cantons came over the Furka Pass, the other two cantons secretly through the land, and first arrived in the district of Goms, where they (where the most rebellious are) held a meeting behind the back of the bishop, the governor, and the council, with their own authority, and there spoke much against our faith, etc., demanding that they remain with the old faith and punish those who have turned to the new faith in body and goods, that they remove Lutheran books and do not allow any more to remain in the land, that they do not send their children to other than papal schools; and although the masses are abolished, if the authorities do not want to oppose the new faith, they are not against them, even if they break with the masses; they will support them with goods, body, and blood. The unruly peasants in the districts have accepted this behind the authorities and the other six districts and have sworn to it (inde) and given the seven cantons a document with the mayor's seal. And how they intend to proceed, as in the other district also to undertake, they came to the mayor of MÃ¶rel and demanded that they hold the Briger district; the mayor did not want to do this and opposed them with harsh words. Meanwhile, the bishop, governor, and council became aware of the matter, were very dissatisfied, and sent the messengers to Leuk: there they wanted to hear them. And there they presented the opinion as before the Goms district with the request to punish those of the new faith, especially if some are found who have undertaken innovations, with many sharp words, etc.</p>
      <p>The bishop, governor, and council answered them: they will not allow anything to be done against the Christian faith; some are punished in the land for their questions; meanwhile, they have received a common letter from Baden in the land, which they let be read in all districts, and everyone is satisfied and they are united, they could have spared the embassy; they can and will not hold any more meetings; it is not the custom, therefore they may well return home.</p>
      <p>And although this answer did not please them, they requested it in writing, which was granted to them. In addition, some of the councilors said they would have stayed at home; who sent for them? They should govern their land and leave Valais in peace. Thus, the seven messengers departed, and the people of Valais are very dissatisfied that they were thus secretly convened, etc. As the messengers of the seven cantons departed, two council messengers, the mayor and Nicholas von Diesbach, from Bern also came, announcing how they had heard that the messengers of the seven cantons had come into the land to sow discord; therefore they also come in peace, with many friendly words and offers, etc. They were thanked, held in great honor and friendship, and let go. And in summary, it is well understood that there is good hope for this land, the seven cantons have not made a great will, etc. And what do these men not dare? But you, Lord, how long? The ways of the Lord are just, and he governs all things most wisely; may he have mercy on us!</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 19, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I could hardly write these things.</p>
      <p>To my beloved lord and brother Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer in Winterthur.</p>
      <p>History of the Valais. Return these.</p>
