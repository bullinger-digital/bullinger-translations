      <p>S. This evening Mr. Balingketus Bonetus came asking if I wanted to write anything; for there was someone who would deliver it.</p>
      <p>At that time, I had nothing and had already given a letter to a citizen, which I intended to give to Stephan Heim (who has not yet departed).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Martinengus writes.</p>
      <p>The main point of the letter is this: he has received letters recently sent from Genoa, in which it is reported that the Turkish fleet has arrived at Oran, a fortified city of King Philipp and the primary one on the African coast opposite Spain. If the Turk were to capture it, there is fear that he might soon occupy the entire region.</p>
      <p>Now the maritime regions of Italy are relieved from the fear that troubled them before they knew what the fleet, arriving so suddenly, intended.</p>
      <p>A rumor is spreading that the council is to be dissolved in August; it is written that Lorraine is still staying in Trento, but in a very disturbed state of mind, because his brother, Cardinal Guise, has warned him to be on guard; for there are 25 Frenchmen who have conspired to kill Lorraine; for this reason, he also sent him portraits painted from life, depicting four of the conspirators.</p>
      <p>Lorraine has obtained from the Venetians the most diligent guarding of the gates.</p>
      <p>In recent days, three Frenchmen, honest men and merchants, have been detained in Brescia for this reason and are still being held.</p>
      <p>The Venetians are fiercely persecuting Christ in his members. The envoy of Philipp has not yet left Rome nor received a response, but there is great hope that he will be able to obtain everything or at least most things.</p>
      <p>This was written suddenly in the evening after dinner; forgive me. June 15, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
