      <p>The grace of God be with us all, which I indeed need, in which I place my comfort, help, and faith; as He wills to deal with me. For my leg is completely stiff; the cold pain takes hold with great distress, so that I can no longer walk or stand on my legs. The helper does his best honestly (I will repay it). I have not been able to go to church for 4 weeks, and still cannot.</p>
      <p>Further, I have asked Josua, also cousin Heinrich, that they come to me as soon as they can; for I need Heinrich's advice. I want to make an agreement with my son; for in the morning such great fainting spells come (especially yesterday), that I fear they might take me away once and for all.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I do not want to burden you with my present condition, for the sake of brotherly loyalty and love towards God and man, everything is well; the more so. If He wills, it is my goal. When I am better, I will write to you more. God be with you all; may He protect you, keep you in true faith for salvation. Amen. Let it be.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes, the infirm.</p>
      <p>To his faithful, dear brother Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
      <p>The last letter from my brother without one, written in July 1570.</p>
