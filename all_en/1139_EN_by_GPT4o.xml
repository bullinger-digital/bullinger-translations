      <p>S. After sending you my letters, I received yours yesterday along with that fragment from Mutius' book, as well as the history of the martyrs, for which I am very grateful to you, especially for that magnificent and truly splendid title "To the highly learned, worthy, pious, and faithful lord, etc., his particularly gracious lord" etc., which seems to me to be nothing but a reproach of my rusticity, as I am not accustomed to adorn you, a man so much more distinguished than myself, with titles worthy of you in this manner. But forgive whatever I have erred in this matter so far; for what I did, I seemed to myself to do rightly by the right of our silent charity; now, however, I will strive that you may never desire anything of this kind in me again, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the council, I have often thought and said that unless God intervenes in some other way, it will be the right opportunity and a welcome means for the emperor to oppress the Confederates who are committed to God's word, and then to bring the others under the yoke as well. May the faithful God prevent this and make the young into the old pious Confederates again. Oh, what a blessed people that would be for me! May God grant this grace, but, but etc.</p>
      <p>With the promise of the servants and that they are preparing for a miserable peasant war, it is truly reasonable to worry that everything might turn from bad to worse. In addition, I recall a saying I heard several times three or four years ago from the old Peter Scherer, my brother-in-law's father, who said: "These matters can never be resolved unless God grants another reasonable peasant war, etc." And how would it be if God initiated such a thing, even though they are contradictions and a wooden shoe. But it has previously lacked that they had no proper head or leaders, no princes or cities were involved, etc. Thus, Doctor Luther truly spoke very earnestly to the lords after that war with sincere admonition, urging them not to misuse their power against God and His word; for he had now shown them a scarecrow and the devil in the glass, so that they might see how quickly he could extinguish them all, and yet this time he was restrained again. But if they do not desist and conduct themselves differently, it will go worse for them than for the peasants. As if he were also their prophet in this matter?</p>
      <p>Well then, praying, pleading, and turning to God with earnest repentance will be the best defense. There is great and much misfortune in the sack; whenever it breaks out, let the nearest beware and make peace with God. Let us send to Him a delegation of our tears and prayers with solid repentance and serious invocation of His name, etc.</p>
      <p>After that, we have nothing more to lose. Regarding the council, I have recently received credible information that His Imperial Majesty shortly wishes that the opposing side also be summoned and heard at the council, etc. But no one should rejoice in this; for it might only bring some delay for appearance's sake and their greater pomp.</p>
      <p>The prejudices are... things too strongly decided, etc., that there is nothing good to hope for... the devil and father of lies have completely possessed them, so that they can neither understand nor want the truth.</p>
      <p>May God have mercy on them and on all of us. Entrusted to Him and earnestly praying for me. Greeting all yours with all dear lords and brothers. January 5th.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly learned, and widely renowned Christian lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful overseer of the Church of Christ in Zurich, his most gracious lord and highly trusted friend, to his hands.</p>
