      <p>Greetings. I am briefer than ever, I write only this, reverend father in Christ, so that you may understand that yours have been delivered to me. I have nothing new at all.</p>
      <p>The commissioners have not yet returned.</p>
      <p>If Märius has not come, he will come; for he himself, after asking me to write this, has gone to his village and perhaps stayed there for this eight-day period. We have heard from France what you write, not without great joy; the same is announced from elsewhere. Regarding the Five Cantons, I see there is not much to hope for; Landammann Bäldius writes to me and urges that I encourage our people to assist if any force is used against them, which is for me a sign that things are in a very bad state with them. We are more occupied than ever before with the bishop's business.</p>
      <p>We have been writing these days continuously; at the same time, we will instruct the good people about the Glarus business. This whole matter is the Lord's, who will undoubtedly act.</p>
      <p>If anything worthy of knowledge is written from Frankfurt, I humbly ask you to share it out of your kindness towards us. I know your occupations; therefore, assign the task of replying to my relative Theodor.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, with all your people, as happily as possible. Chur, April 13, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. After I had written this, the commissioners return.</p>
      <p>Mr. Friedrich writes, but adds nothing new in the letters; nevertheless, I send them so that you may see that I have diligently taken care of all your matters; return the letters when it is convenient. Francis Portus Graecus also writes, from whose letter I have noted what you see on the attached sheet. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
