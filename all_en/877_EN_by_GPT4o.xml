      <p>Johannes Blasius to his Bullinger, Greetings.</p>
      <p>Finally, I met with the bishop, offering him your gift, most esteemed man; he received me very kindly and treated me with great courtesy. From this, it is easy to gather that this gift, as he himself testified in words, is most welcome; meanwhile, he gave great thanks and promised to write back, etc. Furthermore, regarding our affairs, take this: the two Leagues, the Grey League and the Ten Jurisdictions, have punished their subjects much for their transgressions and established other regional laws on how to govern in the future, and now, in part, everyone in the Leagues is at peace, etc. In the third League, called God's House, in which the city of Chur and the bishopric are located, they were here in Chur last Judica Sunday with others; they negotiated with the Seven Places and asked that they proceed skillfully in this matter.</p>
      <p>They have given the matter a postponement until mid-May, and as I understand the situation, they will also punish those who have governed until now and mixed with the French, etc., and I hope the commotion will serve more for good than for harm. We have warned them faithfully and at the right time. They have disregarded it; therefore, they must now suffer, etc. Farewell through the Lord.</p>
      <p>D. Comander and all other good men send their regards to you. Hastily, Chur, April 8, 1550.</p>
      <p>The same yours, etc.</p>
      <p>To the truly learned and pious Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of our Switzerland, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
