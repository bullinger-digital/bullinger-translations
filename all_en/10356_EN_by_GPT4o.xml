      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>My friendly greetings and all the best, dear Master Heinrich. I want to let you know that I am ill in body, but in soul, by the grace of God, I trust in God, it is well, and I am content, for I have moved from Mellingen to Lenzburg for the sake of faith, so that I might (can) remain with Christ and His word, and with His help, I will not withdraw the hand set to the plow.</p>
      <p>Further, dear Heinrich and good friend, I want to let you know that my brother from Basel was with me in Lenzburg a few days ago and negotiated on my behalf with the people of Mellingen regarding the compensation for leaving, and they demand two hundred guilders in Bernese currency for the compensation. But I have not yet come to an agreement with them; however, I want to satisfy them, and I should not regret or abandon temporal losses for the sake of Christ. I am also ready, for His sake and His word, with His help, to suffer even more, if it is God's will, for it is well, praise be to God.</p>
      <p>Further, dear sir and friend, my friendly, earnest, and sincere request to you is that you would commend our brother and friend Joachim to the highest degree and help him as you can, and do your best so that he may be provided for, considering his persecution for the sake of the Lord's word. For it is right that we should take care of our own according to Paul's teaching to the Hebrews in chapter 10. Remember this and my intercession. If I and all of ours could and might earn something decent with our abilities, we would always gladly and willingly do and be so.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant you grace and strength, that you may faithfully and actively proceed in His word until the end. I ask you to pray to the Lord for me and commend me to Him, that He may grant me patience in my bodily illness and sustain me under the cross. Lastly, I ask you to let me know how you are living, how things are with you and around you.</p>
      <p>My wife and all of us send you all warm greetings. Greet your household for us, and whoever is dear to you. We commend ourselves to you at all times. The peace of God be with you all at all times.</p>
      <p>Given at Lenzburg, on the 13th of February in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>And greet your mother especially, our dear BÃ¤se.</p>
      <p>From me, Rudolf Frey, citizen of Lenzburg, your always willing.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich in the city, my especially good lord and friend, to hand.</p>
