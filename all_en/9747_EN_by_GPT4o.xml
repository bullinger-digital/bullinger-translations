      <p>From Strasbourg, July 11, 1574.</p>
      <p>A French nobleman was dispatched from Vienna on the most recent Tuesday, June 29. He reports that the King of Poland left on that day for Venice, having come from Poland. The king stayed late in his chamber on the evening of St. John's Day, then began to undress. The Poles, who were waiting to serve him, remained with him until he undressed and bid them good night. Then he dressed again, and after having the moat measured by some Frenchmen, where they found an exit not deeper than knee-high, and having a ladder from his chamber, he escaped with some Frenchmen through that exit over the moat. He left the guards inside unaware of these events, and that night and the next morning rode ten miles from Krakow to an imperial village, where the French ambassador in Poland, named Belliere, who had previously returned home under the pretense of announcing the king's dignity in France, awaited him and arranged a meal for him. His chief chamberlain, a Pole whom he had recently appointed because the position had been vacant for some time, strongly objected and begged the king to stay, warning that he would be in danger. The king replied that he must leave; he should come along; he would not abandon him for the rest of his life. The chamberlain, however, did not want to go, but asked to delay until a new king was elected, to which the king replied that he did not intend to delay for the Kingdom of Poland, etc. Thus, the chamberlain promised to remain the king's servant.</p>
      <p>Thereupon, the king gave him a ring from his finger with a precious diamond and a cord, as is the custom among the Poles, to wear on the arm as a sign of lasting friendship. The Poles followed him to the aforementioned imperial village but were turned away by the chief and not allowed in. The king then had a drink there and moved on to Vienna, where he stayed for three days with the imperial majesty and then went to Venice. The imperial majesty sent her two sons several miles to meet the King of Poland, and her majesty herself later traveled half a mile on a carriage to meet him, received him, took him on her carriage, and accompanied him to the city and castle.</p>
      <p>From Duke Richard, Count Palatine.</p>
      <p>July 2.</p>
      <p>Regarding the high-born prince, our friendly, dear cousin and brother Duke Christoph, Count Palatine, and Count Ludwig of Nassau, you should know that their lordships and highnesses are certainly still alive. We believe their lordships have now arrived in Heidelberg and Count Ludwig in Dillenburg. However, it is strongly rumored about our cousin Count Heinrich that he, unfortunately, has remained in the course, as we have not been able to learn otherwise until now.</p>
      <p>From Strasbourg, July 7.</p>
      <p>Lord von Thon, after recapturing the two houses TÃ¼rgkenstein and Schattilon with his troops and not encountering the Gascons anymore, has withdrawn and dismissed his troops, who have returned to their previous garrisons, such as Metz, Marseille, Dole, Verdun, Hohenlangeren, and other places, so that their war has also reached its end this time. We hear nothing more about the departure of the Duke of Guise. We do not doubt that you now know that Marshal Montgomery was executed with the sword in Paris and his body subsequently quartered into four pieces, which one of our citizens, as he reliably reported to us, saw himself.</p>
      <p>May the Almighty be gracious and merciful to his soul!</p>
