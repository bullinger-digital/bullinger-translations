    <p xml:id="regest1">Is ready to support Johannes Hospinian for the sake of Bullinger and Megander, but Hospinian's friend [Bonifacius] Amerbach can do this better, as Myconius [at the university] no longer holds any value. Hospinian is courting [Anna Schaffner], but Myconius also has no influence over her since the death of her grandfather [Jakob Meyer] and her stepfather [Johann] Walder. Thanks for the news from the Baden Diet and welcomes that Zurich is standing against France; there, a believer was tortured and burned, and [King Francis I] is openly making pacts with the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman I]. Rumors about the siege of Buda by imperial and Bohemian troops; [the Protestants] are threatened with danger regardless of the outcome of the war. Will endeavor in the matter of the [youths recommended by Bullinger]; cannot write more extensively due to the upcoming synod. Greetings. Votes for the election of [Hans Rudolf] Lavater as mayor.</p>

      <p>I have not yet seen Master Johannes Hospinianus. I know he is not unlearned, but I am unaware of his piety. He has Mr. Amerbach, whom I understood to have been his friend for a long time. He can help. If I am to do anything, it will be in your name and that of Megander. But he does not need my help, and that will benefit him. Those who please me displease others; those I try to promote, I hinder. This is the favor I have among our scholars, although they pretend otherwise excellently. But so far, I have felt and experienced it this way.</p>
      <p>However, I hear there is another reason why he came here; he is certainly courting a good girl. What can be done, I do not know at all; let those who are concerned see to it. It seemed to concern me somewhat while her grandfather and also her stepfather Walder were alive; with their passing, I am nothing, etc.</p>
      <p>I am grateful for what you wrote about the Baden Diet; I knew nothing except some vague things, which I could not trust. I am very pleased that your people are separating from the French and their supporters; he is worthy of being shunned by everyone. In France, an evangelical man, after he did not cease to speak of Christ, first lost his tongue, then was burned within a month. It is so evident that there is an agreement between the Turk and the French that even the French do not hide it. Come, the Lord will visit both in his time.</p>
      <p>There are rumors that the imperial troops have camped before Buda, but dare nothing, the Turk seeks a truce, but no one grants it, the Bohemians are present in great numbers, very eager, but are prevented from attacking the enemy rashly; for there is a danger of being deceived. If it succeeds, we stand in danger, if otherwise, loss threatens again. Whatever happens, we will be more discordant among ourselves. May the Lord stand by us!</p>
      <p>I am diligently inquiring about the youths; if I find them, I will tell you. I cannot converse with you more extensively because the upcoming synod takes away all leisure.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours in Christ. Greet Gaspar diligently in my name, as well as Theodor and Pellican.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 8, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>If you accept my wish, you will appoint Lavater as consul, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
