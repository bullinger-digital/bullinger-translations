    <p xml:id="regest1">Rhellikan has not learned anything new in Strasbourg about the negotiations for a concord with the Lutherans; the people of Strasbourg are annoyed because Grynaeus [from TÃ¼bingen] is being recalled. Myconius will try to prevent the printing of Erasmus' ["Ecclesiastes"]; the Basel council had already taken measures against a collection of letters published by Erasmus in 1531. The Emperor has announced a campaign against the Turks and intends to address the council afterwards. Myconius considers the concession of the Five Places [in the dispute over the oath formula in the common lordship of the Free Offices] to be a new maneuver. He thanks for the favorable reception of his advocacy for [Thomas] Platter. He is outraged by the intention of the people of Uri to win back the people of Glarus through a friendly [church consecration] visit.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Rellicanus was in Strasbourg, and when I asked what he had done regarding the negotiations for Lutheran concord, he replied, not a word, nor had he received anything from the people of Strasbourg, which I certainly find surprising. They have sent no letters to me. They are upset because we are recalling Grynaeus. There are those for whom it is not enough that all the learned have perished from our church.</p>
      <p>Regarding Erasmus, there is nothing to write, except that the fathers use him for their defense, whom the people of Strasbourg also use for themselves in the same matter. For I have begun to deal with the matter with the book censors, though not with hostility. In short: I have advised them to act according to their duty, and when words began to be defended, I added: "I do not seek Erasmus' explanation, nor do I care, but the words themselves, which will come to our adversaries. If there is one who will not interpret these to his own purpose, then whatever I have done or said so far is nonsense." We have seen other things from that preacher; some are pleasing, some less so. But what can you do? Such has Erasmus been until now. I favor the man beyond many others, but reluctantly I allow something here to be pressed that opposes the truth. If I can do nothing, the effort was not lacking. He wrote a book of Florid Letters, which Herwagius printed in 1531 and suffered a loss, for the senate had taken the books, except for a few that were already either sold or distributed, because of the most shameful insults made to our city. One of these has now come into my hands, indeed two. I wish you had the other! There are 13 sections, the format is large. I do not know who would bear it comfortably. You would see Erasmus there.</p>
      <p>Besides this, the Emperor has sent letters to our people that he is now approaching the Turk, asking us to pray to God for a successful outcome. If this happens, he will use all his strength to ensure that concord is achieved through the council he has called.</p>
      <p>What you write lastly about the Five Places, I interpret only for their own use. I do not like what they are doing, briefly.</p>
      <p>Finally, I thank you for so readily agreeing to my requests for Blatter. You will find, if there is anything, that I am equally ready.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 2, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>There was a certain Urius here, who said during a meal: "We have chosen 200 to visit the people of Glarus according to the old custom and to act with as much courtesy as possible with those who embrace the new faith. Then, if any of these presume to dispute about the gospel, we have forbidden anyone to respond, but to send them to the four we have appointed for this matter. Thus we try to bring everyone back to us again" etc. This is because: I have never feared anything more than that the pagans would learn this art. May they go with the evil spirit who teaches them so.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief ecclesiast of Zurich, his brother in the Lord.</p>
