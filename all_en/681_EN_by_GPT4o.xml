      <p>S. You greet me from time to time, which is very pleasing to me, for I understand that you are healthy and well; but the fact that you write less frequently, I attribute to your affairs, which I do not doubt are very important; for these times require it from great men, whose duty it is to protect the kingdom of Christ, the foundation of which was faithfully laid from the divine scriptures some years ago. For the wild boar from the forest has come and tries to destroy it, and now it has succeeded with many, especially in Germany, from whom the destruction was accepted by denying the gospel of the Lord, as you know.</p>
      <p>The foolishness of men directs its strength against the highest, namely heavenly, wisdom and has not conquered wisdom, indeed, as that is impossible, but those who pretended to be wise from the word of God, about whom Christ said: "Those who hear it receive the word with joy, and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away." From this it is clear that such people never sincerely received the gospel. For those to whom the yoke of Christ is sweet and his burden light, do not dread the cross itself, let alone threats. Therefore, it must be believed that they embraced novelty more than the grace of the gospel, however much they needed it; I now remain silent about other reasons for their acceptance. Against these, it is not necessary to contend much, but against the devil, who is at this day and night, so that those who remain good may also be overcome.</p>
      <p>Here it must be shouted and written without limit, for the ravenous wolves must be deterred, indeed driven as far away as possible from the sheep, so that they do not cause any harm. You have the words, you have the understanding of things, you also have the practice of writing, indeed you have grace; therefore, it must be acted upon, for which all these things are given and granted, so that the truth of God is not so miserably trampled upon." But" you say "we act as much as we can, especially among our own; what we do not do, it is not us, but the magistrates are the cause, who prohibit by the command of the Emperor, that we write nothing against the sacred Interim, that nothing of the sort is sold publicly, lest we be devoured by him." Devoured? Therefore, the devil has become the Emperor going around seeing whom he may devour. Or is it not more necessary to shout and write, is it not more necessary to defend the truth of Christ?</p>
      <p>It does not need a defender when no one attacks, but when it is attacked, and the more fiercely, the more strongly it must be resisted, indeed not ceasing even unto blood. The magistrates seem to me to sin gravely everywhere in this regard, that they fear where there was no need to fear; they do what is unworthy of our freedom, they act against the truth of the Lord, they act for the lie of the devil, they act for the confirmation of the papal kingdom, that is, of the antichrist. The enemies of Christ have the freedom, if you prefer, the license to write; their books are sold even in our cities along with imperial privileges, and no one dares to even whisper against them.</p>
      <p>What kind of fear do you think this is? It seems to me vain and completely without Christ, who, placed in the heart, casts out all fear.</p>
      <p>What then? It must be ensured that this fear is cast out from the minds of our people as soon as possible and that the love of Christ grows more in us and in all our people, and the evils in our hearts will perish. These things I wanted to discuss with you familiarly. Vogler will tell you about the Emperor. The Bishop of Arras had recently written to Granvelle's father that Bucer had perished in some tumult in England; but shortly after it was discovered that there had indeed been three tumults and seven thousand papists killed, but that Bucer was alive. The rest, as I said, Vogler. Farewell with yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, 19th of September, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
