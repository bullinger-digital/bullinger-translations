    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] It has been almost a year since Hooper received Bullinger's letter in Strasbourg, which clearly stated that true worship has nothing in common with external idolatry and that it would therefore be much better, for Christ's sake, to lose one's homeland and fortune than to participate in a mass. Hooper has gladly embraced this view. May God richly reward Bullinger for his response. In the meantime, he should protect his church from the wolves and mercenaries and call back the poor scattered people of God to their only true shepherd, Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Hooper will report orally about his long and dangerous journey to England. On the mainland, he was twice put in chains. Yet, through God's wonderful providence, he was freed. At sea, he suffered for three months from enemies and the waves. However, this may not yet be the end of Hooper's suffering in this world. May God grant that the rest of his life stands in the service of His honor and the edification of His church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] When Hooper escaped the flames [of persecution] and the water, he found himself in the midst of this war, in which piety and religion are being destroyed. However, God will not allow the enemies to destroy Peter's faith and His church! Therefore, we should completely surrender to the Lord. Instead, we continue to snore away in the midst of the greatest danger! No wonder we feel God's wrath. It would be time to lead a better life and patiently endure the punishment our sins deserve.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The pleasant news from Strasbourg that arrived yesterday will be told by the current messenger [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In England, there is a change in religion. For if Emperor Charles V is defeated, King Henry VIII will accept the Gospel. But if the Gospel suffers a defeat, the king will maintain his godless mass. Because of the latter, four pious nobles were burned last summer. Currently, the king holds the Duke of Norfolk [Thomas Howard] and his eldest son [Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey] captive in the Tower of London. Both are said to have planned an assassination attempt on the king and his son [Edward VI].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Hooper's wife [Anne t’Serclaes] sends her regards to Bullinger and his colleagues. Hooper and she will soon come to Zurich. [Jacques de Bourgogne], Lord of Falais, his wife [Yolanda von Brederode], and their entire household also send their regards. A pious and learned young man [Valérand Poullain] currently lives in their house, who would like to accompany Hooper to Zurich. He is looking for a position and would be very grateful for a teaching post in Zurich (even at the lowest class level). Bullinger should take up this matter and report back.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings, among others, to Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, and Rudolf Gwalther. Bullinger should excuse the fleeting writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Finally, he should greet [Heinrich] Falkner's wife [...] from Hooper and his wife. Hooper brought the latter as a maiden from Strasbourg to Basel, where he took her as his wife after her parents gave their permission.</p>

      <p>S. P. In Strasbourg, almost a year ago, most excellent lord and most revered in Christ, I received your equally learned and pious letters, in which you wished to persuade me entirely that true worship of God can have no connection with external idolatry; therefore, you considered it more prudent and pious to endure the loss of homeland and fortune for Christ than to participate in impious masses. I honor and cherish this counsel; I willingly agree with this sentiment. I cannot adequately express my gratitude to your lordship; but I pray that He, who can do all things in all, and who, when invoked with true faith for the sake of His Son Jesus Christ, wills beyond what can be believed, may abundantly be your reward and recompense with His mercy and piety. Of this, I do not doubt, that you will be, when this perishable body is dissolved, an eternal friend of God. Meanwhile, while you partake of this life, protect your churches, free them from wolves and mercenaries, gather the people of God, and call back His miserably scattered flock to Christ, our true and only shepherd; fight the good fight, a crown of righteousness is laid up for you, which you will receive on that day from the righteous judge.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>About my long and most dangerous journey to England, I will speak to your excellence in person; having suffered much on land, I was twice put in chains and fetters; by God's mercy (though with great loss of fortune) I was wonderfully freed, at sea for three months miserably harassed by enemies and waves; but the end is not yet; what remains of this calamitous life, I pray may be to the glory of God's name and the edification of His church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Having been delivered from flames and water, I came to war; I see nothing but the destruction of all piety and religion; the enemy of God would destroy (if it were possible for Peter's faith to perish) every mouth proclaiming Christ and the mother with her children, that is, the entire church; but the Lord will look upon His people, I do not doubt, and will not allow the tyranny of the cruel enemy to rage as he wishes. Meanwhile, let us turn sincerely and truly to the Lord, and without doubt, He will regard our tears. But, alas, most excellent lord, we snore in the greatest danger in the greatest security, and therefore it is no wonder if we cruelly feel the wrath of God and the burdens of our impiety. Let us amend, lest He send us heavier things, namely, that we become after this life eternal enemies of God; as the time demands, let us patiently bear the fortune our sins have deserved; for because of iniquity, He has corrupted the sons of men.</p>

      <p>The pleasant news we received yesterday from Strasbourg, this messenger will inform your lordship.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In England, there will be a change of religion, and the king will accept the Gospel of Christ if in this most pestilent war the emperor is defeated; if the Gospel suffers a defeat, then he will retain his impious masses, for which this summer he burned four pious and noble men. Now our king holds in prison in London the Duke of Norfolk and his eldest son and heir; they say the father and son conspired the death of the king and our prince; a horrendous crime, if my letters are true.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>My wife most dutifully sends her regards to your lordship with all the other pious and learned men with you. We will soon visit you, God willing. Lord de Falais and his wife with their entire household pray for all good things for you. In his house is a certain pious and learned young man, whom I will bring with me to Zurich; I ask for Christ's sake, if possible, that he may have some teaching position in some class of your school. He is studious and diligent; he will not refuse the most arduous labors, provided he may have a small condition by which he can sustain himself; he will be useful to the church of God; for Christ's sake, be mindful of him, and if possible, let your lordship write back to me; nothing would come to me more lovingly than your letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for a long time, to the glory of His name and the benefit of His church. Amen. Greet in my name Mr. Bibliander, Pellikan, Gwalther, and all the others. I earnestly commend myself to the prayers of your church. Spare, I pray, the pen that is too hasty.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I ask your lordship to greet in my name and my wife's the pious matron Falkner, who came with us to Basel from Strasbourg, whom she left as a maiden, but now with the consent of her parents, I have taken her as my wife.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted John Hooper.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and vigilant prelate, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, prefect of the ministers of the pious church of Zurich, his most revered lord in Christ.</p>
