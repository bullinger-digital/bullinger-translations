      <p>Greetings. I have received what you sent to me through Martin Metellus, my venerable and dearest brother, and I am most grateful, especially for Brentius's advice, which indeed seems to me to be such that I would never have believed this man, who has so far used his writings with great skill and solid learning, to be its author, unless I had already heard with great assurance from most trustworthy men that he had written things unworthy of himself concerning the Interim, although Huberinus's writing is much more inept and execrable than his. Ah, how they change, ah, how the best and most learned men change, who seem to be, if the face of this world seems so, that you can only confess it with the greatest danger to life, which is true, even if he was also outside great danger when he wrote there. May the Lord have mercy on them and on all of us! O my Bullinger, what evils will soon fall upon the Church of Christ if we begin to sew cushions in this way for our delicate princes and magistrates, and then also for the common Christians, who are so entirely eager for their own skin!</p>
      <p>Beyond belief, I grieve for our situation, after I see the causes of the greatest evils sprouting even within our own bowels, so that now we must fear more from ourselves than from the adversaries of the word of God, and our house threatens the gravest downfall, since it agrees so little with itself. May the Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ so connect us in an indissoluble bond of love and unity, that no place for dissension may remain among us, but being joined and closely united by the most tenacious glue of His Spirit, we may become one with Him as He is one with the Father, amen.</p>
      <p>That you congratulate me so much on Winterthur, you do rightly; for that place pleases and delights me for many reasons. You are not ignorant of my brother's efforts; may the Lord prosper them, that he may be happily admitted into the possession of that most pleasant and fertile estate, which you know, with your consent, and thus may the labors and tedium of many years, which he has endured in administering the republic, be exchanged by favorable nature for the pleasures of farmers, in which he incredibly delights!</p>
      <p>Concerning the skeptics you write about, I wish you did not write so truly. As for me, I have often preferred to be with the Academics (Greek) than to pronounce confidently with a mind not yet sufficiently confirmed, always using moderation, so that my doubt would not harm others. May Christ the Savior grant that what is truly certain may also be recognized by all and held with the most steadfast minds!</p>
      <p>Many, especially good and wise men, take it as a good omen that your people so greatly abhor the alliance with the French. We will be safe enough against all the attacks and machines of the adversaries if we vigorously maintain the confederation of the Lord God of Hosts. We see what our people have achieved with their accumulated alliances; certainly nothing, except that, as their trust in the Lord gradually languished, relying on the arm of the flesh, they became a reproach to their neighbors, a mockery and derision to all who are around them, so that they ought rightly to be deterred by this example, whoever wishes to consult their affairs with the protection of such alliances. You, as you indeed do vigorously, urge timely repentance among your people, lest they be compelled to drink from the cup of the Lord's wrath sooner than they think.</p>
      <p>We daily make prayers for the peace of your nation and offer to the Lord the supplications, groans, and sighs of our hearts, since in His peace we also hope to have peace, however small.</p>
      <p>Concerning that boastful and pestilent slanderer Valentinus, you rightly admonish. I also diligently consider with myself by what Christian means I may timely clear myself, not indeed to him, who is plainly unworthy of even a single word in response, but to pious and simpler people, nor do I think those means will fail me.</p>
      <p>I now fully recognize the legitimate and Christian calling of our Mezler and Funckli. From your previous letters, I only understood this, namely, that it was your advice for them to go to Bern; for you hoped that provision would be made for them. This seemed to me to show less modesty. Now that you write that our Haller is calling them, all my scruples are removed. Therefore, I wrote to Mezler to undertake that journey as soon as possible and not to neglect such a convenient opportunity by delaying. He will also, unless I am mistaken, set out tomorrow. Funcklius, since he is greatly loved by those who called him to the ministry of the church, is anxious and, as they say, holds the wolf by the ears, since on the one hand, he seems unable to leave the church, which once accepted him, loving him so much, due to his conscience, and on the other hand, considering the danger, which indeed greatly threatens his head, and the smallness of the salary, he cannot remain there. But the Lord, I hope, will soon resolve this difficulty for him. There is a third besides these, Johannes Juvenalis or JÃ¼ngius of our Bishopric, who was recently with you in Zurich, a very pious and not moderately learned man, whom you can safely appoint to some distinguished church; he now preaches on Sundays and other feast days in the lepers' temple not far from the city, who would like his ministry to be permanent for them, but they do not have the means to support him with his wife and children, so that he cannot devote his work to them, however much he would like, unless perhaps he wishes to leave them later with greater offense after incurring debt. Therefore, I earnestly beseech you to consider him as well, if ever the sheep of Christ will need a shepherd somewhere.</p>
      <p>Farewell and diligently intercede with the Lord for us. Greet your household with all the brothers and friends. All of my blood here bid you farewell.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>May 1549.</p>
