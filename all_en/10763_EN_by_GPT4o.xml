    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends a letter addressed to Melanchthon [No. 636?]. Has already informed [Jakob Meyer] that [Konrad] Zwick and Thomas Blarer have concerns regarding a concord; [Meyer] regrets this and wishes for more information about the negotiations [of the Zurichers] with Zwick. Myconius agrees to a delegation to Luther with reservations. Bucer has recovered. Bern fears the occupation of Geneva and Neuch창tel by France. Has already reported about [Henry VIII]. A federal treaty is said to have been concluded in Schmalkalden; [Meyer] wants the Zurichers to inquire about the records of the federal diet in Constance. Bullinger's justification [regarding a letter concerning the Solothurn "bandits," which was subsequently revoked by Zurich] is not convincing, as the Zurichers are explicitly named first in the letter of the Confederates and, moreover, at the request of the Five Places, [Jakob] Werdm체ller and [Kaspar] Nasal were dispatched to persuade Basel; an apology from Zurich would be due.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Here is a letter to Melanchthon for you.</p>
      <p>Regarding Zwick, before you advised, I informed our father [Jakob Meyer] from the writings of others to be cautious with Thomas Blarer, lest someone might impose upon us through concord. He is exceedingly and indeed anxiously distressed. He wishes that you would send to us whatever has been done before we meet, so that the matter can be better evaluated. For it is not of little importance.</p>
      <p>Then, I do not quite understand what it means to call the churches of the Swiss. For after they have now been called evangelical, I do not know if you also mean the others. I would easily agree to sending a delegate if Luther's response would be equal to the expenses and the matter could be kept secret, which cannot be done. For what do you think they would plan against us if the delegation were discovered, whom we now wish to keep in the dark? However, if it seems right, let it be done. I have said nothing about this to anyone.</p>
      <p>Bucer suffered from the plague, which you also have in Zurich. Now he has recovered.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Genevans, I know nothing except that the Bernese are very afraid that the French will occupy them. For he will not only occupy these, but also Neuch창tel, indeed they are almost already claimed by their lord, the king's relative, for royal power.</p>
      <p>I have explained everything about the Englishman in previous letters.</p>
      <p>Yesterday someone came from Schmalkalden who said that Melanchthon was there. Otherwise, there is a rumor that a treaty has been concluded by the princes and cities, but under what conditions, it is not yet clear. Consult with me in this way: "It would seem that a letter should be written to the Zurichers to diligently inquire from the people of Constance, when they return, about the acts of the diet. For from there it can be clearly understood about the composition of the concord." Therefore, you will keep this uniquely entrusted to you. Then someone else was saying that the treaty would not be concluded unless concord was first made, which is why the people of Strasbourg have hurried so far. But this talk was neglected here.</p>
      <p>However, you defend your people; which seriously pleases me. But whatever you say, it is nothing, since in the letters sent here by the Confederates, the Zurichers are named first, and then after two delegates were sent here at the request of the Five Places to deter our people from their purpose, one of whom (I name them to you) is the treasurer Werdm체ller, the other is Nasal. Also, it can hardly be denied that it was imprudent, that when your people learned they were violently inscribed and letters sent to our people, they did not excuse themselves to our people with their own messenger. What do you think the mood of the senate would have been then? They would also have consulted in the next assembly. Therefore, unless your people excuse themselves to the Bernese and our people, the codicil sent will retain its authority. But we do not want to fight over this matter, although I wish that this contention had never arisen, it vexes me so much, not in one, but in many ways. Do you not see this evil demon now? Do you think the codicil of the Confederates? Therefore, it is not that you should wonder, indeed suspect that something sinister is being attempted here by I don't know whom. It is clear where this evil against your people originated. You also commend the virtue of God among your people. We give thanks to God and pray that He may increase it daily to His glory. I would wish to lose a limb if this commendation had been continuous from the last war until now. For because it was not, there is something I fear, very serious and harmful. But I will keep it buried in my heart with great sorrow, until it is either reduced to nothing or reveals itself in the light. What I write, I deposit with you. For if I had known the previous letters would cause this unrest, indeed I would not have written a letter. You, my Bullinger, take all my things in good part.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with your people and Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 14, 1536.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest in the Lord.</p>
