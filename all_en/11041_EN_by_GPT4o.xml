    <p xml:id="regest1">Is only willing to hand over his house to the hospital master when an equivalent replacement is available. At the Lausanne Synod on May 14, Claude [d'Aliod] recanted his Arian heresy, while Farel, Calvin, and others were cleared of suspicion; the unanimously decided dismissal of Caroli will undoubtedly be confirmed by the [Bernese] authorities. A synod is convened in Bern on May 30 due to the conflict with Sebastian [Meyer]; Megander wishes for the participation of Bullinger or Jud.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Mr. Caspar Nazal reported to me, and my brother also writes, that my venerable lords have appointed me as the head and steward of the hospital. This will be acceptable to me, but under the condition that another position is arranged for me and that I am not forced to move my belongings until a suitable and convenient arrangement is made for me. I absolutely do not want the house of the schoolmaster Binder; therefore, I will not write here. I urge and beseech you to ensure that neither this nor a similar arrangement is made for me; if not, I will appeal to the promises and letters given to me.</p>
      <p>The synod of the French brothers was held in Lausanne on the fourteenth of May in my presence and was very successfully concluded. Claude of Savoy recanted his Arianism. Farel, Calvin, and many other brothers, pious and very learned men, were unjustly accused and suspected of this heresy. Caroli, who initiated this tragedy, was deprived of his office by the unanimous vote of the brothers, not only for this reason but also for some other impious, vain, and rare matters. I have no doubt that the lords will also approve this decision of the brothers.</p>
      <p>A synod will also be convened in our city on the penultimate day of this month in the evening due to the case of Sebastian. You will undoubtedly hear with great sorrow how this wretched man has disturbed the church. I wish one of you could be with us at our synod. We will strive not to be divided. Pray to God, the God of strength and peace, that we may accomplish everything not out of passion, but according to His will.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 22, 1537.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger and Leo, pious and very learned men, his most esteemed friends and brothers. Zurich.</p>
