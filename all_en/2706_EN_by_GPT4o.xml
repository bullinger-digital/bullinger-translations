      <p>Greetings. The matter of the oath, my dear Bullinger, rightly concerns you, as it troubles me so much that I do not know if anything else could do so more. We have acted in our duty before the senate with the most serious intercession we could, and we have also publicly addressed the same issue. But we have not succeeded in having our people clearly confess their error or in having the decree revoked, and the envoy had already left for Schaffhausen before the senate was granted to us. Nevertheless, there are those who are touched in conscience, convicted by the word of truth, although the pursuit of human favor and the fear of some unknown dangers prevail, which they will (I fear) experience all the sooner, the more they deviate from the evident prescription of Him who alone builds and guards the city. However, by the singular providence of the Lord, it happened that our envoy understood from Uranus that it would not be free in the Five Cantons to not swear by the saints, which had been clearly indicated at the beginning, I hear. Therefore, moved by this message, our people have decided at the next assembly, together with yours and the people of Bern, to urge that either an oath formula be read according to the religion of both parties or that the swearing be postponed to another time, with the faith of the treaties meanwhile preserved, until it can be agreed upon in full among all the orders of the Confederates. And for this very reason, we will not cease to pray to the Lord that our people may persist in their purpose, in whose hand alone are the hearts of kings. I have nothing new at the moment, except that Ferdinand is reported to be devising all sorts of schemes with his priests and to be moving like a snake in all directions to elude and break the efforts of the princes concerning religion, and also to be planning the postponement of the assemblies. But the princes, however, remain steadfast in urging and pursuing the pious plan for true peace concerning religion. Valentin Boltz is leaving us, called to Swabia to plant a new church for Christ near Memmingen. He easily obtained permission from the senate, both because they did not want to fail the pious zeal of the one who had called him, and for other reasons. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. Basel, August 30, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
