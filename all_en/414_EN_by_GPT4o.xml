      <p>My friendly, willing service, along with all the love and goodness I can offer, first of all, to the pious, honorable, highly learned, dear cousin. I have learned from your letter, as well as from my brother David's writing, with what friendly, gracious, and fatherly inclined will you have received him into your house, there treating him like your own child for many days, until you gave him shelter and kept him at your expense, entirely undeserved. Therefore, my dear mother and I express our highest, most heartfelt thanks to you and let you know with assurance that, if possible, we will strive to repay you and yours with a willing heart, always awaiting your command and will.</p>
      <p>I have delivered your greetings and have them greet and thank you in return. May the almighty, eternal, good God grant us all His grace.</p>
      <p>Dated January 22, 1549. Bern. Your entirely willing cousin Hans Zehender.</p>
      <p>To the pious, wise, highly learned master Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his especially dear and kind cousin.</p>
