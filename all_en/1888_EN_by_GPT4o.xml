      <p>I acknowledge your singular kindness, most excellent Bullinger, in that you, to satisfy my earnest request, have not hesitated to write so extensively and accurately about the providence and predestination of God. Although I admire the exceptional learning and modesty in your writings, to tell the truth, I cannot agree with you on everything. For you write that God permits certain things in such a way that you seem to remove all action from Him. We say that God permits many things when He does not renew with His spirit but hands over men to be led by their desires. And although God Himself does not create evil desires in us, which are otherwise born with us, we assert that He prescribes the place, time, and manner, so that nothing happens otherwise than how He has previously determined it to happen: for, as Augustine holds, He even orders darkness. In short, we attribute all actions to God, but leave the vice, if any, to men. I believe Augustine expressed this with these words: To sin is in the power of men; but that men, by sinning, perform this or that work is not theirs, but of God who orders the darkness. Again: God indeed fulfills certain good wills through the evil wills of evil men. Finally, this pertains to that: For the great works of the Lord are such that in a wondrous and ineffable way nothing happens against His will, even what is against His will.</p>
      <p>But I act with little prudence in reminding you of these things, to whom all of Augustine is most well-known. You do not approve of Calvin, who writes that God not only foresaw the fall of the first man and in it the ruin of his descendants but also dispensed it by His own will. Unless we concede this, we will remove all providence and wisdom of God from the midst. Indeed, I do not see how this statement of Solomon encompasses anything less, "The Lord has made everything for its own purpose, even the wicked for the day of evil": and that of Paul, "All things are from Him, through Him, and to Him." I omit other phrases used by the most learned Calvin, as they occur everywhere in the sacred scriptures. Nor can I consider it either inept or dangerous if we imitate the manner of speaking used by the Holy Spirit. And unless it seemed superfluous, I would again and again ask you to be careful that no dissension arises among you because of these matters. For it will not only considerably retard the course of the gospel, but you will not sustain a cause that is already failing on its own for much longer, unless I am completely mistaken.</p>
      <p>If you send your children here, they will be to me in the place of dearest brothers. I have spoken with the dearest man, Mr. Cheke, about Coelius Secundus, whom I believe has informed you by letter what he has done or is about to do. Farewell, dearest Bullinger, and bid all the brothers farewell in my name, especially Mr. Probst, my most gracious host, Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Butler, our countryman, etc. Farewell again in London, June 3. Your most loving, Bartholomew Traheron.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a father and lord truly to be revered.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
