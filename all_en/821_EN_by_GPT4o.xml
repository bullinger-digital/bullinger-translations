      <p>Greetings. I have nothing new to write that I haven't written before.</p>
      <p>You complained recently that I write less frequently; however, I have more reason to complain about you, as you have not responded even once to the many letters I have written about my affairs. The delegates in Baden have been entrusted with my business as well; I am now awaiting a response.</p>
      <p>The delegates are Mr. Johannes Rudolf von Erlach and Pandereta Tormann. The former is somewhat learned and the wealthiest of all the Bernese, with gentle and approachable manners, yet he has cared little for my affairs so far, as he always seemed to favor the opposing party. The latter is from the butchers' guild, a stern and harsh man, yet not opposed to our side, which I want you to know so that you understand how to deal with them.</p>
      <p>The treasurer is still at home, feeling no more pain except that he cannot walk. He sends you his diligent greetings, as does Mr. Musculus. And Mr. Jacob von Burgund, Count of Fallais, a relative of the Emperor, wishes to send you his greetings; he wrote to me these days and also sent letters to you, which he received from England. I recognize the handwriting of Ulmeniss; if they contain any news, let us know here as well. Farewell. Greet your entire household from me; my family and Mr. Musculus's family also send their greetings to you. Bern, January 28, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>After I had written this and the person to whom I was going to deliver it delayed his departure, behold, Zenggius came and brought me your letters, to which I have nothing to respond at present. You are not unaware of how burdensome it will be for me in many ways and for many reasons to remain here. Yet, may the Lord's will be done! If the world repays me poorly, I still expect a reward from the Lord, to whom I am consecrated.</p>
      <p>From your letters to Mr. Musculus, I easily perceive how your entire effort is inclined here, so that I may be detained here; I believe you do this with no ill intent. However, in the meantime, my affairs are not well taken care of, and I, who deserve better, am being pushed out by your company. But I am so disposed that, if it seems so to the Lord, I would even wish to leave greater things for His sake. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and faithful minister of Christ and the church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, my most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
