    <p xml:id="regest1">What is said about the [allegedly broken out in Konstanz] plague is not true; indeed, quite a few suffer from quartan fever and others from a head illness, but most recover. The rumor about a fish die-off is also false or at least exaggerated. Requests news about the negotiations in Bern.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Your letters have been delivered to me, to which I have nothing to respond, except that what is said about the plague is a tale. Quartan fever is common among us; furthermore, some suffer from a certain head illness. However, there are not a few who fall ill; some pass away, but the majority recover.</p>
      <p>Regarding the fish, there is nothing of the sort. In the upper lake, quite a few dead fish have been found, but not in such large numbers and only of one species. Rumor flies and gains strength as it goes, etc. This is written hastily. If you have any news from the Bern negotiations, let me know, in good faith, let me know everything. September 22.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother. Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
