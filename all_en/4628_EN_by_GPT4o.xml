      <p>S. These letters or this copy of the letters were delivered to me late at night.</p>
      <p>The minister (namely the son of Mr. Philipp, a colleague), who delivered them to me, to whose community these are also addressed, affirms that things are not in a bad state; because in the Upper BÃ¼ndnerland several large courts have come together, namely Schams, Heinzenberg, Thusis, Rheinwald, Savognin, Tschappina, who mean business seriously. For until now it has been an oligarchy.</p>
      <p>I hope to God it will change.</p>
      <p>This Jan Florin, who is mentioned here, and the Mr. Doctor, now in Baden (you understand) and another, Cabalzar, are the real dear children, perhaps they have overstepped the mark; because one must act roughly, or simple people do not understand. I am sending you this copy so that you can have it copied and leave a copy of it with our messenger on his return. And if you think it will not be a pleasing service to Mr. von Rosintz and the district judge, share it with those from the Gotteshaus and the courts.</p>
      <p>It can bring much good; because the assembly of the league is near, and it is not possible for me to write everywhere. If you, with an honorable council of the city of Zurich, handle the matter seriously and plead for Mr. Beccaria, I have no doubt, with the help of our dear God, we will once again outwit the devil. This is a wonderfully good, serviceable matter for the Glarus affair; because exactly those who are pursuing the Mausaxer affair against Mr. Beccaria are the right fellows.</p>
      <p>But as you understand from this copy, they have brought the fire upon their own feet, etc. These things late at night, and indeed very hastily, since they had to be given the same evening, because ours leave around 4 in the morning. Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>On the day of the other.</p>
      <p>The same, whom you know, your most observant.</p>
      <p>This copy of the letters, which I sent with these of mine, you will return; for I have kept none, etc. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant head of the Zurich church, his lord and patron.</p>
