    <p xml:id="regest1">Laments that Bullinger and Jud, despite being invited [to participate in the Bern Synod], did not respond. Sebastian [Meyer] could not substantiate the accusation of false sacramental doctrine and had to apologize to Megander and Erasmus [Ritter], but will likely hold on to his view; the accused are unjustly suspected of being opponents of the Concord. It has been decided that teaching about the sacraments should continue in the usual manner and avoid new terms. In regard to the Concord, no concessions beyond the confession sent to Luther and the Bern Disputation should be made. These resolutions have been approved by the Great Council. As for the dispute at the Lausanne Synod between Caroli and Calvin, Farel, and Viret, the latter allow the discussion of the persons [of God] and the Trinity, without being committed to it by their opponent. This report is intended to silence those who spread falsehoods. Luther is said to have died; had this happened two years ago, the church would now be in a better position. Bucer's cunning plans can be found in the enclosed letter; Bern's response will be communicated later. The Württemberg envoy Philipp [Lang] was unsuccessful and sends a letter back.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I cannot sufficiently express in writing my disappointment that, despite being in such a dangerous, perplexing, and ambiguous situation, and despite not even being asked, you, who have been seen as our guiding force, did not stand by us with a word. I cannot understand or justify how this happened, nor can I, after much thought, suspect you of any ill intentions. But I want you to know that your silence has greatly affected the brothers, and not without reason. You seem to have been seen by many as lifting the anchor you have uniquely provided until now and even preparing to depart from us. I, however, always hope for better things, so firmly that it does not touch my mind, let alone come to my thoughts. But to what end are these words?</p>
      <p>Let us proceed to the matter at hand and hear how everything was conducted at our synod:</p>
      <p>We do not doubt that it is already known and confirmed to you that our Sebastian has badly misrepresented us, accusing us in more than one place of having preached inadequately and not reverently about the sacraments, and asserting, whether he lives or dies, that in our church we must discuss these matters differently, almost under oath. Because not only we but also our council could not hear or bear this, they convened a general synod in our city at the end of May and explained the reason for the convocation, attending and sitting for two whole days to resolve the matter. And when, after two days of debate, he could not prove that we had taught incorrectly about the presence of Christ in the faithful's communion, the sacramental union, the true eating of Christ, the manner in which Christ offers himself to the faithful to eat, or the power or use of the sacraments or ministry, we appealed to the council and synod to judge and deliberate between us. And so that we would not be accused of being judges in our own case, we, along with Sebastian, left the assembly and entrusted the matter to those named. And if we had not dealt more gently with the man, he would undoubtedly have been condemned by the decree of the council and synod to retract and revoke the slander brought against us. But we, sparing the man either out of respect for his venerable old age or because he has suffered nothing for the restoration and propagation of the gospel and truth, were content with this alone, that he was ordered to ask us to forgive all the offenses he caused us in and outside the synod through thoughtlessness. This was done, hopefully not to the great detriment of our church. I fear the man will not change his intended and undoubtedly assigned purpose, especially when he sees one or two drawn to his opinion, until he either draws all to himself or disturbs the church. The man does not sleep, so I do not hope for peace as long as he remains with us. These are the matters that transpired between Sebastian and us, that is, Erasmus and me, and certainly not without great pain in our hearts. For it greatly grieved us to deal with such a man and brother in this way, even though there are those who suspect or slander us as being quite different, namely as inventors of dissensions or disturbers and hinderers of Christian peace and concord.</p>
      <p>As for the manner of preaching about the sacraments, it has been decreed and decided that the manner hitherto observed in our churches should not be changed, but should continue as before, namely, that we should discuss the sacraments simply, openly, with familiar and customary words, omitting and neglecting rare and newly, so to speak, invented terms, such as substantially, really, corporally, personally, ineffably, incomprehensibly, and miraculously, and any other terms unfamiliar and unusual to our churches.</p>
      <p>Regarding the concord, apart from our common confession recently sent to Luther and the disputation held in Bern, nothing else. All these matters were referred to our deacons by the synod, received and approved by them.</p>
      <p>As for the Lausanne Synod and the controversy of Caroli against Calvin, Farel, and Viret, it is already known to you that the Genevans think about God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit in a holy and catholic manner, and not differently from us about the sacraments. They do not require nor reject the terms of persons and the Trinity, but they did not want to accept them in the grace of Caroli.</p>
      <p>So, dearest brothers, you have everything conducted and transacted at our synod written in order, everything, I say, that is important for you to know, and this for the sake of truth, so that you can silence all mouths asserting different things.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that Luther has passed away. If only this had happened two years ago in the Lord! Undoubtedly, our church would be in a much safer position than it is now.</p>
      <p>What Bucer is attempting against us, you can clearly see in the letter sent to you. Whether it is deceit or virtue, I beseech you to consider. What response he will receive from our people, you will soon know either in person or by letter. Behold the troublesome old age! When he sees that this, that is, the fox-like approach, does not succeed, he dons the lion-like one.</p>
      <p>Farewell for a long time in safety, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 26, 1537.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Doctor Philipp, the envoy of the Duke of Württemberg, has obtained nothing of what he requested from us. He earnestly asks that I send these letters back to you.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished men in learning and piety, Bullinger and Leo Jud, preachers in Zurich, their dearest brothers.</p>
