      <p>S. P. D. At the time the courier was present with us, there were almost two reasons why I did not write back to you: one because I am not able to express the feelings of my heart in the German language, the other because I was overwhelmed with so many urgent affairs that I scarcely had any leisure. However, the love with which I ardently pursue you has momentarily drawn me away from my affairs and compelled me to completely set them aside until another time. Then finally, I most joyfully prepared myself for the continuous exchange of letters, so that with this effort, I might somehow satisfy your mind with my most humble letters. For indeed, I love, cherish, and embrace you, and I also give the greatest thanks, who have deigned to send me both the most elegant and kind letters, while I have been more negligent and remiss in writing until now. But your received letter has shaken off all my inertia. Although affairs do not allow it at this time, I have entrusted everything I decided to write to you to this Mercury (messenger) and I ask you to trust him, as time forbids me to paint more. Rightly, however, I lament your absence, who have been an outstanding friend to me (indeed I will say patron) and have so bound me to you with your benefits. Even if I were to pledge my life (less good), I cannot repay you with equal thanks; therefore, since life and goods do not suffice to repay thanks, it is still possible to have them. Oh, if only the distance of these places had not separated our bodies by such an interval, so that we might use that familiarity which we used before. I hope, however, that you will soon see England; if you would be willing to do so, I would then call myself most fortunate, to whom it may be allowed to enjoy your long-desired presence again. I beg you, my father, in my name, to impart many greetings to your wife, my mother, and to bid all my other friends to be well with one greeting.</p>
      <p>In Gloucester, October 27, 1551. Farewell. Rachel is in excellent health (thanks be to God) and greets you and your wife and asks for your blessing and prays that God may deign to bless her in your blessing.</p>
      <p>Your perfect friend forever obliged, Anne Hooper.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>Anne Hooper</p>
