      <p>Well-educated, worthy, especially gracious dear sir, we send you our friendly greetings, willing service, along with whatever we can offer in honor and goodness, beforehand, gracious dear sir.</p>
      <p>We are of the opinion that you are well aware that our schoolmaster, whom God has been gracious to, has passed away and departed from this life, which has caused us to seek another. Meanwhile, our dear citizen Hans von Hinwil from Elgg has kindly suggested a young man, whom he considers suitable, and has requested that we accept him, as he was raised in Elgg and by our gracious lords. Now, we were inclined to accept him immediately. However, we have refrained from doing so because we considered that our gracious lords might not be fully satisfied with this decision and might not approve of such a hasty action. This is not our intention; but if it were to be with the consent of our lords, we would gladly accept him and show him the duties that would be required. However, if it is not the will of our lords, we would let it be a good matter. For, at the request of von Hinwil, we are inclined to consider him. We have wished to inform you of all this with good, friendly intentions, so that you might perhaps be able to give the good young man guidance to further pursue the matter. Entrusting you to God's protection, who may always keep you in good health.</p>
      <p>Given in haste, on the Exaltation of the Cross, in the year 1542. The mayor and council of Winterthur.</p>
