    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the help that his brother-in-law Hans Sunnenmann found with Bullinger. Reports in detail how Heinrich Lavater, with a student from Lindau, went swimming in the nearby Ill in the evening [of July 4] - against the instructions of his landlord Bedrot, who was visiting the traveling Simon Grynäus together with [Christian] Herlin - secretly, then competitively crossed it and drowned while swimming back due to a cramp in front of the eyes of the leader [Melchior Cumanus] and some students of the college; according to the confession of his companion, they had already bathed at the same spot around noon, where a similar incident had passed off lightly. Requests further support for [Hans Sunnenmann]. Bullinger will know the latest news about the occupation of Münster, etc. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Peace and tranquility of conscience through Christ.</p>
      <p>From the letters of my brother-in-law Hans Sunnenmann, I recently learned, most learned Bullinger, of your not at all ordinary benefits towards him and your great benevolence, for which nothing else delayed me from diligently thanking you than a faithful messenger, whom I finally found as I wished.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, such a bitter event shook me completely, so that in what my mind had conceived, it could achieve nothing more: I mean the sad and unexpected death of Heinrich Lavater, about which, since the pain is too intense to allow me to write at length, I wanted to inform you in a few, but very true words. Simon Grynäus had conveniently turned into our city, returning from Tübingen on the 5th of July, whom we all greeted the next day, and Bedrot (as a more familiar friend) met him again with Herlin after dinner, having business with a certain Greek author, leaving all his companions (as he thought) at home. However, Lavater and the student from Lindau secretly slipped away to the bank of the Ill river, not far from the city walls, where, while they prepared to bathe in the cold water, the head of our college happened to come upon them with some students and offered them the opportunity to bathe together, intending to be a spectator of the game. While the others lingered in the shallow water near the bank, Lavater and his companion, as if to reproach the others for cowardice, boldly headed for the opposite bank, and when they reached it and, now secure from danger, tried to swim back with the same audacity, to the amazement and applause of the others, suddenly poor Heinrich's strength failed him where the river was deepest, so that he could neither emerge himself nor be helped by others. Those who witnessed the tragedy conjecture (and perhaps not in vain) that he was strongly seized by a cramp while swimming; for he only cried out once or twice when he was already sinking, and it is said that before they entered the river, he remarked that he would yield to no one in swimming, if he did not suffer a cramp so easily. Indeed, as the student from Lindau finally confessed to us, the same thing almost happened to Heinrich at the same place on the same day; for while Bedrot visited Grynäus after lunch with us accompanying him, those two bathed alone without anyone knowing, and Heinrich's own instinct warned him what he should beware of, as his limbs were so constricted by a cramp while bathing that he confessed the danger to his companion. Bedrot had altogether forbidden bathing to all his people more than once, and perhaps jokingly during lunch, he had mentioned the old superstition of the people that the day of Saint Ulrich was ominous, and many were accustomed to perish by water or by falling. But all these things could not save poor and imprudent Heinrich from the death that was already imminent. Fate was pressing, and he had to perish, for he never otherwise slipped away or went out without greeting his teacher. Bedrot had no one who needed less to be scolded or deterred from vices or dangers. He seemed wise by himself, for which reason he was dearer to his teacher than the others, and his death caused him even greater grief. He grieves no less than if he had lost a son, and not only grieves but also fears that you or Heinrich's father might blame him. I earnestly ask that you do not do so. For as far as the care of a man and a teacher can foresee, he omitted nothing to prevent such a thing from happening to Heinrich. I, who almost share a house with Bedrot, can testify to this clearly. Therefore, be more fair to a man who is your friend and afflicted by the adverse event just as you are. We do not doubt you, knowing that you interpret human events humanely, but it will depend greatly on your wisdom and faith that the father bears it more moderately. If only I could have written more pleasant things to you; perhaps the cheerfulness of the mind would have somewhat polished the style. Now, with the mind squalid from grief and sorrow, only sordid words flow from me.</p>
      <p>I thank you as much as I can for the benefits bestowed upon my relative and promise that for these and for our old friendship, I am prepared to gratify you in whatever matter I can.</p>
      <p>About the occupation of Münster in Westphalia and other news, you are undoubtedly already informed.</p>
      <p>Greet for me Leo, Pellican, Theodor, and the other learned and studious ones.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, 4th of the Ides of July, 1535.</p>
      <p>Petrus Dasypodius.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in learning and commendable in humanity, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his friend and brother. Zürich.</p>
