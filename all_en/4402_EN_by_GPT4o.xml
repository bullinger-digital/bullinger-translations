      <p>At this moment, I receive these from brother Thomas, who asks that if you have written to Grindal, you send these along with yours to him. He also sends a pamphlet about the newly necessary papacy, which I will send to you soon after reading, in case you judge it worthy to be printed, although perhaps it is not wise to further provoke these hornets. August 21, 1560.</p>
