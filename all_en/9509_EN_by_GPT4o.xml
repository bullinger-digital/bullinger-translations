      <p>S. I do not cease, most reverend father, to be a bother to you.</p>
      <p>I send what I receive from the gates of Italy, as if from the other side of the world. It is also confirmed from there what is reported from Germany about the defeat of the Albanians and the dangerous illness of the king. - It is said that the envoy is laying traps for us in Rhaetia and digging pits, into which I wish the former would fall! We are warned to be prudent and cautious against him, who with his money can now do anything and who tries in every way to undermine us secretly through tunnels. I could easily believe this, and he would gladly take the first experiment on me if it were possible in any way. I will explain the reason to you next time. Outwardly he is charming, but inwardly he suffers from the French disease. I have not yet finished what I was going to send about the court proceedings; thus, one thing after another hinders me. But I do not want to trouble you with more.</p>
      <p>Farewell then, eternally greeted by all our friends. Most swiftly from Chur, Rhaetia, November 30, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. I have just now received the letters from Mr. Haller and cannot respond to them at the moment. I am saddened by his illness and wish him well. May he be safe.</p>
      <p>I am also sending a copy of the letters given to the Bishop of Como by the Rhaetians at the past assembly, when Mr. Helvetius was here. Regarding these, a present judgment sent to us from Italy, please, if you can through business, read it and show the same to Mr. Gwalther. It is hardly believable how much the foreign monks press to be admitted into the Valtellina against the country's laws. They recently had a patron here who publicly pleaded on their behalf: the people of Como and Milan are planning something against our merchants and their goods unless free access is granted and opened to foreign monks. Behold the impudence of men and the laziness and negligence of our people. Why do they not bring such coercers into order, why do they allow such threats to weaken the ancient laws of the Rhaetians?</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most illustrious Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most reverend father.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
