      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. I received your book, most learned man, on the grace of God, which you gave me out of your usual kindness, on July 20. Today, the books were also delivered to the scribe and to Ulstetter, who is a parish priest in the countryside, in a large village, Gebsheim.</p>
      <p>I read the preface to the King of Denmark; if only the princes would read it and kiss the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, so that they would not be led astray by the flattery of words, and by the various and foreign papists. But how few listen to these things and repent? We see those who hold power, although they confess the Son of God steadfastly, deny Him by their deeds.</p>
      <p>The one who is set over us has now shortly after his return begun to publicly consort with prostitutes, and also to scrape together and extort money from those who labor for him with money, through right and wrong; he lives securely and licentiously. The church and the holy ministers are of little concern, etc., etc. And what do I say? See, Lord, and judge your cause. But, unless I am mistaken, He will soon rise and come to us with glory and majesty to powerfully liberate His elect. Let it be so, let it be so. Amen.</p>
      <p>I wish that all your German sermons and those of the brothers would be collected by Froschauer and printed in one book; certainly, they would be scattered by many. There is no bookseller now who brings new books here. I think Quirinus has long since been taken by death; that William the Frenchman of Basel has already ceased, worn out by disease and old age. If anyone would occasionally bring new books to us, they would be bought by the brothers, etc.</p>
      <p>They say that Margrave Albrecht passed through Basel with 6 unknown horsemen, recognized in Bern, but dismissed without honor. He is heading to France.</p>
      <p>As for the state of my health, take it thus: that swelling, which occupied my feet for several months, then my stomach, finally, while I hoped to be freed by the work of doctors, pervaded my whole body in just a few days, so that I thought it was over for me. But the gracious God, in His usual mercy, looked upon me and suddenly removed the most troublesome swelling, which did not allow me to either eat or sleep quietly, within eight days. Now, leaning on a staff, I walk around the house. If my feet do not fail in their duty and help the weakness of the body as much as they can, I might enter the temple of the Lord within a month to sing a hymn with holy Hezekiah to the best and greatest God. Then, going out into the open, I will proclaim the great deeds of God to my old comrades. Farewell. July 22, 1554. Our people greet you. Greet your colleagues, especially Pellican, who is also long-lived as I am. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>From Riquewihr.</p>
      <p>Your very own Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the people of Zurich, his lord and dearest brother, etc., to his hands.</p>
