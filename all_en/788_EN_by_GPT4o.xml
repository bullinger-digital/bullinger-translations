      <p>Our friendly greetings with the offering of honors, and whatever we are capable of in love and goodness, may it always be with you, honorable, highly and well-learned gentlemen and Christian brothers. We have read your learned and earnest letter to us with diligence and a fully inclined will. In which we, as in your other writings, perceive your faithful care, which you bear for the teaching and admonition of the churches altogether, and how they might be maintained in peace and Christian unity. And since you notice that between us, the pastors on one side and an honorable council as our regular high authority here in St. Gallen on the other side, a discord or tension is said to have arisen, about which you have received a complaint and have applied your fatherly diligence with friendly instruction to extinguish the same, we thank you for that above all; it is also a heartfelt sorrow to us that you should be burdened and laden on our account among so many of your affairs, which we well recognize, and also be troubled with suspicion against us in such a case, where we are not aware that we have ever had any discord or tension with our dear lords and superiors. For, as your writing to us states, that a Christian authority may establish statutes from compelling and important causes in matters of marriage, to which the subjects should also be obedient, we are not opposed to this and let it remain so; indeed, we ourselves, who are of the marriage court, have sometimes helped to enforce statutes. And at the time in the year 1549, when our lords and superiors established and announced a statute that the third degree of kinship should not be allowed for marriage, we have never opposed this statute, but have let the authority prevail, and have agreed before small and large councils to help enforce the statute; for we are not unaware of what our most learned preceptor Master Heinrich Bullinger has written in his book about marriage, that no one should boast and rage about this, taste, push, and condemn the prohibition of the authority, etc. And we can well endure in such a multitude of people, that the forbidden degrees are held and honored all the more diligently by God, that in the nearest unprohibited ones, moderation is established by the order of secular authority. And if we are otherwise suspected in this, all this would be made known to us by our dear authority itself.</p>
      <p>But, honorable gentlemen and Christian brothers, since your earnest writing has reached us and you have undertaken our matter, it is our very humble request that you would kindly hear in short what and how the matter stands and is, from which the suspicion of discord between us and an authority has arisen, and share your Christian advice on this, so that help may be provided to us pastors, likewise to the lords and superiors, but especially to the two persons whom this matter concerns, for their soul and body. And it has the form, as you partly well know: It is the son of a pious citizen, an honest fellow Ludwig Haga, and the daughter of a pious citizen, an honest maiden, Rosina Zollikofer. These two persons are related in the third degree, so that both their grandfathers and grandmothers are siblings. This aforementioned Ludwig has taken the now mentioned Rosina in marriage, and they are both known and pressing for marital cohabitation. The two have not wanted to let the small and large council come together as married people because of the closeness of kinship, but that their marriage should not be valid, and Ludwig Haga may take another wife and Rosina Zollikofer another husband. Now it is to be known here that there has been no special prohibition according to statute in the degrees of kinship here in St. Gallen, as the general statute of Leviticus in chapter 18, and although in the year 1533 a conference was held in Zurich regarding these articles and our lords of St. Gallen appeared there through their envoy Franciscus Studer, yet the same did not have further authority to approve in this and other articles than what may serve unity according to God's word, and thus it was separated from Zurich.</p>
      <p>For it would have been difficult for our lords at that time not to remain firm by God's word and thereby give occasion to the adversaries, also to defend the statutes of their religion outside of God's word, as then this is shown and capable by the instruction of our lords, given at that time, and the written decision, placed in the hands of the cities in Zurich, as they are at hand, so that until the time when this present matter with Haga and Zollikofer occurred, no statute in our lords' city in this case has ever been made or established, but since the year 1533 in our lords' city marriage court judgments have been issued, where persons in the same degree of kinship as Haga and Rosina, of the third degree, have been recognized as married people and confirmed with public church attendance.</p>
      <p>Here now is the question of Ludwig and Rosina, since they have entered into marriage at the time when they could do so without divine prohibition and without the prohibition of the authority's statutes and others in the same case have been allowed and not separated by a council, but through the recognition of a marriage court, whether he should also be granted divine and civil freedom and no new beginning be made with him after the matter has occurred, since he has asked the preachers, his pastors, whether it may be with God, before and when he gave the marital handshake with Rosina, and no prohibition has been shown to him hereabout, with the offering, if anyone thought he had deceitfully won over the daughter, he would give his proper answer.</p>
      <p>To this question, put to us, we have resolved: since Ludwig Haga has not acted against God's prohibition nor at that time against an authority and civil fairness demands that he should not suffer for the subsequent statutes, but the cases that occurred before the statute in matters of marriage, which are not against God, should remain in force for the sake of conscience, as then the authorities of the Christian cities have always reserved the same in their renewals, and yet everyone should be warned and know in the future that in such cases one will refer to the statute. And as long as we do not obtain better information, we will not be able to allow Ludwig Haga another wife, nor Rosina another husband, since their conscience stands thus.</p>
      <p>This now recounted opinion we have presented to our gracious, dear lords, small and large councils, and have recounted it at length in a friendly and virtuous manner without any heat, from which nothing could ever have been ignited. We have also not noticed or ever understood it, but have let ourselves be dismissed with a friendly farewell, hoping that our lords and superiors would find a good means in this according to their wisdom and strive at the place where nothing has been acted against God nor their statute concerning the degree, to approach the Lord's law (in contentious matters) as closely as possible, as Master Heinrich also speaks very Christianly and expressively in the aforementioned place, etc.</p>
      <p>This is the matter, dear gentlemen and brothers. Therefore, we ask you as our faithful preceptors and well-practiced and understanding gentlemen, that you would, for God's sake and for the comfort of the two troubled people, send us your Christian report; for these two persons are pressing us for the resolution of their conscience and want to bring their matter to a legal recognition, so that their hearts may be at peace, and they desire such reassurance of their conscience from us. Therefore, as mentioned before, we ask you to send your report and the same in German, so that it can be understood by many without our interpretation.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we ask that you do not take offense at our humble writing; for we desire that everyone knows what and how we have written. And the messenger will wait for your answer, and as soon as it may be, you would send the same back without delay. Where we can serve with our ability, we are always ready. May the Lord God give you His grace and preserve...</p>
