    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes for his long silence. Has written extensively to Leo Jud about [Hans] Pflaum, whose wife is on the way to bring him [back to Ulm]. The deficiencies of the churches are overemphasized by the [Spiritualists]; one of them, Sebastian Franck, who is naturalized in Ulm, has submitted a letter of justification to the council after the appearance of his "Paradoxa," which is reminiscent of [Hans] Denck and [Ludwig] H채tzer. With Kaspar Schwenckfeld, who now lives in the house of the mayor [Bernhard Besserer], Frecht, together with Bucer and [Ambrosius] Blarer, has reached an agreement in T체bingen; towards Franck, who burdens the church more than Schwenckfeld, he has never shown leniency.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, most learned Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Why should I not indeed take kindly to those letters of yours, not awkward and forced, but truly fitting and written spontaneously out of the right of charity in the case of Pflaum? To which, I wish, according to your wishes, I will respond and first of all excuse myself well for that long silence of mine, which I hope you do not think is to sever friendships like the pagans, but rather to unite more in the Lord like Christians. For my respect and charity towards you are not so weak that they constantly need paper witnesses. Therefore, much more rightly than you, both the beginning and the end of this letter will be adorned with this saying: "Although I write more rarely, Bullinger is nevertheless most commendable to my mind."</p>
      <p>But regarding the case of Pflaum, excellent Bullinger, what should I respond to you, I do not have so readily at hand. You have tried solidly and piously, as you write, to persuade him to return. Now his wife herself, with a notary, her relative, has embarked on such a difficult and certainly inconvenient journey to you, not so much as a vehement orator but as a successful pleader by her own judgment. She will reclaim her husband, who is much more suitable for supporting the family than for learning letters, which, when he was still a boy, he could not easily grasp due to his simplicity. But I have written more extensively to the excellent man Leo Jud about the matters of Pflaum than to you.</p>
      <p>As for our churches, which I do not doubt you also care for, everything is such that I would always wish for better, although the Lord by His goodness ensures that the magistrates' spirits are not at all slackened in maintaining and propagating the accepted religion. However, the listeners, alas, as I hear, this common evil is growing everywhere, are more numerous than the doers of the word. This is often exaggerated by those who favor the more subtle Anabaptists, such as the Silesian and Franconian spirits, who write and whisper many things in corners about the external and internal word, about the letter, the spirit, and their ministers, who openly teach that the scripture is not the word of God, that the internal word lies hidden in all minds, which only comes to light through the testimony of the external word, expecting another kind of ministry, calling, and ecclesiastical economy. Sebastian Franck, the author of chronicles and paradoxes, seems to be of this kind, whom our people almost imprudently than piously received into this city two years ago, and then into citizenship. When he had published that marvelous context of his Paradoxes in this city without the knowledge of the school presidents, the censors of published volumes, he was reported to the senate and offered himself for the declaration of those articles which were written by him obscurely or not piously enough. I have seen the prologue of this story begun with him in these days, but I expect the catastrophe daily. He indeed offered a declaration, but one which, in my judgment, needs another, for he is now obscure, now indeed slippery in the exposition of the external and internal word. You are not unaware of how Denck and H채tzer once played with the external word; you would swear they have revived in Franck and his accomplices. Nor are you unaware of how the Lutherans in that fierce sacramental battle have contended with the external word, which in my opinion they do not want to be separated from the internal word in the ministry, and that piously.</p>
      <p>Besides this Franck, we now have as a guest here in the house of our consul that Kaspar Schwenckfeld, with whom recently Bucer and our Blaurer and I have made an agreement in T체bingen. The terms of the agreement are these, that Schwenckfeld does not disrupt the entire ministry of our churches and we do not accuse him of this, indeed he himself wishes to diligently be present with us, so that the people may conspire to unite themselves in the Lord with zeal for true repentance and trust in Christ. I do not doubt, however, that you have learned something about this agreement from the brothers in Strasbourg, so that there is no need to comment on it more extensively with you now. However, I wanted to write about Franck, who is more burdensome to our church than Schwenckfeld, so that you might sometimes admonish us here by letters about those things which you think should be admonished. There are those who suspect us, as if we prefer to treat and foster such heretical minds indulgently rather than to rebuke them sharply according to Paul's admonitions. But they are mistaken; for we never advised that this innovator be received into the city. But he had his patrons, to whom he imposed his marvelous Christology, and I fear that he imposes on them to this day. Pray to the Lord that He may deliver our church from these various minds inclined more to destroy than to build. But about these and other things I will write to you more diligently at another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your fellow ministers, whom you should greet in my name and that of my colleagues, especially that venerable Pellican and Bibliander, truly, as it is said, learned men.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Ulm, October 14, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, Martin Frecht.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent in piety and doctrine, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church in Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
