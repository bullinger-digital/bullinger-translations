      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Mr. Peter returned to us from France, where he had been sent for a conference, safe and cheerful, thanks to God, escorted to us by two captains, certainly distinguished men. Today, they were heard in a full senate. At the beginning, they delivered letters to the consul and senate written by the Queen Mother, by Navarre, by Prince Cond√©, and by Admiral. Then they gave an excellent testimony to Mr. Peter, and that his presence in France bore the greatest fruit. Afterwards, they gave thanks for the concession itself. Mr. Martyr later explained through me what had been done with his entire legation and what fruit came from it. There, he explained everything about the conference, the causes of the conference, the beginning, the progress, and the rupture of progress by the cardinal and bishops. That the opponents withdrew with eternal disgrace. That now throughout all of France they know that they did not dare to meet. They then requested from the royal senate to suppress the gospel. This was openly denied by them, but it was consulted on how to act so that peace may be maintained. They see that they cannot retain peace unless they grant places to the pious where they may meet publicly. However, since it was previously decreed publicly by all states that our assembly should not be celebrated, so that even with this response the occasion for tumults may be cut off, the royal cannot abrogate this decree. Therefore, around the middle of December, new assemblies of the states of France have been called to then decide on evangelical places. In the meantime, no decree is published, but a place is nevertheless permitted to the evangelicals with modesty. Briefly: Martyr testifies - and Mr. Beza's letters also testify - that throughout all of France now, Christ triumphs against the will of the princes of the priests. Moreover, two princes write to our magistrate, although at present they have not yet achieved what they would have gladly wanted, they are nevertheless in good hope that soon our magistrate will hear something to rejoice about. Let us therefore pray to the Lord, that He may assist His cause and break the arts and furies of the adversaries. Farewell excellently.</p>
