      <p>Highly learned, pious, honorable and wise, gracious, dear sir, may my friendly, well-intentioned service always be with you. Gracious, dear sir, I thank you most highly for the recent news you have sent me, and there is nothing new with us, except that my lord treasurer von Graffenried has written to me, dated the 9th of this month, namely this opinion: "Regarding recent news, it has not happened anywhere as you have been informed before and as you have written to me; for my lords have actual news from Prince of Condé, how they have harmed the king's forces and driven the cavalry into the city of Paris with force and have slain about 600.</p>
      <p>But of the evangelicals, only about 180 persons have perished. Since then, the Condé forces have moved away from Paris and towards Sens, intending to await the black riders there. What then happens and is driven by them, time will tell." Furthermore, I am sending you herewith a venison from a deer; you may enjoy it with my gracious lord Wolfgang Haller in health and peace, as you please. And I ask you to accept it graciously. It is further my friendly request to you, that if you have any news, you would also share and inform me of it; for I will always strive to deserve it from you. With this, I commend you to God Almighty.</p>
      <p>Dated the 12th of December in the year 1567.</p>
      <p>Your well-intentioned servant Samuel Tillmann.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, pious, honorable and wise lord Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the divine word in Zürich, my gracious, dear lord and friend.</p>
