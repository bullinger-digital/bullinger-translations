      <p>Franciscus Portus to the man... S. P.</p>
      <p>Leonardus Prunardus, a man of a distinguished family and... renowned for his virtues, is sending his son there... so that the church may be established as if in another Geneva... so that neither my recommendation nor that of another... I did not want to give him any letters to you, so that at least some... of my respect for him I might show. I therefore ask of you..., that, since your singular humanity is most renowned throughout the world, you especially embrace such a man and assist him with advice and with the work, which is open to all, especially the pious, and to those like this man, who has endured much for the sake of piety and still endures. Indeed, I wish that his son may live with Mr. Josias most of all; if it cannot be done, then, I ask, most illustrious man, that you ensure he lives with another pious and honorable man, and that you commend the boy to him. You will indeed do a favor to the most grateful father of the boy; and as for me, who honors him as much as possible, I love the son both for the father's sake and because of his singular moral integrity, you will bind me in such a way that whatever you grant to him, I will consider it all as granted to me.</p>
      <p>Regarding the state of affairs in France, Germany, and even our own, from him who was in the court for a long time and often dealt with the king on the matter of religion, you will be able to learn easily and abundantly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>Geneva, September 5, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Franciscus Portus. To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the Zurich church.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
      <p>Franc[iscus] Portus the Greek.</p>
