    <p xml:id="regest1">Undoubtedly, Bullinger would like to know if Caesarius is still alive, especially since the plague is raging everywhere and has been sweeping away both old and young people in Cologne for two years now. For this reason, Caesarius was quite glad to be able to leave Cologne when a young count, highly educated in Greek and Latin [Hermann the Younger of Neuenahr], called him to [Moers]. He spent seven months there, from last summer until the beginning of the current Lenten season. For the time being, he is back in Cologne. Although the count has offered him to always live with him, he intends to spend only the summers with the count, but the winters in Cologne.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Caesarius has not received or read any of Bullinger's writings for a long time. If he has published something at the last [Frankfurt Book] Fair, he should send it, even though Caesarius is not quite sure how he could show his gratitude.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger should also write about how he is doing and what progress the evangelical doctrine is making in the [Confederation]. If only Caesarius were in such good health that he could visit [the people of Zurich]!</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior.</p>

      <p>There is no doubt, most distinguished man, that you are eager to know whether I am still alive, especially in this time when the plague is raging everywhere and has certainly taken many, both old and young, in Cologne for two continuous years. Meanwhile, I preferred to be away from Cologne rather than remain in that intense outbreak and await danger. However, I would not have fled if a certain count, a young man excellently educated, as he is not moderately trained in Greek and Latin, had not called me to him, where I stayed last summer for seven months until the beginning of Lent. Therefore, I have finally returned to Cologne, perhaps not to stay there long, since the same count clearly wishes and wants me to reside and stay with him permanently. To whom I gave the response that I would gladly stay with him during the summer, but in winter I would rather be in Cologne, and that for reasons which I refrain from narrating at present, as it does not greatly matter whether you know them or not.</p>

      <p>It has been a long time, my dear Bullinger, since I have received or even read any of your writings. Therefore, if you have published any at the last Frankfurt Fair, I ask you, according to your custom, indeed according to your benevolence towards me, to make me a participant of them. However, the reason I do not reciprocate is not due to a lack of will, but of ability, nor do I certainly know in what matter I could gratify you in return. Now it remains for you to also write back to me about your health and how the evangelical doctrine is thriving and progressing there. If only I were in such good health that I could be allowed to visit you there! I would indeed seem not a little happier.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From my house in Cologne, on the fifth day after Laetare Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Johannes Caesarius, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and wonderfully courteous man Heinrich Bullinger, his best and incomparable friend.</p>
      <p>At Frankfurt, to the hand of Froschauer, the printer in Zurich in Switzerland.</p>
