      <p>S. I wrote to you from Basel.</p>
      <p>You will be able to understand from the court if it is true that it was written to me from Milan that the Pope is sending the prior of La Scara to the Rhaetians, so that they may leave the Valtellina in the old religion and leave the care of temporal matters to those to whom it belongs; otherwise, he threatens excommunication and has arranged for Mr. Johannes Angelus Ritzo to be sent by King Philip to demand the same and to threaten that trade with the Milanese will be hindered. They will not lack a prudent response if it is true.</p>
      <p>I am sending you copies of the letters I received from Spain. The King currently resides in the castle of Boulogne, a one-hour journey from Paris.</p>
      <p>The hearts of him and all the princes are in the hand of God, so that He may use them for the glory of His name. We must pray that He has mercy on us and assists France.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends and love us.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, June 4.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
