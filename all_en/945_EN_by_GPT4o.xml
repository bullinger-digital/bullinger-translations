      <p>C[aelius] Through Christ Jesus, the only Savior, sends greetings.</p>
      <p>You seem to follow Bucer, you write, dearest brother, in a certain place of our institution, where I do not treat of the Lord's Supper, but strive to explain the place and chapter of the Lord's ascension for the dignity of Christ and for my own modesty. You think, along with my dearest Gwalther, that I explain that place not by a change of place and space, but only by a change of condition, which is indeed far from the truth, and you would never have come to this suspicion if you had examined a little more carefully what we write there. For we establish with you a double change, one of place, the other of condition. Those very words of mine could have told you this, which, when we taught about the changed condition, we immediately added as if another part of the change. They are as follows: "But if he ascended into heaven, rather above all heavens and to the throne of God, it was fitting that the height of sublimity should correspond to his abasement and humility on the other side." By these words, we openly confess that he not only departed in degree of dignity but also in intervals of places and was exalted on high.</p>
      <p>You then criticize that I wrote that Christ ascended in the same way he had descended. You deny this in every way. You say, God descended, God and man ascended, etc. Here lies a fallacy, when it is said to be entirely what is in part: God descended, God and man ascended, it is true, but this does not encompass all the ways of descending and ascending, but only one, namely, that which signifies the nature of Christ. But there is another way, which refers to condition and quality. I immediately declared this there, when I said: For he had descended from glory to ignominy, afterward he ascended from ignominy to glory. But if you wish to call it a fallacy, which is viewed in the homonymy of the word, because the words of descending and ascending are homonymous, I easily agree. But what, I beg you, my Bullinger, would you say if I had followed the words of Christ the Lord and Master:</p>
      <p>No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven? What also, if of the Apostle Paul: He who descended, he says, is the same one who also ascended above all the heavens, that he might fill all things. But if I had said so, since you have a clear understanding of my opinion on the Lord's Supper, you ought to have interpreted it in the best part. Now, however, I said less, I used lighter words; for I noted not the natures, but the manner and condition and rather the proportion of ascending and descending and a certain contrary relation, which that particle "so" or "as" could teach. But let us come to other things: You accept and approve my analogy of Christ's presence, when I say that this sun is a kind of image of Christ's presence; which, although it remains in heaven, is nevertheless present to all. Why do you not also apply all other things, if there were any doubts for you, which I discuss about Christ's presence, to this rule? For I refer the whole presence of Christ to the end and spirit. Those words teach, which are read a little before the place you noted; for they sound thus: Things other than spirit are not seen with the eye of the spirit. If anyone wishes to see Christ, let him open the eyes not of the body, but of the mind and faith. Which I also confirm there besides other things from Paul, who says that Christ dwells in our hearts through faith; for if faith is true and whole, it sees the whole, true, and entire Christ with one glance, not humanity elsewhere, divinity elsewhere, but sees God and man, one Christ our Lord. But that seems especially absurd to you, that I say he is present, not only through the spirit but also by his person, and here you bring up the usual opinion about the person, by which both natures of Christ, namely divine and human, are signified. I, my Bullinger, embrace that opinion about the person of Christ:</p>
      <p>As I do not confuse the natures of Christ, so I do not separate them, but I confess with all assertion both natures in one Christ. For there is one, says Paul, mediator of God and men: the man Christ Jesus. Now if I say that this Christ is present in his own person, as we Italians speak, that is, whole, true, and entire, not distracted and divided, not feigned, not diminished in any part, to the eyes of faith, by the work and illumination of the Holy Spirit, I think nothing absurd, nothing papistic, that is impious, nothing alien from the doctrine of the apostles, nothing alien from the custom of the true church, do I either believe or teach or affirm. But what you do not grant me from the spirit of Christ confirming the presence of Christ, I do not know what you mean.</p>
      <p>For it is the gift of the spirit to show us Christ and to illuminate the eyes of the mind, so that they may also search and see the most hidden things of God; for the spirit searches all things, says Paul, even the deep things of God. With this spirit, we see with Stephen the heavens opened and Jesus not only sitting but also standing at the right hand of the power of God.</p>
      <p>For just as wherever the spirit of God is, there is God, so also wherever the spirit of Christ is, there we must confess Christ, indeed even the Father, to be. If anyone loves me, says Christ, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.</p>
      <p>Likewise: Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I am in the midst of them.</p>
      <p>For it is not to be believed that he sent his spirit so that he himself would be perpetually absent from us; but the Holy Spirit is given for this reason, that we may believe Christ to be truthful, who also said: All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me, and shortly after: And behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age.</p>
      <p>Behold, he says, not only with my spirit, but wholly, as much as I am, in my own (as our people say) person. Yet there is no reason for you to fear that I, with this doctrine, call Christ down from heaven and include him in bread and wine or, to use your words, distill him by alchemical means, which art I have neither learned nor practiced. For these are entirely different things: that Christ, the true and divine sun, is present to all and to be included in bread; for he instituted his supper for this reason, that he might leave a monument of those things which he had done and performed for us in the days of his flesh, that is, in the state of humility. But he ascended into heaven, that he might appear before God for us, divinely administer his kingdom, that is, the church, and be present at the same moment to all who call upon him in faith.</p>
      <p>I am further amazed, since you also approve of what I said about the head Christ and his members, why you do not understand in the same way what I applied about the spirit to Christ's presence. For what I discussed about the sun, the head, and the word of the gospel in the same place ought to have brought light to the remaining places and removed all doubt from you. For we have never subjected the presence or sight of Christ to these gross and bodily eyes or senses, but to the pious mind, to faith, to the spirit, unless he himself wishes, as he did to some, to exhibit himself visible even to the eyes of the body. Therefore, according to my canon, which you could gather from those clear and certain notes, no one will be able to rightly accomplish or conclude anything other than that Christ is spiritually united with his church, spiritually present to his church, not so separated by intervals of places that he is not at hand to extend a hand to the afflicted and to restrain the wicked and impious; which brings great consolation to pious minds, but a certain pious fear to the weak and struggling, when they know that the Lord Christ is so perpetually present that he observes all their deeds and words.</p>
      <p>From these things, therefore, I think you see well enough, my most observant Bullinger, that I have involved myself in no great danger from the use of the pen or other words, if only they are rightly understood, as is fitting. But if these do not satisfy, write back; for I will try in every way to satisfy you. For I wished to respond to these few things openly and simply, without any color or disguise, which I have never used either to cover or overturn the truth, but to persuade it more gently, sometimes even more powerfully. To you, indeed, dearest brother, I am very grateful that you have kindly admonished me about what you were in doubt, and also to Mr. Gwalther, whom I see has progressed so far in the Italian language, and I rejoice, that he can not only understand but also judge my writings. Would that I had made as much progress in German; but a parrot, as they say, is too old to learn words.</p>
      <p>I have seen what you wrote in your previous letters about those young men of yours.</p>
      <p>I praise the correction, concerning which I will also remind my colleagues in your name, that they too may be somewhat stirred to vigilance, although I see that this is diligently cared for. But the perversity of young men at this time either deceives or surpasses all the diligence of good men. Concerning Mr. John Hooper, what you wrote was pleasing. I recently wrote to him and in turn expect letters from him. Farewell, dearest brother, and greet your wife with your sweetest children in our name. You will also bid your noble sons, most excellent young men, much health in my name along with Mr. Gwalther. Basel, 10th day before the Kalends of July, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours from the heart and with sincere faith, C[oelius] S[ecundus] C[urio].</p>
