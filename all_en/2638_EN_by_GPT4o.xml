      <p>Honorable, noble lord and especially trusted, gracious, dear and good friend, my friendly greetings, willing service along with all honors, love and goods, are always ready for you from me. I have received your letter along with the booklet called "The Christian Mirror" and have handed it over to my dear wife, who thanks you kindly for it and hereby sends you and your honorable wife friendly greetings and many good wishes. After that, I have also received and read with pleasure and willingness the two sermons that you have published about the Last Judgment. May the gracious God grant us all His grace, so that we may conduct and lead our lives, actions, and affairs in this time with piety and honor, so that we may appear with joy before His throne of grace on the day of the Lord and there, with all the faithful and chosen of God, await the comforting sentence and judgment that He will speak to those who are His righteous. Amen.</p>
      <p>Regarding the news you wrote to me about, it is almost of the same opinion here, and the story persists further and further, namely that the Queen of England is said to have died in childbirth, and if that were the case, I hope the Emperor's son will not have a place in England for long. It would be a good providence of God for the good of the Gospel in many things and especially in England; for as I am informed, the deceased queen's sister, to whom the kingdom is supposed to fall, was raised according to evangelical reformation, and in her I trust all good things. May the Lord grant His grace.</p>
      <p>May He stand by all troubled and distressed Christians like a father and graciously. Our confederates from the 7 places are dealing harshly with the honest people of Locarno, therefore it is necessary to do the best for them and have them recommended. A collection has been gathered here in the city and country, in the hope that it will soon be handed over to them. Your lord's messenger is here along with the bailiff from Schwyz regarding the gentlemen of Rapperswil; it might be partly tolerable if your lords had sent a messenger to another place in this matter instead of here. I hereby commend you to God. Dated the last day of May in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your entirely willing friend Niclas von Diesbach. To the honorable, well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my very friendly lord and good friend.</p>
