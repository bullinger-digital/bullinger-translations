      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>You are not wrong to reproach us, most kind Bullinger, for our negligence or should I say tardiness in replying, I do not know, since you have sent us such letters that are not only full of consolation but also laden and adorned with your paper gifts, to which we are so far from being able to respond that we have long since despaired of returning the favor. May the Lord repay you on that day.</p>
      <p>However, we hope that some room for defense is left, especially with such a fair judge.</p>
      <p>For at first, there was no subject for replying except for giving thanks for the benefits bestowed upon us, which you continually accumulate with new ones, while nothing is left for us but "thanks be to God," which we can return to you. Furthermore, I have had no other matter to write about, so much so that I asked our Jacob whether he had thanked you on behalf of both of us, who used the same pretext as I did. For what else could we trouble you with, who are otherwise so busy?</p>
      <p>Finally, since I previously wrote with difficulty, I now write with the greatest difficulty due to a goiter that has been attached to my throat for three years, which is so stubborn that it yields to no treatment, and so troublesome that I can hardly put on my shoes without someone else's help. I have indeed persuaded myself that I will have the same end as Franz Kolb.</p>
      <p>I almost completely desist from writing; for my breath is constrained. These and other things make me slower to write; therefore, you will easily forgive this fault for your kindness towards me.</p>
      <p>We are in doubt as to who is the heir to the Kingdom of Scotland; for we have persuaded ourselves that the king's only daughter, the wife of the Dauphin of France, has succeeded to the native kingdom together with her husband. With the Frenchman deceased, I have long since predicted such an end as with Pharaoh, Antiochus, Herod. I assisted the little woman as much as I could, not so much because she was dear to me for her piety, but because she was recommended by you; she speaks much good of you and your family, and also much of your hospitality. Farewell, most kind Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Jacob and the others greet you; I wish all the brothers well. In haste.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, 4th day before the calends of August, in the year 1559. Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man in piety, learning, and candor, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his dearest lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
