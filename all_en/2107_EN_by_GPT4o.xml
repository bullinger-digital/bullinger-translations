      <p>The most honorable magistrate of Geneva has written a brief letter to the most distinguished senate of our city. Since it was written in French, the honorable Mr. Consul sent it to our Mr. Gualter to be translated into German: thus it happened that I also saw and read it. They propose three questions to our people. 1. How, according to God's command and the scriptures, and with unblemished religion, excommunication should be exercised. 2. Whether it can be exercised in any other way than through the consistory. 3. What is done in this matter in our church. The letter was read in a full senate: soon the honorable consul and three distinguished men from the senators were appointed, who, together with three pastors of this church, would consult on giving a suitable response. They consulted and all unanimously agreed that a letter should be written to the most honorable senate of Geneva, expressing our sorrow that their church is so disturbed, that strife and contention are sown from strife and contention. We have long heard about the consistory laws of that church, and acknowledge them to be pious and in accordance with the prescription of God's word: therefore, it does not seem admissible that they should be changed through innovation. It is better that they remain intact, especially in this age, in which people are continually becoming worse. And although our discipline does not correspond to yours in all respects, it is nevertheless moderated according to the circumstances of the times, places, and persons, and we do not wish yours to be overthrown. Since your people have requested to know what is done by ours, a brief summary is sent. These decisions were made unanimously today, and tomorrow this response will be referred to the entire senate. Whether they will approve or disapprove of it, I do not know. I sincerely pray to the Lord that everything may turn out well for the glory of His name. We have certainly labored with all our might to ensure that nothing is done by our people that would tend to the derogation of the good laws of your church. We also urge you to continue to be faithful to the Lord, and to apply moderation in all things, so that you do not lose those whom the Lord wishes to be saved, who does not break a bruised reed, nor extinguish a smoldering wick.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed man, and dearest brother in the Lord. May our Budaeus live forever: may the Count of Martinengo live: and with them Mr. Gallasius and the other fellow ministers and brothers.</p>
      <p>Most hastily. Zurich, December 12, 1553. A copy, as they call it, of the letter from our most honorable senate is now being sent to me: at the same time, it is announced that the senate approved yesterday the response prepared by us. I see that the public document of the senate does not vary at all from what I recorded in these letters yesterday: indeed, they earnestly encourage your people to remain in what has once been accepted. We do not send the form of our discipline to prescribe even a little: it is better that the churches persevere in what has once been accepted, and indeed accepted from the scripture. Therefore, I am now writing letters to Mr. Simpert Vogt and Mr. Simon Sulzer, pastors of the churches of Schaffhausen and Basel, about the unanimous response of our magistrate, so that they are not ignorant of this, and that they too may seek peace and the edification of the church of Geneva, even if they do not have everything similar in their churches. May the Lord bless this matter through His Spirit, and direct your hearts in the way of peace. Amen, amen. I will also write to Bern to Mr. Haller and Musculus. I send these to them, praying that they may ensure they are delivered to you promptly. Love us in the Lord, my Calvin, and pray for us together with the brothers.</p>
      <p>May the excellent old man and well-deserving of the church, Mr. Farel, the first apostle of these parts, be safe. See to it, my Calvin, that you diligently and piously describe Servetus with his end to all the pious, so that all may abhor the beast.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 13. All of ours greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>Postscript. I am compelled to add this: you write that you offered the messenger 6 batzen per day; rightly. You write that our batzen are worth more and that 15 of ours make 16 of yours; rightly. But finally, I was to pay the messenger three florins as for eight days. But he says he spent five days coming here and claims he was forced to wait in Schaffhausen for several hours, about which our Ruggero said nothing to me about the waiting, as it is customary for those who ordered the waiting to write. In summary: he seems to me to be a good man.</p>
      <p>Consider the matter, and if there is anything to be added (which I do not think), add it, I ask you, and I will repay. Do not fail to write that you gave the courier so much money from Mr. Baionensis; for I wrote nothing. Farewell again, brother.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Bullinger, etc.</p>
