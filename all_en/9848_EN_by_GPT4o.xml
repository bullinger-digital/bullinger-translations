      <p>Greetings. Do not think, most illustrious man and most revered father in Christ, that I have completely forgotten you because I have not sent any letters for several weeks. At least for the sake of greeting your humanity, I wanted to write something, as I have nothing else to write, and even those things I could write, I know are more known to you than to us. I truly rejoice from the heart, as I hear from others that you have somewhat recovered, fervently praying to the Lord with all my heart that He may deign to support and preserve you for many years to come, as we would be truly orphaned in this world without you.</p>
      <p>I recently read the orthodox writing on the Lord's Supper and the consensus of the ancient church published in Heidelberg, which can educate and admonish the attentive reader learnedly and copiously on the main articles of controversy. I also recently received from the printer a complete copy of our Theodoret, which lacks nothing but the first page, which will contain the book's title and part of the preface, and this is to prevent a copy from being secretly stolen before the fair and published by someone else in the meantime, to the great detriment of the printer. The printer asks that I either compile the index myself in the meantime or give him the authority to compile it. He printed it quite elegantly and accurately. Besides this, I have nothing to write, except to ask that you deign to convey my greetings and those of my brothers to your colleagues in order, who also wish all good and happy things to your humanity, together with your individual friends and all, praying that you may briefly inform us of those things which you think we ought to know, even with the fewest words. Farewell eternally in the Lord with yours. Given hastily on December 9, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted son, Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most revered lord and father in Christ.</p>
