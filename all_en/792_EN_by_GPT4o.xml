      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have no doubt that you have received the pamphlets about the death of Pope Paul. Behold the astonishing matter: our fictitious provost of the great temple, Mr. A. Gumpenberg, the leader of all courtiers, came to us on December 29th, accompanied by a large retinue of silk-clad doctors and servants. I believe Venus's maidens were never so softly dressed, as Christ does not say in vain: "In the courts of kings are found those who wear soft clothing." Present was Doctor Matthias Held, a little man dressed in velvet inside and out, with a golden chain around his neck, hanging diagonally from one side to the other; a scabbard of silk, a sword covered in gold, a hat, belt, shoes, and leggings of silk.</p>
      <p>Mr. Theobaldus Papa, Mr. Paulus the physician, men of tall stature, follow the new provost, then the rest of the silk-clad. The bishop added a master to that court to make the pomp more splendid. He asked the senate for the provostship, which he had obtained from the pope and legally secured in Rome. However, our provost said in a few words that he had been elected and confirmed by our senate and held it under a just title in quiet possession for several years; therefore, he did not want to contend with him or accept any condition, entrusting it to the Basel senate to defend him from those robbers of ecclesiastical benefices. That fictitious man pushed many things, namely that he wanted to feed four tables daily, consume his goods, which he possesses, in Basel, and if the senate had any business before the emperor or king, he would easily settle it with those with whom he is held in high esteem. The senate replied with common votes that they had elected the provost, whom they also wished to preserve against all and had that power. A... confirmed... also... In the meantime, they brought forth the decree about the courtiers. The response was sad for the provost; but all tedium is devoured with astonishing cunning. See what Satan is plotting. Mr. Held bought splendid houses in Freiburg from a certain nobleman, giving him 8000 florins and several hundred more. He acquired these monies from Protestants and bishops with deceptive words; in Sélestat, he invested 16000 florins.</p>
      <p>Our Myconius suffers from gout, the good old man, and it is strange, since he never collected treasures nor pursued avarice, that he is vexed by this affliction. They say Mr. Reginald Pole, the Englishman, has been created the new pope. If the Satanic ones have not seduced him, he could benefit the church due to his piety and learning, virtues in which he excels. Farewell. January 3rd. I pray for a happy beginning of the year for you, your wife, and all yours. Greet Mr. Theodor and the others in my name. Basel.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>When will you complete your Decades of sermons?</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his perpetual esteemed teacher.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
