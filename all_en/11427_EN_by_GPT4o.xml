    <p xml:id="regest1">Is concerned because his letters [No. 1379 and No. 1382] have not yet been answered. The letter carrier sold linen to Mrs. Myconius and is to be compensated for it from Gwalther's scholarship. The completion of his Joseph poem is delayed. Repeats his request for the sending of books. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have already sent you two letters, most kind father, and still I see no response. This matter involves my mind with no small amount of care and anxiety, as it seems to me to be a matter that should not require such a delay.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I earnestly ask you to ensure, as far as possible, that this matter is not postponed any longer. But perhaps you do not need my urging; for I believe you to be even more diligent in my affairs than I am myself.</p>
      <p>The reason I am writing to you again now is because of this letter carrier, a citizen of Zurich and a relative of Myconius's wife. For Myconius's wife bought linen from him at the price of two and a half florins and asked me to write to you, so that you would pay this amount in my name from the stipend of the angaria, as they call it. Therefore, I beseech you to kindly fulfill this request of mine and pay this money to him.</p>
      <p>I would have long since completed the history of Joseph, if my mind, entangled in so many cares, could apply itself to the study of poetry. But as soon as I have completed it, I will send it to you.</p>
      <p>Please send the books I wrote about recently. Greet your wife and mother in my name, along with all the children. Farewell, dearest father, and may God keep you safe for me for a long time.</p>
      <p>Basel, 18th of April, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed father. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
