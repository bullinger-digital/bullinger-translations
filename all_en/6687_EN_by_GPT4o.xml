      <p>Revered and especially gracious lord, I send you my willing service along with wishes for all good things from God. On the 8th of this month, I sent you my recent letter, hoping it has reached you by now, in which I reported how our lords, some of their citizens, who are accustomed to call themselves Schwenckfelders, enthusiasts, and sacramentarians, were summoned and examined. For this reason, I was just waiting for the moment. This has not yet happened, and I intend to travel to Paris on the 18th of this month. I do not know if it might happen in the meantime. May God grant me His Holy Spirit so that I may steadfastly confess His will. I have heard from some who have been examined that after they made their confession, everything was written down word for word and read back to them. Immediately, they were presented to the council and were told to bring all their books to the chancery. People were assigned to them, and as they say, all the books were cut and torn apart, but nothing has yet been done with their persons. We want to pray to God that He may grant us the knowledge of His word. Things are truly bad with us; there is no one who asks after God. Gluttony, drunkenness, fornication, and all kinds of debauchery are rampant here. There is no improvement. May God the Lord be gracious to us and one day deliver us from this vale of tears with His coming. Regarding recent news, nothing special is heard from the Reichstag. The princes are still in Marburg in Hesse for the wedding. What they will negotiate there, time will tell. It is to be feared that this Reichstag will cause unrest in Germany unless God prevents it, although we certainly deserve it. Otherwise, nothing more at this time. I commend myself to your love and ask you to pray for me. We also send you and yours our most diligent greetings, and with that, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Given in Nuremberg on the 13th day of February in the year 1566. Your willing Gabriel Schl√ºsselberger.</p>
      <p>To the revered and highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, my gracious lord and good friend in Zurich.</p>
