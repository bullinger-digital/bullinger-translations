    <p xml:id="regest1">The Landtag [in Bonn] has agreed to the Reformation order of the Cologne [Arch-]Bishop [Hermann von Wied], only the city [correctly: the Cathedral Chapter] of Cologne has requested 14 days for consideration; the envoys [of the Schmalkaldic League] have warned the clergy against resistance; now the order is being printed and also supported by the coadjutor [Adolf von Schaumburg], which particularly displeases [Johannes] Gropper. Philipp [Melanchthon] subsequently departed, while Bucer awaits the response from Cologne and Hedio remains for another two months; the Archbishop has verbally explained his position to the Emperor. The Emperor's soldiers are true devils, which reflects the disposition of their lord; if the Schmalkaldic delegation, which also includes [Jakob] Sturm, achieves nothing with the Emperor, dire consequences are to be expected. There is no time for further news. Regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The Bishop of Cologne is earnestly pursuing the matter of the gospel. At the assembly, which you know of, after he had presented his intentions to the counts, nobles, and cities, there was unanimous agreement on the reformation and an addition that they would bravely endure whatever the Lord might impose for this purpose. The city of Cologne alone requested 14 days to consider the matter more carefully. The envoys of the Protestants were present, praised the piety of the recipients, and admonished the clergy of Cologne not to oppose the pious efforts of the archbishop, lest they wish to experience the wrath of God. Meanwhile, the reformation is being printed and published throughout the entire dominion with consent, regardless of what Cologne might eventually respond. The coadjutor of the old man, who has been considered a papist until now, responded to the envoys that he approves of the reformation and will apply all diligence, even if the old man is taken by the Lord, to defend the reformation as long as he lives. This matter grieves the city, the canons, and especially Gropper, about whom you have heard, to an extreme degree. Philipp, having accepted the reformation, soon departed for home; Bucer remains awaiting the response from Cologne; Hedio will remain for another two months to pursue what remains. Let us give thanks to the Lord! The archbishop was with the emperor; he conversed with him for a full hour, presented himself to him, and then returned to himself.</p>
      <p>The emperor has an army of pure devils, except for the Germans. From this, his disposition seems clear to me. The Schmalkaldic Diet sent a delegation to him, in which Sturmius is included; unless this achieves something, you will soon hear astonishing things. There are still many things we know for certain; but at present, it is not permitted to say more.</p>
      <p>Farewell with Theodor in the Lord. Basel, hastily, as you see, August 14, 1543.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
