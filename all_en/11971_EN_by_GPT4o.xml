      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Brother Hieronymus, who brings this to you, most learned and dearest brother Calvin, is Italian.</p>
      <p>He was a Guardian in a certain Franciscan monastery near Milan. However, he fled to avoid being imprisoned for Christ's sake. He was received by Mr. Hieronymus Fricker, the bailiff of Mendrisio, who now acts as president, and wrote to Mr. Pellikan a letter which he brought here, seeking advice and help from us. When I saw and understood that the man was good, but not equally learned, although he was skilled in the French and Italian languages, but certainly more in the latter than the former, so that he would be of no use in our church, which is otherwise also burdened, I advised him to proceed to you, equipped with letters and travel provisions, and to seek some place there where he might stay. For many report that the churches in the Bernese and Genevan territories suffer from a shortage of ministers. Therefore, I commend this brother to your charity, if perhaps a certain place might be given to him, so that he is not forced to wander perpetually. I am not unaware that your affairs are very strained: therefore, I beg for pardon. I do not send him to burden you, but only to indicate, if perhaps he might be of some use. If he will be of no use, then it will be possible to dismiss him again, equipped with some consolation and recommendation. I truly regret that we do not have such resources to receive and support him and other exiles. We do what we can, nor do we ask anything else from you. May the Lord Jesus be with you.</p>
      <p>The young man, whom you recommended to me, will write how his affairs are. He bought books for 29 batzen, which is almost two of our guilders, not crowns.</p>
      <p>However, it would be convenient if the merchant would send 6 or 8 crowns to the scribe. For it is almost customary with us that those who receive boarders pay a good portion of the agreed money at the beginning or around the beginning. Take care that what is sent is not only sent to the boy, but also to the city scribe or to me. Farewell, esteemed and very dear Calvin, brother in the Lord, venerable. Zurich, 8th June 1544.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
