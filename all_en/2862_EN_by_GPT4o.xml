      <p>Greetings. Before I write anything or thank you, dearest compater, for your books, I must express the immense pain of my soul, which the unexpected death of my dearest and most upright brother and fellow minister, Mr. Michael Schlatter, has brought to me and our church. He passed away on the 11th of this month, after having been bedridden for 10 days with an unknown illness. I have never lost a friend more faithful and necessary; thus, I am almost consumed with great anguish of spirit. I fear that our church may again suffer some severe paroxysms, especially if someone turbulent and arrogant is imposed in his place.</p>
      <p>Therefore, help us with your prayers, that the Lord may assist us in this matter and also his church.</p>
      <p>As for your books, I have received them and, although greatly disturbed, I have read them with great comfort to myself and not without pleasure and recreation. I therefore give you great thanks, not so much for the book itself, with which you have honored me, but because you have undertaken to defend our common cause so faithfully. May God grant that you remain with us for a long time, so that under the protection of your writings, as under the shield of Ajax, we may be safe, we who, like young soldiers with lesser strength, fight for the truth. Since you also seek my judgment, although it is small and insignificant, I will say, not to flatter you, but to confess the truth, that your defense pleases and is approved not only by me but by all of us more than the writings of all others. For besides that calm treatment of all matters, which cannot but be approved by every honest person, the matter itself is so clearly, learnedly, and skillfully explained that we all hope this effort of yours will have a great effect on the adversaries. And so that you may see that I do not judge from affection, but candidly, I say that Mr. Bernhardin's treatise does not please me at all, not indeed as to the argument itself and the matter, but as to the manner of treatment, the force of the arguments, and the skill of explanation. For besides his dialectic, everything seems very barren and little worthy of such a man. I would therefore wish him to leave the place of fighting to others, lest he expose the doctrine itself to ridicule along with himself.</p>
      <p>You will take my freedom in good part, I know; I am dealing with you. I saw that you also made honorable mention of his work in your writing; but he is not such a writer as I thought. I also read Calvin's second defense, who always has his own ways of speaking, some of which I see you have also noted in your writing, indeed explained, as a writing that somewhat distinguishes between faith and the eating of Christ, yet in the meantime satisfies all the wise by explaining himself. But what power of fighting in him, what fervor and impetus of words, what agility in combat! I fear that here too he may be excessive and carried away with more impetuosity than befits us. But such is his nature. What pleases me most in him are those things which he wrote almost at the end about private absolution, examination before the supper, the supper being brought to the sick, etc. You see, therefore, that I have read these things and what my judgment is. You will take it in good part; I write to you, not to others, and I judge thus also of others, because I love them. Farewell. All of ours greet you. We have nothing new.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 15, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his most dear and esteemed lord and compater. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
