    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] With the present messenger [...] Konrad Zwick sends the enclosed letter from Ulm. The very busy cousin could not write himself, as he had to ride towards [Germany] before daybreak. May God protect him! Blarer is worried about him. It would be a great loss if something were to happen to him. In the enclosed letter, Bullinger should particularly pay attention to the passages about the Swiss envoy in Ulm as well as those about the great undertaking of Emperor Charles V. The people of Zurich may make a copy of the letter, but they should return it to the messenger, as Zwick, who intends to be back in Konstanz on the evening of February 3rd, still has to report on it to his council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Oh, how much is God's wrath over the ingratitude of the [Protestants] palpable! God wants to make them understand that they must become much more earnest and should not boast of His word as long as they do not live accordingly. Just as in the time of Isaiah, God's hypocritical people are now punished by the Assyrian king [in the form of the Emperor]. May they recognize this, repent, and learn from the mistakes of others!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger should continue to pray for the people of Konstanz. He can imagine how even pious, sensible people are anxious in this helpless and dangerous situation, especially since they can no longer count on any human help and have only bad things to fear. No wonder, then, that the majority is despondent and tries to escape death, even if they thereby soon expose themselves to an even worse death! May God show a tolerable way out!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The letter from Ulm addressed to Zwick by a God-fearing person [...] suggests that the cities which the Emperor will take by force face an even more terrible fate than the cities that have voluntarily submitted to him, as the latter are treated in such an unfavorable manner. But it would be much better to die a thousand times than to make peace with the Emperor! If only the Swiss would recognize the ruin that threatens them! Even a blind man can see the Emperor's plans! May God put a stop to the raging sea!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Due to lack of time, Blarer has not yet finished reading Bullinger's writing [„De ira domini et persecutione“?]. He likes it very much. He will send it back with the next messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] He will also entrust Bullinger's letter to Johannes Haller [No. 2780] to the next reliable messenger. However, the roads are currently unsafe. Messengers are repeatedly being arrested. It is best to use only secret writing in letters intended for [Germany].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Blarer sent his earlier letter [No. 2778], which Zwick [during his visit to Zurich] should have delivered along with a letter from Georg Frölich [not received], again to Bullinger with his letter [No. 2784] the day before. Frölich and some other people from Augsburg make Blarer very sorry, as Augsburg will probably fare even worse than Ulm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings to all councilors, friends, and colleagues, especially to Bullinger's family. May the people of Konstanz not be forgotten! Bullinger should send back the enclosed letter from Ulm!</p>

      <p>Grace and peace through Christ with all good things. Friendly, dear lord and faithful brother. Herewith, with this own messenger, my dear cousin sends you these writings. He could not write to you himself due to his many great affairs; for he had to ride out before daybreak. May God protect him on his way there and back, for it is quite worrisome to ride on the other ground. We would be very badly affected by God if we were to lose him, for he is a dear person. He asks you to pay close attention to the two points he has underlined in the letter that comes from Ulm: about the Swiss envoy to Ulm; and about the great undertaking of the Emperor. You may copy from these writings what you like; but you should certainly send them back with this messenger, for the cousin hopes to return tomorrow night. He will have to report to a council here with us.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Oh dear brother, how we see the great works and terrifying, cruel judgment of God in these matters! How angry He is over our ingratitude! He truly wants to teach us the right seriousness and let us see how it is no joke before Him to boast of His word and at the same time to be completely inconsistent with it. Truly, He sends the Assyrian over the hypocritical people, Isaiah 10. Oh my God, that we might recognize it, so that we might turn to You from the heart and with truth and become wise from the harm of others!</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Pleading, praying, and imploring for us with loyalty. You can well imagine what pious, sensible people and godly hearts among us are wearing a narrow shirt, while we stand completely exposed to all human help and have great things to fear, that evil, evil is to be feared, the majority will be too weak and will want to flee the nearest death, even if, as will certainly happen, they must endure a more cruel suffering. We want to cry, admonish, warn, strengthen, comfort with God's grace and as much as He grants spirit, as best we can. Still hope in the dear God, He will send the matters among us on a tolerable path and will not let us be put to shame. Therefore, help us with utmost loyalty, as my heartfelt trust in you stands, for it is more than necessary.</p>

      <p>From this letter from Ulm to my dear cousin, which comes from a very pious, God-fearing man, it can be well deduced what those who the Emperor will conquer by force have to expect, while those whom he has taken into grace are treated in such a manner. Oh my God, should one not much rather die a thousand times than accept such a peace? Oh that the Swiss could also see their impending and imminent ruin (if they do not avert it in time against God)! What the Emperor intends, even a blind man should see! May the strong God see in it, and set a dam and barrier to this raging and swelling sea, so that it may not overflow everything. Amen.</p>

      <p>I have truly not yet finished reading your little book, for I have not had the time. I will send it to you with the next messenger. It pleases me exceedingly well. May the Lord increase all good in you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I will send the letter to Haller as soon as I can have a secure message; for now, it is completely unsafe, as the messengers are constantly being arrested. It will no longer be good to write on the other ground, except with unknown letters. Everything is full of treason and unfaithfulness.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Yesterday I sent you the letter that my dear cousin should have delivered to you with the letters of Lęti. The good man, along with some others in Augsburg, needs me badly, for Augsburg will fare even worse than Ulm. May the dear, faithful God help us out of all distress for the sake of His great name. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Tell all good lords, friends, and brothers all love, good, and greetings along with the offering of my good services, especially to your dear household, and do not forget us! Dated February 2, 1547. Send us back the writings. Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, Christian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my especially trusted dear lord and brother, to his hands.</p>
