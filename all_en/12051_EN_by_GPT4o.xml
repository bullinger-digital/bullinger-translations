    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger undoubtedly has the two books ["A Short Reply to the Long Answer of Heinrich Bullinger" and "Replica Brevis"] by Cochläus; [Cochläus] does not rage on his own, but was instigated by the people of Ingolstadt, who have no one else to fight the Gospel; the Turk lurking at the border will teach them the power of the Gospel. Recommends the young, pious, and learned Erasmus [Cornier], who was a teacher in Montbéliard; from him, Bullinger will learn the source of discord among the brothers; the [local] court preacher [Johannes Engelmann] is inclined towards Lutheranism and follows entirely [Count Christoph of Montbéliard] in everything. If only Theodor [Bibliander] would write something against [Andreas] Osiander! Send the book catalog soon.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>You undoubtedly know and also have the two books that Cochläus wrote against you. The old miser is completely insane, but not of his own accord. The people of Ingolstadt, having no one to oppose the Gospel of Christ, are instigating others.</p>
      <p>May the Lord forgive them and grant them a better mind. They have the Turk lurking at the borders, who will teach them what the power of the Gospel is.</p>
      <p>I commend to you Erasmus, that learned and pious young man, who was a schoolmaster in Montbéliard, from whom you will learn the source of discord among the brothers. The court preacher is entirely addicted to external ceremonies and leans towards Lutheranism to the point of madness, and he agrees with whatever the prince wants, so as not to offend him; indeed, as I hear, the prince is being misled in many things. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 4th of October, 1544.</p>
      <p>I wish all happiness to Theodor. If only he would write against the dreaming Hosdich Anders! If he did not want to publish it without a name, it could be done under a fictitious name, to remove the mask of hypocrisy from the proud man.</p>
      <p>I will send the catalog of recently printed books soon. Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his ever-honored teacher. Zurich.</p>
