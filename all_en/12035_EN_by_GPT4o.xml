      <p>It is written and said that the Emperor has conquered Châlons with the storm, but lost about 8000 men, many distinguished people, among them several counts, including Count Wilhelm von Fürstenberg, who was supposed to have been in French service, and several hundred noblemen.</p>
      <p>Andrea Doria has captured several galleys of the Pope because a cardinal, his closest cousin, had bequeathed and provided him with several thousand ducats, and the Pope did not want to hand them over, saying he had no authority over it; it was spiritual property. The Pope wanted to appoint a cousin as a bishop in Naples against their custom and freedom; he also brought him in through intrigue; but immediately afterwards, the Viceroy intervened sharply, plundered him, took everything, and also expelled him.</p>
      <p>The new Elector is contemplating restoring Heidelberg, in which matter he desires the assistance of Philipp and Frecht. In Ravensburg, the Gospel of Christ is being preached with great applause by a recently called deacon, so that no one doubts that Christ will reign there.</p>
      <p>They affirm that the French Constable (as they call him) is anxiously working for peace with the Emperor's sister and several dukes, among whom is also the Duke of Lorraine.</p>
      <p>Also, the Duke of Orléans, the younger son of the King of France, is seeking marriage with the widow named Vittoria, the niece of the Roman Pontiff. Also, 5000 Turkish horsemen have come to Buda. Also, locusts of remarkable size are plaguing Austria. 18th September 1544.</p>
      <p>To the man of incomparable doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother, etc. Zurich.</p>
