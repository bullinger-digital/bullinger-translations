      <p>Greetings and Peace. If you and yours, as well as all of ours, are well and there is peace in public affairs, it is good. Our affairs are indeed in their old and moderate state. I was very sorry to hear from your recent letters that you were troubled by some discomfort and illness; but I hope that you have recovered and have completely cast out whatever troubles there were from your mind. For it is fitting and proper for a man as great and significant as you to have a mind entirely free and devoid of all other cares, dedicating yourself entirely to the Christian republic and literary pursuits, as you have been accustomed to do until now. For it would be utterly unworthy for your course and most useful studies to be hindered by any other matter.</p>
      <p>For indeed, the holy apostles rightly said in Acts 6:2: [Greek]. And Christ himself spoke no less gravely about each one's talent.</p>
      <p>But what am I doing? Bringing wood to the forest or owls to Athens, as it were. In truth, nothing else but to be an advisor and encourager to you, out of my perpetual love and respect for you, so that you do not allow yourself to be diverted even a hair's breadth by any matter, to give yourself to grief or to be deflected from the most righteous studies to disputes or less useful matters. There are more useful and necessary things, to which you have served excellently all the pious and studious until now and will be able to serve splendidly always in the future. I truly believe that some are now ashamed and regretful, for they preferred to be like fans and nails in those public sores rather than, according to their mediocrity, more devoted to peace, concord, and tranquility. And all malice will eventually vanish like smoke and dust, which the wind casts from the face of the earth, [Greek].</p>
      <p>However, as for me, I gladly and with pleasure read the book you sent me as a gift and shared it with many others, to whom it was also most welcome, in these regions. Nevertheless, the didactic and historical way is much more useful to all and more glorious for you for all posterity. Yet whatever has originated from you, all of it, because of your modesty and because of your learning and piety, cannot but be most welcome. Therefore, I would like you to give your printer the task that of everything you publish henceforth, one or two copies be sent to me at my expense through our booksellers, to whom I will immediately satisfy, although I intend to send one of my sons to Frankfurt at this fair or even myself, if the Diet of Regensburg does not prevent it, I would like to travel there. Where I ask and request that I may find your letters about all your affairs, the longest and most copious. For just as the longest iamb of Aristophanes seemed the best and to Cicero the speeches of Demosthenes and the letters of Atticus and even to the younger Pliny the speeches of Cicero to Cornelius Tacitus, so it happens to me with your letters to me. There is nothing new here with us now, except that in Prussia and Livonia a very fierce war has been stirred up, and in these very days a rumor has arrived about more than 6000 foot soldiers being slain by the Livonians. About Hungarian affairs and others, I think they are more known and certain to you there than they are here with us. Therefore, I would rather hear from you if there are any certain things and worthy of chronicles. The Diet of Regensburg is expected at the beginning of September, although it has often been postponed and changed before. The Emperor is said to be certainly considering Spain and is about to hand over the reins of the entire empire to his brother Ferdinand, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most learned and kind man, and continue to love us in return, as you do.</p>
      <p>Given in Leipzig on the day of Saint Lawrence in the year 1556. Valentin Paceus [Greek].</p>
      <p>To the singular and excellent man of God, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most learned and upright friend, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
