      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I recently received your letters full of the most pious love, most esteemed man. I have not written to you more frequently or sooner because I had almost nothing worthy of your reading time, unless I wanted to repeat certain matters about a few stubborn people who pretend and yet diligently dissemble, about whom I cease to speak until the Lord compels.</p>
      <p>Regarding the man you write about, I wish it were true that he is cleared; however, what is known to me is not based on empty conjectures, and they will not easily dissuade me. I know how easily people lie either out of fear or cunning. But enough about this; not everything can be entrusted to letters.</p>
      <p>The Chronology of Johannes Functius is commonly sold by Oporinus for half a crown, that is, 12 baccioni, as his servant recently told me; for I did not buy it. Ferrante Gonzaga is expected to return here to Milan. Here is Lord Ascanio Marso for that reason and because of the upcoming general assembly at Baden. So far, nothing certain is known or reported about the Turk or other matters. Doctor Zanchi in Strasbourg, after being earnestly requested for an entire week, publicly addressed that question hateful to heretics, that it is permissible for a Christian magistrate to impose capital punishment on heretics, etc.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it will come to light. Farewell well and perpetually with your holy family. From Basel, May 26, 1554. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Your least brother in Christ, Guglielmo Grataroli, physician. To the most illustrious and best minister of the word of God, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed superior.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
