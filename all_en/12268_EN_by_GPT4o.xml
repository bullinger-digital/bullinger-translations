    <p xml:id="regest1">Yesterday, the decision of the Diet of Worms was read in the [Basel] council; undoubtedly, this will also be communicated to the [Zurichers]. For the new religious colloquy in Regensburg, four scholars, eight auditors, and two presidents are to be appointed by both the Papists and the [Evangelicals]. Whether some [Protestant princes] will invite to this is uncertain. - The Council of Trent has been postponed until the [Catholics] agree on at least some articles. Bullinger will get to see the proposals for agreement advocated by the Bucerans, Lutherans, and Papists [in the writing "Von den einigen rechten wegen... christlicher religion zu vergleichen"]. Gast would like to learn from Bucer and also from [Simon] Sulzer why they harbor such aversion against the Zurich church. More on that later.</p>

      <p>The decisions made at the Diet of Worms were read yesterday in our council; without a doubt, they will also communicate them to you, as they have done so far. A new colloquy has been established in Regensburg concerning religious matters, and our side and the Papists will each appoint four scholars; then, each side will select eight auditors for this colloquy; thirdly, two presidents will be chosen to impose silence on the contentious. However, whether any of our churches will be invited to that colloquy, I do not know.</p>
      <p>The Council of Trent has been postponed until they agree on at least some articles. You will see the plans of the Bucerans and Lutherans and the Papist agreements, etc. I want to bring Bucer, or rather Sulzer, and accompany him for one mile, to discuss with him why he is so unfair to the Zurich church. More on that later.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Basel, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gast.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
