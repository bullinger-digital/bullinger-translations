      <p>When I understood from Mr. Rudolf, your relative, that there is a man here to whom letters can be safely entrusted, I enclosed these, which you see, which otherwise I would not have entrusted to just anyone. You ensure that they are returned to me promptly and safely.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Schmid, the most faithful minister of the Church of Chur, a revered and most beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
