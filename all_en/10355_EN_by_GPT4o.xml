      <p>Here you have a letter, from which you can learn enough about the state of the Swabian League and what the Augsburg Diet has brought us. I am very busy now, otherwise I would write more. I sent you a letter on January 20th and I have no doubt that you have received it. I eagerly await yours.</p>
      <p>Greet the entire choir of saints who are there. All of ours greet you, especially my dear wife and sister. Farewell, most distinguished Bullinger, and commend us to Christ. Greet your wife carefully with my words.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, February 13, 1534.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>With the next messenger, please return this letter.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
