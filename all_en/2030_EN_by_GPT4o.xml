      <p>I am still staying in Chur; for an Italian is supposed to follow me here, and many inconveniences would arise for both him and me if he came here and did not find me; for I have solemnly promised to wait. But I hope he will arrive soon, and I will immediately run to you. Meanwhile, I am living quite uncomfortably and even dangerously in a public inn, although the lord envoy often invites me to lunches and dinners, and there I find some rest from cares and labor. From the letters and conversations of many, I have heard what is happening in Geneva with that fanatic Servetus, about which you will hear something from me. For Gribaldus, before he came to you now, was where you well know, and I heard the man discussing and presenting his authors in the midst. I will tell you in person; for now, I will only say that I indeed abhor the Servetians and such monsters, yet I would not think that fire or sword should be used against them. I write this to you because the brothers in Geneva write to me that that church will seek your advice, and I know how much your authority will be valued there. Farewell and greetings to you and your family and all your household. Pray for me.</p>
      <p>Chur, [3rd] October 1553. Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich, dearest brother and lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
