      <p>God with us.</p>
      <p>Faithful, beloved father, so that you are informed about how brother Hans Rudolf is doing, we have decided to send this, as there is nothing else to do. Know therefore that the blood has somewhat returned, but not as before; for not as much is flowing, and what does flow is not as beautifully red and foamy as before, but rather black and mostly clotted, which has caused him great tightness and pressure in the chest and around the heart during the day. However, today he is expelling (which did not happen before) many clots of congealed blood, and whereas he previously had severe fainting spells before and after the bleeding, now he has none at all, but is in good strength. Therefore, I hope once again that God Almighty will do what is best for him and us, so that the matter may turn out well. I would very much like, if possible, for Doctor Wolf to come to us tomorrow, so that we can further discuss what to do about the situation.</p>
      <p>We therefore ask you, faithful, dear father, to send him and inform him of the matter; for I have thus left it with Doctor Keller (who has gone to Baden). But if he cannot come, we ask Doctor Thaddeus; he will gladly do it to please us, if he can leave the house for the sake of the sick. I would like it to happen tomorrow at a good time, so that nothing is neglected in the matter. We have, as a precaution, given a horse, so that whichever doctor comes out does not have to run around looking for one.</p>
      <p>May God Almighty grant grace, that the most appropriate and beneficial advice will be given for the matter. May He always be faithfully with you, etc.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient son, Heinrich Bullinger. Dear father, you may now send the letter to Doctor Wolf; for he, if possible, will be willing. To the most distinguished man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. Zurich.</p>
