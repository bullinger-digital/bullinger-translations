      <p>Greetings. It often happens that when there are very necessary things I wish to write to you about, messengers are lacking, and conversely, when there are messengers, the subject matter is lacking. This is also the case now; for many are now offering themselves to go to you; but everything is so silent with us that I have nothing worthy to write to you, nor do I willingly disturb your most holy occupations with empty words. We have absolutely nothing from Augsburg, which we greatly wonder about. It is reported about the people of Ulm that they have expelled their papists along with the Interims from the city; how true this is, we do not know. Lord Martin Peyer from Schaffhausen reports that the Margrave has again gathered a large cavalry. He was with the secretary of the aforementioned Margrave, Sylvester Reid, at the King of France's court in January. Sylvester is now acting in Solothurn on behalf of the Margrave. Lord Martin was here yesterday and reported this to Musculus. It is also reported that the Prince of Spain has arrived in Genoa; the German princes are doing nothing; in England, everything is again overturned, and the marriage with the Spaniard is to be ratified, all happening out of fear of the Emperor. Regarding the passage of Gonzaga through Switzerland, you undoubtedly have more certain information than I do; I have only learned from our senators (who, strangely, keep everything very secret and hidden) that passage was granted to him by our people, which does not please everyone; for there is a fear that either they might presume something violent against us or we against them. Wilhelm Fr√∂lich was here these days, accompanied by some people from Zurich; what he did, I do not know, but he used the pretext of attending a wedding. However, while he was here, he was immediately recalled by the King's legate to Solothurn. Our people have not yet decided on the future punishment of those going into military service. These days a new magistrate is elected, and all constitutions are usually read; something will come of it. Wattenwyl will now take up the consulship again.</p>
      <p>You have undoubtedly already learned what business our people have with the people of Freiburg. The town of Orbe, the homeland of Viret, is subject to the jurisdiction of both cities; its citizens desire the abolition of the mass and the establishment of the preaching of the gospel. Therefore, according to the old agreements made with the people of Freiburg, the mass should now be abolished, since the majority of the citizens want this. The people of Freiburg complain that Viret has been acting there for a long time and has, through his practices, contrary to the agreements and pacts of the cities, achieved that he obtained the majority; therefore, the citizens of Orbe should swear that they were not persuaded to this by him. The citizens would like to swear; but our people do not want to, lest they deviate from the pacts in any way.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the people of Freiburg and our people also want this dispute to be settled by law. Then there are other things that strangely exacerbate the minds of our people, so that I fear serious disturbances from here again. The people of Solothurn also become excessively insolent against our people, relying on the support of those you know. I wanted to send you these tumultuously gathered things now, so that I would not send nothing and not offend you with my long silence. I recently received your letters, full of piety and paternal comfort; I thank you and want you to be convinced of me in this part, as much as the Lord has granted grace, that I will not fail in my duty. May the Lord strengthen us with His spirit. Amen. Farewell with all yours, to whom I wish you to convey many greetings in the name of all of us. Bern, March 22, 1554. Musculus greets you, who, after now completing Genesis, will soon begin to interpret Isaiah.</p>
      <p>Your Haller to the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his venerable lord and compatriot.</p>
