    <p xml:id="regest1">He asks for understanding that he cannot write as often due to his workload; his preaching activities, attending lectures, church and domestic affairs, personal and written contacts, as well as work on his exegetical works take up all his time. The plague has claimed only a few victims in Zürich so far, in contrast to Bern - as the Lenzburg preacher [Diebold Etter] personally reported - where more than 80 victims were mourned in two days; however, it did not affect any of the city pastors and councilors. Bullinger is working on the 14th[!] book of his commentary on Matthew [HBBibl I 144] and sends Vadian a sample; the commentary is of moderate length, Bullinger does not like oversized and verbose books. [Rudolf] Gwalther is intensely engaged with poetry and also sends a sample; Bullinger asks Vadian to write to Gwalther - who has married Zwingli's daughter [Regula] - and encourage him to continue his studies. [Christoph] Froschauer has not yet returned from Frankfurt, his return is expected within eight days; Bullinger will convey any news to Vadian. He requests news about the Turkish war; if people do not turn to God, the situation will not improve; similarly, God has previously used Sennacherib, Tiglath-Pileser, and Nebuchadnezzar to punish rebellious people. Bullinger's mother [Anna, née Wiederkehr] passed away [on August 16].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I can hardly express, my most esteemed Vadian, how much I miss your letters. Believe me, none are as welcome as yours, nor do I derive more benefit and fruit from any others. I therefore beg and beseech your Humanity, not to become sluggish in writing because of my negligence or rather my occupations, which hinder me from writing more frequently. I am burdened with quite frequent and laborious sermons; public lectures are added, of which I am a diligent and attentive listener; ecclesiastical and domestic affairs increase daily, which I cannot entirely neglect. I must also devote some good time to friends, now indeed by writing to them, soon by discussing with others, whom I cannot refuse when they come here for the sake of conversation. Meanwhile, I wish to preach Christ to those who are farther away and to help those laboring in uncovering the meaning of the scriptures. Therefore, I am composing and writing explanations of such scripture for the press, which wonderfully distresses and oppresses me. How much time do you think I have left to eat, sleep, or refresh myself with honest leisure and take care of my body? For now, I will not recount the crowds and cries of my numerous offspring, as such complaints would only provoke laughter from the listeners. - The plague still rages quite mildly among us. Few have yet passed away, so the illness of those who are bedridden does not yet trouble me. What will happen, I do not know. However, I think that what happens to others will happen to us. May the Lord's will be done! In Bern, it rages more than hostilely; however, no one has yet passed away from either the city preachers or the councilors, whose death could bring harm to the republic and the church. Over 80 have passed away in 2 days; so reported the preacher from Lenzburg, who came to us from there. I am working on the 14th book of my Commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew, of which I send you a sample of my study here. Pray to the Lord to assist me in my labor. Although I have divided the work into 14 books, it will not exceed the limit. For I hate those vast tomes, leading readers around with excessive digressions. My Gwalther is very engaged in poetry; he sends you a sample here. Please, write to the most studious young man; for your letters will be like a treasure to him. Encourage him, however, to continue in his studies. He has married Zwingli's daughter. Froschauer has not yet returned from Frankfurt. We expect him and hope he will come within eight days. If he brings anything worthy of your knowledge, I will share it with you in good faith. For I wish to serve and gratify you from the heart. Farewell. If you have or have obtained any certain news about the affairs of the Turk, please do not let me remain ignorant. Would that we might first oppose such a great enemy with repentance and prayers, then with faithful arms. But fate presses and the wrath of God hangs over us, nor will anyone persuade me that our affairs will be better unless we turn back. The Lord has stirred up Sennacherib, Tiglath-Pileser, and Nebuchadnezzar, by whom those who reject the faithful admonition of God will perish. May the Lord have mercy on us. September 22, 1541. - My mother has happily departed from this life to Christ.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Joachim Vadian, consul of the people of St. Gallen, his most esteemed lord.</p>
