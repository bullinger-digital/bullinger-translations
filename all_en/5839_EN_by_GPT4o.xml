      <p>Greetings. I have nothing at all to report at the moment (reverend father in Christ). Your belongings have been returned to me in good faith; I give the greatest thanks I can.</p>
      <p>If this English disaster is true, it will not cease to be of great importance.</p>
      <p>I am amazed that our people have been acting so lazily in all matters for a long time now; I hope the force of war does not turn back on the Christians! I will take care of what you have commanded, and I hope Mr. Martinengo will not fail in his duty.</p>
      <p>I have read extensively the proceedings of Baden and the affairs of Bern and Savoy, along with the double instructions of the envoys to the people of Bern.</p>
      <p>We help mediate for so long until we find ourselves in the middle of it.</p>
      <p>The people of Bern are praised by our people for not wanting to abandon the people of Geneva; may they persist and not, as is their custom, recoil from a good beginning.</p>
      <p>I have nothing at all, except to let you know that a strong assembly has recently taken place here in Chur.</p>
      <p>This has been described due to the following reason: The people of Engadin have had much tension and conflict with the imperial forces for a long time now; it stems from the war on the Adige.</p>
      <p>Many times now, the government has been petitioned to quell the defiance and willfulness of their people, to prevent greater unrest.</p>
      <p>The government gives smooth words, claiming that these things happened without their knowledge, etc.</p>
      <p>Recently, some imperial forces have attacked and plundered an entire village with armed force, capturing some and taking them away with them.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the people have been active here and there in the mountains and the Alps.</p>
      <p>However, when they were warned of this, about 200 Engadiners gathered together and brought their people back home from the emperor's land with armed force.</p>
      <p>In response, the imperial forces have mobilized up to 6000 men and positioned them at the borders; however, as we have since learned, they are supposed to have been called back by the government.</p>
      <p>Thus, it was very close to the matter escalating into a serious civil war.</p>
      <p>Our people have written earnestly to the government; for it seems to our people that the matter is serious and that much is being played out on one thing or another.</p>
      <p>The provost of this college, from the Salicetum family, is suffering fatally from a spitting of blood and a rupture of the vein.</p>
      <p>From this very illness, two of his sisters passed away last month.</p>
      <p>Our bishop is bathing in Fideris.</p>
      <p>He affirms that he has read my little book on Providence (for I had given it to him as a gift) diligently and indeed at regular hours.</p>
      <p>I was surprised that he was not offended by those things I brought against the papists and Roman frauds.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, he has invited me quite humbly to visit him through his people; but I do not go; for he calls me to banquets, etc.</p>
      <p>Since I had nothing external to report, I wanted to note these domestic matters, so that I would not write nothing.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all your people, for as long and as happily as possible.</p>
      <p>Our people send their regards to you respectfully.</p>
      <p>Chur, August 16, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
