      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I believe you have received the letters I sent through the treasurer, received from Valentin Nusboum; if you have not received them, please let me know. What do you think will happen at the Satanic council in Trento? The bishops of Trier and Mainz were in Selestat, but they were received with the usual honor, not episcopal; the same was done by my people from Breisach, but the people of Freiburg were honorably received with bells, candles, banners, crosses, and other things; the whole clerical swarm came out to meet them. The bishops were lavish in giving crosses to the people; the foolish people are unworthy of any sound doctrine.</p>
      <p>They are now acting in Trento; they will consult on everything against Christ and His word, and they have not gathered for any other reason. In Augsburg, four bishops consulted about expelling the preachers; two opposed, wanting to wait for the papal counsel, but the other two, with the Emperor's approval, along with the Spaniards, succeeded in having them immediately proscribed, and this was done to terrify the other cities, so they see that the Emperor favors the old Catholics. What do you finally think will happen with the excellent Prince Christoph of Württemberg? He will undoubtedly agree to everything that the Emperor's men will prescribe to him, both in religion and in other external matters.</p>
      <p>Some ships sent against the Turks have been sunk. Silesia is armed, lest the Turk invade the borders, and I have this from the man from Wrocław, who was with us these days.</p>
      <p>The people of Bern are disputing with the lords of the Teutonic Order; the matter has not yet been brought to an end. You see how this kind of people raises their crests, and we are so senseless that we care nothing for all they do, and we plan nothing for the future.</p>
      <p>Why is it that no annotations on the 1st Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians are sent to us? Farewell and write back; for now, you have the most convenient leisure. I am also sending the letters of our Myconius, who is almost permanently confined to bed.</p>
      <p>Duke Georg of Württemberg has called Erbium to him; perhaps Duke Christoph has written to send away the preachers.</p>
      <p>The people of Strasbourg have Marpach in Wittenberg, who consults with the Saxons, and with the people of Wittenberg, Leipzig, and Frankfurt, on what they want to respond to the suspicious council in Trento. Farewell. More soon. Greet Dr. Theodor in my name. September 10, 1551.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, to his hands.</p>
