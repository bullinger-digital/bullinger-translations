    <p xml:id="regest1">Steiner assures that he stands faithfully by the Gospel. He unsuccessfully tried to justify himself before the synodal commission against two accusations of benefice running. Felix Brennwald, the bailiff of the Abbot of Einsiedeln at the Fahr Monastery, is ready to testify for him as a witness. He, Steiner, had only tried, with the help of the Abbot, who was obliged to him from earlier times, Brennwald, and the councils in Zurich, to secure the parish of Weiningen, as he - despite his merits for Zurich and the Church - had suffered hardship and could expect help from no one. However, nothing was undertaken in the matter. The second accusation alleged that he had tried to illegally acquire the parish of Wädenswil from Konrad Müppein; for this, he refers to Müppein's letter No. 461. That he was excluded by the council, at the request of the synod, and removed from the preaching office in Schwamendingen, he feels as a harsh and unjust punishment. This judgment, if it remained in force, would bring him to the beggar's staff. He has asked the council for mercy, but was referred to the synod with the assurance that their judgment would be respected. Steiner now asks the synod to forgive him and to reinstate him.</p>

      <p>Honorable, pious, wise, gracious lords, highly learned, divine fathers and brothers.</p>
      <p>After God called me from darkness to His light of truth, I quickly rose up and followed, putting my hand to the plow and never looking back, standing firm by my Lord amidst tribulations, never falling away from God, but standing as a faithful servant by His side, and may God find me so until my end, and no one will snatch me from His hand. God has warned us: "Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall" [1 Cor 10:12]. Without God's power, no one can stand, as God has allowed many chosen ones to fall and then raised them up again.</p>
      <p>Just as a synodal statute provides that no one should appoint or insert themselves into a bishop's office - for a bishop should be chosen by divine will with the help and favor of the common people, the church, and the consent of the neighboring bishops, so that God's wrath does not come upon us; as it is spoken through the prophet: "They have set up kings, but not by Me" [Hos 8:4] - I have been accused by your appointed ones of acting against such divine order, and two articles were presented to me, to which I have confessed the truth and responded.</p>
      <p>But my words were not believed. I cannot take it to heart, for in one's own case, one cannot testify for oneself, as everyone favors themselves and speaks nothing harmful against themselves, as the Lord Himself says: "If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true; but others bear witness of Me" [John 5:31f] etc. Therefore, I have asked my dear godfather and good friend, namely Felix Brennwald, to report to your worthiness what I have brought and requested of him, with his mouth and hand. He did not want to do this due to his illness, nor was he ever required by you. And if you do not believe me, then you will not believe his writing either. But if you seek the truth in him, he will not withhold it and will speak plainly. And it is so, as I have seen, that I have been abandoned by all human help, counsel, and comfort for ten years, and for the sake of the fatherland and above all God's honor, I have lost all my possessions and goods, which is not small, and for the past three years, I have served a foundation honorably and gloriously for 12 guilders in hope of grace, and yet I have felt no grace, but have been rejected and cast aside, and yet I have so many years and days upon me that I am no longer fit and capable for any work, as I am almost the oldest preacher and have served the church honorably for thirty-eight years and have never been accused of negligence or omission, so I have now wanted to demand a letter of rights and seal from a lord of Einsiedeln through his bailiff. Because I and my predecessors have served faithfully in my younger days, therefore a promise was made to me that if I were in need and not provided for with a benefice, then I should be provided for by the monastery or have the lord's table. And if I were to be treated like others, I would be satisfied with my claim. I also hoped that my gracious lords would help and advise me in this, and would not act against the right church, without favor and permission. This I entrusted to Brennwald to present to the abbot. He did not do this and the matter was never considered. I would much rather be provided for otherwise like others and have my many sufferings and old age considered in good faith and my honest loyalty, which I have shown to the church, diligently assessed etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, how I am said to have run to Master Konrad Müppein in Wädenswil and wanted to buy his benefice and some speakers ran there and spread this about me. Well, I would need to say something about this. I will keep silent for the sake of love and peace, to which I give no answer. Hear his answer written here. I cannot keep my benefice, which I have acquired by just title and have a letter and seal for, because I am not a merchant. Worthy and gracious lords, for such an act and transgression, my gracious lords have rightfully and by judgment, at the request of the preachers, deprived and removed me from my prophetic office and service of the benefice in Schwamendingen, which is the greatest sorrow and punishment that can befall me. For the sake of the service, it was not necessary, for no one should be removed from their goods, but for the sake of the office, which I have acquired with such great effort, labor, poverty, and misery and with the sweat of my father, for which I was raised from the cradle, and thus should have worked and be of no use to God, the Christian church, or myself, and all my temporal honor, fortune, and sustenance stand therein. Moreover, if one considers the punishment, I must be suspected by all pious people as a disgraceful evildoer. Let each one consider this in their heart. An sit dolor similis etc.</p>
      <p>And if such a sentence should not be revoked (as I do not trust), I would much rather endure another war, as I have been robbed for the third time. Yes, I would rather endure death and call to God with Paul: "Who will deliver me from this body of death, that I may live with God" [Phil 1:23], also speak with Jeremiah: "Cursed be the man who brought news to my father, saying, 'A son is born to you'" [Jer 20:15]. I would rather have perished at birth or been destroyed in my mother's womb than be given to such disgrace (si res sic se habet). Nothing else can follow from this than that I must leave my fatherland, which I have helped to protect with my blood for the seventh time, and leave an honorable, pious wife with the children and take the beggar's sack around my neck and go into eternal misery. That is what awaits me. There are enough other laborers etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in my old age, so that I am not first so disgraced and shamed, I have asked my gracious lords for mercy, where there is now no lack. Those who are not in breach of such order and statute in our times and have recently begun by God, so God wants to establish His covenant and laws through me and reform the church, and appoint me as the dog to be struck before the lion and that, being a sanctuary, He wants to begin to punish, so that, I will endure it for His honor's sake. So that my gracious lords have let me stand in punishment until now and have instructed me to turn to you; whatever grace and goodness I find with you, my gracious lords will not withhold from me. I hope, too, you have served them well in this etc. Therefore, I exhort you by divine mercy, since you are called sons of the Most High God and Father. That you show this to me, that is grace and mercy; thereby one recognizes His children, namely those who do His work etc.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, I exhort you by Christian love, which is a bond of all perfection, the city so, one bears the weakness of his neighbor, forgives the debtor and does not seek revenge for his wrongdoing etc. And consider the great damages I have suffered in honor, body, and goods, also the loyalty I have shown in God's word and to all His servants, and have never tasted the outward sweetness of the gospel, but have drunk excessively, especially always from the cup and beaker of the Lord Jeremiah and Isaiah, where a full measure has been poured for me etc. So God is not eternally angry, but forgiving to all who ask Him. So I ask you all in general and each one in particular, to forgive and pardon me for God's sake, as you would have God forgive you, and to restore to me my office, so that I may serve God and the Christian church according to God's command. Then I will be more careful in the future and more vigilant over God's word and order. An office is of no use to me if I have not broken it, therefore you are generally asked, my gracious lords, to consider me in grace and provide for my old age and be satisfied with my tribulations. I will repay this to God and each one. With this, I commend you to God and His grace etc.</p>
