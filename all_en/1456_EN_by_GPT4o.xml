      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I do not doubt that you have received my letters sent through the citizen of Zurich with Polyaenus; if there is anything else you wish to be taken care of, let me know. I also believe that you have received from the Wittenbergers the current state of affairs in Saxony and especially what is happening with the people of Magdeburg, who are still steadfast in the defense of their Bethulia, for whom I pray Christ to be the defender of their cities. It is certain that the Emperor left Augsburg on October 22. He was splendidly received by the Bavarian in Munich and with great joy proceeded to Innsbruck; the soldiers are still dissenting and seditious; the captains have fled, they have plundered the villages of the abbot; his name escapes me. They also attack the best people for the denied salary. Consider the instability of Satan.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Strasbourg, called by the Emperor to the council, went miserably with a few companions, well understanding what the Emperor is plotting in that little council. I send you a sample of what they have decided against our churches. They are worthy of being answered with a bitter writing, so that they know they have established these articles against the Holy Scripture and have made their decisions against the opinions of the Church Fathers. O miserable kind of men, who hunt for nothing else but their own glory, not that of Christ Jesus, the Son of God.</p>
      <p>In Paris, it was announced with a trumpet that whoever wants to buy gold pieces, silk garments, and spices should come at a specified time; they intend to sell everything cheaply. Thus the king tries to sell the imperial plunder he took from Germany, so that the people may see the plunder and rejoice together with the courtiers.</p>
      <p>What the captain is doing in Constance with the Nuremberg merchandise, you know better than I do. A very serious war is imminent, and these Austrians will undoubtedly dare to devastate many places.</p>
      <p>I also thank you immensely for the booklet you sent, which I have read and reread, and I only regret that you have used brevity in matters so great and holy. I pray for the king to have a spirit inflamed by the Holy Spirit, so that he may read the booklet diligently and read it again, indeed read it thoroughly, so that the true doctrine of the Fathers may adhere and then bear fruit. Farewell. More another time.</p>
      <p>If you intend to send anything to Lord Maurus, the royal legate, you can do so, and I will take care of it through the post to him almost every day; I beg you not to neglect this opportunity. Basel, November 5, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the venerable master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich, my kind dear lord. Zurich.</p>
