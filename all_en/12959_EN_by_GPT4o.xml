    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The repeated greetings that Bullinger keeps sending to M端ller through acquaintances in letters prove that he still counts him among his friends, even though they have never met and he has only rarely responded to Bullinger's letters. The reasons for this are the heavy workload, the lack of messengers, and also (M端ller must admit) a bit of negligence. However, he will never be able to forget Bullinger and will always remember his helpfulness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Johannes Haller expresses in his letter [No. 2908] the attempt by the Augsburg authorities to detain him and [Thoman Ruman], as well as their recall by the Zurich council. M端ller asks Bullinger to vouch for the truthfulness of the letter and to ensure the good reputation of the young, pious Haller. The people of Augsburg are in great danger and could not convince anyone (not even themselves!) that the proclamation of the Gospel will not soon be banned, the pastors expelled, and the papist priests with their idolatry will return. Therefore, the Zurich council made a wise decision in recalling Haller and his colleague. If anyone tries to dissuade them, they will surely know how to respond in this tense situation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger will have understood what it is about. If M端ller finds the time, he will report more on it. The brevity of the letter is excused. The messenger [...] is in a hurry. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Most pious brother, I not only give and hold great thanks to you (but also owe to return them) for the very frequent greetings in the letters you have written to me through your friends. From this, I recognize (even though we have never communicated in person and I, I admit, have very rarely responded to your letters) that you have not erased me from the list of your friends. The reason I have not responded is partly due to my occupations, partly due to the lack of messengers. However, I cannot deny that I should not be accused of some negligence because of this. Nevertheless, I do not want you to believe that I have ever been so busy and negligent as to forget you, my brother; for I will never be unmindful of your kindness towards me, not even while this spirit governs these limbs.</p>

      <p>Therefore, you have from Haller's letters what he responds to you and your council regarding the retention by our senate and his recall. I wish and ask that you give certain credence to these and consider the honor of this pious and learned young man. For now, we people of Augsburg are exposed to such danger that we cannot convince ourselves or anyone else that we can retain the word of the Lord or its ministers for much longer, and that soon the papist priests and their factions will not come here and restore the old idolatry. Therefore, the recall of him, your minister, and his colleague, most prudently instituted by you, and if otherwise dissuaded, it will be up to your prudence to decide what should be established and responded to in such a great storm and what needs to be done now.</p>

      <p>You understand the matter well, and when you have time, I will write more to you about it. Now, due to the haste of the messenger, forgive the brevity. Farewell with the brothers and keep me recommended to you and continue to love me! Given on the 25th of May in the year 1547. Yours, Nikolaus Maier.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man Heinrich Bullinger, chief ecclesiastic of Zurich, my most esteemed brother and friend.</p>
