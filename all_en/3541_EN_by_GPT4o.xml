      <p>Greetings. The most illustrious prince, the Margrave of Vicosoprano, who offers you this letter, dear compater, resides in Geneva. He is most beloved by all the pious and good people because of his virtues and is worthy of admiration and support from good men. Therefore, I commend him and his cause to you and your faith.</p>
      <p>I have also recommended him to both consuls through letters written to them. He seeks to be received as a citizen or under the protection of the Rhaetians, so that he may enjoy the privilege granted to them by the most illustrious princes of Venice. But he will explain this matter to you in detail.</p>
      <p>I therefore pray that you may deign to assist him; for he has been highly recommended to me by the pious people of Geneva. Now, besides this, I have nothing to write.</p>
      <p>I am writing many and lengthy letters to Frankfurt, so that they may be delivered to my friends from there; therefore, I am brief in this letter to you. I am writing about the same matter to Mr. Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>We hear that some are very eager to see if a synod can be convened, in which the concord of the churches of Switzerland and Germany may be discussed. May the Lord grant us what He knows will contribute to the edification of the churches.</p>
      <p>Why is it that Mr. Philipp does not care to receive his Bible from me and have it transported to him? I implore him in this matter of the illustrious count, just as I have entreated you, etc. Farewell, dear brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 18, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, his compater and dearest brother.</p>
