      <p>Greetings, my son. While I am waiting to hear from you about the price that is usually paid by the wealthier and middle-class for board in Strasbourg, our dearest lord and my brother, your lord Burcher, has anticipated you and is requesting eighteen French crowns for you this year. It does not seem to me that he has asked for too much, so I thanked him and promised to pay him faithfully. I urge you to speak to him kindly and say: "My father has praised your generosity to me, who, although you could have received more, asked for less; therefore, I thank you and ask that you continue to hold me in your favor.</p>
      <p>If I can also be of service in the house and elsewhere, I offer my assistance willingly." I have indeed asked him to continue supporting you until I send you away from Strasbourg, where you now have excellent teachers and very useful lectures. See to it that you make good use of the goodwill of the most distinguished men, Mr. Martyr and Mr. Zanchi, both of whom have written letters testifying that the fault does not lie with them if anything is neglected here; for they are favorable and very ready to help you, as they have indicated to you.</p>
      <p>Now, if you add the 8 crowns that you took with you (I am not even mentioning the travel expenses and other monies) to these 18, you will gather a total of 26 crowns or 40 and a half German gold coins and 5Î². I willingly spend these for you, even though both of them burden and distress me in my domestic affairs. See to it, my son, that I do not make such great expenses in vain; devote yourself to your studies day and night, fear God, be of good character, and if you need anything else for your well-being, let me know; however, I want you to be frugal and thrifty; because giving so much from my household for a year weighs on me.</p>
      <p>I am sending you my Decades, not inelegantly bound, through H. Vuestius; see that you use them neatly, so that you always have that book from your father, and use it at home for a long time. Your mother is not in very strong health, which worries me; pray to the Lord to strengthen her, so that she is not consumed by premature death and illness. Live and farewell. Zurich, June 24, 1554.</p>
      <p>To his beloved son Heinrich Bullinger the Younger, residing in the house of Lord Burcher in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg.</p>
