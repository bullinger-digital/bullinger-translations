    <p xml:id="regest1">Asks why Bullinger does not let anything be heard from him; left Basel without consulting, because he wanted to hear other teachers in Paris. There they saw the splendor at the reception of Emperor Charles V. In Orléans, he can give lectures on rhetoric; he would have the opportunity to move to England, where he would only have to teach mathematics to a gentleman, but he awaits Bullinger's judgment on the usefulness of such a journey. Greetings.</p>

      <p>I am deeply saddened, most revered father, that I have not received anything from you for a long time. I still do not know why this is or what I have done to deserve it. I will always be the one who, in all things, follows the will of those whom God has given me as elders and revered fathers. If my unconsulted departure has caused any offense, I hope for forgiveness on the grounds that I left Basel without being recalled by anyone and for no other reason than to hear other professors of disciplines, of whom there is a great number in Paris.</p>
      <p>And to set aside the studies of literature, we saw the royal pomp and more than royal, with which Emperor Charles was received both in other parts of France and indeed in Paris. There you truly see what was boasted of Rome: the city and the world, than which nothing more illustrious exists in the whole of Germany (as far as I know), except for one or two places. But I am burdening your most sacred affairs with these trifles.</p>
      <p>Briefly, after leaving Paris during the Easter festivities, I came to Orléans, where I am now again enjoying an honorable position by lecturing on rhetoric. I have decided to await your truly paternal letters here, so that I may know what should be done next. For a certain very dear friend in Paris has promised me that he knows a certain gentleman in England, with whom I could live honorably by teaching nothing but mathematics, and if I wish to go there, he would provide me with a horse along with travel expenses. However, I think it more prudent to delay until I am made certain by your letters whether we can gain any benefit from a deeper insight into England. For with your wisdom, you cannot be unaware of how much, I do not say pleasure, but also utility, we derive from long and distant travels. But this is entirely at your discretion, to which I willingly submit.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family, with Mr. Pellican, Mr. Theodor, Mr. Amman, and all my other lords and teachers. 1540, April 18, in Orléans.</p>
      <p>Otho Werdmüller, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his father to be honored forever. Zurich.</p>
