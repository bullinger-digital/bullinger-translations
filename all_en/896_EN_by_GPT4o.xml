      <p>Greetings. A stupendous plan of the Emperor is being circulated regarding the future assemblies, namely that he intends to excommunicate all who have not accepted his Interim, and to wage war on those who have accepted it but do not openly observe it.</p>
      <p>If this is true, I would dare to proclaim him a tyrant, the likes of which have not been seen since the beginning of the world.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it would have been a pious act if we had not prohibited the Italian translation of Walter's Antichrist from being published here, so that not only the Antichrist could be recognized, but also his ministry: the censors, kings, princes, etc. If you have anything on this matter, please let me know at your leisure.</p>
      <p>The new Pope writes that he will easily bear a council, provided that the Roman See is not disparaged, but remains unharmed. If the Emperor had even a crumb of heavenly wisdom, or even if he were wise in a human way, would he not know that the Pope is the devil, after so many evils have disgraced that seat? But he is carried away blindly like a raging horse, until he will eventually bring himself to ruin. Twenty-one articles have been sent from Rome to Duke Heinrich Otto concerning matters related to the stomach, distinguishing them well. Therefore, Vergerius recently said not without reason: "There is nothing good to hope for from the new Pope." Among these articles, one is as follows:</p>
      <p>"For the peace and tranquility of the Apostolic See, to avoid scandals and inconveniences that might otherwise occur, we freely promise the city of Parma to the most illustrious Lord Octavio Farnese, its current prince," etc., since it is known that this was bought with a huge sum of money and placed among the conditions of Cardinal Farnese, if he wished to have his and his followers' vote for the papal dignity.</p>
      <p>But all sons of the devil must be like this; otherwise, they could not be distinguished from the sons of God; they are liars like their father, just as the sons of God are truthful like God.</p>
      <p>Besides this, we hear that the plague is raging again among you, as well as in Luzern, and some unknown flow of blood from the mouth, which kills within 24 hours. A miraculous scourge upon the people avenging their evils. Such inconveniences usually afflict good men, so it is no wonder about you.</p>
      <p>We have a preacher, Valentin, a painter, cut off and yet married and a comedian. From your commentary on Luke chapter 5, you noted some things about the pastor from Erasmus's paraphrase, from which we wonder if you would tolerate such a one.</p>
      <p>I say this so that you may know, for no other reason; for I doubt what he is like in your minds. Farewell in Christ, who may defend you and yours from the evil plague. Amen. Basel, on the first of May, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, brother in the Lord, his venerable in Christ.</p>
