      <p>Greetings. I am deeply saddened to learn from your letters, most esteemed lord and godfather, that the two letters I sent to you from the feast of John the Baptist were intercepted or lost. Had they reached your excellence, you would not have been unaware of our status and our love towards you. However, I am fully convinced that we are bound by such a strong bond of kinship that neither the loss of letters on the way nor their absence can erase it. But henceforth (God willing), I will compensate for the crime of silence with the diligence of letters.</p>
      <p>As far as I know, even the letters from my wife to your wife and the wife of our godfather, Mr. Bibliander, our dearest godmothers, have not been delivered. From them, you would have at least somewhat understood our condition and that of the kingdom. But since I now promise both duty and effort (in this part) more diligently than we have omitted so far, it will be your kindness to forgive generously.</p>
      <p>I will not now speak of how just an excuse the severity and danger of my labors would deserve from you, most esteemed lord, but I will descend to what you command. First, as it pertains to me, accept a few words. Since we came to England, I have not seen my homeland or parents due to the frequent and dangerous disturbances stirred up there for the sake of religion; and still (may God grant better things) matters are not settled calmly and peacefully. My father still lives, ignorant of true religion, whom I hope will eventually be taught better by the grace of God. Here in London, I have served as an interpreter of the Holy Scriptures, and sometimes at the court of the king by the order of the Duke of Somerset. In the city, I completed the epistle to Titus and almost seven chapters from John: at the court, I interpreted the holy David: but how perilously the sixth chapter, God knows.</p>
      <p>I am also now dealing with Daniel around the end of the seventh chapter. I wanted to present the sixth chapter of John and the seventh of Daniel alternately, so that the people might recognize Christ truly from one, and the Antichrist truly from the other. Let these things be said about me. My wife, who remembers you in her prayers (to pay what she owes to your love), lives and is well, not as she once was in Zurich in Switzerland; but as the English air and our climate allow. Our Rachel grows in both body and mind. She moderately understands English, German, French, and Latin, but above all Latin.</p>
      <p>While I was writing this (on the fifth of February, when I received your last letters), the Archbishop of Canterbury had summoned me. He, in the name of the king and the councilors, enjoined me to act as a preacher of the word of God once a week before the king (who resides in London and will not move elsewhere before Easter) during the following Lent. May the Lord open my heart and mouth, so that I may think and speak what promotes His kingdom. I think I will choose a very suitable topic, which beautifully touches upon the duties of each, namely the prophet Jonah. You, venerable godfather, make sure to write back as soon as possible and diligently advise what you think is more appropriate to say in such a large audience. It must be a great thing before the king: for in the city, the attendance at my reading is such that the temple often cannot accommodate it.</p>
      <p>Now, what is happening in England. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Rochester, the Bishop of Ely, the Bishop of St. David's, the Bishop of Lincoln, and the Bishop of Bath support the cause of Christ, and, as far as I know, they now purely understand the cause of the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>I have freely discussed this matter with all of them, and I have found nothing but pure and holy.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Canterbury, who holds the primacy from the king's council, allows readers and preachers to read and preach; however, each one first subscribes to several articles, which I will send to you if I can, among which one is about the Eucharist, which is plainly true and Helvetic. The Marquis of Dorset, the Earl of Warwick, and the majority of the king's councilors support the cause of Christ as much as they can. Our king is such as the whole world has not seen for his age. May the Lord preserve him. His sister, whom the deceased king had from Queen Anne, burns with such zeal and religion for Christ.</p>
      <p>She not only knows what true religion is, but she has advanced so much in Latin and Greek that she can defend it with the most just arguments and her most fortunate intellect; and she overthrows the few adversaries she attacks.</p>
      <p>However, the people, a many-headed beast, kick back, partly out of ignorance, partly bewitched by the flattery of bishops and the malice and impiety of priests. These things are happening in England. As for the state, take this. On the sixth of October, the king fled with the protector from the court, which we commonly call Hampton Court, to another castle, called Windsor in our language, for the reason that the others from the councils in London decided to consider his case (as was right).</p>
      <p>Great forces on both sides.</p>
      <p>Because I had great enemies on both sides, I did not want to be part of any side. In the king's flight were the Duke of Somerset, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the controller of the court, and others from the king's private chambers.</p>
      <p>All the other nobles and more powerful forces joined the councilors who conducted this case in London: however, the matter was settled without bloodshed by the mercy of God. On the 14th of October, the Duke of Somerset was led with others to the Tower of London, from which he has not yet emerged.</p>
      <p>He will be released this evening or tomorrow (by the grace of God). As for Driander returning to you, put aside fear; he looks after himself and does not care much for us (except for profit).</p>
      <p>Mr. Cox received both your letters and your gift most honorably; I would have thought you had received a response from him by now. The Archbishop of Canterbury did not care much for your letters or your literary gift, to tell the truth. But now, I hope, Mr. Bullinger and the Archbishop of Canterbury think the same. If not, you will hear shortly.</p>
      <p>As for what you write about the Marquis of Dorset, what you have suitable for the press, I ask you to dedicate it to him. He is pious, good, brave, and distinguished in the cause of Christ. You will greatly promote the glory of God if you stimulate him and others with your writings. Believe me, your reputation is honorably (as you deserve) reported among all learned and pious Englishmen.</p>
      <p>Take the roughness of the letters in good part. After a few more, you will hear more. London, February 5, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, John Hooper.</p>
      <p>You will remind Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Bibliander, and other Zurichers if they have anything to print about religion, which they might dedicate to our king, the best and most learned boy, or to another of the nobles. To you, most learned godfather and in every way most esteemed teacher, I command and urge you to send something printed to our king. I will ensure that your work reaches his hands, and the gift will not lack our speech.</p>
      <p>Please do not mention these letters to anyone. I would write to Mr. Bibliander, as is proper, and to Mr. Butler, but I do not have the time, God knows. I pray for all happiness for everyone. After three days, I will write more. You will hear about the Interim and others in a few days. The Duke of Somerset will soon leave the tower, and many others will enter, whom I cannot name now.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger. Quickly, quickly, quickly. Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the honorable wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Send this to John Burcher.</p>
