      <p>God with us. These two, my sons Ulrich and Heinrich, are coming to you with great joy. Mr. Haller and I have earnestly asked Ludwig to allow Heinrich; today and tomorrow they have leave, on Thursday they should come back home. Treat them well. All our people send their greetings, and since you are so well godfather Hans, I have told godmother Regula that today they should baptize Alwin and the following day Heinrich, with which we are very satisfied, and she will arrange and do everything well. I have no new news other than this present one; send it back to me with the boys.</p>
      <p>And may God be with you, Susanna, and Elisabeth; greet them all for us, also godfather Hans and all your people.</p>
      <p>Given on Tuesday, September 18, 1571.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
