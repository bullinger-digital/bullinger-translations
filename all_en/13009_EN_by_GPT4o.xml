    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger received Blarer's confidential letter from July 18 [No. 2955] on July 22. He gratefully returns the copy of the response letter from the people of Constance to [King Henry II] of France. In his opinion, the people of Constance acted prudently and wisely, as it is better for them to ensure their own protection without the help of a foreign garrison. As soon as a city recruits foreigners, it arouses suspicion among both friends and enemies. Blarer should ensure that Emperor Charles V does not cunningly seize control of Constance and entrust the city's government to one of his followers. The story of Troy, as told by Virgil, is a fitting warning. One must be cautious of the Emperor. He is a wicked and cunning man who will certainly make no exception for Constance. He will impose the Imperial Diet's decisions on the city, just as he will on all the other cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Imperial Diet begins on September 1. It is to address, firstly, the maintenance of peace, law, and order; secondly, a resolution to the religious question; and thirdly, the defense of the Empire.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The first goal is to be achieved with the [newly appointed by the Emperor] Chamber Court. This will reinstate all the clergy who have been deprived of their income and order compensations. The second goal is to be achieved with the council or with the help of a similar book to the [Worms Book], which was created years ago in Regensburg. Then the situation [of the Protestants] will be even worse than before! The third goal is to be realized thanks to a great Imperial League; a league to which the devil, Baal [i.e., the papacy], monks and priests, the bloodthirsty dynasties of Kings Ahab, Jeroboam, and Athaliah, Austria, as well as Burgundy, are to belong. This league will likely cause more unrest and turmoil than the Hydra has heads. God's wrath over the Empire is great because it has shown itself to be so ungrateful.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Extreme caution is required in dealing with the Emperor, as he is an open enemy of God and a murderer of Christ's witnesses! He does not serve the truth. What characterizes him is Spanish deceit and antichristian actions, with which he has promised much to the cities and princes but has kept nothing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] One should pray to God for grace. Greetings to Sebastian Schertlin, Thomas Blarer, and Konrad Zwick.</p>

      <p>Beloved lord and friend, I received your confidential letter, sent on July 18, on the 22nd of the same month. I am sending you back the copy of the response given to the French. Thank you most sincerely. In my understanding, your people have acted neither unwisely nor thoughtlessly in such a complicated matter. For if you can manage to ensure your own protection without the help of a foreign garrison, then it is right. As soon as you allow foreigners in, there is fear and distress from friends and foes. But be careful that the Emperor does not cunningly and deceitfully bring your city under his control and place someone he favors in charge. "Do you believe the enemy has gone, or that any gifts of the Greeks are free from treachery? Is this how Ulysses is known?" You are dealing with a cunning, evil, smooth-talking, deceitful man. Therefore, be on your guard! I fear, I fear, he will not make any exceptions for you: You will have to follow the Imperial Diet's decisions like others.</p>

      <p>The Imperial Diet begins on September 1. It will primarily deal with three articles: 1. The maintenance of peace, law, and order in the German lands. 2. The resolution of the religious question and a reformation. 3. The protection and defense of the German nation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The first article will be addressed with the Chamber Court. This will reinstate all clergy, abbots, and priests, and order them to bear the costs and damages. The second will be addressed with the council or with a book similar to the one presented years ago in Regensburg. "The latter will be worse than the former!" The third will be completed with the great Imperial League. In this league will be included Belial and Baal, monks and priests, the bloodthirsty houses of Ahab, Jeroboam, and Athaliah, Austria, Burgundy, etc. This will bring more unrest and rebellion, for Hydra has raised its heads. Now, I see that God's wrath is great over Germany because of its ingratitude.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Beloved lord and brother, I urge you to consider most seriously how and what you are dealing with the Emperor, who is an open enemy of God, a murderer of Christ's martyrs, who does not uphold the truth, who is composed of Spanish deceit and antichristian practices, who has promised much to the cities and princes and has kept nothing!</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>We will pray to God for grace. God be with you and all yours. Greet for me Mr. Sebastian Schertlin, your brother and cousin. Given on the feast of Mary Magdalene, in the year 1547. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his dearest brother. Constance.</p>
