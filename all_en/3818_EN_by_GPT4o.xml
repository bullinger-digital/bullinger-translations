      <p>Honorable sir and especially beloved friend, my good-willed, friendly service to you first, with wishes from God for your and your family's temporal and eternal well-being, etc. Since I have now undertaken to make an exchange of my young sons with Mr. Rudolf Funck, I have instructed the bearer of this letter, Adam Leon, my young one, to visit you, my dear sir and friend, with this little letter and also to learn how you and your family are doing.</p>
      <p>If it is going well for all of you by God's grace, it would be a special joy for me to hear. My aforementioned messenger also has orders from me to inform you, my dear sir, about the above-mentioned exchange and in other ways about the situation of my five sons, more so, how your son departed from Munich at Easter and what kind of passport I... but so far (beyond his statement) nothing more has come to me about his situation. Perhaps you will know it...</p>
      <p>The Reichstag (Imperial Diet) has now begun here. What will be decided, time will tell.</p>
      <p>May God grant his grace.</p>
      <p>I have now sent your report on the questions... which were presented in the papacy, with good-hearted intention, to... and you sent it to Doctor Gerion here (see G. Seiler March 12)... seen.</p>
      <p>In God we hope that this and other matters of yours... will serve to the praise and glory of God and the salvation of souls. May God grant you further his grace. The times... are very burdensome.</p>
      <p>I know nothing more to write to you.</p>
      <p>I commend my sons to you in the manner of a gracious patron.</p>
      <p>With that, may God commend you and all yours. Dated Augsburg, the 1st year 59.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, doctor and servant of the church of Zurich, my especially dear sir and friend, to be delivered.</p>
