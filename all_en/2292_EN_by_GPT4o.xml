      <p>S. I have immense gratitude for your extensive and accurate duty of writing, to which I am unable to respond now as I would like, due to the occupations that overwhelm me upon my return home from a journey. I am deeply saddened by what you write about the renewed zeal for disputes by certain contentious minds, as if there were not already enough evils and scandals in the church, and as if the battle against the kingdom of the Antichrist and the monstrous and open heresies were over, so that we should attack our own insides and consume each other by biting. However, I have received nothing so far about the Saxon synod, and not even in Strasbourg (where I recently traveled to Breisgau and Alsace, called there by the daughter and widow of Margrave Ernst of Baden, and here by the Baron of Rappoltstein) did I learn anything about this, nor did Mr. Marpach go there, whom I heard teaching. However, I can hardly believe they would have kept it from me, as everyone received me so familiarly. And lest you be unaware, I addressed your son in person and admonished him with the diligence and faithfulness I could muster, using a dutiful lie, affirming that it was given to me by you as a mandate, as you were aware of my journey; for although he proceeds not lazily on his own, I seemed not to act unprofitably if I also encouraged one who was already running. The other students, alumni of your church, greeted me very familiarly. Of the news I received there, the most significant is that Mr. Peter Martyr reported having been informed by letters from England that recently in a session of parliament, when the queen wished to restore the primacy to the Roman pontiff and also the burning of Lutheran books (as they call them) and those who possessed and read them, it was decreed publicly that the pope should not be considered the head of the Anglican Church, but that it should remain in the state of liberty in which it was established by Henry VIII; nor should there be an inquiry into Lutheran books, and it should be left free to possess and read them, provided no one disturbs anything else. Lastly, concerning Philip, that he should be recognized as king, but on the condition that upon the queen's death without a male heir born of both, he should relinquish the kingdom. And indeed, the Bishop of Winchester, now residing in Strasbourg, a man of incredible sweetness of character, sharp and elegant intellect, and of the best omen, was pronouncing these things and that these beginnings would be, if these were true, by which the state of affairs would be changed for the better.</p>
      <p>Our Lycosthenes is moderately restored to the extent of his foot function, so that he can proceed without hindrance wherever he wishes, and also of his tongue, so that he can baptize infants and console the sick; but he is not yet able to preside over the pulpit due to his speech still being impeded by certain cold distillations, which he will attempt to remedy by the use of the Baden baths on the advice of a doctor.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord that He may completely loosen the bond of the tongue of this most excellent organ and render him fit for the sacred ministry. These things now briefly and hastily, which I ask you to consider kindly. Farewell. Basel, May 26, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>After I had written this letter a few days ago, a messenger's untimely departure forced me to retain it longer. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
