      <p>Greetings. If you are well, reverend father in Christ, it is good; indeed, by the grace of God, we are well. I do not expect any letters from you now, as you have already indicated that you would not write, nor would I have written, because I have nothing new to report. However, there was something that compelled me to write: to inform you that the books of the councils have finally been returned to us, and because the matter concerning Mr. Eglin greatly troubles me.</p>
      <p>Regarding the books, we owe you special thanks; there is no need to repeatedly testify how much we owe you, as you already know this well, and it has long been time for us to let you know and understand this in reality. It was very timely that, as soon as they were returned to me, I had someone to send them to Clavenna, and I do not doubt that your book will reach you before mine are returned to you. Concerning Eglin, I hear that he, who has been eagerly awaited by me and his people in Davos for a long time, is considering coming at the first opportunity with his wife and children.</p>
      <p>If he does so, he errs greatly in my opinion; so that you may understand, consider this: There is another in Davos who has a place until the upcoming St. George's Day; for they have contracted him for that long. In the meantime, Mr. Eglin should come and have preached a sermon; thereafter, if he is agreeable to them, they would have met him in such a way that it would have been agreeable to him. Mr. Eglin should still do this, as I advise him well; for an entire congregation does not accept a pastor before they have heard him preach.</p>
      <p>If Mr. Eglin were to come with wife and child, the old pastor would still be present, and they would be much less inclined to accept him than otherwise, as they would think he still had other options. Therefore, I earnestly ask you, honorable lord and father, to arrange once more that Mr. Eglin comes and preaches in Davos.</p>
      <p>If he does not come soon, the common people will become displeased (you know what a many-headed beast does), and I will be left in a difficult position. They do not know where they stand, and I cannot write to them; for no one lets me know anything; I hear it only from the merchants. As for other matters, I know the papists are not asleep.</p>
      <p>The pope sends letters to our man (I know this for certain). What they are planning, the outcome will reveal. Certainly, our man has been received into favor by the pope.</p>
      <p>Last week, Verhardus de Raytmonte came from Rome with large bundles of letters to the German nobles everywhere. But he was also with our man, to whom he gave the pope's letters, etc.</p>
      <p>There are credible sources who, led by I know not what arguments, conclude that our man is being supported with money by the pope. Whatever it is, he is spending gold; this I know for certain.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man, with all your people, as happily as possible. Chur, March 10, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most devoted.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church in Zurich, his much-honored lord and patron.</p>
