      <p>Greetings. I received your letters sent through Mr. Tretius along with the new volume of your work "On the Origin of Error and Councils," for which, most esteemed lord and godfather, I once again give you great thanks. I see how much you care for me, as you continually remember me by distributing copies of your writings; if only I were able to repay you! May He who bestowed these gifts upon you repay you, so that by writing and teaching you may benefit His church. As for the French affairs, Tretius will report to you everything he heard in Geneva. They are most deplorable, and for many years there has not been such a miserable state of affairs in France as there is now. Our people are quite disturbed by this. The Duke of Savoy also raises his crest against the Genevans and, by whatever means he can, blocks their supplies; I fear that something new may soon arise from there as well. From the Netherlands, we have nothing except the common report that the forces of Louis of Nassau have been utterly destroyed; however, I do not know if the adversaries are fabricating this. Indeed, one of ours returned from Lorraine these days; he reports the great triumphs they are celebrating in Burgundy (for he passed through there) because of this victory. I also hear that our confederates are very restless; they imagine that because of that assembly held in Aarau, our Republics want to forge a new alliance with the Palatinate and the people of Strasbourg and other such things.</p>
      <p>Your people are spoken of poorly here by some, because they were unwilling to contribute, when it seemed that the people of Basel and Schaffhausen would do so if your people's willingness had also been present. However, the reasons by which they excused themselves have been understood. Otherwise, there is nothing to write, since you have Tretius, the living expositor of all our affairs, whom there is no need for me to commend, as he is already most commendable to you.</p>
      <p>Our consuls and treasurers, as well as other friends and brothers, send their greetings to you. I did not know that Friedrich Musculus was going there; otherwise, I would have written something through him as well. I wish to know how the Rhaetian affairs stand; if you have any information, share it with us. Above all, our Diesbach sends you his most dutiful greetings.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 20, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my lord and godfather, to be honored with the highest and perpetual faith.</p>
