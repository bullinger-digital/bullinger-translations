      <p>Greetings. If all our letters have been delivered, there is hardly anything left except that you also inform us in turn about your affairs, especially ecclesiastical ones. You have seen, I believe, the impudence of the Pope in such great light. The blindness of this world and its princes, as if "the whole world lies in wickedness," can hardly be suspected by anyone except true Christians and Catholics. Our local bishops, especially those of Nuremberg and Meissen, have not yet done much openly, but Sidonius, now of Würzburg, clearly and loudly declares through words and deeds that he will restore everything and each thing that was in use among Catholics, with the manifest errors of the common people, as they say, not of the ecclesiastical leaders, being disguised or interpolated. Hence, on the last Christmas, when he had barely arrived and was protested against with solemn protestation by all orders and states, especially by the Anhaltine, not to attempt anything against the present religion and the Augsburg Confession, nevertheless, he anointed the children of some great doctors in the republic, even jurists, in baptism, who had not been anointed in this way before, and confirmed them in his manner, and even wanted to ordain new priests who were anointed and shaven. These are the beginnings of evils, and he boasts with full cheeks that he is most certain that he will prove and assert these and similar things from all the old Catholics against all our innovations before fair judges in any council whatsoever. Here, here, my Bullinger, if you have anything at all from the old Greek and Latin writers against this madness, please share it; for he also boasts that he will obtain and triumph with holy water, exorcism, blessings, ceremonies, and everything else from the old and most approved Greek and Latin Catholic fathers and councils against all schismatics and heretics. And it is astonishing that there are and will be undoubtedly many among the learned whom he will persuade with this one lie. I ask, if you could have some unpublished or manuscript works from the oldest Greeks and Latins, which we desire and which would act against these people, that you help us as much as possible and indicate the price at the Frankfurt fairs, if they can be obtained. Or at least have certain better passages transcribed at any price, which will be paid by us immediately according to your indication. Forgive me, I am very much convinced, again and again, that for my piety towards you, I share everything so familiarly as if into your bosom, and in turn, you should have it eternally persuaded of me, as of a most friendly and observant person, and you will experience it, I absolutely want to, and I will always demonstrate it in reality according to my mediocrity. Your bookseller has not yet sent your Sermons, but I have received against Cochlaeus, as I wrote before. And I would like to be informed what you would like to be sent to you in return, especially according to Heriod's addition, either here or in Wittenberg or Frankfurt on the Oder or Königsberg, or even to the bookseller at the Frankfurt fairs, the same amount of money or in whatever way you have arranged; about these and all other things, please write back as copiously as possible, either before the fairs, if you can, or certainly whenever you can have them, to whom you rightly give them. Socinus ordered me to greet you all and to indicate that he lives and indeed in the most desired studies, always mindful of you. Farewell and love us back, as you do, for your humanity and piety, and write back. Written very quickly under the noise of the winter fairs 1552 in Leipzig.</p>
      <p>Eternally yours and your people’s, Valentinus the Peaceful. Occupations do not allow for better or more verbose writing, nor was there time to reread.</p>
      <p>To the great man of God, singular in word and deed and immortal writings, the most outstanding of all, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, administrator and most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his lord and most venerable friend.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
