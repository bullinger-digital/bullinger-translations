    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the greeting conveyed through Johannes a Lasco; considers a Lasco to be on par with Erasmus and worthy of being the Archbishop of Germany; describes his origin, appearance, and piety, and praises his theological education, which is drawn not from the Scholastics but from the Holy Scripture; in Basel, he maintained a close relationship with Erasmus, who wrote his "Lingua" for his sake, and acquired his library, which he makes available to the poor here; his knowledge of Latin and Greek literature is also evidenced by his work ["Epitome doctrinae ecclesiae Phrisiae orientalis"], the publication of which Aquilomontanus hopes for from Bullinger. To avoid the temptation of worldly honors, a Lasco married a poor woman and now has three children; he attracts many seekers of advice and calls Aquilomontanus "Father." He was persuaded by the sovereign [Anna of East Frisia] to accept the bishopric and has begun to unite the divided pastors and confront the heretics; Aquilomontanus asks for a recommendation to him and apologizes for his clumsy praise. His proclamation meets with incomprehension among the educated and he suffers from the ailments of old age, but he wishes to ensure a good education for his three sons before his death. He asks for a benevolent reception of his inadequate writing. He hopes to see Bullinger's Bible and latest works through a Lasco. He asks for intercession, sends greetings, and urges him to take care of his health.</p>

      <p>Grace and increase of the spirit.</p>
      <p>I am grateful, most excellent of friends, that you remembered me with the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes a Lasco, and ordered a friendly greeting. This man, my teacher, I value as much as all scholars value the great Erasmus. Thus, I desire nothing in this man (may envy be absent from my words), but I regret that he has fallen into this barbaric and ungrateful region; for he is worthy of the archbishopric of Germany, or if any more civilized nation can be found. Such is the man's humanity, courtesy, eloquence, and, among other great gifts, humility, that I often openly profess among friends that I have never found a man more humble, adorned with such sublime gifts, anywhere in the world (I have traveled through several nations and spoken with many learned and pious men). You have heard (as it is true) that he was born of Polish barons, rich and opulent, showing a princely stature, with a long beard, and a shaved head, as is the custom of his country. His face is heroic, open to all, cheerful in conversation.</p>
      <p>What shall I say about his piety towards God, when, besides other disciplines, he is so versed in theology that he is a marvel to all, and, what is given to few, he not only knows but also understands, so that he is said to speak not only with his mouth but also with his heart. He drew this theology not from impious sophists, nor from Thomas, Durandus, Scotus, and Occam, but from the most pious and sacred scriptures, considering the true nobility of the mind to be the ornaments of the soul.</p>
      <p>He had the highest acquaintance with Erasmus in Basel, so much so that he wrote "Lingua" for his sake; he bought his library after his death for many hundreds, so that he brought a library equipped with every kind of volume here for the use of the poor. He added Greek literature to Latin, so that he excels in both, as indeed the letters written to you and his learned and pious work indicate. If only that work, revised by you, would return to us printed! This man, bidding farewell to the world, turned to us, and lest worldly honors again remind and entice him, he closed the way to honors, marrying a poor yet honest virgin, from whom he has raised three children, with whom this excellent man delights himself. These are indeed great and admirable, yet you will hear greater things. When he settled here for the freedom of the gospel and entrusted the domestic care and management to his wife, so that he might devote himself more freely to studies, the light kindled by God could not be hidden. The pious flock to him, the learned flock to him; he received all with both hands and a loving embrace, presenting himself as affable and open to all, so that with sweet conversation and salutary advice he attracted all like a Gallic Hercules; he called me father because of my gray hair and simplicity, and he uses that name in letters to me.</p>
      <p>Finally, when several pastors here disagreed and few cared about the matter, God the best did not abandon his own. He appointed an excellent widow, after her husband's death, to govern the region, to whom nothing was as dear as the doctrine of Christ and public peace. She often called this excellent man into counsel, finally asking him to be the bishop of the region for Christ's sake, who could not be enticed or swayed by the many annual revenues to be a bishop in other regions. The man, endowed with all gifts, did not refuse, but promised to serve the church freely, if true religion was dear to her and her counselors. He accepted the governance, called together the elders, among whom he counts me because of my gray hair, and began to discuss concord.</p>
      <p>What shall I say, the excellent man instructed all with his eloquence and learning, so that no one had anything against him, although he did not change everyone from their preconceived opinion due to stubbornness. He undertook an immense and daily labor against many heretics, of whom we have many here, so that never did Augustine or Jerome have more. Therefore, I consider it a great thing that the most noble man despised honors, bid farewell to the world; yet I consider it greater that he undertook to govern the church freely and voluntarily, especially in a barbaric region, where there is no honor for the pious and learned. Consider these things well, good man, that I dare to say anything in a trivial style about the most excellent man adorned with all gifts. Never has the Almighty shown himself more favorable to our Friesland, in my judgment, than when he joined this man to his gospel. I pray, commend me to the man with your letters, although I desire nothing in the man, yet it is sweet to be praised by a praised man. And you will advise him not to lay down his office, weary of the ingratitude of many; for if he did, we would be members without a head. You have about the most excellent, most pious, and most learned man, and, what I observe most, the most humble and open to all; whom I wish another eloquent and with Roman chastity of speech had described! It would affect more, but we build with our own resources.</p>
      <p>About myself, you will receive these few things: I do what I have done, and I provoke the envy of many against me, the more I attribute all salvation to Christ alone and propose man according to his worst nature to all. If I had not experienced these things, I would never have believed the learned of the age to be blinder than moles in the matter of salvation; but I have committed myself to the Lord. I grow old daily; yet my eyes, hands, and teeth perform their function without assistance; only my feet desire a staff. I have three sons, healthy and quite well-behaved, whom if I had educated in piety and common learning in any way, I would be ready to die; but let the will of the Lord be done. Amen.</p>
      <p>You have a very poor letter about a most excellent man, which you will make good if you consider the mind, not the hand or pen of the writer.</p>
      <p>I have not been allowed to see your Bible and other later works; but I hope for everything through my lord a Lasco.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent of friends, and commend me and the church entrusted to God in your prayers. Greet, I pray, your fellow soldiers, my friends, diligently and take care of your health, as I hear you are in poor health. Farewell again and love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>In haste, the day after Bartholomew's from the pastoral house of the church of the House of the Old near Emden, in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Hermann Aquilomontanus, minister of the church of the House of the Old.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his teacher. In Zurich.</p>
