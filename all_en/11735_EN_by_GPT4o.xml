Theodor [Bibliander] will report on the English [King?], otherwise there is nothing to write; everyone is affected by the devastation of the Jülich region; in view of papist blasphemy and evangelical lukewarmness in prayer against the Turks, armed violence, contempt for the Word of God and its servants, Myconius fears the worst and is at a loss, but does not want Bullinger to become weary of his worrisome letters. Greetings and congratulations to [Konrad] Pellikan, to whom the Bishop [of Strasbourg] has given a goblet.</p>

      <p>Thomas, the Englishman, sends thirteen crowns to John Burcher, the Englishman, and asks you to give them to him if he is in the city, otherwise to keep them with you until he arrives. And I would ask on behalf of both, but there is no need; I know your diligence in these matters that I entrust to you. Thomas does not know to whom he could more safely entrust this money for safekeeping than to you, and I did not know to whom I would rather give it, so that I could also send greetings in the meantime. Therefore, you will take care of the matter as we both trust you. I entrusted the money to Stump, who sells cloth; he will also deliver it.</p>
      <p>Besides this, there is nothing to write, except what I wrote to Theodor about the Englishman; he will share it. The Jülich region is so devastated that I hear no one who does not lament. I fear many and grave evils in the coming year, as God is more and more despised and earthly things are desired. In the papacy, they hold processions, and these, although blasphemous in themselves, are so defiled by blasphemy that it would not be surprising if God were to rage against them with thunderbolts. Women cry out: "May God punish the Turks; we must go here as fools and neglect our own at home." What the men do, there is no need to say. We who are evangelicals pray so tepidly that I seem to hear the voice of the Lord: "Because you are lukewarm, I will spit you out." What about those who are in arms? By the law of war, whatever they please is permitted. What else could God do but the duty of justice?</p>
      <p>I am indeed convinced that He will not cease from His indignation until we all say with one mind and voice: "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." But when do you think this will happen? We are all so immersed in earthly things that we spit on the divine. They dare to say about the Word: "Our soul loathes this light food." On the contrary: "If I had it, I would let the devil take the priest. In the papacy, I heard the mass and was content; now he tries to force me to do what pleases him. Let it be." Here indeed I see how cautiously, diligently, and zealously we should act; but in the very action, decorum seems to be lacking. Thus it happens that I often hesitate, not knowing where to turn. But enough of this, lest it happen to you as to a certain friend of mine, who is frightened whenever he receives my letters, as they always bring some turmoil, never anything pleasant.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family in Christ. I wish Pellicanus health and safety. Please congratulate him on my behalf for the goblet given by his bishop; for yesterday, the one who carries it passed through here.</p>
      <p>Basel, November 14, 1542.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
