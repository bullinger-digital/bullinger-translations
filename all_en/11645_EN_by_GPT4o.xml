    <p xml:id="regest1">The Imperial Diet could not yet be opened; [King] Ferdinand is said to have arrived [in Speyer], but has not undertaken anything yet; he has not sufficiently considered the costs of his plans. The delay of the princes is due to the enmity between Hans Wurst [Duke Heinrich of Brunswick] and [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse; the latter is said to have responded to the latest defamatory pamphlet of the former. More than external enemies, Myconius is troubled by those who say: "The Church is in the town hall"; pastors who openly point out grievances are summoned before the authorities, which makes Myconius disillusioned with his office; the [councilors] have become sensitive because [Karlstadt] spared them. Greetings; inquires about the [Turkish booklet] promised by Theodor [Bibliander]. Hopes that [Sebastian] Münster, despite his rejection of the academic degree, will take over Karlstadt's theological chair.</p>

      <p>Greetings. There is nothing new; therefore, I have nothing to write. The Imperial Diet has not yet begun, even though the appointed day has long passed. They say Ferdinand is present, but he is doing nothing. But what could a man (in my mind) of no consequence do?</p>
      <p>He has decided to build a tower without first calculating the expenses; it is no wonder, then, that not only he alone is in danger, but also all those standing by him. What do you think is in the minds of the princes, since they are coming to Speyer so slowly, if not that they are burning with dissension? Hans Wurst has written anew against Hesse; the latter is said to have responded anew. He has papist adherents, the other has the rest. Hesse fears to leave, lest that vile instrument stirs up trouble in his principality.</p>
      <p>But let it be, if both leave together, there will be danger to one from the other and vice versa, so it is likely that there is not equal fear from the enemy. Thus, Satan knows how to disturb everything; but God permits it, so that he may repay our ingratitude in kind.</p>
      <p>Yet our impiety troubles me even more. We have had to fight against the papists and against the Anabaptists, now against those who have defended the gospel against force. Listen to what they say among themselves: "The Church," they say, "is in the town hall." But why so? Because they desire to oppress all our authority and freedom. Therefore, whenever someone inveighs against vices a little more freely, he is called to the authorities, examined on what he said, why he said it, from whom he said it, against whom he said it. Is this custom also among you? Or among other churches? Believe me, they often make me think about resigning from the ministry. But while Christ says: "I have suffered such things, and you refuse to suffer?" I am indeed restored, but I conceive such nausea that I would often prefer something else than teaching. He left such people, that is, so tender that they would prefer anything to our severity, whether in teaching or in correcting. I write this to you so that, if you have time, you may console us sometimes.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in Christ. Greet Theodor and ask him why he delays sending what he promised to send.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 15, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>I spoke today with Münster; I hope he will finally succeed Karlstadt in the theological lectures. However, he still hesitates about the degree, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and best Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
