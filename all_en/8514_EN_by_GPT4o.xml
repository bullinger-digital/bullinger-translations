      <p> Greetings. What was decided in the council today or what will be answered to you regarding the Basel matter, I do not yet know, because I have not yet been able to meet with the mayor or any of the lords. However, I will find out shortly and inform you of the matter. This I know, that my lords are also very displeased. But Sulzer has so hindered the people that it is in vain with them until God will also break the ice among them; may He grant that it happens soon. We have no news, except that the inquisition in Burgundy is beginning, with many Spaniards gathering there, many suspected of the religion being thrown into prison, and there is great concern about unrest. </p>
      <p> We have again lost to death in Lausanne our theologian whom we had there, Mr. Samuel Marthonius, a learned, discerning, witty young man; we are now at a loss as to whom to appoint in his place. We know nothing, and my lords would gladly have a renowned theologian. There is much talk about Ursinus in Heidelberg. </p>
      <p> Dear friend, advise us in this matter. In Geneva, there is nothing; the French are generally self-righteous and of their own mind, as you know, therefore my lords have washed their hands of them. I know nothing else at the moment. We are faithfully entrusted to the Lord. </p>
      <p> Bern, March 13, 1571. </p>
      <p> Yours truly, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. </p>
