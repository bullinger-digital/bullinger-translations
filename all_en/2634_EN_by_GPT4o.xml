      <p>S. D. et se commendat. You have, what you so eagerly requested from me, the booklet, most illustrious and dearest Bullinger. He returned late to me from Kempten, and then the news, certain and faithful, offered themselves late: otherwise, you would have received it long ago. That Westphalian judgment, abolished and obliterated throughout all of Germany and Westphalia itself, seems to us that Westphalus wants to restore it to us and thus reinstate it with his carnal and bloody writings. For certain importunate loudmouths, or you might call them quarrelsome sophists, certainly more to be called revilers than preachers, coming forth from Saxony, imbued, or rather infected and inflated with his writings, good God, what disturbances they cause us, they disturb the churches and disrupt the peaceful. Augsburg itself is a witness, along with Kempten and Ravensburg. We hope, however, for more tranquility, as we see some rendered somewhat milder and more equitable by the pious, modest, and solid writing of Mr. Calvin, a pious, learned, modest, and solid man, which many pious ministers and other sincere and steadfast ones strongly wish to be translated into the German language, as they see the Westphalian writings translated into German by a certain minister from Nuremberg. I therefore ask you, most humane Bullinger, to also serve the pious brothers, indeed the holy churches, in this matter, and to strive to ensure that they hear and are confirmed in the simple truth about the Eucharist, once taught by Christ's words, institution, and spirit, now testified and asserted. Regarding the tragedy in Ravensburg, stirred up by a loud and harmful preacher, whom I would rather call a reviler, I believe you have already received news either from Willing himself or from his letters; if not, you will perceive from the letters, if you wish, which I have given to my greatest patron Johann Funck, a man of utmost piety, prudence, and humanity, about this matter and others, about Doctor Ludwig Rabus, now said to be the chief pastor of the church in Strasbourg, what he did among us and what he discussed with us about the supper, and finally about some men among us horrendously infected with the Arian plague. These and other things, if you ever have time to chat, as he says, by the fire after supper, you will hear abundantly and to the point of nausea.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live, having recovered your former strength by the goodness of God, happily with all yours, and ensure that Calvin speaks to us Germans. From Memmingen, 11 days before the Kalends of June, in the year of Christ 1555.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your humanity, Bartholomäus Bertlin.</p>
      <p>To the most humane man, distinguished in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful and prudent leader of the church in Zürich, his lord and friend, to be reverently observed.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
