    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Myconius had a different estimation of the people of Constance until Bullinger informed him about the unsuccessful efforts of the people of Zurich, which now leads him to entrust the whole matter to God. He cannot understand why the people of Constance have avoided reconciliation [with Emperor Charles V.] for so long if they want to remain in the Empire! Certainly, they wanted to live up to their reputation among the Swabians because they wanted to be considered steadfast. Some [people from Constance] who came to the Basel [Martini] fair reported how the Five Places issued a mandate prohibiting the Thurgauers from coming to the aid of the people of Constance, except in the case of a fire. That does not correspond to the customs of the Confederates! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] That the people of Zurich are too devoted to the Five Places has long been undisputed! Myconius could report from Zurichers who explained to him that they would never allow a campaign of their own against them because the five defeats that the Zurichers had to suffer against them had shown that luck was not on their side. Therefore, one must pay more attention to maintaining friendship with the Inner Swiss. However, Bullinger should not interpret this or the statement prompted by a [letter addressed to him] in his last letter [No. 3057, 11-15] as an expression of any disapproval, especially since the cohesion between neighbors or allies is commendable. Myconius merely wanted to mention both to his friend Bullinger in passing. But now that he has been informed by him about the brave attitude of the people of Zurich, he will say nothing more about it. May God preserve and strengthen that spirit for the glory of His name! Because the Confederates are exposed to attacks from all sides, more than ever, such brave, steadfast, and God-fearing men are needed! The Confederates have lacked such people for far too long, which has brought much misfortune, which can be explained by the fact that God tends to withdraw such men from the world when He intends to punish the people. Therefore, one must pray all the more fervently today for pious, brave men, otherwise, it is over for the Confederates! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Myconius cannot say anything about the question of whether alliances [with foreign princes may be entered into or not]. If the Confederates do not ally with others, they are lost unless they are granted increased fear of God again! But even if they join other powers, they are no less exposed to destruction. So what to do? Entrust oneself to the Lord, for this is the safest. But what if all the other places, especially the neighbors of Zurich, make an agreement with King Henry II of France? Can the people of Zurich then reject this on their own without making the other places their enemies? And if one rejects any alliance, why not also the alliance between the Confederates, especially since it is so inappropriate? </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] It pains Myconius that Bullinger threatens him with a break in correspondence if he were to report something confidential to Strasbourg. What an ugly insinuation! As if he were so reckless! To Martin Bucer, Kaspar Hedio, Petrus Dasypodius, Theobald Nigri, and others, he only sends news that is already circulating in public. He owes the people of Strasbourg many pieces of information about the Schmalkaldic War as well as about France, England, and Scotland. Accordingly, he also responds with correspondingly informative letters. But that he would share secrets with them that Bullinger entrusted to him, no decent person could claim! He has long known that some Confederates have a very bad reputation in Strasbourg. Only in letters to Dasypodius, who is also a Confederate, does he complain once or twice a year about the Five Places and their accomplices, but not without urging him to remain silent. Only in the last case, therefore, could he have made himself guilty. Bullinger writes that he knows that Myconius often writes to Bucer. That is true. But he cannot accept the accusation that he would transmit contents from Bullinger's letters to him! What is Bullinger thinking? Myconius also knows that there are Germans who are not well-disposed towards the Confederates. Recently, a young Swiss [...] from Strasbourg reported that there are people there who would be very happy about an attack by the Emperor on the Confederates. Should he reveal secret matters to such people? If Bullinger continues to consider him unreliable, he would prefer the correspondence to cease! May God improve their mutual relationship! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Strange that Bullinger writes nothing about the council, with which nothing good is intended. It is indeed almost a foregone conclusion that everyone must submit to the decisions made there. Myconius could report more about it, but it is already late, as he is writing after dinner against his habit. </p>

      <p>S. Indeed, I had a different opinion about Constance, but you have convinced me, and I will entrust the whole matter to the Lord, now that I understand how futile the dealings with them have been so far. However, I still wonder: If they wish to be part of the Empire, why have they refused peace for so long? Surely, it was so that such a small people could make a name for themselves among the Swabians and be called steadfast, as they are reputed to be. Those who came to the fair here are said to complain about the Five Places, because they sent a mandate to the Thurgauers not to assist the people of Constance, whatever necessity may arise, unless it is a fire: Then they may come with buckets without arms. A remarkable mandate, if they speak the truth, and contrary to the Swiss custom!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Furthermore, it has long been established that you are too devoted to the Five Places: I know from some of you, who once said in my presence that they would never allow the Zurichers to attempt anything armed against them; for after five unfortunate encounters, they see that fortune will never favor them; thus, it is necessary to act with them in such a way that friendship is maintained on both sides. But I say neither this nor that with the intention of disapproving of the advice (for neighbors, not to mention allies, ought to adhere most closely to each other), but moved by letters written here to a friend, I have spoken rather than remained silent. I rest, moreover, believe me, better, when you proclaim that there are both strong and Christian spirits among your people. We will pray to the Lord that He may graciously allow this to continue, indeed that He may nurture and increase what He has given to an immense degree for His glory. For I see that today there is a need for men of understanding. We are attacked on all sides; and how can it be possible for us to endure, except through such men, who have strength of spirit and knowledge of God and Christ. For we have already experienced for some time what calamities arise when such men are lacking. And indeed, the Lord is accustomed to rescue such men when He intends to oppress the people with calamities. Therefore, we must pray both more devoutly and more frequently henceforth for the pious and the brave, or we perish.</p>

      <p>There is nothing to say about alliances. If we remain alone, it is over for us, unless piety is increased in us. If we join others, it may be that it is likewise over. What then should be chosen? Surely, what is safer: For it is good to adhere to the Lord. But what if the others, especially your neighbors, make a pact with the French and you refuse? Will you not have them as enemies? Or while we reject all alliances, why not also our own, since it is so unequal? These are the reasons why I do not know what to say. But enough about this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>One thing pains me, that you threaten not to write anymore if I send any mysteries to Strasbourg, etc., as if I were so vain as to write what should not be written! Truly, you inflict a rather disgraceful stain on me. I write to Bucer and he in turn to me. I write to Hedio, to Dasypodius, to Theobald Nigri, etc., but about things that are now before our eyes. From Strasbourg, I have received most of what has been done throughout this war. What is happening in France, in England, in Scotland, is similarly from there. And I respond to them as is fitting. But that I write mysteries, which you entrust, no good person says! For I know how badly some Swiss are regarded there, and indeed I have experienced this for a long time. To Dasypodius, as a Swiss, I sometimes sent complaints about the Five Places and their accomplices, but in such a way that he should keep it to himself (and indeed I did this once or twice a year, no more!). In these, if I have sinned, I confess the sin. If something else were to be imputed, I would hardly bear it from those who told you! For you say you have it from elsewhere that I write frequently to Bucer. While I do not wish to deny this, I could not bear it if someone said I write what is discussed between you and me. What do you think? I also know Germans, and indeed those who can hardly favor us. A young Swiss wrote from Strasbourg these days: There are those there who rejoice more than they should when they hear that the Emperor is going to attack the Swiss. Would I then reveal what is done in secret among us to them? If I knew, therefore, that you considered me a man of bad faith, I would prefer your silence to a bad suspicion of me. But God grant better things for both of us.</p>

      <p>I am surprised that you are silent about the council. I hear everything is so badly arranged: What will be decided in Trent, the rest will have to abide by, it is now almost concluded. I would write more about this if there were more time. For this is written after dinner, contrary to my custom.</p>

      <p>Farewell, therefore, happily in Christ with Gwalther. Basel, November 6, 1547. Yours, O. M.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, most learned man, best minister of Christ, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
