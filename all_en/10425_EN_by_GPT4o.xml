    <p xml:id="regest1">Wants to use the journey of Ludwig von Diesbach to Zurich to urgently admonish Bullinger to advocate that in the upcoming elections, instead of the allegedly retiring mayor Diethelm Röist, Hans Rudolf Lavater or another "pious" man should be elected. There are rumors that in Zurich, some regret the victory of Philip of Hesse in Württemberg; probably for this reason, Bern received no communication about it from Zurich. Caution regarding von Diesbach is advisable. In Geneva, a priest named Louis Bernard laid down his vestments in the middle of the Pentecost mass and professed the evangelical faith. Haller wishes to receive the next printed part of Bullinger's commentary on the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians.</p>

      <p>S. Since the noble Ludwig von Diesbach, a man quite pious in our faith, who has a very pious wife, a Mettelinen, was about to travel to Zurich, I did not want him to ride into your city without my nonsense, especially for the reason that the day of electing your magistrate is now approaching, which urges us all the more strongly because we experience daily how important it is to have a pious magistrate.</p>
      <p>I therefore beseech you, as you are most aware of your affairs, to take the utmost care that a pious consul is appointed to the city. We hear that Röist is to be removed from office. You will ensure that either Lavater or someone else succeeds him, someone who has the cause of Christ more at heart than the favor and flattery of the Antronians, and who also proves to be a man not fearful, but steadfast. There is a rumor among us that some regret the victory in Württemberg from the bottom of their hearts, and so much so that the pious could not achieve that your people would announce new joys to our people. However, we want to remind you of this, you who love Christ with us and whom our city holds in the highest regard in this matter. You will not discuss anything with this messenger, except that you greet him kindly if he meets you: He is a neophyte.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in Geneva this Pentecost, when innumerable people were celebrating the Lord's Supper, a certain priest appeared openly, dressed in choir habit and almuce. As soon as he reached the table, he threw everything to the ground, shedding the old man before the church and presenting himself as captive to the gospel of the Lord, so that it became a miracle to all.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there is no news with us. You write, and if anything from the Corinthians is printed, have Christoph send it.</p>
      <p>June 6th, 9 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his beloved lord and brother.</p>
