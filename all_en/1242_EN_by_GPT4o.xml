      <p>I am most grateful to you for reassuring me about the letters sent to you. How true it is that these are evil days, the matter itself teaches us; but the Lord will also put an end to all this, so that we rightly congratulate those most illustrious and best men, whom the Lord takes away from here before the evils become completely overwhelming.</p>
      <p>It is uncertain why Philipp is hastening his return to his people; perhaps the judgment of the Lord is urging him. Some confidently assert that the Frenchman will send to the council, if the Pope is willing to submit to the authority of the council, and then if no profane business is to be decided there. I see that a few learned Germans are being sent with no benefit, but with great mockery.</p>
      <p>Let us knock on the ears of the Lord of Hosts with the most holy and constant prayers, so that He may govern everything in such a way that the most impious efforts of the wicked are frustrated, as they are truly worthy, and that we, trusting in Him, may never be put to shame. Amen.</p>
      <p>They write to me nothing new from Augsburg, except that some think the Emperor will not come from Augsburg anymore, and that the council of all things should be extended until it is seen whether His Imperial Majesty will indeed return to his will; then during the council an interregnum should occur and the Emperor should close his eyes, the clergy would have great things to fear, and there is concern about great unrest, especially since the Turk is making his move. May the Almighty, faithful God graciously help us, amen. Commend us to the Lord and farewell. April 12, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
