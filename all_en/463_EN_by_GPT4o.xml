      <p>I wrote to you the other day from Stein; I am doing so again now, but I have nothing special to report, except that I received a letter yesterday, in which it was indicated to me that when the young prince arrived in Ulm on February 27th, he was asked by many kind-hearted people to release and free Frechtum and his fellow prisoners, but with the condition that none of them should ever return to Ulm, and that they should also pay all the incurred costs. Then, on March 1st, the young prince moved to the Netherlands; they are to pay homage to him there; after that, he will come back up here again.</p>
      <p>We have received news that the Roman king has insisted with the Confederates that they should not tolerate the exiles from Constance as his majesty's enemies and rebels in any way. This was taken into account by the envoys in the decision, and another day was set for Mid-Lent. I would like you to inform me precisely (if you can) about the form of the king's request, and what you think will happen from your side, so that we can prepare ourselves in time accordingly. Well then: the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; he will perhaps show us a place where we can spend the short days of our lives. To him be praise and glory forever. My dear brother and sister, also the housewife, send you all their love, many greetings and good wishes. Praying for us.</p>
      <p>Greet all good gentlemen and friends.</p>
      <p>Given on the 13th of March in haste.</p>
      <p>Your willing Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
