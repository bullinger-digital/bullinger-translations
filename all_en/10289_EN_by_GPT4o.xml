    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks Bullinger for his literary assistance, especially for a not further specified "libellus". Desires the most recently printed parts of Vadian's work "Epitome trium terrae partium". Sees a possibility for money transfer to the Zurich students studying in Bourges through Lyon merchants and Melchior Volmar. Is concerned about many differences in liturgical practices and marriage legislation between Bern and Zurich, which provoke mockery from Catholic opponents, such as the kneeling of the Zurichers versus the standing of the Bernese during the Angelus bell at the Diet in Baden. Bern now wants to determine how its delegates at the Diet should behave; Haller asks for advice. Confusion in the clothing of the pastors in Bern: what is customary in Zurich? Leo Jud's appointment to Ulm; Zurich should not let him go. When is Bullinger coming to Bern?</p>

      <p>Greetings. You do not cease to adorn me with your benefits, indeed, and with gifts, with which God himself does not cease to educate us, dearest Heinrich, and through you to increase his knowledge in us. I have seen the booklet, but I am not yet satisfied with it. I saw in it what I had once barely extracted from Simler, to whom you had written in the vernacular. I still desire the remaining parts after the ninth quire in Vadian's work. If they have been printed, make sure that I have them at some point.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding your inquiry about how money should be sent to the students in Bourges: There are four from our city there, to whom money is sent through merchants to Lyon, to the merchants' agent Conrad Schlisselberg. He then ensures that it is delivered to our Melchior Volmar, who teaches Greek there and supports our boys.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I cannot trouble you again with what is so often thrown at us: your angelic salutation, the apostolic feast days, that you refer to the angelic salutation in your sermon, and what I consider the worst of all, that at the last assembly it was decreed with your consent that an adulterer should be punished for five days. Now you write back, perhaps regretting the decision or the plan, to our council, that it should be punished for only three days. Thus, the first begin to become the last, which I perpetually fear about us. Moreover, individual dedications have been abolished among us, as they are the seedbeds of almost all seditions and evils. But you tolerate them and even establish new ones. Your envoys at the Diet in Baden kneel at the angelic salutation, ours remain standing. The third group, that is, the Antronians and others, laugh at both: "Behold," they say, "how they agree in religion!" Later, our people are troubled by the disparity of rites, and because they are laughed at, they reproach us, asking why we do not allow these things as well, and everywhere they seek an opportunity to free themselves from the gospel and the magistrates' edicts. Indeed, it has come into question in the council how the delegates should behave. We will be called for a response, and you, when I wrote before, unless my memory fails me shamefully, did not respond to these matters. I know that the pious do not care about these things, but in the meantime, I do not know how to deal with hypocrites and the impious. Some argue that offense should be avoided with them, which they impose on us, how sinisterly we think of the divine virgin, but when we have knelt with them at the salutation, it is already removed, and they cite what Paul did and taught. Others argue that since they are blind, their blindness should not be cared for nor should we dissemble with them, but just as they do not care about our religion in the least, so we should not care about theirs in return. Be you the judge. You promise in all letters to write more, but you write very little. But I attribute this to your occupations.</p>
      <p>Finally, among our local pastors, there are those who dress either in a completely rustic manner or in vain and various colors. Besides the freedom they think they have in these matters, they use your people as a pretext, and when I reprimand them, they accuse me of establishing a new papism. Therefore, communicate with me briefly about the attire of your people.</p>
      <p>I hear that Leo is being called by the people of Ulm. I would not want our homeland to lose him, but I do not doubt that you will do whatever seems most beneficial for your church. I would still like to see a play; you understand me well. Dear friend, when is Bullinger coming to Bern for a walk? At the Greek calends; I have no more concern about it, I am happily quite secure forever!</p>
      <p>Farewell and always forgive my trifles. I always pour out my thoughts towards you, to whom I uniquely trust among all mortals, as much as one can trust a man.</p>
      <p>15th of September, year 33.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. Haller.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his beloved lord and brother.</p>
