    <p xml:id="regest1">Today, Johannes Haller preached, and not only devoutly, but brilliantly on [Mark 16:15]. Especially the scholars praised his sermon. This fortunate beginning gives hope for abundant fruits. Initially, [Wolfgang Musculus], this follower of Luther and Bucer, had scruples about Haller's appointment. However, he was sharply reprimanded by the mayors [Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser]. The Wittenbergers, Nurembergers, and others of this kind will be outraged by the introduction of Zwinglian doctrines. Yet, one is not obliged to the whims of men, but to the purity of the Gospel!</p>

      <p>Greetings. Today, Mr. Johannes Haller delivered a sermon that was not only devout but also brilliant, based on the nearly final words of Christ: "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature," which all good people, especially the learned, greatly praised. Since the first fruits have fallen so happily, I hope for abundant results in the future. One of our church ministers wanted to raise a scruple about his appointment. However, the mayors taught him with harsher words how piously and legitimately he was summoned, not only by letters but also by me in person. We therefore rightly restrained the man as a progeny of Lutheran dregs and Bucer. However, the Wittenbergers, Nurembergers, and others of this kind will shout that we are going to introduce Zwingli's doctrine, disrupt concord, etc. We know this indeed. We also know that we follow the purity of the gospel, not the whims of men.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Him, who is the only salvation. November 22, 1545. Yours, Georg Fr√∂lich (Laetus).</p>
      <p>To his incomparable master Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
