      <p>To the honorable lord and father, I have no doubt that you are eagerly awaiting the outcome of the French and Philippian negotiations with us. I would have gladly informed you earlier, had the matter not been so confused and uncertain, as it still is today, that no one among us can make a clear judgment.</p>
      <p>However, here is a summary: After the Spanish embassy arrived here in Chur again, they immediately requested a meeting of the league, which was denied by the three main leaders and other council members, with the explanation that since a meeting had already been granted and scheduled for the French, it would not be appropriate to knowingly hinder their proceedings. To this, the Spaniard cunningly remarked that he was quite satisfied with the given response, but requested that he be granted a separate meeting during the ongoing French meeting, as he had no intention of hindering anyone's proceedings and had no orders from his king to do so. However, when the council envoys departed, he stayed behind and secretly wrote letters to all the communities, against the common law, which were later shown to me, signed with his own hand, in which he complained bitterly that an open meeting had been denied to him.</p>
      <p>Thus, some communities were persuaded by a few; for the alliance and neighborhood of his king, who is a powerful prince, would be much more beneficial and profitable to the lands than the French union could be. Therefore, he requested that his proposal, along with the French one, be presented to the communities; then one would immediately see a significant, apparent difference and take the friendship of his king far more seriously.</p>
      <p>With these letters, he sent a large sum of money to most communities where he thought his influence would be strongest. Everyone was a guest for several weeks, whoever wanted to be.</p>
      <p>What was spent in secret cannot be known as well; but by the song, one knows the bird. The French lord was excellently hindered by the Freiburg proceedings, which he awaited, as the other grew stronger day by day.</p>
      <p>The priests have bitterly opposed the French from the pulpits; some have done it so crudely that they have been taken to court for their indiscreet words.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, those who supported the Philippian cause and took his money have been advised and warned to go idle, as they thought this would be significant to the common man. The poor peasants did not notice this practice, nor did many of the preachers, until they fell into it.</p>
      <p>I have long seen through this game, but did not dare to intervene openly, so as not to be considered partisan.</p>
      <p>Good advice does not always have place and space. In such divided governments, as you know yourself, it is difficult and troublesome to act, which is why I have often stood by the matter and doubted whether there is anyone wise enough to unravel all the entangled issues.</p>
      <p>I often wish I knew not where, as I am so tired of this business that I could not be more tired, and if I were not otherwise regarded by my gracious lords of the city of Zurich and you, the learned lords, I would be forced to seek advice by myself. For if it were to stand still, I would abandon all studies.</p>
      <p>It has now been three whole months that I can hardly come to any book, and even when I am alone, I am still pondering this and that, and there is no end to this confused life.</p>
      <p>But to return to the main point, it is all aimed at driving out the French and allowing the Spaniard to take root.</p>
      <p>For the Spaniard may well feel that he achieves nothing, as the old one is near; so if he must depart once, he would still leave the seed behind him, etc. It would take only a few months, and he would have free access.</p>
      <p>For this people is accustomed to the name, and it will not be done otherwise than it is; all the effort lies in informing the simple man that there is a bad practice behind it. For if one were to increase today, all lords would go idle, it would not last two months.</p>
      <p>Since those who have pressed for it in the communities are going idle, they daily send their letters and messages here to the Philippians, often coming themselves at night and departing again before daybreak: we have noticed the practice here in Chur so clearly that we must also fall into it, which then gives the citizens a great reason to hurry and turn to the French side.</p>
      <p>But it could not be done so quickly. The Spaniards have caused much division, and in the Upper League, the majority could not be won over to the French side.</p>
      <p>Those who were inclined towards the French have been drawn to him with unspeakable money; for where he promised 20 crowns, the other promised 40, and if the meeting had been held elsewhere than in Chur, it would not have passed without great unrest. However, since strong guards were kept day and night here in the city and the citizens were entirely united, the Philippian party did not dare to act. The Philippian envoy also made himself scarce and went to the Upper League to Thusis, where, as I hear, he causes much unrest, has opened four inns, and keeps many guests; promises captaincies and much loyalty, as one does with the French.</p>
      <p>The council members have been sitting on this matter for three days now. Many have opposed it; yet it has finally come to the point that they should sit together and deliberate in common, without distinction, and not each league act for itself, which was done so that the French have a unanimous majority in the Ten Jurisdictions and also a slight majority in the God's House; but if the Upper League had acted for itself, one could not have said that the common three leagues had agreed. Now, however, if one combines the votes in one community, the French outnumber the others.</p>
      <p>Thus it came to this point yesterday, and they sat together until night; but many envoys departed; they did not want to sit and help deliberate; those who were at the leagues, however, as I hear, were admonished in vain. - As I have come to write until now, around 9 o'clock, I hear that a considerable majority has been reached concerning the main points, to enter into union with the French; other matters will be dealt with in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>I will be very insistent that the religion be preserved. Once the French alliance is made, the Philippian can be dismissed more favorably and the communities better informed. Nunc prodeo exploratum omnia.</p>
      <p>Postscripta.</p>
      <p>I hear that today before noon, a majority of 13 has been reached to accept the French union. Those who abstained, said to be 17, have also been counted.</p>
      <p>What happens next, I will let you know by the first message. I write this in haste; therefore, forgive my clumsy writing.</p>
      <p>May God the Lord preserve your reverence along with yours in all good at all times. Given in Chur, the 15th of January, anno 1565. Your reverence's willing servant, Hans Schmid, pastor in Chur.</p>
      <p>Non relegi; nuncius festinavit.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
