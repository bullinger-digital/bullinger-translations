    <p xml:id="regest1">Pastor Jakob Fehr in Bischofszell is in distress and would like to be transferred to another parish through Bullinger, as his only other option would be to go to Württemberg; Theodor Bibliander and Peter [Schmid], a proofreader at Froschauer, will be able to provide information about Fehr, and they will regret that the church in their homeland is being abandoned by so many pastors. Wishes Bullinger steadfastness.</p>

      <p>Grace and mercy from God, our Father, and Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>I would not have been so presumptuous as to trouble you with my foolish letters, had not such a pressing occasion presented itself, dearest brother. For I received a letter on July 18 from Lord Jakob Fehr, a pious and learned brother, from Bischofszell, the content of which is as follows: After the greeting, he says, "I beseech the same" (he means my brotherly love) "towards me, that you may feel, and since matters of no small importance urge me to fulfill my duty, to inform our Heinrich Bullinger of this and to implore him in my name that, if you perhaps have any knowledge, you may assist with all your might, so that if any position is vacant or any blessing remains in your regions, you may arrange for me to be called there; otherwise, I plan to travel to Württemberg, and that soon. And although, as it is said, every land is a homeland to the brave, yet nothing is ever sweeter than the delights of one's own home. Consider these words spoken in reference to me. Therefore, most faithful father, do for me what you are convinced I would do for you; do not delay at all, I earnestly pray; for every delay in this matter is most harmful. Farewell." These are his words, from which, excellent brother, you yourself understand what needs to be done. I therefore earnestly beseech your charity, as deeply as possible, to assist this pious and learned brother in any way you can. There is no need for me to commend him to you much, as you will find sufficient testimony about him from Theodor Bibliander and Peter, the proofreader at Froschauer; but I do not doubt that they will receive this matter with great sorrow when they hear that the church in their homeland is being deprived of such a pastor. For he is well-regarded by both the council and his entire church. I have replied to that good brother and strongly encouraged him not to abandon the sheep entrusted to his faith. Therefore, I ask to receive your opinion through the present messenger; or if you prefer, respond to him either through yourself or through Theodor, and I will duly present the letters to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, always stronger than your enemies and a bronze wall. But also pardon my rusticity. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given on July 21, in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Your ever dutiful</p>
      <p>Johannes Schlegel in</p>
      <p>Elgg.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed lord and dearest brother in Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church in Zurich.</p>
