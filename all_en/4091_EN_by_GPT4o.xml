      <p>Greetings. You continue, indeed, in your usual manner to bind me to you more and more, as I have long since, however small I may be, become yours, my venerable and more than dearest Bullinger. And would that at last some opportunity, long wished for with impatient prayers, might shine upon me, by whose benefit I might be allowed to demonstrate my gratitude to you according to the sentiment of my heart. But in the meantime, while I await this, I humbly substitute the Father of lights Himself, from whom every good and perfect gift descends from above, to pour out all good fortunes upon you and all yours from the inexhaustible horn of His abundance, in Christ Jesus. I also pray with all my heart that, just as you have undertaken to expound and inculcate the words of the most afflicted prophet Jeremiah in this our most deplorable age, and have even sent me a printed copy, a truly welcome gift to me, so you may bring about, both among your own people and all others to whom your labor is so greatly directed, what he in vain attempted to persuade his own people with unspeakable groaning and sorrow of his spirit, namely repentance and a serious conversion to the Lord, swiftly and most successfully. I am greatly surprised about Samuel Witenbach, that he did not explain to you another and more important reason why I wished to renounce my ministry at Biel, which I briefly touched upon in a previous letter to you, about which, however, I will perhaps soon discuss everything with you. Pray diligently to the Lord for me, that He may graciously direct all my plans and the remaining course of my life, which will be very short indeed, to the glory of His name with His Spirit as my guide. Farewell eternally with yours. September 26, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>The little letter, which you receive here, I thought had been delivered to you a few days ago, but I received it again yesterday from the one who had changed his plan to travel there. A good citizen of Constance, named Peter Kinzer, whom our Mangold knows well, wrote yesterday in this manner among other things: "There are reports from Friday last from Lyon, that after the death of the current pope, the oldest, most powerful, and richest citizens of Rome, up to 3000, enlightened and moved by God, have expelled all the cardinals from Rome, and have also burned the pope's decrees and laws along with the house in which they were located to ashes." Even if these things are not true, they are still very pleasing and delightful to hear. However, what makes me doubt their truth is that just the day before yesterday, a merchant from St. Gallen, Johannes Liner, who came here directly from Lyon, did not mention any of this to me, although he told many things about the new king of France's new tyranny against the faithful of Christ and other such topics. To the man of incomparable learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed and dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
