      <p>Greetings. Yesterday I wrote to our people.</p>
      <p>Today it is reported here that great disturbances have been stirred up in Naples in the name of religion. For when the inquisition was introduced there and the cruelty of those men was great, the common people rose up against the Spaniards and forced the Spanish garrison into the citadel, having killed some; an army is expected from Spain to suppress the Lutherans. - Yesterday I wrote something about this French alliance.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I have put forward my opinion in this summary, which I have not yet shared with anyone; however, I await your judgment.</p>
      <p>The Rhaetians can enter into no alliance that is contrary to the freedom of the homeland and the church. Therefore, particular precautions must be taken, the first of which will be that the Rhaetians do not join their opinion with those people who are also sought for this alliance but are the most hostile enemies of our religion, who now harshly attack the King of the French, saying that he has become the patron of heretics from the most Christian. But suppose these men relent from their complaint, yet they will bind themselves to the king with those terms by which they not obscurely attack our religion, which they desire to overthrow. What else is the desire to subscribe to their opinion now than to declare war on our religion voluntarily? Moreover, it is not at all glorious for the Rhaetians to subject themselves to the decrees of others as if they were servants. Therefore, our people must be advised that if they wish to renew this alliance at all, they should do so separately and on their own, only with the common consent of the entire Rhaetian republic intervening. This will be the first precaution, the next being that this alliance binds the Rhaetians only as long as no violence is done to our people in the name of religion through France and that the public peace, which allows impunity to the allies of religion, is kept inviolate by the king.</p>
      <p>Unless this point is clearly expressed, the ministers who preach the gospel in Rhaetia will oppose this French alliance by all means.</p>
      <p>The other points of the alliance will be easily judged by Christian prudence, which should be of such a kind as to be suited to defending the borders of the kingdom, not expanding them, and to repelling, not inflicting, injuries.</p>
