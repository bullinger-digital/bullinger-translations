    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] In Konstanz, a divorce process is currently being conducted between two spouses who possess citizenship. While the husband [Jakob Kundigmann] justifies his desire for divorce by stating that his wife [Elsbeth Huber] has run away from him, she claims that her husband has not had any sexual intercourse with her in the past eight years, and she is therefore still virginal as at the beginning of their marriage. However, the husband contradicted this and demanded that the wife be examined by experts regarding her virginity, as is customary in a court proceeding. He also emphasized that if the truth could not be brought to light in this way, he would be willing to prove the truth with his own physical condition.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The wife agreed to an examination but obligated the court that if her virginity was proven, she would not have to provide any further evidence and her marriage would be legally recognized as dissolved. Subsequently, the mayor and council of the city of Konstanz ordered the corresponding examination by midwives, which, however, revealed that the woman was by no means virginal. She was then imprisoned and confronted with the question of who had taken her virginity, especially since she had claimed her husband's impotence in court. Without prior torture, she confessed to having slept indecently with another man [...] (whose name she mentioned). This man, and not her impotent husband, had taken her virginity. Her husband, unlike that man, had not been able to perform a sexual act but had only made futile attempts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Since she continued to claim her husband's impotence, he was also arrested and questioned about this without prior torture. However, he steadfastly asserted that he had had sexual intercourse with his wife. Nevertheless, he admitted that he had not had sexual intercourse with her for half a year before her departure, but this was not due to him, but to her dismissive and loveless behavior.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In a renewed interrogation of the woman, conducted with the application of light torture, she again asserted that her husband was impotent and, apart from some futile attempts, which he had even completely refrained from for two years, he could not have sexual intercourse, unlike the other man.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Since neither of the spouses makes any concessions to the other but insists on their account, some conclude that the woman, in view of her husband's impotence, did not break the marriage but merely committed fornication. Therefore, she should not be divorced from her husband as an adulteress, but solely because, due to her husband's incapacity, a marriage between the two never existed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Others, however, are of the opinion that the marriage is legitimate because of the marriage promise and the subsequent married life conducted with mutual consent. In this context, the questions of whether the man is actually impotent or whether the two spouses have had sexual intercourse do not matter, especially since the woman did not complain about her husband's impotence to the authorities for a long time. Moreover, given the adultery committed by his wife, it is inappropriate to pursue the man's potency.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The council and the mayors of Konstanz are informing Bullinger of the entire matter because there are differing opinions on the reason to be cited for this divorce. Bullinger is requested to thoroughly discuss the case with his colleagues and other scholars and to communicate his recommendation in written form through this messenger [...] or otherwise as soon as possible, to enable the people of Konstanz to make a just judgment. They will be grateful to Bullinger for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] [P.S.:] Both spouses are free again.</p>

      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Heinrich Bullinger, leader (Antistes) in the word of God in Zurich, our particularly dear and good friend, our friendly service ahead! Honorable, well-learned, particularly dear and good friend, there is a legal matter before us between two people who are our citizens, regarding the divorce they both desire: The man, because the woman has run away from him; she, because the man, in the eight years they have lived together, has never engaged in marital relations with her, and she is still a virgin, as she was at the beginning of their engagement. The woman's statement, however, the man did not admit as the legal proceedings went on, and he requested an investigation of the truth, that the woman should be examined by knowledgeable people (as is customary and usual in court) to see if she is a virgin or not. And if the truth could not be established in this way, he offered to bring forth other evidence that he could obtain, or to testify to the truth with his own body, as is appropriate according to the law.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now, whether she (the woman) should be examined, she has submitted to our decision, but with the condition that if she is found to be a virgin upon examination, then other evidence would be unnecessary, and she should be divorced from him, etc. Based on this statement, we have decided with judgment that the woman should be examined regarding her virginity. The midwives examined her and found that she is not a virgin, but a woman like any other woman. From this, we are compelled to imprison her and ask who took her virginity, since she claimed in court that her husband is not a man. Thus, she freely, without prior torture, confessed that during the marriage she had engaged in acts of unchastity with another man (whom she also named). This man took her virginity and not her husband, because he is not a man. He never properly performed the marital acts with her, as the other man did, but often attempted to handle her, yet never managed to achieve anything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As she persisted in her claim, we also imprisoned the man and (without torture) asked if he is a man; likewise, if he had engaged in marital acts with his wife. To this, he said yes, he is a man and had engaged in marital acts with her, as a man should do with a woman. However, he admitted that for half a year before she ran away from him, he had not engaged in such acts with her. But the fault was not with him, but with her, as she did not want to show him any affection or love.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>On the other hand, the woman says and insists, although she was asked about this with torture (though not with great torture), that the man is not a man, and did not engage in such acts with her as the other man did, but often attempted to handle her, yet never managed to achieve anything. Moreover, for two years he also refrained from such attempts against her.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Since neither party will admit the other's claims, but each insists on their own account, and then it is considered by some that if the man is not a man, then the woman did not break the marriage, but merely committed fornication, she should not be divorced from him as an adulteress, but because he is not a man and therefore no marriage ever existed between them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Some believe that because of the marriage promise and the subsequent cohabitation between the two, a marriage exists, whether the man is a man or not, or whether he engaged in marital acts with her or not; moreover, the woman never complained about her husband's impotence to the authorities for a long time. Furthermore, it is unnecessary and inappropriate to examine the man's manhood, especially because of the woman's adultery.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Since there is thus a disagreement about the reason why these spouses should be divorced, we have decided to write to you about the matter. We ask you, together with your fellow servants in the word of God and other learned men, to thoroughly consider this matter, how to proceed and what judgment to give, and to report your advice to us in writing through this messenger or (if that is not possible now) later, but as soon as possible, so that we can judge more correctly in this matter, as we are obliged to you and can show you friendship, willing to be. Dated July 2, 1547, etc.</p>

      <p>We have released both people from imprisonment again.</p>
