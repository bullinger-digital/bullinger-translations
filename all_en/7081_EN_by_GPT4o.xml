    <p xml:id="regest1">Dathenus, having returned to Heidelberg from the Netherlands under great life-threatening danger, reports on the situation there. After the iconoclastic riots of August 1566, ambiguous peace articles were proposed and accepted city by city, which promised religious freedom to appease the people until the Spanish king and the provincial estates decided otherwise. However, the regent began to impose protective troops on the cities to suppress the Protestants. Allied nobles promised their support to the threatened Protestants in exchange for money; thus, troops allegedly assembled in Germany by William of Orange and Louis of Nassau were to be financed. However, they behaved deceitfully towards the Protestants; Dathenus does not wish to say more about the treachery of the nobles. In any case, religious freedom and the old privileges of the provinces are being curtailed, trade is at a standstill, craftsmen are fleeing; the cities are devastated, and numerous good citizens and subjects are being executed as insurgents and rebels. The people were betrayed by their defenders, who had incited them to take up arms. Only Hendrik van Brederode – whom Dathenus praises emphatically – has remained steadfast; with some support, he could still achieve great things. In Flanders and Hainaut, sermons have been stopped; in Antwerp, Zeeland, Holland, and Gelderland, preaching continued until Easter – how it is now, Dathenus does not know. Valenciennes was captured; the conquerors are reportedly raging against the citizens. Refugees are flocking to England and East Frisia – where they are received humanely – as well as to the Duchy of Cleves.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>When I finally returned home from the Netherlands, not without great danger to my life, and learned that a messenger was ready to go directly to Zurich, I could not refrain from writing something to you, most honorable and upright man, most esteemed father and fellow minister, and briefly explaining to you the mournful state of our Netherlands. So, to say much in few words, receive this.</p>
      <p>When last August, after the destruction of idols and altars, some very ambiguous articles of peace and concord were proposed and accepted city by city to pacify the people, which seemed to grant religious freedom until the King of Spain, having convened the provincial estates, decided otherwise, and in this way the people were appeased, the regent began to impose garrison troops on the citizens almost city by city and to pave the way for oppressing those who professed the Gospel.</p>
      <p>Hence it happened that the allied nobles also thought of just defense, and since they were weaker, they solicited the churches for money, promising them all their efforts, etc. The churches, moreover, well aware that they were in the greatest danger (for according to that Constance axiom they knew no faith was to be kept with them), promised and counted out several thousand, with which foreign aid could be called in to oppose unjust tyranny. The Prince of Orange received those funds, as did Count Louis of Nassau, who said they had some forces ready in Germany, and they deceived the wretched people with some hope for so long until the matter itself finally showed that they had not dealt sincerely but treacherously with us.</p>
      <p>I could here recount many true things about the deceitful schemes and arts of the leading men, but I almost shudder every time I recall their treachery, who, without any confusion and bloodshed, without any loss of their dignities and goods, could have saved both their country and the freedom of religion, if they had wished. Now indeed the freedom of religion lies oppressed, the ancient privileges of the provinces perish, merchants' negotiations cease, craftsmen and artisans seek safety in flight, and cities once very populous are rendered vast and desolate, good citizens and subjects are captured in droves for punishment as seditious and rebellious, although they have always been the most faithful subjects to the king and still continue to be. But who could sufficiently depict the sad and miserable face of the Netherlands? The people are betrayed by those who themselves were the authors of the defense and incited them to arms. However, they will receive their reward from the Lord. Only Lord Brederode still stands firm and conducts himself steadfastly, a distinguished man endowed with a truly heroic spirit. I wish others would not also solicit him to defection, which I greatly fear will happen. The rest left him three days before Easter in Amsterdam still with an unbroken and steadfast spirit, whether he has since defected I do not know.</p>
      <p>I hope God, the best and greatest, will confirm and govern him with His Spirit, for although the man's life is still less reformed, he is nevertheless sincere and candid, he accepts admonishers, and he diligently strives and labors to be pious. Therefore, he could achieve something great if he were helped with a small subsidy, things are not yet so desperate, how easily could help be provided if those whose nearest wall is burning would diligently think of helping their neighbors. In all of Flanders and Hainaut, sermons have long been interrupted. In Antwerp, Zeeland, Holland, and Gelderland, they were still held during the Easter holidays, whether they have now been interrupted, I do not know. Valenciennes was captured after a long siege and assault, with the citizens dissenting among themselves, without any conditions. Ten banners of soldiers entered, whom I hear are raging most cruelly against the citizens, etc.</p>
      <p>You have briefly, most excellent man, the plainly tragic state of the Netherlands, which I have therefore described a little more fully, so that you may commend the scattered churches to God all the more fervently. Do not hesitate to convey my greetings to the most honorable men and fellow ministers Lord Walter, Wolf, Simler, Lavater, Haller, and Bullinger's son, and to all other friends, to whom I will write when I have the opportunity, which I cannot do now with the messenger hurrying. Most hastily and with a very sorrowful mind in Heidelberg, April 17, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Petrus Dathenus.</p>
      <p>England, Frisia, and the Duchy of Cleves are abundant with refugees, and in England and Frisia, foreigners are received humanely.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and upright man Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Church of Christ, most esteemed lord and fellow minister. In Zurich.</p>
