    <p xml:id="regest1">Can only now read Bullinger's [„De origine erroris“] after the book has been bound. Praises his [introduction to the Latin Bible], but regrets the use of Münster's translation [of the Old Testament]; it would have cost him little effort to improve its poor Latin. Urges to take care of concord and joins Myconius's suggestion to take action against Schwenckfeld. He cares a lot about Rudolf [Gwalther].</p>

      <p>Greetings. The reason why we have not yet read the previous booklet, I believe, Myconius has explained. For what was possessed undivided, before it was bound, we did not believe could be read. I do not remember it being published before. Now it is bound, now it is in our hands; we will see what you say.</p>
      <p>I immediately reread this latter one, as it was presented with your most loving letters, and I carefully noted your judgments on the entire writing. I praise your diligence and zeal for the church. Münster's diligence pleased me, but his counsel never did. He could have rendered a thousand places better with a slight change or transposition of a single word, indeed with my help, as I have heard almost the entire Bible from him, as he rendered it. And I wonder at you, why you wanted to publish this translation, which, if I had no more than three months free, I could render three times better. I would not detract from the meaning (although there are certainly very many places where you cannot know what the meaning is), only the diction itself, which is semi-Latin-German-Greek-Hebrew, I would make Latin of one kind as much as possible.</p>
      <p>We will see about the place that is read in your book about the sacrament. I earnestly pray you to look towards the public concord of the churches, not our concord with Bucer and Luther. What Myconius writes to you about Schwenckfeld, I ask you to take care of diligently and not to neglect the greatest inconvenience to the church.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. I truly love you all in the Lord. May the Lord Jesus Christ preserve us innocently and holy. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your Grynäus.</p>
      <p>I love Rudolf.</p>
      <p>To his lord Bullinger, his dearest brother and friend. In Zurich.</p>
