    <p xml:id="regest1">The unfortunate Ulrich Eckstein?, recommended by Bullinger, has been received in Konstanz. Zwick thanks for the kindness shown during his recent visit to ZÃ¼rich. He will immediately forward news about the Turkish War when it arrives, but at the moment he has nothing other than what Wilhelm von Zell has sent him. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace through Christ.</p>
      <p>We have taken the unfortunate man you recommended into our care. We hope he will be better soon. How can I express enough thanks for your kindness towards me and for all those who treated me so generously when I was recently with you. I wish I had the opportunity to return the favor. In the meantime, since I cannot achieve what I desire, I proclaim to all good people that your humanity is worthy of the highest praise.</p>
      <p>Before leaving, I promised to write to you if any news from the Turkish War reached us, and I will not neglect this matter. But we have heard nothing so far except what Wilhelm von Zell sent us, as you can see here. Otherwise, we have heard nothing at all.</p>
      <p>Please convey my greetings a hundred times to all the brothers, especially to my brother and Father Pellican, then to Theodor, Leo, Karlstadt, and all the guests.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, a friend like an incomparable brother.</p>
