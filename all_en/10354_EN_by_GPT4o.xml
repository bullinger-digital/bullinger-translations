    <p xml:id="regest1">Did not write so bitterly about the Zurichers as Bullinger portrays in his letter. However, he has never been as desperate because of them as after their response to the people of Basel. How could it happen that the Zurich delegates remained silent, even though it was agreed during Jakob Meyer's visit that they would discuss reconciliation with the people of Basel and Bern at the Diet on January 15, 1534? The people of Bern are holding back only because they fear rejection. The Five Places are trying to prevent unity between Bern and Zurich to have a free hand against Bern, - as a learned acquaintance also wrote recently. It's a pity that Bullinger is so reluctant to believe Myconius's fears. Therefore, he should now know that even a Zurich councilor friendly to the Reformation declared to Jakob Meyer? that the Zurichers, who have already recorded five defeats against the Inner Swiss in the course of history, would never go to war against them again. Nothing good can be hoped for from the current council, only from God, who will protect His word. Many regret that there is no longer a "Secret Council" in Zurich. Even if the Zurich Diet delegates were instructed to receive the offer from the people of Basel and Bern kindly, that is not enough as long as they themselves said nothing. Bullinger should admonish and comfort even more strongly. Rumors of a French campaign against the Confederates, which is unlikely due to the visit of Philip of Hesse to Francis I.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I do not have a copy of the last letter I sent to you, which is why I doubt if I wrote so bitterly as you say. I know that I wrote that our people have never been as desperate about you as after reading and hearing your response. They expected something very different after sending such an honorable delegation to you. Among some, there was nothing more certain than that it would happen, which is why that great man was sent in every way, although some doubted for no other reason than that you have such a torn council.</p>
      <p>For what good could be expected from Clodius and the Clodians, when it is certain to know what they would ultimately gain from this concord? If what was reported had been pleasing, how could it be that you remained silent after the meeting? Even if not to ask, it would have been fitting to give a chance for reconciliation to speak with you, which you too will not deny. I think our people have worked hard enough. I see the Bernese are afraid if they start something themselves, who are thought to have been harmed, they will receive a response that increases discord rather than removes it. But I seem to see what the matter is. A great and learned man wrote a few days ago, from whom I could understand how much it would hurt those impious ones if concord were reached. For the effort of the Immontani is this, that after they see it is more difficult to draw you away, especially now, from your path, to hold and delay, lest if they institute anything against the Bernese and even us, you would be there to help. If concord were made, the hope of the impious would perish. Those who seem good among you agree, allow themselves to be led, but they will finally feel where it leads, unless God strongly prevents it. While I write these things and the like in faithful speech, you do not believe me, although I have not written even a jot of which I was not more than certain. But what, after the Bernese have suffered what the Zurichers and Baslers? Then it will be over in the Helvetians concerning the gospel and thus then finally provided for us. That good man, whom I just mentioned, is grieved, as I am grieved, that you do not want the friendship of those who have the same God and Christ, the same word, the same ceremonies with you. You fear and revere those who have stripped you of almost all goods. I say frankly, those who delay this concord, indeed who are the cause that you do not apply all your effort to accomplish it, should by no means be numbered among pious men. For more pleasing to them is either an impious one, whom a fearful one follows, or an insolent affection, which desires to be asked rather than to ask, than that God of peace and concord. But what I emphasize about perpetual fear, because perhaps it moves you, listen to what reason it has. I know from your noble senators in piety, who spoke with a good man in these words, while asking what end of your affairs he expected: "It is certain," he said, "that we Zurichers have already met with those Pagans five times and always unsuccessfully, whence such a spirit is conceived in both the old and the men and the youth that it will not be that we can ever meet with them successfully in the future. Hence the horror, whenever even a word about warring with them arises. Therefore, I do not think it will be that we will enter into war with them in the future forever, whatever may happen." Indicate what this means. While I hear such things from good men, what hope, do you think, can I conceive about you? Although it is not as you write, no letters can drive me from despairing about you. For even if there is no hope at all from your council, while it is such, yet how could I not hope that God, the protector of His word, is not only with us but everywhere? Besides, I hear there is already good seed both in the city and in the countryside, as I also indicated in the last letters. Those who care about your affairs complain that you lack a council that holds what it handles and to which everything can be safely entrusted. I know those who would sometimes share plans with us, how they would benefit, unless what we have already said were lacking. Hence without a doubt, something could finally happen for the common use, but in this way, while something is entrusted, it soon flows to the enemies, which is most certain to have happened not so long ago.</p>
      <p>What you write about your people, that they entrusted the delegates, after being dismissed from Baden, to faithfully receive if anything were offered, our people also entrusted the same, but to what end, while you remained silent? But enough about these things.</p>
      <p>What remains, you write, exhort, urge, console, as you have done so far, and do so more abundantly in the future. For I ask this from the heart.</p>
      <p>Do not overlook this: It is certain that a Frenchman is preparing an army against the Confederates (die Eidgenossen), but whether against the pious or the impious is uncertain. There is hope that he will attempt nothing against us, because the Duke of Hesse is with him today, whence the people of Strasbourg expect him every day. What it is, God knows. I wish us all to be as commendable as possible to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 12, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
