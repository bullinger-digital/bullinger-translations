      <p> Greetings. I am expecting a letter from you, most esteemed lord and godfather, especially to know whether you have received the ones I sent to you not long ago in the name of the elder Zehender; for I am anxious about this matter until I understand whether you have received them or not. I had a few other things to mention; since I have already included them in the letters written to our Gwalther, there is no need to repeat the same in yours, as I know everything is shared among you. However, I wanted to write to you as well, so that you could relieve me of my concern and I would not neglect my duty. I recently wrote about Gentilis' demise. We hear that some people are speaking ill of our church because of this event, who, if they had burned their own heretics, would not have needed to exhume and cremate them after death. We ask you to, whenever the opportunity arises, defend our magistrates, our church, and this action. Farewell. All of ours greet you, especially Consul Steiger, Diesbach, the treasurers, the Zehenders, as well as my father-in-law, mother, and wife. </p>
      <p> Bern, 23rd of September, 1566. </p>
      <p> Yours as always, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, my lord and godfather, whom I honor with the utmost respect. </p>
