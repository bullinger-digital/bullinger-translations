      <p>Greetings. I am compelled once again to trouble your fatherhood.</p>
      <p>There are various disputes among us regarding the degrees of consanguinity, and since many in the Confederation enter into marriages in the third degree, a great many are offended by this. Our synod, recently attended by many Italian brothers, learned men, has thus decreed (I will append the words): "We consider that the magistrate, if he forbids marriage to be contracted in the third degree, should be obeyed for the sake of propriety; however, if such a marriage has been contracted and carnal union has intervened, we will not be the authors to dissolve it." I agree with this opinion; however, there are those who are offended by this synod's decree, among whom is Mr. Philipp, our colleague; he thinks that this entire matter should be left to the magistrate, who should have the authority to annul a marriage contracted in the third degree, even if carnal union has intervened. I, however, although I do not approve of the act, cannot be the author to dissolve such a marriage again. Certainly, this matter torments me greatly, and it also troubles others.</p>
      <p>Please, in your leisure, inform us of what is done in your matrimonial court; meanwhile, if the synod's opinion satisfies you, we would also like you to enlighten us. This same matter will soon, I believe, be referred to the council of the Three Leagues.</p>
      <p>The most illustrious Mr. Friedrich von Salis sends you his greetings; he refrains from writing presently, as he had recently written to Francis the Greek by nationality, a man of outstanding learning. Those who are in power in Valtellina seem to act more leniently, which is why the senate of the Three Leagues has reaffirmed the acts of the Davosian assembly; but it has also legislated that no place or lodging be given to monks or papal priests who are newcomers in Valtellina; furthermore, that the Spanish monk, to whom lodging was given by that Quadriis (archpriest, as I have meanwhile heard), be expelled from the borders or subjected to questioning, unless he complies, and that he returns the noble sons he arranged to be taken away. Furthermore, that it should not be free for the nobles in Valtellina to send clandestine missions beyond the walls, etc. These and other matters.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new besides this.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, with all your people, as happily as possible.</p>
      <p>Chur, May 29, 1559.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and most esteemed patron.</p>
