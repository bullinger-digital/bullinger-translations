      <p>Greetings. We have received and read your letter, honorable and beloved brother in the Lord, in which you extensively, learnedly, and diligently explain the entire journey you undertook for the sake of the prisoners of Jesus Christ in France. We give you immense thanks for this labor undertaken for our benefit.</p>
      <p>May Christ the Lord grant that the mission of the princes achieves a more favorable outcome than that of our own. Meanwhile, we are consoled by the account of Philo, the envoy to Emperor Caius, who, after being dismissed with insult, is said to have told his sorrowful companions: We must be of good courage, for Caius is angry with us, because divine aid is sure to be present when human help fails. We earnestly pray to the Lord, who is faithful in His promises, that this may also happen to us and to our brothers in France who are in peril for the sake of the Gospel. You spend the greater part of your letter explaining in detail the confession you presented at Worms on behalf of the French churches, why you presented it, and finally, why you sought the colloquy, which seems to us all to be something that should be earnestly sought from them, especially since this seems to be the only way to achieve the unity that all the pious desire, to remove the grave offenses from the churches of God, and to restore peace at least to the exiled churches, which are miserably afflicted and harassed because of our dissension. However, we cannot respond to the colloquy at present.</p>
      <p>If, however, any colloquy is legitimately called by the princes in the future, and its place, time, and manner are certain, then we think it should be discussed and decided upon by our churches in common and at the appropriate time, what should be done and what seems useful and salutary for our churches, lest while we seek to enter into concord with others, we ourselves become divided, or lest we commit the churches entrusted to our faith to internecine war among themselves. It should be ensured above all that we agree among ourselves, lest when we descend into the arena with adversaries, we turn our weapons against our own vitals, and the same thing happens to us that we now lament happened to those who were in colloquy at Worms. For they preferred to contend among themselves rather than to attack the common papist enemies with united forces. Thus they provided joy and a most delightful triumph to the enemies, but grief and great disgrace to themselves and their fellow ministers, and a most serious scandal to all the weak.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, we do not shun the light and the meeting, nor do we distrust the good cause, which we see the Lord our God has defended so strongly against the most cunning for so many years, even through simple men. We are therefore ready, according to the apostle's command, to give an account to everyone of the faith that is in us. Nor do we shrink from holy concord with those who confess the same Christ with us, whether they be Saxons or Swabians. For Christ has united us all into one body and adorned us with His most sacred name, and He requires nothing more earnestly from us than mutual love and holy concord. Meanwhile, we do not seek just any concord, but a religious, moderate one, which does not conflict with the confessed sincere truth, nor introduces any obscurity or doubt into the manifest light and clear doctrine, which for its sincerity is common and pleasing to all the pious, and also long-lasting and stable, which does not sow new seeds of dissension.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will not take it amiss if we explain here what holds us back and makes us anxious, why we believe it is more difficult for the otherwise salutary business of concord to progress expeditiously and happily through a colloquy. However, these things should not be taken by anyone as if we are irreconcilably at odds with the brothers who follow the Augsburg Confession, with whom we have not yet been able to agree on some points, or that we pursue them and their churches with hatred and condemn them more hatefully, or that we shun all colloquy. We have often testified how much we grieve over this unhappy dissension, and how much we value those brothers of ours outside of this controversy, although some of them disdain to consider us as brothers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, what we mention here pertains mainly to the fact that we fear, not without great and many reasons, that colloquies will be instituted with minimal fruit, as they seem hardly able to achieve the end they ought to reach, and we wish with all our heart to avoid by all means that anything is done in excessive zeal for agreement that we may later regret, especially when the best people from England, France, Italy, and other nations enlightened by the light of truth begin to be indignant and disagree with us.</p>
      <p>We are certainly not yet persuaded that we will reach concord through colloquies, or that a colloquy with these people is the only way to depart from discord, unless perhaps, before we come to a colloquy, we have decided to simply subscribe to the Augsburg Confession, I mean the confession presented to the emperor and all the estates of the empire in the year of our Lord 1530 at the public imperial diet, and repeated and offered to the Council of Trent in recent years. Many colloquies have been held since that confession was published, in all of which more consideration was given to it than to the holy Gospel of Jesus Christ itself, so that whoever does not acknowledge and receive it in all things, although he fully and sincerely professes the evangelical faith and apostolic doctrine, is still not considered to have acknowledged and received sound doctrine. Hence we have no small reason to fear that even if we come to a colloquy, our effort and expense will be in vain unless we subscribe to the Augsburg Confession in all things and above all.</p>
      <p>We do not bring this up because we utterly reject the Augsburg Confession, but because, since there are so many dispersed churches of Christ throughout the world, which in some respects think more simply and purely than what is found to be handed down or professed in it (as the times were when it was published), these people nevertheless continue to impose and prescribe it to everyone as the only and most perfect rule of faith, which unless one follows in all things, he is deemed unworthy of the fellowship of the body of Christ.</p>
      <p>Indeed, as they have always shown themselves very difficult to engage in colloquies, so many of them do not seem to aim at friendly and peaceful discussion, and then to allow room for truth without prejudice, but rather that they may always seem to have won, and that we may be drawn from the clear to the obscure, from the certain to the doubtful, from the articulate to the tangled, and thus from our opinion to theirs. For they boast too insolently that their doctrine alone is pure, and therefore will triumph against the Schwermer and the gates of hell.</p>
      <p>This also pertains to the fact that after so many years and so much light of truth, and after the doctrines have been discussed with such faith and diligence, they have never deigned to change a word of their matters or to express them more conveniently, let alone to acknowledge and lay aside some errors. To which they add that they are unwilling to yield even a hair to us, or to give even a little.</p>
      <p>Nor do they claim to be able or willing to deal with the Schwermer in any other way. Certainly, twenty years ago, the ministers of the Swiss churches composed a confession of their faith at the synod of Basel: which was finally recited before all the Swiss churches and was unanimously acknowledged and approved.</p>
      <p>The same was presented by Bucer and Capito, who also approved it, to Luther and his fellow ministers at a colloquy, and it was not condemned or rejected. But it was meanwhile demanded that we approve the Augsburg Confession, so that it might be known from this that we sincerely felt what we had professed in writing in the confession. At that time, concord was sought at various diets and colloquies, and indeed with great expenses and labors, Bucer continually promising a certain and firm agreement: but since the Swiss churches neither wanted nor could subscribe to the Augsburg Confession, the whole matter, which had been handled with great hope for so long, did not end in ashes, as the saying goes, but erupted into a fire more intense than ever before that amicable pacification. For Luther shortly after poured out that German book, called the Brief Confession, against us, in which he attributes to us so many monstrous heresies and heretics, and unloads so many cartloads of devils upon us, delivering both us and the holy churches of Christ to the devil. Moreover, we held a colloquy in recent years at Zurich with Calvin and Farel, most esteemed lords and dearest brothers. A consensus was drawn up.</p>
      <p>This matter aroused Westphal, who soon drew almost all the pastors of the Baltic Sea region into the alliance of war, who all poured out a remarkable abundance of confessions, all of them looking to that Augsburg one. What is more, all these people were offended by nothing more than that Calvin wanted to join his doctrine with that of the Augsburg Confession, as if they were not at all different. For it did not satisfy these people that he modestly confessed to receiving the Augsburg Confession, but with a sound understanding or sense. What then do these people seem to seek other than that, having once passed over the doctrine of our churches and our way of speaking, we simply receive the Augsburg Confession, along with the Apology? And if ever a colloquy is to be held with the Saxons for the sake of restoring concord, without a doubt those same importunate people, who now also, as you mention, have armed the King of Denmark and the Elector of Saxony against Philip, will have neither the last parts in it nor the smallest number of votes. From which we also gather that in that colloquy, which seems so much to be desired, the authority of Philip, a man otherwise learned, pious, and not unjust to us and all the pious, will not be of much avail. Which also in the Worms colloquy could do no more than that these people, withdrawing from all their fellow ministers, having first presented to the president Julius our condemnation, departed, etc.</p>
      <p>And although we have fully and clearly expressed our opinion on the redemption of the human race through Christ, on the ministry of the word and sacraments in our consensus, and have sufficiently clearly testified that we do not recognize mere signs in the sacraments, how is it, I ask, that although you have met so many times, not with these furious ones, but with otherwise more moderate people, of whom there is some hope that they will accommodate themselves to concord, you have not once presented that consensus of ours to them? You have undoubtedly understood from them that not that but something else and more is required of us. A year and a half ago, the illustrious man John a Lasco held a colloquy with Brentius, who also for his piety tried all the ways of concord.</p>
      <p>But to what end did the colloquy erupt, or what hope of mutual agreement was opened to him? It is said that the most illustrious prince himself plainly and without disguise told him: If you want to see the churches at peace, and you delight so much in true and stable concord, simply acknowledge the Augsburg Confession and persuade those people of yours in the church of foreigners to join the German churches wherever they are.</p>
      <p>And when that same John a Lasco shortly after published a booklet titled: The Purging of the Ministers of the Church of Foreigners in Frankfurt against the Calumnies of Those Who Accuse Their Doctrine of Dissent from the Augsburg Confession Regarding the Presence of the Lord Christ in His Supper: what, I ask, thanks did he receive from these people? Or what did this otherwise dangerous attempt contribute to the business of concord? We do not wish to say anything here. Let the writings themselves speak, which were published by these people against John a Lasco for this one reason: but why do we mention these foreign matters, when you yourself this summer once and again held a colloquy with people of better hope. But what did you find, I ask? You found them indeed to be humane and kind enough, nevertheless, as we explain many things here, and not without reason we emphasize so much, they always return to the Augsburg Confession as to a sacred anchor, and after long circumlocutions of words, and after involutions, they always present it, and unless it is subscribed to by us, they leave little hope of reconciliation or pacification.</p>
      <p>For they are bound by this bond as tightly as possible, both they and the most illustrious princes. Nor do many, as it seems, fear without reason that it may easily happen that the whole business of religion is brought into the greatest danger because of the single article of the Eucharist. For the emperor, with all the estates of the empire, has hitherto dissimulated and promised to dissimulate the diversity of religion until a future council, provided the Protestants persevere in what they professed in the confession presented, and in no way join those who destroy idols and deny the bodily presence of Christ in the supper. There are still most reliable witnesses of this matter, the Recesses of the Empire printed in German.</p>
      <p>What is more, in all the subsequent diets, from those at Augsburg to these last ones at Regensburg, it has always and solely been provided that peace seems to be given only to the Protestants, closed to those alien to the Augsburg Confession, and thus the Sacramentarians are expressly excluded? Therefore, since they are bound by this necessity, those who have moved these things do not wonder why subscription is so much required of us and why many do not defend and even profess the more sincere doctrine of our churches, to which they are otherwise not unjust. To all of which is also added the not insignificant fact that the most illustrious and most holy evangelical religion princes are diligently inculcated by the cunning sons of this age that they must by all means avoid even the suspicion of levity, and that with the emperor, with kings, princes, and all the estates of the empire, with whom they have once professed their faith by the Augsburg Confession presented, which they have proposed in the matter of the supper in such a way that the emperor himself and those who call themselves Catholics have approved that article. However, they cannot be purged of the note of levity if they now agree with those churches, or profess to be willing to bear them in any way, which in those famous diets, while the Protestants were as if received into favor, were expressly condemned by name, and have hitherto been excluded in all diets under the name of Sacramentarians. Otherwise, we see that some cities expressly condemned in those very Augsburg diets could not be received, nor were they received into the society of the Protestants except by subscription to the Augsburg Confession.</p>
      <p>But to return to where we digressed, when you yourself were dealing with the princes and their preachers, learned, kind, and moderate men, this past summer, what, I ask, did you achieve by your colloquy? You left in their hands the confession published in the name of the Swiss and Savoyard churches, which alone can abundantly testify that such colloquies aim at nothing else than what we have just said. For that confession, which you offered without our knowledge, inclines more to their doctrine than simply expounds ours.</p>
      <p>Hence we could not acknowledge it, and we urged you at Zurich in the assembly of brothers, as you know, to refrain from writing and offering such confessions to the princes. Nevertheless, you have now again come to the preachers of the most illustrious princes at Worms for a colloquy, meanwhile pursuing another matter, namely the cause of the prisoners of Jesus Christ in France, and you have again composed a new confession, and requested a colloquy. But what kind of confession? Exactly the kind that we repeatedly say is required of us by them, and to be given by us if we wish to hope for any pacification. For you either wrote such a confession yourself, or offered one written by another, which in all things agrees with the Augsburg Confession, indeed expressly professes it.</p>
      <p>However, you except, which we meanwhile approve and praise, the article of the Eucharist, in which some controversies still remain. Meanwhile, we do not think the purer churches of France will acknowledge all those things, even if you except the article of the Eucharist, which they profess in their Augsburg Confession.</p>
      <p>Among other things of this kind, we think there is the necessity of baptismal water for salvation in infants, the confession made to a priest and private absolution, to mention nothing else. We certainly do not follow the Augsburg Confession in these, let alone in the article of the Eucharist, nor have the churches of the Swiss ever wanted to simply receive it, as we also previously explained when we mentioned what was done in the business of concord through Bucer.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since these things are so, we did not rashly say, what we now repeat, that we are not yet persuaded that a colloquy with these people is the only way to reach true, solid, and stable concord, since in all the colloquies held so far, the Augsburg Confession is constantly imposed on our churches to be simply received in all things, and thus all their efforts aim at us leaving ours to join them: which we cannot grant them unless we are willing to act against faith, duty, and conscience, you now consider how well you consult the affairs of our church, who, having undertaken journeys to the princes and their ministers, wish to obtain this, which is connected with so many and such great difficulties and dangers. However, we know that the French churches, and also those of foreigners throughout Germany, do not at all ask us to receive anything obscure, tangled, or incongruous with the truth, so that they may be safer and more tranquil.</p>
      <p>We also acknowledge that nothing is more desirable and pleasant than peace and concord among brothers. Blessed are the peacemakers, says the Lord, for they shall be called the children of God.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we do not doubt that you, with all the saints, acknowledge that not even a hair's breadth should be departed from the confessed truth and holy simplicity for the sake of peace, nor should anything be received against conscience, especially since that famous saying of the Lord is also celebrated: I did not come to bring peace, but a sword, etc. Indeed, the offense of the weak is a troublesome and almost abominable thing.</p>
      <p>But what, I ask, will you do, especially when you are constrained by the express commands of the Lord and there is a danger that through that obscure pacification not only will the already inveterate and less harmful offense not be removed, but rather it will be doubled by being renewed? Therefore, we fraternally exhort and beseech you, honorable lord and dearest brother, never to forget the words of our Lord and His apostle saying: Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves! See that you walk circumspectly as wise men, redeeming the time, because the days are evil, and temper and beware lest you promise the princes things that are not only difficult and full of dangers, but also pertain to the knowledge and consultation of many, and do not continue to write so many and such confessions, which you may later be forced to explain to many, and thus incur the hatred of both friends and enemies, or, if ever a colloquy is to be held, you will have us, your brothers, as adversaries, who indeed, although we are sincerely inclined to enter into holy concord with those who preach the same Christ with us against Antichrist, nevertheless, we do not want to use doubtful and obscure words or sentences in our confession, since we know that it has always been received by the opinion of all as undoubted: that confessions of faith should always, especially when dealing with matters that are in controversy, be most simple and clear, and not at all doubtful, ambiguous, or obscure, lest, while composing with some, more serious wars are undertaken with many others who are differently affected, or a matter that is clear in itself is enveloped in clouds for the sake of men, with excessive zeal for concord. However, a Consensus has been published by us in which the whole cause of our redemption, as well as the ministry of the word and sacraments, is fully and clearly, and as it is taught and believed in our churches, expounded. Let us persevere in it, I beseech you, so that firm and perpetual concord may stand among us, and let us not reject those who feel the same as we do.</p>
      <p>If, however, we see that something more obscure or intricate than these of ours should be given by us to others, or we see that it is neither opportune nor convenient for those of our brothers and illustrious men who are more favorable to us, due to certain decrees of the Empire, or for other reasons, to receive or openly agree with us as we are, let them indeed use their own customs, opinions, and ways of speaking, but let them allow us to use ours. At least let them restrain, if they can, the petulant and more ferocious spirits among themselves, so that they do not continue to pour out such writings, which cannot be passed over or ignored by us in silence out of faith and duty. Therefore, if nothing better, greater, or more sincere can be obtained, let us at least cultivate peace among ourselves and bear with one another until the Lord gives better times and more favorable opportunities. Meanwhile, let us earnestly pray to Him that what cannot be healed by human prudence, diligence, and effort, may be cured by divine power, wisdom, and grace. Farewell, dear brother in the Lord, and commend us to your fellow ministers and deign to greet them diligently in our name. Zurich, December 15, 1557.</p>
      <p>The pastors and professors of theology, ministers of the church of Zurich. Your prudence and piety understand that this letter is not to be communicated or spread indiscriminately, as slanderers and those who rejoice in dissensions will seize upon everything that happens to the detriment of the church of Christ and to propagate and strengthen it. May the Lord Jesus grant us stable and holy peace.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Théodore de Bèze, professor of sacred letters in Lausanne, our most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
