      <p> Greetings. Yesterday I received your letters through this messenger of yours, along with the letters to the Landgrave. I read them, and Steiger also read them. Meanwhile, last night Beza arrived with Syndic Rosetus and Mr. Dathenus. They are sent to our republics to deliberate with them or rather to bring them here, so that they may send some delegation or at least some common letters to the Erfurt convention and, as much as possible, to prevent and hinder the establishment of that colloquy. What they will obtain from our people, I do not know; they are not ill-disposed towards the cause itself; however, they are reluctant to involve themselves in those foreign controversies; for they fear that we may become entirely entangled there and draw them upon our own heads. They will also come to Zurich; I want to forewarn you of this. - Tomorrow they will finally be heard by our senate. They would like to have some of our people added to them, who would travel with them to Zurich, so that a common deliberation on these matters may be held there. But what will happen, I still do not know. It seems sufficient to us that you have already acted, namely that you have commended that cause to the Landgrave; we hope he will perform the duty of a good prince, and we would like to hear first what he would respond. But they urge the matter because the time is too close to the first of September. However, one cannot well proceed without first hearing the Landgrave's response; moreover, the princes do not break their engagements to come together so soon. For the rest, which you wrote and sent, I give thanks; I will return the rest through Beza. Farewell. Steiger, Gravenriet, Zehender, and all the brothers greet you, as does my father-in-law with my household. Greet yours. Nothing has yet been done with Valentino Gentile. Beza brought us much that we previously did not know about the Polish tumults stirred up by him and others. Farewell again. </p>
      <p> Bern, July 26, 1566. </p>
      <p> Johannes Haller, always yours. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. </p>
      <p> Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. </p>
