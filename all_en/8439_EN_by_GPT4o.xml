      <p>Greetings. Today is the eighth day since I last wrote to you, dear brother. I entrusted the letters to Mr. Johann MÃ¼ller, a man dear to me and very devoted to me; he told me that he had taken good care of them and given them to a trustworthy man. Therefore, I assume that due to the bad weather, he arrived at Chur later, but now my letters have been delivered to you. Unless I receive something special from friends elsewhere, do not be surprised if I write little or nothing until the first of January; for I am overwhelmed with many things that I have to do.</p>
      <p>I thank the Lord, who has added the desired conclusion to your tragedy. I pray to Him to bless the election.</p>
      <p>I think it was well done that our Campell was appointed in place of Ganthner. You will congratulate him in my name. I pray for the Lord's blessing upon him. Let him earnestly pray to the Lord to bless him. Do not fear; the Lord can change the hearts of men, and if you seek only His glory and the welfare of the church, your affairs will prosper. Seek first the glory of God, the safety of the church, be united and peaceful, and the Lord will bless you. Ganthner does not cease to plot new things; but the Lord will not abandon a good cause. [You] conduct modestly those things that are for the public good. Sometimes a great storm arises, but it is soon calmed, etc. Strange things are written from Basel about the surge of the Rhine. If these are true, I fear more for Holland than before; but we are all in the hand of God. And this sudden and utterly furious surge of rivers and waters seems to be a precursor of a great and unexpected calamity.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us and protect us from evil! Farewell together with all good people, the councilors, Pontisella, Campell, Bonett, Karl, and others. May your house be safe, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 8, 1570.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
