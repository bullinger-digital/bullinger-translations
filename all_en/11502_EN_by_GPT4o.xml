      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greetings. When the assembly was suddenly dissolved due to the unexpected mandate of the Emperor, the brothers were unable to write to you as they wished. Philipp himself promised me that he would write to you diligently. Each of the others was prepared to write. Therefore, I beg you to attribute the lack of many letters from us to necessity.</p>
      <p>All of Strasbourg holds you in pious esteem and affection. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your S. Gryn√§us. 2nd of February.</p>
