      <p> Greetings. The letters you recently sent to me, most esteemed friend, were most welcome to me; for they indicated your old and indeed friendly disposition, about which I had no doubt. You are mistaken, therefore, if you suspected any defection on my part; there is no one alive who has ever experienced such fickleness and inconstancy in me, that they would see me alienated from even the slightest friend. What reason could there be for alienation from you? As for the fact that you have received letters from me less frequently, it is certainly not my fault, since I not only replied to each of yours and thanked you for your excellent books, but I also sent letters to you several times without being prompted; therefore, I do not vainly surmise that my letters have been intercepted, as many malevolent people have caused me such harm repeatedly over the year, so that my more secret letters have not only been intercepted, broken open, and read, but also copied and sent elsewhere, from which not a little danger has arisen for me. I beg you, continue in your former affections towards me; I am yours forever. </p>
      <p> My affairs are still such that I do not know where to turn; but as soon as I find out whether I will stay here or leave, with God's guidance, I will immediately set out to you. Dr. Philipp Melanchthon, as I hear, passed away peacefully to the heavens on April 19th and left behind a confession entirely agreeing with yours, to the great indignation of the Lutherans. As soon as I obtain this confession of faith, I will send it to you. </p>
      <p> Farewell and greet the brothers. </p>
      <p> Hastily, May 18th, in the year 1560. </p>
      <p> Yours, Georg Frölich from Lemnitz, etc. </p>
      <p> To the highly learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zürich, my especially gracious, dear lord and friend, to his hands. Zürich. </p>
