      <p>Greetings. I have received both the previous letters and the ones you have now sent.</p>
      <p>I was unable to respond to the previous ones due to the business, which, as it accumulates more and more, I feel in myself not the same readiness and dexterity in action, which I seem to have had before, by the grace of God. I attribute something to the age of this time and also something to the strength weakened by long and excessive exercise, indeed broken. Certainly, everything has its most certain periods.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I willingly accept everything from the Lord as it is. Now I also respond briefly to the latter.</p>
      <p>I was horrified in my whole mind when I read about the blasphemous rascal's similar story of the old and young donkey. It is a satanic mind from which such abominable things proceed. Thus those rascals show gratitude to both God and men, because they were collected as exiles by the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>The Lord will repay them according to their merit. The same will not fail you in the synod, if only you, striving for simplicity, do not give place to their audacity and lust for speaking. - If the Ferrara man has occupied Mirandola, he will not retain it without a civil war in Italy. Perhaps the Lord will repay this nation for their impiety, unless perhaps they nourish another monster; but the Lord lives. From France, we hear nothing else yet but that peace is being cultivated, although in some places the sons of Belial break out and, according to their nature, bring violence to the innocent sheep of Christ. It is written that the prince of Transylvania is dead and therefore there is a danger that the emperor and the Turk may engage with each other, both wanting to subjugate Transylvania. Those who returned from Frankfurt reported nothing worth mentioning.</p>
      <p>Two bishops from England write to me that everything is safe and sound there by the grace of the Lord, with the universal assembly of the kingdom to be celebrated on April 2nd. It is written from TÃ¼bingen on April 14th that Mr. Bidenbach, the successor of Brenz and provost of Stuttgart (he published against us the testament of Brenz), has fallen into mania or melancholy and has gone to his brother in Bebenhausen, which is a monastery where his brother is the abbot.</p>
      <p>There, on April 6th, Wilhelm Bidenbach threw himself headlong into the street from a window at 3 o'clock before dawn, was taken up half-alive, did nothing worthy of a Christian, nor showed any sign of repentance, and within the space of 2 hours breathed his last and was buried at 4 in the evening of the same day in the same monastery: Jacob Andreae gave a funeral oration in praise of the deceased, trying to demonstrate that his death should not be considered like those who take their own lives; for that talkative man is accustomed with his sweet eloquence to make white black and black white. Then the people have many things in their bagpipes, with which they deceive the people. In the meantime, God is not mocked, who is a just judge. Merchants report nothing certain about the war either in Belgium or Germany. May the Lord grant us peace! I bring you, my dear Tobias, the unfortunate and mournful news that on the 25th of this month, around 3 in the morning, the most distinguished man, the consul of our republic, Mr. von Cham, passed away from this world and was buried yesterday. May the Lord repair this inestimable loss for us. I am thinking, for the sake of restoring my health, if the Lord wills, to enter some bath at the end of May. If you can do any good in the cause of our Lemannus, do it.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Zurich, April 27th. Greet all our people. Zurich 1571.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
