      <p>Greetings. If you were living beyond the farthest pillars of Hercules, dearest Bullinger, I would receive your letters more often than I do now (I suppose); for it has been a year since I have received any of them.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I cannot help but be anxious about the reason for this, and especially, lest something has happened to you that I would not be pleased to learn from your letters. I wish to be freed from this anxiety of mind as soon as possible. I am glad that the Swiss are now less involved in foreign affairs. There have been some courtiers of the Prince of Orange here, who say that there will be no war in Germany this year and that the maritime cities of the Saxons are free to navigate to Antwerp and trade. They say that in two months from now, he will come to Speyer for the diet, where he will transfer the imperial scepter to his son. May God prosper whatever pertains to His glory. In the month of March, my father passed away. There is nothing else new here. I wish you to be as well and as upright as possible, my incomparable lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Nozereth, 7th day before the Calends of July in the Christian year 1549. Yours and his, Gilbert Cousin of Nozereth.</p>
      <p>To the most accomplished professor of theology, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable lord, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
