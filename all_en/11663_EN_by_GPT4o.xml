    <p xml:id="regest1">Christoph [Rotacher] was deceived by the maid who seduced him through a likely feigned pregnancy; he is suited for service in school or church and will make his mistake forgotten through future good behavior. The Imperial Diet [at Speyer] is said to have ended in great harmony, and now preparations are being made [for the Turkish campaign]; Pope [Paul III] sees Italy threatened and therefore wants to provide only a small troop contingent. The council, postponed from Pentecost to the Assumption of Mary [August 15], is to take place in Mantua, Ferrara, Bologna, Piacenza, or possibly Trent, as announced by the Bishop of Modena [Giovanni Morone].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Christophorus (Christoph Rotacher) finally returns, as you see, certainly a good young man, although he has deceived me shamefully, yet he was deceived far more shamefully; for the maid, whom he forced into fornication, which he could never deny, after she carried the pregnancy for a long time, meanwhile also acting as a servant, vanished and is said by everyone to have been nothing less than pregnant. If this is true, what else was intended but to defame both me and him and expose us to ridicule by all?</p>
      <p>What he did, therefore, was foolishness, not malice, which is not found in everyone. Therefore, he seems to be entirely worthy of being received and nurtured until he can perform his duty either in school or in the church. I commend him to you and to the others to whom the care of the schools is entrusted; there is no doubt that he will act henceforth in such a way that his previous mistake will easily be forgotten.</p>
      <p>Your merchants have surely reported about the concluded Imperial Diet and the military preparations. They departed, as they say, in great harmony; a huge amount of money is being collected everywhere, as well as a large number of people. The Pope (Paul III), because he does not know whether the Turk will also attack Italy (for he is said to have gathered a huge fleet), promised only five thousand foot soldiers if the emperor is going to embark on the expedition, otherwise, half of that.</p>
      <p>The council was to be announced for the feast of Pentecost, but it is closer than to be convened so; it will be postponed until the Assumption of Mary. Because he himself wishes to be present, he has designated the cities in Italy: Mantua, Ferrara, Bologna, or Piacenza. If anyone stubbornly prefers Germany, he also names a city here, Trent. Thus, the Bishop of Modena (Giovanni Morone) proposed to the princes at Speyer. What the response was, I do not know. I wanted to add these things to the previous letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, April 15, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
