      <p>S. D. At almost the same hour, most illustrious man and father in Christ, most revered, when the public courier of your most honorable senate delivered your letters to me, I had already written back. For when you requested that I immediately return the news you shared through the same courier, I did not want to delay, so that you might have what you requested promptly. But when I sought the courier here and there with the sealed letters through a boy, I learned that he had unexpectedly departed shortly after leaving me. Therefore, what was neglected then, I now wish to remedy in any way possible.</p>
      <p>Our Bartholom√§us Stultzius is eager to comply with the call of your most honorable senate with a willing spirit; however, there are two things that he and his most honorable and pious parents complain about as burdensome. The first is that the stipend is said to be so meager that he can barely sustain himself, especially since the income is expected only at the end of the following year, and he has so far made intolerable expenses from both his and his wife's patrimony, thus almost exhausting his entire fortune.</p>
      <p>He therefore requests that your most honorable magistrate, if it can be done in any way, deign to assist him in this matter. The second is that he fears, since the prefect Liechtesteigius is related by blood to the Frauenfeld family, that they might conspire against him and thus increase the danger he endured in the previous church.</p>
      <p>He therefore asks your most honorable senate to take his situation into account and to undertake his protection. This seems to me to be most fair; for you are not unaware of the calumnies by which our people are often oppressed before they are heard, as happened to this Stultzius in the Maggoensian church. What I write to your kindness in his name and that of his parents, the same has been requested by me and Stultzius himself to be acted upon in person with your most honorable senate by Mr. Consul Rinckius.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Mr. Consul, like your courier, is said to have departed for Zurich by order of our senate without my knowledge the day before yesterday. It is truly lamentable that the adversaries (as the proverb goes) cannot break the wretched peace of the land, but we cannot maintain it. Our people, alas, care little for Christ, the gospel, or the churches, being devoted only to their own interests and given to their bellies. But He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The news you sent, I shared with our consuls and brothers, for which we give you the greatest thanks. Especially uplifting were the reports from Mr. Erastus about the Wittenbergers. That you have a pious regard for our situation in the monastic struggle is most gratifying. May the Lord of peace and life repay what we cannot recompense. We will also continue diligently in public supplication, about which we have not written for another reason than to imitate your example in all things, and since I do not see a serious amendment of life, but rather an accumulation of sins provoking the just wrath of God, I believe we must continue, unless we wish to be utterly consumed by divine vengeance. I received with the most grateful heart this truly admirable sprout of rye; may it portend the resurrection of the dead soon to come, as both the place where it grew and its fertility excellently agree with the Pauline image. For what else can we hope for or desire more in this ruin of the whole world, I cannot see. As soon as Mr. Consul Rinckius brings back the response of your most honorable senate, Stultzius will be ready to accept the call.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in Christ, who preserves your kindness, amen. Mr. Consul Peyer, Doctor Martin, Burgover, and all the fellow ministers greet you reverently with the brothers; I also do the same always.</p>
      <p>Given hastily on the 14th of August in the year of our Lord 1572. I am temporarily reserving the letters of your most honorable magistrate, by which Stultzius is recommended to the Bernang[en] church, with me until their use is required.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted in kindness, Johann Konrad Ulmer. To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful overseer of the Zurich church, his friend and father in Christ, most revered.</p>
