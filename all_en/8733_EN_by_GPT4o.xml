      <p>May God grant you many good years along with all your people.</p>
      <p>I have received your letter and my news well, I have nothing further; but we are waiting for the days. We have miserable news here, that they are carrying Mr. Hans Wägmann out of the house and barn with his goods, etc.; it pains my heart, it goes badly; may God improve it. Keep it to yourself, do not spread it, etc. Your red wine is good, it pleases me; I will also settle with you. Night after night, my lord bailiff Steiger from Bern sends me a beautiful ripe measure of Rolle's wine, exceedingly precious; it is half mine. Thanks be to God. On Monday we intend to share it. Our friendly, dear brother-in-law Jörg Grebel has become steward in Winterthur, Mr. Erismann bailiff at the Fraumünster, Fry in Niederdorf, Mr. Hans's blessed brother steward at Embrach to Kappel, two Brämen, one a choir, the other a court usher.</p>
      <p>All my people greet you; greet all your people for us. God be with you.</p>
      <p>In haste, Saturday, December 29, 1572. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Wish me many good years from Mr. Hans Peyer and his honorable wife.</p>
