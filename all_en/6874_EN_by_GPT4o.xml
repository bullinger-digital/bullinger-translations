      <p> Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, by the singular grace of God, I am still well with my wife and children, but even so, I cannot promise myself anything certain about this mortal life. The strongest and most robust men are dying; the timid have fled. But death pursues even the fleeing man; for among those who fled, some have meanwhile died. Ambrosius, the consul, has also finally retreated elsewhere. The remaining members of the republic mostly show themselves to be quite strong; however, the consuls have deserted the republic. But it frightens me greatly that I perceive little improvement in all this, therefore I fear there is still a greater punishment present. My maid, who has been with me for six years, died in a most Christian manner on Friday. I am raising a nurse at home with her little daughter; but the nurse's little daughter is also now close to death. Thus it spreads, and unless God miraculously sustains us, we can hardly remain unharmed. I have a caregiver in the house; I give her 1 florin every week (as do others), without food and drink; one cannot find care and service in such abundance of the sick and scarcity of the healthy, etc. Otherwise, nothing is brought here; it is a miserable thing; the peasants are so very frightened, etc. You should not expect any news from elsewhere from me. Someone is said to have come from Germany, who brought amazing news about the Turkish terror; you inform us about these things. They will shave their beards, but not with wine, as happened in Augsburg, but with blood. God have mercy on the poor German lands, etc. These things suddenly; you will forgive me for your candor. I wrote eight days ago and hope they have been delivered to you. I have not yet received any letters from you this week. Our man has not yet returned. Farewell, reverend father in Christ. Chur, August 19, 1566. Greet your sons and sons-in-law, the best of men, from me. </p>
      <p> Yours, Fabricius. </p>
      <p> In all this dying, there is no pastor in the common Three Leagues, nor in the Romance-speaking areas, who has written us a letter or once asked or spoken to us with a comforting word. From this, you can gather more about what understanding and discretion they have. If it goes well, I am their host, but I make no judgment, etc. Now this grace, etc. This evening I receive letters from Dr. Lavater. I cannot reply. I am now burying the nurse's little daughter. My own little daughter is also beginning to fall ill. I thank Dr. Lavater, who wrote very kindly and extensively in such a corruption of affairs. In the episcopal matter, I do not feel differently; but he would hear amazing things in person. But who would have obtained even these moderate things, whatever they may be, unless good men had most steadfastly opposed them? Now another has withdrawn. The primary canon, the author of this matter, is now suffering from the plague. This matter no longer torments me. I have done as much as I could; but this itself was not fruitless, etc. Greet Dr. Compater. I wish you well. If I live, I will write, etc. These things suddenly. Greetings. I wrote these letters, reverend father, eight days ago amidst the funerals and illnesses of my people. Meanwhile, my little daughter has also died. Now my dearest and most Christian wife is also gravely ill, so that there is no or little hope left for her mortal life. She has faithfully called you and yours gracious; for she always regarded you as a father. I also wish to have you graciously herewith; for I have offered myself to God before and now. And I ask you, if I die, to also graciously remember all your synod members, pastors, and professors in my name. Paul Pul has also died, and before him, the strongest and most robust, etc. </p>
      <p> I am now receiving letters from Dr. Zanchi, which I am sending here at the same time, etc. There is no need to send them back, etc. He urges me to take care of my health; but I have entrusted all this to God; for amidst the embraces and funerals of the dying, I cannot do otherwise, etc. My wife is so weak today that I can hardly believe she will survive this night, etc. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his and in Christ reverend father. Zurich. </p>
