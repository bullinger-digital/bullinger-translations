      <p>Greetings. I pray you, my dear brother, to give these three copies of my Repetition to those to whom they are addressed; you will keep one for yourself, give another to your dearest son, and the third to the venerable and highly esteemed elder Mr. Johann Fortm√ºller; you will adorn this small gift of mine with your words and ask them to appreciate it sincerely.</p>
      <p>Greet them most kindly and excuse me for not writing to them myself. However, I am pleased to retain my old custom of always sending you a copy of all my writings, just as I used to send to the incomparable Mr. Joachim Vadian. I remember being reminded by you and your son about his works; but I wonder why it is that in the meantime you have never mentioned this matter in any of your letters. I would gladly handle with Froschauer what pertains to their publication, and I do not doubt that his works will be most useful to the church and the republic, since all his works are not only most learned and eloquent but also very suitable for edification.</p>
      <p>Therefore, consider, my brother, what needs to be done. As for the rest and concerning the affairs of the French churches, you will hear everything more fully and certainly from your merchants.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord: "Confirm, O God, what you have worked in them." For plots and violence are to be feared; the Pope does not cease; the Lotharingian is a schemer without equal.</p>
      <p>Unless divine wisdom and power scatter the machines or practices of these men, human weakness will not withstand.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore pray to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Our churches also labor under the same danger; our people are astonishingly cold, the adversaries are fervent, and now the recall of the French alliance is being attempted with remarkable cunning.</p>
      <p>There are many dangers from other causes.</p>
      <p>What then can we do in these matters but flee to the Lord and seek counsel and help from Him.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with us according to His good and most holy will. I hear and understand from Beza's letters to me that he himself has written against the Omnipresentials.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Bishop of Winchester, the most learned Mr. Robert Horn, writes to me from England, and the learned men of England are planning something against the monstrosity of Ubiquity.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus be with His church and settle these internal dissensions. In some places among us, there are clear signs of a plague; and in Basel, many are being consumed by this disease; the plague spreads far and wide.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant to the unrestrained world that, having despised the mud of this age, it may desire and yearn for heavenly goods. Farewell forever, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and your household.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 31, 1564.</p>
      <p>Always yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Johann Kessler, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen.</p>
