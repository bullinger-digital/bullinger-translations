      <p>S. D. I hope you have received everything I wrote in the previous days, along with the petition of our most honorable council for Beccaria. I have read what you sent to Mr. Gessner.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord to bless our cause; for if He does not exercise His power here, it will be very difficult to put a bridle on the untamed horse. The bishop's powers are great; but greater is the power of Christ, who, if He wills, will blow away this bull without any trouble. I anxiously await to know what has been done.</p>
      <p>May the Lord prevent sedition; otherwise, a very wide door would be opened for the Five Cantons, and much more advantage and authority would accrue to the bishop and the adversaries than would be taken away. Therefore, I pray to the Lord to moderate these things Himself; for I experience more and more every day that what the Lord said is true: the children of this world are wiser than the children of light. We are lazy, fearful, entangled, and soft.</p>
      <p>We are neither brave nor earnest and steadfast in God's matters. This matter has afflicted me for several years and now almost kills me; for I am forced to hear and see every day what I do not wish to.</p>
      <p>I find that Jeremiah did not in vain so vehemently rebuke the laziness and incredible obstinacy in evil of his people after so many labors. If the Lord had not foretold these events, it would not be surprising if the helmsman were to throw away the rudder. The pope has called a council; I adorn the papal council with these books of mine that have been published; take one copy for yourself, give another to our Philip, and send the third to Mr. Friedrich von Salis and greet them in my name most kindly.</p>
      <p>What I have received from elsewhere, I share here on the condition that you return it. The things brought from France are memorable, nothing from Italy, except that the arrival of the most powerful Turk is indicated from elsewhere. Italy will be so constrained by war with Spain that they do not seem to be able to do much against the gospel. Among men, our common enemy is gaining; he will reform us later and hold the council, etc. Today Johannes Hyler is proposed to go to Davos; tomorrow it will be decided.</p>
      <p>Tobias Egli has not been able to succeed; for since he was expelled from Frauenfeld, the lords are now worried that he will have no peace from the Five Places and that those in Davos will be troubled by it. You will have understood well from the mayor and the lords of the land in Davos what they have negotiated with me and how earnestly they desire a preacher. Therefore, if my lords are willing, speak with them, that they hold him in honor and well, as he is worthy of all honor. Johannes FÃ¤sy, helper in Wangen, is proposed for him; I do not know who it will be.</p>
      <p>The thought of Hyler has never come to me; but as other lords began to speak of him, I am glad; for you know that he is an honest man and well learned. The Lord be with you, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 31, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, his esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Chur.</p>
