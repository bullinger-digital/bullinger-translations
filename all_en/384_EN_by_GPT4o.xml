      <p>I cannot restrain myself, dearest Bullinger, from writing to you about the things that have recently brought us great joy, so that you and your fellow ministers may share in some part of it. A debate was held in London on the nineteenth of December, if I am not mistaken, in the assembly of almost all the nobles of all England. There was a fierce contest among the bishops. Contrary to everyone's expectations, the Archbishop of Canterbury defended your opinion on this matter most openly, steadfastly, and learnedly. These were his arguments: [Greek] etc. He was followed by the Bishop of Rochester, who handled this matter with such eloquence, clarity, learning, and strength of argument [Greek] that he silenced the most ardent papist of Worcester.</p>
      <p>Never has truth won a more splendid victory among us. I clearly see the end of Lutheranism, as those who were previously considered its greatest and almost sole supporters have entirely become ours. We owe much to the Lord, who also wishes to provide for us in this matter. I did not want to deprive you, dearest friend, of such great joy, which I pray to God you may enjoy for a long time. Please convey my greetings to Mr. Bibliander and the other dearest brothers; I wish health to your wife and all your children from the bottom of my heart. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Chaonia, the day before the first of January. Bartholomew Traheron.</p>
      <p>Behold, as Mr. Treheron was about to deliver his letters, I happened to arrive by chance. I could not help but write you a little greeting; for due to the excessive haste of the courier, I cannot write more. Soon I will make sure you are informed about all matters. Hastily. In London, there is a remarkable recantation of the foolish bishops.</p>
      <p>Johannes from Ulm</p>
      <p>To the most learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the greatest of friends. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
