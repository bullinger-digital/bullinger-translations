    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich did not respond to Bullinger's last letter, delivered by the Augsburg rider [...] [not received], because he was very busy and also ill. But even if he replies now, Bullinger should not feel compelled to consider what and how he should write back to Frölich; after all, they are both united in faith in Christ and mutual understanding.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Frölich is saddened that Bullinger refuses the gifts [from Augsburg], especially since he does not know how else he could thank Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Frölich's wife [Anna, née Lochner] was very pleased with the gift featuring the David [motif] from Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- A letter from Regensburg dated [February 8] reveals that the [Second Regensburg Religious] discussion has begun. However, the negotiations resemble the Eleusinian Mysteries, as the participants' resolutions must remain secret and everything is to be handed over sealed to the Regensburg council. Philipp Melanchthon has not come to Regensburg. Thus, "Bucephalus" [Bucer] holds the first rank; Frölich calls Bucer this because Bucer titled him "Hippograph".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Johannes] Haller was not received with the honor due to him [in Augsburg]; he has enemies. Frölich also has to endure some things because of this appointment. [Wolfgang Musculus] and [Bucer] reported him to Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony and Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse]. Bucer is now trying to invite himself to Augsburg and wrote to some [Augsburg] councilors and preachers: "I hear there is strife among you. Why don't you bring in scholars who are nearby?" But the Augsburgers [block their ears] like the companions of Odysseus once did!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Haller, his wife [Elsbeth, née Kambli], and [little daughter Agnes] are expected. The Augsburg council will cover Haller's travel expenses.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The [Zurich] council should not have given the Augsburg servant [...] four crowns, as he was in Augsburg, not Zurich service.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Some believe that Luther has improved his criticism against the Leuven [theologians] with the enclosed booklet [“Contra asinos Parisienses Lovaniensesque”?]. It is not known that he has published anything against the Zurichers again. At the Frankfurt [spring] fair, one will probably get information about it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- How Frölich interprets the danger he was [recently] suddenly exposed to, Haller probably knows. God admonishes him to lead a better life.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Frölich thought he had already answered the question of whether Bullinger should dedicate his commentary on Luke only to the [former] mayor Hans Welser or also to the [former] mayor Jakob Herbrot. He believes it would be better if the commentary were dedicated to only one of the two. Welser comes from an old patrician family, and Frölich saw with his own eyes 400-year-old documents from his ancestors. [Herbrot], on the other hand, a newcomer, comes from the common people. Welser has better manners and shows more zeal for the Gospel; he also has several years of experience in the administration of the community. Herbrot is quite astute and eloquent; he will probably also play the leading role [in Augsburg] if he sheds his conceit. Neither of them has studied. However, Welser masters French and Italian and is well-traveled.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- There was a rumor that the people of Basel had executed a pastor [Niklaus Petri] who committed a capital crime and murder. Bullinger should report on this occasionally. - Greetings to Bullinger's family, [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Pellikan, [Konrad] Gessner, [Johannes] Fries, [Johannes] Wolf, [Theodor] Bibliander, and to all [scholars] in Zurich, the haven of the Muses like Athens once was. Greetings from Nikolaus [Müller called] Maier, Michael Keller, [Sixt] Birck, and Bernardino Ochino, who has already published scholia on the Epistle to the Romans [“Expositio Epistolae divi Pauli ad Romanos de Italico in Latinum translata”].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- [P.S.:] The Regensburg [Religious] discussion is in limbo because the Bucerites say that the opponents are not sufficiently educated and therefore a victory would be inglorious. The opponents have no linguist, and Bucer sounds in their ears with Greek and Hebrew.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- [Duke] Ernst of Brunswick-Lüneburg has passed away. He was an important support of the [Protestants] after the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- [Enclosure:] The friendship between the Zurich and Augsburg councils has gained new momentum due to Haller's good reception in Augsburg. The appointment of Haller could not have come at a better time! There is a shortage of pious scholars in many places. The Augsburg council is all the more grateful for Haller, who was trained in Zurich with great effort. Bullinger should inform the Zurich authorities of this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Frölich thanks Bullinger for his report on the Zurich church, written in German, which he has forwarded to various places.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- All evangelical estates are ready to rejoin the [Schmalkaldic] League. There is also a new treaty that regulates, among other things, legal matters, especially since the [Imperial] Chamber Court is still suspended. A final decision is to be made [at the Schmalkaldic Diet], which will take place on April 1 in Worms. Elector Friedrich II of the Palatinate and many estates that were not yet members will participate. Even [Sebastian Heusenstamm,] the new Bishop of Mainz, shows himself inclined [to the League]. The many intrigues of the opponents will probably remain ineffective. If the Germans took courage, God would let them achieve much.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- Emperor [Charles V] has recruited 6,000 mercenaries. Several thousand Italians are moving from Milan [over the Alps]. They are said to be destined for the King of England [Henry VIII], but this is not very credible. Precautionary measures will be taken in Swabia in case of war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest19">- Allegedly, [Charles V] will travel via Strasbourg, Ulm, and Augsburg to Regensburg; a detour that is probably due to a special plan, especially since [the Catholics] do not like to pass through Lutheran cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest20">- Frölich sends his regards to the [Zurich] mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab] and the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest21">- Sebastian Schertlin returned a few days ago from Landgrave [Philipp] of Hesse. He declared himself willing to support Hans Wilpert Zoller and his horse for a year. However, Zoller must provide for clothing, armor, and the horse himself. In the event of war, Schertlin will see to it that Zoller is called up. If peace prevails, Zoller must then take care of his own [livelihood]. Schertlin should not be burdened too much [financially], but Frölich would be willing to help. Zoller, whom Frölich sends his regards, should now decide whether to accept the offer.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord through Christ, our avenger. The reason I have not yet responded to your last letter, which was delivered to me by the Augsburg rider, most esteemed Heinrich, is partly due to my occupations and partly due to my physical weakness.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Now, however, as I am about to respond, I first say that you need not worry or be concerned about what and how you write to me (who, even when I have thought things through, often go astray); on the contrary, you do not know how to write anything reprehensible. Moreover, the bond between us is so strong, namely faith and the religion of Christ, that we interpret everything sincerely and candidly with each other; although I must confess that I have never found anything negligent or offensive in your letters. But how badly I sometimes falter, I am my own witness, as I neither have the diligence nor the time to write exquisitely. Therefore, I write to you, my dearest Heinrich, as if to my own heart, in solid love and faith, which Christ, the rich King of kings, may enrich in us all. Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The rejection of our little gift has caused me some sadness, especially because I do not know any other way to show my gratitude to you, unless you value the goodwill of our people towards you, which certainly could hardly be more inclined and greater.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest3">
      <p>My wife received the gift from your most distinguished wife with great joy and testifies that David will be a perpetual bond of friendship between her and your wife.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5">
      <p>She inquires not once, but again and again, how she might show her gratitude; therefore, I ask you to give your wife great thanks and convey to her my most abundant greetings from my side.</p>

      <p>A letter from Regensburg dated last Friday reports that the colloquium, or rather the idle talk, has begun. However, what these miserable people say and discuss is so secretive that it is considered like the Eleusinian Mysteries; for none of their words may be eliminated or divulged, but must be committed to paper, which must then be handed over sealed to the Regensburg council for safekeeping. Oh, foolish and impious babblers, who, if they were fighting for the glory of God and the truth, why would they flee the light? Philipp Melanchthon did not come to Regensburg. Therefore, "Bucephalus" will have the first rank; I say Bucephalus because Bucer, in his writings, mockingly calls me a hippograph.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Haller was not received here with the honor he deserves; however, he remains worthy of his duties, and we are the harvest of his agriculture. The adversaries are grumbling and perishing at this appointment; hence, your brother Laetus also endures and suffers somewhat. For mice and cats have reported me to the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave. But I, with a steadfast mind, disregard those drones. It is incredible to say how vehemently these people plot against me. Bucer is entirely focused on how he might secure an invitation from Regensburg to our city. He writes to some senators and preachers so openly about his intentions that nothing could be clearer, unless he were to say he would gladly visit our city. For he writes these words: "I hear there are disputes among you. Why do you not consult and summon learned men who are not far away?" But we will act like the companions of Ulysses until the sirens' song ceases.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We are eagerly expecting Haller, and I have no doubt that he will hasten his arrival with his wife and family. Furthermore, our council is convinced that Haller will not wait for letters or another invitation, but will fly here directly with his luggage and bags. The expenses and costs of his journey will be covered here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It is indeed too much that your most generous council has given the Augsburg servant four crowns. For how could he accept so much from you, who was then in our, not your, service? But thus, we had to be overcome and overwhelmed by generosity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest8">
      <p>What Luther has denigrated in his booklet, or rather I should say fan, against the Leuven theologians, seems to have been somewhat whitewashed with the attached booklet. He has done something in this, but not without his usual manner. I have not yet heard that he has published anything against you again; however, the Frankfurt fair will teach us something. I would rather believe that he will keep his lips sealed than utter more nonsense.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest9">
      <p>How I myself interpreted the unexpected danger and peril I endured, Haller, if I am not mistaken, knows. I know indeed that the heavenly Father urges me to amend my life in this way, whose grace and mercy you will earnestly implore with me, that he may not let me fall into impiety. Indeed, there is no need for me to seek in what I sin; rather, if I confess that I am sin itself, I am not mistaken. But to the merciful God who leads his little sheep back to the fold, glory forever! Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I thought I had already communicated my opinion to you, whether it would be advisable to dedicate your Luke to Johann Welser alone or to both him and Jakob Herbrot together. In this, I do not know how to advise. However, I know that your plan will be more pleasing if you dedicate your work to one rather than both, and this for the sole reason that almost all human nature has a certain jealousy, especially in matters concerning glory and honor. Welser is a consul of patrician order and very old lineage, whose ancestors' consular letters, published in this city 400 years ago, I have seen with my own eyes, intact and credible; the other, however, is a newcomer from the common people. Welser excels in humanity, piety, and zeal for the Gospel of Christ and has been involved in the administration of the republic for many years; the other is a man quite perceptive, eloquent, and plausible, who, if he exchanges modesty for pride, will one day play a leading role here. Neither of them is skilled in letters. However, Welser is very proficient in the French and Italian languages and a traveler of those and other regions, and through this, he is more civil. In summary, they are our consuls and leaders, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Today, a rumor has spread here, I wish it were false, that the people of Basel have executed a certain prominent minister of the church there for murder and a preceding capital crime. Whatever you find out about this, you will inform me in due course. Farewell, my honor, and convey my greetings first to your most pious household, then to Gwalther, my dear heart, Pellikan, Gessner, Fries, Wolf, Bibliander, and finally to the entire domicile of the Muses in Zurich, flourishing no less than Athens once did. D. Nikolaus Maier, Michael Cellarius, Bernardino Ochino, who has already published scholia on the Epistle to the Romans, and Betuleius send you their most friendly greetings. Farewell again and again. February 12, 1546.</p>

      <p>The Regensburg colloquium has been suspended for the reason, as the Bucerites say, that the opponents are not sufficiently prepared (they have no one skilled in languages, while Bucer silences the mouths of the papists with Greek and Hebrew letters), which, if the enemies are unarmed, will result in a more inglorious victory. There are specters on both sides.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Prince Ernest of Brunswick and Lüneburg, a pious and very brave man, has fallen asleep in the Lord, not without great sorrow among our people, because he was the second hope of men after the Landgrave.</p>

    <div xml:id="div16">
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most august Antistes of the Zurich church, my lord and best brother. Zurich.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest15">
      <p>I hear that the honorable magistrate of Zurich is particularly pleased with the fact that Lord Johann Haller has been well received and accepted here, and therefore a fruitful renewal of confidential, good friendship between them and my lords has taken place. Accordingly, you should know and be certain that the city of Augsburg could hardly have been better served at this time than by the willingness and acceptance of the aforementioned Lord Haller; and my lords, as well as all sensible people, can well consider and recognize such a proven good deed. For, besides the fact that the aforementioned Lord Haller, a native of Zurich, has been educated and maintained at great cost until now in his useful years, the churches in many places are completely devoid of godly (pious) learned people, and they cannot be obtained with any money, therefore my lords should rightly recognize that they have been highly and well served in this matter. I will also, as long as God grants me this city, ensure that it is not placed in oblivion. You may well report this to my lords of Zurich.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Your wise, faithful, and sensible report, sent to me in the German language, I have forwarded to appropriate places with good confidence, and the hoped-for fruit will soon appear from it. Therefore, I express my high, friendly, and brotherly thanks to you. It will always be necessary for everyone, who has ears, to hear, who has eyes, to see, to watch and not to sleep during the day; for the matter is ours.</p>

      <p>All evangelical estates have agreed to rejoin the league. A new treaty has already been drafted, which also includes temporary peace and justice (since the Chamber Court is now suspended). And the final decision of the mentioned league is set for the first of April in Worms, where Elector Friedrich, the Palatine, and several estates, who were not previously part of this agreement, will also come and finally conclude. The new bishop of Mainz also shows himself friendly and accommodating. The counter-practices are indeed great, but they will not help. In particular, it will not hinder what certain individuals from cities and courts seek here in entirely self-serving matters; that is not to be trusted with the pen. If we Germans brought forth our old hearts and hands and used the means that God now places in our hands, God would do great things through us. His will be done for his honor.</p>

    <div xml:id="div20" corresp="regest18">
      <p>The Emperor is recruiting 6,000 mercenaries, and several thousand Italians are said to be coming from Milan under the pretense of being sent to the King of England. However, I cannot make much of this calculation nor trust it. Our people will take a small precautionary measure here in Swabia with cavalry, etc., in case the jest should begin, so that we are prepared against it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div21" corresp="regest19">
      <p>It is said, but it is entirely uncertain to me, that the Emperor will take his route via Strasbourg, Ulm, and Augsburg to Regensburg. This must be done through special preparation (planning), I do not say treachery, because the route is a long detour. Moreover, one does not like to enter Lutheran cities out of special grace and favor. But as long as God the Father holds us under his rod and fear, he loves us and it is beneficial to us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div22" corresp="regest20">
      <p>Convey my willing service to my esteemed, gracious lords, the mayors, the city clerk, and all those who wish me well.</p>

      <p>Lord Sebastian Schertlin has returned here a few days ago from my gracious lord, the Landgrave of Hesse. I have spoken to him on behalf of Hans Hilpert Zoller and have obtained from him as much as follows: Although he is already burdened with many servants, horses, and steeds, he will nevertheless support the aforementioned Zoller with fodder and meals (meals, provisions) for one horse and one person for about a year out of friendship and to please me.</p>
      <p>He will provide clothing, armor, horse, and other costs himself. If war breaks out, he, Lord Schertlin, will hopefully obtain command, service, and pay for him. But if peace remains, he will still look around here and make acquaintances in this manner. Here, expenses and costs are feared; however, I will ensure that Schertlin is not too burdened. Now my good friend Zoller can consider his situation. If I could serve the honorable friendship, him, and all Zurichers, I would do it, even if it costs me money and effort. Tell him, Hilpert, my willing service.</p>
