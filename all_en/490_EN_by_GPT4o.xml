      <p>Greetings. Today, I received two decades of your sermons sent by our mutual friend and lord Joachim von Watt; may Christ, our avenger, be your reward, who, with his inexhaustible goodness, never abandons us even in the midst of whirlwinds and storms, but always inspires prophets from the Father of lights, from whom we may draw consolation. Since I understand from von Watt's letters that your sermons are very relevant to these times, I will study them all the more intently. I would gladly know where all your colleagues are and where Musculus is, as well as the refugee brothers from Strasbourg. Here, I live among the Scythians, who are utterly idolatrous, exposed to many dangers. I consulted a certain Egeria, who replied that soon a nation will gather, intending with military force to occupy all the nearby cities on this side and beyond the Rhine and will not refuse a pact afterward. Here, it is rumored that the French and the Emperor have made peace, and that things are going well between the English and the Emperor as well.</p>
      <p>The cities of Saxony, even those under the dominion of Duke Maurice, as well as the King of Denmark, Duke Augustus, Maurice's brother, the Dukes of Pomerania, and Margrave John of Brandenburg have not yet accepted the new church ordinance Interim, affirming that they would rather die than consent to it.</p>
      <p>About which I have little doubt. Nevertheless, this year does not threaten them with any less martial matters. Some think that the traitor will be more severe against his own people, but in a subtle way. The lawful wife of the Landgrave of Hesse is said to have passed away, and he himself, having given two sons as hostages, is to be freed from captivity shortly. The captured sons of Duke Johann Friedrich steadfastly refuse the Interim; therefore, calamity awaits them in their homeland.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my soul. Greetings to all the brothers, Gualtherus, etc. Hastily from Kaufbeuren, April 18, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Frölich.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes among the Zürichers, most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
