      <p>Greetings. A selection has indeed begun to be made among us, although it has not yet been announced, but not for the French, rather for the defense of the borders of this territory. Therefore, there is no reason for them to hope that aid will be provided to the French.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there is nothing new with us.</p>
      <p>I am currently suffering from a cough and a head cold for the second time, so I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the beginning of your Decades; review it and advise us in time on those things that seem necessary. I will send letters to Blaurer tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 8, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
