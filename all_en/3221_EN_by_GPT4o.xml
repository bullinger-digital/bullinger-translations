      <p>S. P. Although, reverend father in Christ, I am entirely occupied, I did not want the most illustrious man, Friedrich von Salis, to come to you without my letters, both to testify to him that I observe and honor you and desire to converse with you as frequently as possible through letters, and to inform you of the state of our affairs and the republic. Now, regarding the first matter, I certainly pursue your great merits towards me with gratitude and respect, and I will ensure that all good men recognize that I owe much to you, the most illustrious man, from whom I have received much honor, into whose familiarity I have come through the intercession of your letters and hope to come in the future. As for how much strength and firmness your letters, written to me so familiarly and kindly, have brought me, how they have suddenly raised me, wavering in a hard and difficult province, to my feet, the matter itself speaks, so I will not write more.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I, who previously completely distrusted myself and was almost failing under this very heavy burden, have regained my spirit from your letters and have now hardened myself to all labors. Therefore, since I have no one more loving to me than you, it is fair that you find no one more respectful of you than me. The most excellent man who will deliver these letters to you will explain in person the state of our affairs and the republic; therefore, I am not more prolix in writing. The schedule attached here will explain somewhat the state of our republic. On the previous Friday, the case of Pontisella was discussed and debated before the full senate (before the entire assembly). There was a great contention of minds and studies there, and finally, the whole case was referred to the commissioners. For when Mr. Philipp Gallitz, my colleague, unexpectedly and beyond our expectation, had summoned another from the Engadin for Pontisella with his letters, it was in vain labored by our senate and the entire synod, which honored Pontisella with the most honorable testimony. For those who defended the other party were more numerous and also powerful. However, as the cause of Pontisella was better, so it was also superior in judgment, although he was not without the support of good men. Therefore, by the sentences of the commissioners, Mr. Pontisella was restored to his former place. Mr. Friedrich von Salis, while he was here, behaved very kindly towards me, which, because I know well it was done for your sake, I would very much like him to understand from you that he did not place his service uselessly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ, and continue to love me and commend me to good men, as you still do. To your wife, the most honorable matron, to your children and sons-in-law, the most honorable men, and to the most learned man, Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, convey my very best greetings. The most distinguished consuls send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>I will write to Mr. Collin, my father-in-law, at another time; now there was no leisure. For six continuous days, I was never alone, except that in such a great crowd of people, I had to preach three times.</p>
      <p>Therefore, excuse me to him, if you can conveniently. Farewell again. Chur, June 21, in the year of our Lord 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, most observant of you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, outstanding in learning and piety, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most honored patron.</p>
