      <p>Greetings. We have received your letters, which you wrote to us, and we are not at all displeased that you encourage us to boldly resist impiety and vices, so much so that we even thank you for this.</p>
      <p>We have both rebuked those sinning so shamelessly; but whether we like it or not, we will have to leave not a small part of mortals to their lord Satan; the world is going to ruin willingly and of its own accord. Many soldiers from our Confederation do not go to war, deterred more by the meagerness of the pay than moved by piety; yet the leaders fill their numbers by enlisting Swiss from your regions. From Italy, we hear nothing new about the Turk or anything else. I think I have understood what the envoy wrote to you most recently; I know what you replied, and he received your letters with great joy, if those who serve him tell me the truth. We hear from there that the Bernese do not want to allow those bringing aid to the French to pass through their land, and that the king has punished some of his own.</p>
      <p>We wish to know the truth, if it is permitted or convenient for you to write. Your Traversius was here these days; he made a good excuse for not having written to you. However, he will write to you; for I am expecting letters from him. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most esteemed man, and continue to love us in return. Comander, Ponticella, Tscherner, and all good people greet you. From Chur, on the 4th of July, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours in integrity, Philipp Gallicius. I am just now finishing the synod's decrees; I could not do so before; I will send them shortly.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord, etc.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
