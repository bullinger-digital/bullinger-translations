      <p>Greetings. I received your letters written on the 5th and 15th of this month, to which I have not responded due to my occupations. It was pleasing to me that you approve of the king's judgment, who wished the case of the robbers to be left to the knowledge of the judges and was displeased with the delay that the envoy interposed, although not without reason. But I fear that the envoy from Cambrai may have rashly believed something and that there were those who wanted to alienate his mind on that occasion from Mr. Fabricius, a prudent and pious man, whose friendship could have been useful and honorable to him; indeed, nothing is not susceptible to slander.</p>
      <p>I hope to easily settle all those matters. I am writing to the most honorable council about the money being transported from Lyon so that the treaty is not defrauded, and I am sending what I have truly understood from Germany. It is certain that there is great anger and enmity of the pope with the Carafa nephews, having deprived them of all honors and offices and proscribed them; but perhaps they will be the anger of lovers. What you have understood about the conditions of peace has been written to me from Lucerne; but anyone can rightly perceive that they are most vain, nor can I yet affirm anything about peace or truces, as the deputies have nothing certain yet and are now conferring among themselves, and if Calais is reclaimed, a departure will immediately occur. Moreover, I think the servant from Cambrai is bringing the money that the king gave for the names of the Danish envoy.</p>
      <p>I will strive to ensure that what is owed to the host at the Stork is paid to him or released by a pledge; there would be no difficulty now if he had spoken to me about it earlier. I send many greetings to Mr. Martyr and Gwalther and friends. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, 22nd of February.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church.</p>
