      <p>S. Yesterday, most venerable father, I entrusted a boy with letters from Mr. Friedrich von Salis to be delivered to you; now, however, since we have received a sworn messenger from your city, I will not fail to burden him with my own letters as well, in which I will briefly describe our return and what happened during it. We reached our home safely and found everything intact by the grace of God. However, the bailiff of Davos, before we reached Lake Riva, went directly to the people of Glarus for the sake of some of his own business; we crossed the lake alone. He followed the next day and reached Chur, telling wonderful stories of the jests with which he was struck and received by the malevolent in Glarus: 'What does it matter to us what the rest of the Swiss have decided? We have a special passage in our hands, which we will continue to use by right, just as we have begun.</p>
      <p>Where is the Lord of Rhaetia? If he had come here with you, we would certainly receive him with honorary wine, etc. They blurted out these and other things recklessly. But the bailiff attributes all this to the sacred festivities of Fridolin, which the drunkards celebrated at that time; for the next day he was asked not to take it badly; for they had drunk more than enough at the festival. This Mr. Consul shared with me in secret, expecting some addition, which they would subsequently unload on the complaining allies. Above all, however, Ludwig Tschudi showed himself to be sharp. What is happening in Italy among the nobles and how the Turkish fury has presumed to provoke Cyprus with war, Mr. Friedrich has undoubtedly written to you. However, I have not yet heard anything about the Rhaetian expedition.</p>
      <p>But at Wesen, it was full of young rascals; there was also the little flag and a deafening noise. God have mercy!</p>
      <p>I write this to you quickly, most esteemed father, and I earnestly beg and request that you always have us commended to your faith and humanity. I also gave letters to the aforementioned boy for Mr. Erni, the best of friends, which I certainly wish to be delivered with the greatest eagerness.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul, Mr. Karl, who wishes to know from you whether doctors of both laws, spiritual and secular, are also made in Basel, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, and everyone good, send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 14, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the church in Zurich, his singularly esteemed father.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
