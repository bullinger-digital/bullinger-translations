    <p xml:id="regest1">Zurich's response to the Five Places regarding the mandate dispute, as well as Bullinger's advice to Peter Im Haag, found general approval in Bern. Bernhard Meyer wants to advocate in Basel for the restoration of harmony among the evangelical cities. The Reformed in Solothurn, who are only allowed to attend the evangelical service outside the city, want to appoint Paul Rasdorfer as pastor. Haller urges the answering of two marital law questions and reports on a letter from the Strasbourg church to Bern.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You have your response presented at the Baden assembly, dearest Heinrich, which pleased the pious so much that they could neither add nor remove a single point. The entire council followed your advice to Peter Im Haag. May the Lord turn everything to the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Bernhard Meyer from Basel, well known to you, stayed with us for almost 14 days, and we could trust him completely. The more prudent among us have so equipped and even persuaded him that he will leave no stone unturned among his people to restore mutual favor among the cities through them. He has most eagerly taken on this task and hopes that his efforts will not be in vain. Indeed, he has diligently advocated your cause against the Cantons among those who seem to us to be papists.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the pious in Solothurn, who are in the city, listen to the word outside the city in a nearby village from a certain brother whom they support at their own expense, albeit very modestly. They would like Paul Rasdorfer to be recommended by us, as he is worthy, if he were still with you. Therefore, inquire from the man and write to me as soon as you can, whether he has a wife and children, and if he would now like to take on this position. As soon as the people of Solothurn have understood this through me, I will write to you about what kind of living they can and want to provide. For that place indeed needs a learned man because of the Anabaptist dregs, which have so prevailed that very few have not learned their gospel from such people.</p>
      <p>We have not yet received your advice on the two articles. I would indeed wish that you had indicated with even one word, so that while some are plotting against us, we could more cautiously prevent it. Long ago, if I am not mistaken, I asked you by what arguments it can be proven and persuaded that it is permissible for a separated adulterer to marry again without scandal. But I hear that your occupations are so great that hardly a tenth could satisfy them. Nevertheless, as you have never deserted me with your skill and work in interpreting the scriptures, so now I also ask and demand from you for the sake of our friendship. For the people of Constance completely deny that what cannot be done among us or that either a divorce must be refrained from or a different and more severe penalty must be inflicted on adulterers or that a new marriage, which has the fault of divorce, should not be so easily admitted. All of which, as I look far and wide, our people will not easily admit. Thus, evil is added to evil while we do not do everything rightly according to the word. Therefore, my dear Heinrich, if you have any advice, as you certainly do, share it with me.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and always write about what is happening with you. I hear that less pious people have been added to your council. May the Lord guide and preserve you all. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>December 14, 1532.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>The brothers from Strasbourg have most gratefully advised our council by letter for the restoration of the harmony of the cities and the defense of the miserably oppressed pious.</p>
      <p>To his dearest brother Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
