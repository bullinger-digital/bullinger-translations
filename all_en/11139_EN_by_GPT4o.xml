    <p xml:id="regest1">After Luther's response has arrived and, according to the assessment of the people of Basel, aligns with the [First Helvetic] Confession, he hopes that Bullinger and his colleagues, particularly Pellikan, will reach the same conclusion, just as Bullinger has approved Bucer's [“Report from the Holy Scripture...”]. He does not understand that Bucer's reputation in Zurich has suffered due to his appearance in Bern, as there is nothing to criticize about the outcome of the negotiations there, and Kaspar [Megander's] catechism has been reviewed and expanded, but not altered. He suffers from the fact that certain people use the Gospel as a pretext for disputes; although he cannot write openly, it will soon become clear what he means by this. He requests a statement on Luther's response.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You finally have Luther's response, which is simple, pious, and true, at least in my judgment and that of all of us here. May God grant that you see it the same way. It does not seem to differ from the common confession. However, since we do not all have the same perspective, I await your judgment; for I am not overly anxious about others (except for Pellikan). They have rejected me, though I have never deserved to be rejected in such a way. I commend the matter to the Lord. I beg you, my dear Bullinger, to be a steadfast man in simple truth. You once recommended Bucer's opinion on the Eucharist to the people of Münster in writing. Since Luther desires nothing else, make sure you persist there, so that division does not occur.</p>
      <p>I understand from some that Bucer is heard worse among you than ever before, after he defended himself in Bern. I wonder who is the author of the claim that he did something wrong there. I have dismissed the acts; what, I ask, is to be criticized in them? Kaspar's catechism has been commonly seen and expanded (for not even a jot has been changed). What is it, then, that is attributed to him, as if he acted either impiously or secretly or in some unknown manner? Oh, emotions! Let us pray to Christ that he is truly placed as the foundation by all of us, so that emotions do not deceive us, and that we do not please ourselves except in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I speak only to you; I know that you do not interpret my words badly, which keeps me in the duty of writing. For if the situation were otherwise, I might have stopped long ago.</p>
      <p>It pains me, more than anyone believes, when I see certain contentious people acting in such a way that, unless God protects it, the Gospel will sometimes not be the Gospel among us, but rather a seedbed of fires, dissensions, and calamities that are not pleasing to God. "What are they doing?" you ask. Through lies, they cause good men to be seduced and to separate into factions. "Why don't you speak openly about what the matter is?" I would indeed dare to speak with you if I were present (as I have written before); I do not dare to commit such a thing to writing. But the time will come when you will understand where they are heading, which I am indicating.</p>
      <p>Write back sometime, especially your judgment on that response, and please do not abandon me.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with your family.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 24, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most beloved lord.</p>
