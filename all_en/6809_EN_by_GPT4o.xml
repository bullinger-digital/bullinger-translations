      <p>Revered Father. I ask you to forgive my tardiness and brevity; for I neither always have nor know who might come to you, since I live apart from the town, nor do the many troubles allow me to write more. However, it consoles me that you are aware of my respect towards you, so that, although I am slow and tardy in writing, you can in no way doubt my goodwill. This Pole is called Stanislaus Ilovius, a man learned in Greek and Latin, who has written and published many works, and has been my friend and acquaintance for many years. He wishes to see you and to establish friendship and familiarity with learned men. He comes from Italy. You will be able to inquire and understand from him if there is anything new. We are well here by the grace of God, but I am consumed by the lack of companionship of learned men. However, since I was born not for myself, but for Christ and the church, and Christ has called me here, I must bear everything with a calm mind; I only ask that He may ensure I do not live here in vain. May He also keep you safe and sound for us and His church for a long time. Farewell, and you will greet the brothers in my name. Chiavenna, June 10, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours, Zanchi.</p>
      <p>I have greeted the Saliceos and they return the greeting. [Fridericus] has set out for Hungary to his brother. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, revered father of the Zurich church.</p>
      <p>To Zurich.</p>
