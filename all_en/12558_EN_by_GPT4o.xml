    <p xml:id="regest1">The [Augsburg] city clerk [Georg Frölich] received a letter from Bullinger [not preserved] this week, indicating that Bullinger had entrusted a letter for Haller [No. 2494] to the Rapperswil [Hans Rych]. However, just as Bullinger only received Haller's letter addressed to him from June 1st [correct: May 31st, HBBW XVI, No. 2451] on July 9th through [Rych], Haller will probably also receive Bullinger's letter entrusted to [Rych] with a delay, especially since [Rych] has presumably followed the field camp. And should Bullinger's letter have been opened by the opponents (which Haller naturally does not wish), it would not have such dire consequences for the [Schmalkaldic League] as it did for the Imperialists when (as Bullinger may have already learned from Frölich) about 800 letters from the imperial post were confiscated at the pass [Ehrenberg] near Füssen, and consequently, all the secret intentions of the Emperor [Charles V.] came to light. Thus, the Lord thwarts the plans of his enemies!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- What Haller feared from the Helvetians has come true. But at least the people of Zurich should prove steadfast! Perhaps God now gives them the opportunity to avenge their ancestors who fell [during the Second War of Kappel], for God will likely punish the Helvetians for their unreliable, mercenary loyalty. It is certain that God (Lord over both the Helvetians and the antichristian Pope [Paul III.] and over the whole world) is on the side of the [Schmalkaldic League]. This can be concluded from the purity of their doctrine, the authenticity of their faith, and especially from their now demonstrated willingness to repent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The [Schmalkaldic cities], together with Duke [Ulrich of] Württemberg, have more than 60 companies. Ulrich and [Elector Frederick] of the Palatinate each have 1000 horsemen. Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] also leads a large army, to which many horsemen and foot soldiers join additionally in Franconian Mergentheim (the seat of the Teutonic Order). According to [Jakob] Herbrot, the Landgrave is said to have no less than 5000 cavalrymen and 20000 infantrymen. The Emperor never has so many! [Elector John Frederick and Duke Maurice] of Saxony and the Cologne [Arch]bishop [Hermann of Wied] also have their troops and will protect their own territory and that of the Landgrave and prevent reinforcements for the Emperor from the Netherlands. The Saxon free Hanseatic cities prevent the supply of provisions to the neighboring territories of the enemy. Also, [Albert] of Prussia, Margrave of Brandenburg, would do much if he could. Herbrot learned through a letter from Antwerp that King [Christian III.] of Denmark has occupied the North Sea with 400 ships, so that Flanders, Brabant, Holland, and Zeeland receive no more food. Therefore, there is great inflation in Antwerp and throughout the Netherlands. [King Francis I of] France is said to have sent the Landgrave a supreme commander [Rheingraf Johann Philipp of Dhaun] (probably out of cunning). He wrote to [Sebastian] Schertlin that he would soon fight at his side and had ordered the soldiers provided by the French king to go to Strasbourg and wait there for further instructions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [King] Ferdinand has married his daughter [Anna of Austria] to the young Duke Albrecht of Bavaria in Regensburg. He married his daughter [Maria of Austria] to Duke Wilhelm of Cleves (probably to "thank" the Cleves house for its bad behavior against the Emperor).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The Mainz [Arch]bishop [Sebastian of Heusenstamm] had to present the concerns of the other electors to Charles V. However, he was not ready for peace negotiations, arguing that the [Schmalkaldic League] proved rebellious against him. [Heusenstamm] then withdrew. Ferdinand also left Regensburg. But the Emperor, who has less than 1300 soldiers around him, does not know where to go. Two days ago, a neighbor living in the same house as Haller returned from Regensburg. He reported how the imperial soldiers were already speculating on the possessions of the Welser, Herwart, and Herbrot. The imperial troops expelled from Füssen are gathering again in the Freising region. There are 6000 [imperial] mercenaries near Eichstätt. Only on July 15th were about 20000 Italians mustered in Bologna. Therefore, they cannot arrive in [Germany] before mid-August. The [Schmalkaldic League] will not wait until then. They would have attacked the Emperor long ago if they had not wanted to wait for the Landgrave. They almost control the entire diocese of [Augsburg]. The [Imperialists], however, waste the dirty money they have collected!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Haller admonishes his listeners by warning them of the bad example of Achan and Belshazzar. He also does not accept gifts, much to the displeasure of his colleagues, to be able to silence everyone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- With the news transmitted here, he merely wants to keep Bullinger informed and not give the impression that he relies on human help. God alone decides the victory!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- So that Bullinger can see with what cunning Augsburg was approached, the following. First, the Emperor demanded in writing that the people of Augsburg remain calm, as he was not moving against them but only against some disobedient princes, especially since he was well-disposed towards the cities. This ruse was seen through, and Augsburg replied that they were obliged to the princes through the [Schmalkaldic] alliance and felt affected themselves.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- When [Charles V.] achieved nothing in this way, he summoned, among others, the Fugger and the Welser to him and conferred with them. They demanded in writing that their relatives and friends leave [Augsburg] because the city would be plundered in a few days. This was intended to frighten the other citizens, prevent them from helping the Landgrave, and persuade them to beg the Emperor for mercy like the treacherous Nurembergers. This ruse almost succeeded, for the population was greatly frightened by the flight of the wealthy. It was feared that all the city's businesses would be suspended to the great detriment of all. But the guild masters were strengthened both from the pulpit and personally by the council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Since [the Imperialists] could not lure all the wealthy out of Augsburg, they claimed that the people incited against them would rob all their goods. However, this remained ineffective.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Finally, the Emperor threatened to block the goods of all the [wealthy who remained in Augsburg] (Frölich estimates this property at 4,000,000 florins) in their branches in Italy, Spain, Antwerp, etc., which would naturally lead to wage losses for the employees in Augsburg. This temptation was great, for one had to choose either God or Mammon. But the people of Augsburg did not give in and replied to the Emperor that he could not deprive honorable people of their property, especially since he had to guarantee law and order.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- The Great Council decided to adhere to the chosen course with body, life, and property. In view of this steadfastness, the city's enemies openly declared war. Consequently, the city also armed itself. Bullinger can now see how much God was active among the people of Augsburg. They are ready to die for [eternal life]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- If only the Helvetians would also show such a spirit! Haller is ashamed of them! He spoke with [Swiss mercenaries], including those from Toggenburg and Thurgau, who do not want to return home. They behave decently but do not get along well with the [German] Landsknechts.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Haller asks Bullinger for indulgence for his somewhat chaotic writing, which he has not entirely composed in Latin but mostly in German. The reason for this is not only his many tasks but also his currently joyful yet unfocused mental state. For last night, a son [Johannes] was born to him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Greetings. Request for constant prayer. In 14 days, it will probably be known who is the victor and who is the vanquished.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- [P.S.:] Haller intended to interpret the Book of Genesis. However, the current turmoil prompted him to comment on the Book of Judges. He uses the notes he once made during Bullinger's sermons. Had not a colleague already interpreted the Book of Jonah a few months ago, Haller would have preached about it according to Bullinger's advice.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace through the Lord Jesus, etc. The city clerk received a letter from you this week, in which you mentioned, among other things, that you sent a letter to me through the Rapperswil messenger, who also delivered my letter dated June 1st to you on July 9th. You wonder if I have received it. But just as he delivered my letter to you late, he may also have delivered yours to me late; for I have not yet seen him or the letter. I believe he went straight to the camp. I fear they may open any decrees you wrote. But I do not think that opening them could harm us as much (although I would have liked them to be kept safe), nor could any enemies find such things in them as ours found in the letters, about 800, intercepted with the imperial post near the Füssen passes, which our people still hold. For all the secrets of the adversaries have been revealed, as you may have learned from Mr. Laetus. The Emperor was found to be such as he did not want to appear until now. Thus, the Lord does not cease to reveal the thoughts of men and to scatter the plans of his enemies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>What I feared from the Helvetians has happened, although I have long known what to expect from them. Be strong and unyielding! What if you were given the opportunity to avenge your fallen ancestors? However, I entrust it to the Lord, who will not leave their mercenary faith unpunished. We have Him on our side, who is the Lord of the Helvetians, the antichristian Pope, and the whole world. The purity of religion, the truth of faith, and, most importantly, the sincere repentance with which the people now turn to our God, indicate that He stands with us. These arguments alone console me and make me certain and confident of divine help. Nor, as far as human means are concerned, do we lack anything.</p>

      <p>Our people have more than 60 banners with the Duke of Württemberg, 1000 horsemen from Württemberg, 1000 from the Palatinate, and the Landgrave is bringing a very large army. On the way, he encountered many in Mergentheim in Franconia (a very powerful Teutonic Order), both horsemen and foot soldiers, whom he made swear allegiance to him and leads them against those they were previously to serve. Herbrot told me yesterday that he has no less than 5000 horsemen and 20000 foot soldiers. The Emperor never had such an army. The Saxon leaders with the Archbishop of Cologne also have their troops, with which they will protect their own borders and those of the Landgrave and prevent any reinforcements from coming to the Emperor from Lower Germany. The free Saxon cities, which are called the Confederates and the Maritime, are behaving very bravely, intending to prevent the hostile neighbors with the considerable forces they already have. Likewise, the Grand Master from Prussia, the Margrave of Brandenburg, would do much if he could. The King of Denmark (this is certain: letters from Antwerp arrived for Herbrot last night) has occupied the German Ocean with 400 ships, so that Flanders, Brabant, Holland, and Zeeland admit no supplies; hence there is such a high price for grain in Antwerp and throughout Lower Germany that it is intolerable for them. The French king, I do not know by what trick, sent his supreme commander to the Landgrave (his name escapes me), who wrote to Schertlin that he must soon be at his side with his troops, namely those sent by the French, and ordered them to go to Strasbourg, waiting for further instructions. I have all this from Herbrot.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Regarding the Emperor, I have this: Ferdinand gave his daughter in marriage to Albert, the young Duke of Bavaria. The wedding took place in Regensburg, where he also gave another daughter to Wilhelm, Duke of Cleves, as a reward for his loyalty. He also celebrated the wedding in Regensburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Archbishop of Mainz proposed to the Emperor what he had in his mandate from the other electors. The Emperor replied that he could not find any conditions for peace, as we are acting so seditiously against him. He then left again. Ferdinand also left Regensburg. The Emperor does not know where to stay. He has no more than 1300 soldiers with him, as my host, who lives in the same house with me, told me. He came from Regensburg only two days ago. He said they are very insolent: they are already speculating on the possessions of the Welser, Herwart, Herbrot, etc., sharing the loot as if they had already caught the bear. That group and swarm, scattered by our people near Füssen, is gathering again near Freising. Near Eichstätt, he has about 6000. Besides that, nothing. Italians, about 20000, were to be mustered in Bologna on July 15th. They cannot arrive before mid-August. Meanwhile, our people will not wait for their arrival. I hope we will become either bishop or bathkeeper. Only the Landgrave is awaited; otherwise, they would attack the Emperor directly. Our people have almost conquered the entire bishopric. That gold from Toulouse is being plundered as it was collected.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I faithfully warn publicly not to abuse it. I propose to them Achan and King Belshazzar, etc. I reject all gifts, so I am not forced to flatter. I do not want to make myself a participant in these things, God willing. They, because their mouths are shut, remain silent with great indignation from the other colleagues.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I write all this to you, venerable father, not to trust in any human help (I know who holds victory in his hand; I know how we should turn to him if we want to hope well), but to inform you of each detail. Forgive me, therefore, for occupying you with these trifles, although if I had ever understood that this effort of mine was unwelcome to you, I would write to you less frequently about each detail.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I add this one thing, so you can see how our city was tempted to defect, yet how our people, inspired by the divine spirit, overcame these severe temptations. First, the Emperor wrote to our people, asking them to stay safely at home and not oppose his plan. He claimed he would punish some disobedient princes. However, he wished well for the cities. Our people, understanding and sensing the monster that lay beneath, and knowing they were obliged to the princes by the alliance, and that their own cause was at stake, replied to the Emperor that they could not do this without losing honor, truth, and indeed the entire empire.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>When this achieved nothing, he took another approach. He called the Fuggers, Welsers, etc., to him, with whom he conspired. They sent very serious letters throughout the city to their friends and relatives, urging them to flee the city. For within a few days, the city would be miserably plundered. They did this to instill fear in the remaining citizens, so they would remain quiet in peace and not help the Landgrave, but rely on the Emperor's clemency (like the treacherous Nurembergers). And indeed, they would have achieved something with this art, had the Lord not intervened. Such a great fear had seized the city that nothing was above it, with the wealthier fleeing. It was also part of the art that they instilled in the common people: with the wealthy fleeing, they would have no means to live; all their trade and workshops would stop; hence the ruin of the poor and the entire city would follow. And indeed, this argument would have had much influence among the common people, had the Lord not given another counsel. All the common people were publicly (privately by the magistrate) encouraged by the tribunes (guild masters) and also by us in sermons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>They attempted a third method, suggesting to those they could not lure away that the people, already incited against them, would plunder all their goods. But they did not achieve much here either.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Fourth, since the Emperor saw them so obstinately against his majesty, he wanted to seize all the merchants' goods they had in Italy, Spain, Antwerp, etc. If he did this, all the citizens would have lost everything they had, and it would be ruined, because all their money was in these associations. If the Emperor were to seize everything everywhere and ruin the associations, the common citizen could not be paid; thus, everyone would have to lose their own. Mr. Laetus says they have over 4,000,000 florins in the Emperor's domain. You see, Bullinger, how great these temptations were! Here, indeed, one had to cling to either God or Mammon. But our people were not broken here either. Instead, they turned this argument against them: If they consider the Emperor's majesty more honorable than to commit such villainy, to take from honest people what is theirs by force, while he should protect justice and fairness. Thus, they excellently eluded them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>And a whole Great Council decided that they would, in this undertaking, since they see what is being sought, lay down their body, honor, goods, courage, and blood, as long as they have it. Seeing this constancy, those scoundrels declared open war. Consequently, our people also armed themselves. And so the matter stands, as I said above. You see how God was in the midst of us! Certainly, there was a need for prayers, public and private exhortations. May the Lord preserve this spirit in us forever! By God and the truth, everyone desires to die and to be healed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>If only all the Helvetians were like this! I am now ashamed of them, as they respond so poorly to the great expectations placed on them. I have spoken to many here who are reluctant to return to their homeland. Most are from Toggenburg and Thurgau. They behave well, but they do not get along well with the Landsknechts. They give each other good caps, although it is strictly enforced.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I write all this to you, mixing serious matters with the ridiculous, as to one whose humanity is so well known to me that I am sure it does not bother you. Forgive me, however, I beg you, for writing so Germanically, barbarically, scarcely a third in Latin. Partly because the number of tasks makes me hurry, partly because my mind is now wandering and joyful because of the son who was born to me last night. Forgive me, therefore, and farewell.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Greet the family and all the brothers. Pray, I beg you, unceasingly. We see the fruit and within 14 days we will see whether we are victors or vanquished! Let us press on! The Lord will fight for us.</p>

      <p>In Augsburg, July 24, 1546. Yours most devotedly, Johannes Haller. I was about to begin Genesis, but with these troubles arising, I took up the Book of Judges, in which I am greatly helped by the diligence with which I once wrote down your sermons on this book from your mouth. I would have taken up Jonah, as you advise, had not another minister expounded it a few months ago.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and father, to be revered uniquely. Zürich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
