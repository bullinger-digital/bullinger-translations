    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger had a letter delivered through Rudolf Schinz in recent days [No. 1608], but it is unknown whether it was delivered. He sends a crown and a batzen for a bound copy of Bullinger's commentaries on the Pauline and [Catholic] letters [HBBibl I 84f or 91]; if the money is not sufficient, he will promptly send the remaining amount; the courier will safely transport Bullinger's book and can also undertake further services. Greetings, also from Comander's colleagues. Pray for us, for we are in no small danger!</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I had sent a letter to you these days, dearest Bullinger, through Rudolf Schinz; whether it has been delivered is not certain. The most important thing, however, is that it contains a request to find Bullinger's commentaries on all the epistles of Saint Paul and other canonical letters in a larger format, elegantly bound, with you. I am sending a crown and a batzen; if anything is lacking, I will also send it without delay. You can safely entrust the book to the bearer of this letter, for he will take good care to bring it to me intact, and if it happens that I can serve you or be of use to you in any matter, command me. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From the Chur of Rhaetia, March 6, 1542. We wish all brothers well. Pray for us; for we are in no small danger or neglect. Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the venerable man in piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and brother to be respected.</p>
      <p>Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
