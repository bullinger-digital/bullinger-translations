      <p>Greetings. Today, while the council was in session, our messenger arrived; therefore, I could not speak to anyone about this matter. The letters were soon read and it was decreed that others should be written there; what they contain, I do not know, for the council had just adjourned. In the meantime, I read the letters you sent from Philipp, Johannes a Lasco, and Hyperius, and I thank you greatly for sharing them with me. Musculus also read them, as did Mauritius, and they were very pleased with them. Musculus wrote a letter yesterday, which I am sending enclosed here. We are greatly troubled by the matter of the common oath. Our people have remained firm by the grace of the Lord until now.</p>
      <p>Now I hear (but how true this is, I do not know) that the envoys of Zürich have given some hope to the others in Baden that they will agree with them, which I hope will never happen. We are seriously pressing the matter here so that they remain steadfast and consider how great a sin this is against God, and how much offense it will cause among foreigners. Today we will also meet with the consuls about this matter. We have decided to approach the council and the deacons this week, if necessary. We do not want anything to be sinned here due to our negligence, and we hope the Lord will be with us and grant us success.</p>
      <p>As for the Genevans, our Mauritius was there these days; he was received kindly. He reported various things to Calvin that are said about him; he denied them all. At the same time, he heard strange rumors throughout Savoy about Calvin and other ministers; hardly one in a hundred can be found who speaks well of him.</p>
      <p>The one who is held captive here has confessed nothing yet. Our people have sent a messenger to Geneva for the confession he made there; once it is brought here, more will be done with him. He is Roman by birth and somewhat learned.</p>
      <p>These days I had with me [Mr.] Thomas Lever, an Englishman, with three others: they were with me for two days, and today they departed from here towards Lausanne. They greatly praise your kindness. I have nothing to add now. I will write more in the coming days about the translation of your Decades, which our Apiarius will bring there. All of ours greet you; we wish all of yours well. Bern, October 7, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Mr. Peter Walther, our consistory's beadle, passed away, with whom your students stayed; therefore, they will need to find other lodging; I do not know where they can be conveniently accommodated.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed and dear lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The oath by the saints.</p>
