    <p xml:id="regest1">[Rudolf] Gwalther has arrived safely [on his journey to Regensburg]; Zwick has taken care of him according to Bullinger's request. [In Regensburg], discussions have already taken place regarding the doctrine of justification, but the outcome is not yet known, and in the article on the sacrament, [Contarini] is making demands that cannot be fulfilled, while the question of the Pope's authority is said to have been postponed; Gwalther will report in detail. [The Protestants] should not respond to the treachery of their opponents in kind. Greetings. Recommends Georg Wimpfer, the pastor of Stein [am Rhein]; his many years of service and his family circumstances would justify a higher income.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther has arrived safely to me, and I have carried out everything you wished me to do in your letters in his name, and there is nothing so great that I would not always do it in your name.</p>
      <p>We are daily expecting more certain news from the assembly. We know that a discussion has been initiated among the deputies; we do not know the conclusion, but we are awaiting the outcome. They have discussed the article of justification, but how they have agreed is still uncertain. Now they are discussing the article on the sacrament; but the papal legate insists on transubstantiation and adoration, to which our people object, as is right and as the glory of Christ demands. They say the article on the authority of the Pope is suspended.</p>
      <p>As soon as I learn anything certain, I will not hide it from you, although now you will have Gwalther, who will inform you of each detail. Let us pray to the Lord without ceasing, that we may not commit anything unworthy of Christ. We are certainly dealing with very cunning men, and it is not right for us to act cunningly with foxes. It is fitting to invoke Christ, that we may overcome with simplicity and integrity.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, May 24, 1541.</p>
      <p>I wish the whole family well.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>I commend to you Lord Georg Wimpfer, the pastor of Stein am Rhein; he is a man worthy of having his salary increased by your generosity, because he has governed that church for many years with the utmost faith and great labors, and finally, because he, being poor, is daily increased with many children. Remember him, I beseech you.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
