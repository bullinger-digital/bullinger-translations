      <p>My service, dear lord and friend. On October 3rd, our troops marched from Donauwörth to meet the Emperor, who has gathered all his forces at Nördlingen, day and night. On the morning of the 4th, there was very intense skirmishing in the fog. They have taken the city of Nördlingen and the nearby hill. And after the fog lifted, both armies were in the open field, with only a small stream between them, a quarter mile apart from each other. Both sides arranged their battle lines on horseback and foot, as if a battle must be fought. And after our forces advanced with their formation against the enemy, the Emperor withdrew to a hill in a favorable position, which is why our forces did not want to attack. Both sides continued to skirmish heavily until night. On October 5th, nothing significant happened until noon, as both sides remained as they were the night before. God knows what the evening will bring. No one can predict the Emperor's intentions. I hope to God, if he attacks, he will find enough enemies.</p>

      <p>I hear that the Palatinate and Württemberg are supposed to be strong together. Additionally, Duke Maurice has 2000 armored horses and 6000 foot soldiers and his rural population, so wherever he goes, he will find enough support. If he then moves back towards Donauwörth, it is expected to be well secured.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>May the Lord God have mercy on the poor rural people, who are so severely afflicted by the tyrant's troops with murder, arson, and pillage, that it cannot be adequately expressed. We all pray to the Lord God to turn away His wrath.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Do well and ensure this news reaches the chancellor in Lenzburg, as he has to inform my friends and neighbors of the same along with my well-being.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Dated Höchstädt, October 5th, 1546. I have neither time nor space to write much. Yours willingly, Hartmann von Hallwyl.</p>
