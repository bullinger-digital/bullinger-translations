      <p>On the 5th day before the calends of August, I sent you a serious letter; I wrote extensively and diligently about Polish matters. For as soon as I arrived in Antwerp, nothing was more important to me than to inform you about everything. Now, receive my notable calamities. Woe is me, most esteemed teacher, I have been miserably deceived, betrayed, and subjected to unworthy insults; oh, what a lost and calamitous affair!</p>
      <p>You know that Aegidius of Ghent, who was there with me; I falsely thought him to be faithful and well-instructed. I had dispatched this scoundrel with letters and very serious instructions to the lower regions; I had also instructed him to have 50 ducats transferred to me from my merchant (with whom my money was deposited). The matter was well taken care of; the money was counted out to me. While I was traveling from Strasbourg to Cologne, I suffered severely from my foot; a toe was in danger of being amputated; I lay in a public inn for many days, paying more than half a crown each day for food and a servant, and moreover, I spent the money I had intended to send to you solely on doctors and surgeons; for unless I am mistaken, I was forced to pay 17 crowns to the doctors and surgeons.</p>
      <p>I arrived in Cologne healthy; my money was spent. I again gave instructions to the merchant for 60 ducats; the boy left with that money. That injury would not have moved me much if he had not committed graver offenses against me. In Cologne and Antwerp, in front of everyone who knew me, he denounced me as a Zwinglian and a most lost heretic, then claimed that I had conspired with Bucer and Calvin against the emperor, insulted John a Lasco with unworthy insults, and almost betrayed him; he said he wanted to report my name to the court.</p>
      <p>Moreover, he not only slandered my name with insults and reproaches but also most impudently betrayed those to whom I had sent pamphlets against the Interim and on avoiding superstitions.</p>
      <p>Greatly moved by the indignity of this matter, although I had realized the business later than was just (for I was expecting him every day), I did not think such nonsense should be ignored. I decided to pursue the treacherous scoundrel, and I learned that he had stirred up great disturbances against me in Antwerp. I reached Ghent from Cologne by long journeys, but my effort was in vain; they say he fled to France. I earnestly remonstrated with his parent, regardless of the expense, and ordered an inquiry. I will do what seems best to be done.</p>
      <p>This is the gratitude I received from that treacherous scoundrel for my kindness. Furthermore, in Antwerp, I feel the attitudes of many towards me have changed. However, while I was in Ghent, this Spanish prince was being inaugurated by chance. Why should I tell you much?</p>
      <p>In this prince, there is a remarkable and unbearable arrogance; to omit other things, he did not even give a nod of benevolence to the entire senate publicly receiving him. I am silent about the abominable and foul things that fly through the mouths of men; for I think it is the last thing that he knows no other language than Spanish. The wretched people of Ghent provoked the insatiable lust of the Spaniards upon themselves with their spectacles; for among seven arches (which they had erected in the manner of the ancients, Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and the remaining forms composed), a thousand virgins of the most excellent form with torches confronted the entering prince on high seats. But about these trifles from others. The emperor is nurturing something monstrous; for it is certain that he has about four thousand horsemen in Arlesia; he expects a numerous infantry, as I have heard from a trustworthy source, up to forty thousand. Where he will turn these arms, the matter itself will declare. I greatly fear that this simulated friendship of the emperor will bring great harm to England; for in his court, they speak and think very badly of that excellent boy. The affairs of England are as follows: very serious and dangerous uprisings were stirred up by the peasants against the magistrates. These evils were given occasion by the new nobility; for they had seized certain public goods, which did not belong to them, such as fields, meadows, pastures, forests, and other such things, which, because they were usurped against the laws, these disturbances were stirred up by the common people in the name of liberty. These matters were prudently countered; for the king restored public places, forgave the common people their errors. But the matter finally flared up in a remarkable way; for idolaters stirred up seditions, who altogether desire the papist religion to be restored to them. Certain priests were the authors of these evils, having been caught, they paid the penalty; for they were hanged.</p>
      <p>Many, moved by the admonitions and benevolence of the princes, desisted from their purpose. The people of Gorduba are still in arms; they, having deposed the excellent Archbishop of Canterbury, recognized their own Winchester, although imprisoned, as their metropolitan, a most wicked people and especially hostile to the truth of the gospel. Against these, by the king's command, a numerous and strong army has been sent, with whom it will undoubtedly be decided by the sword, unless they return to grace in time. It is easy to predict how much danger threatens England from these more than internal wars. Many are those who secretly wish for the emperor's arrival. On the occasion of these tumults, the Scots, who seemed to be seeking peace, have taken great courage. A rumor was also spread by some that the king himself had died and was being maliciously concealed by the protector. For this reason, the matter came to London with great pomp on the 10th day before the calends of August; his sight added much courage to the good. As for religion, alas, the studies of men are divided into various opinions; one part plainly depends on the Roman idol, the other again is miserably torn apart. Many are agitated by the fury of the libertines; the pestilent opinion of the Anabaptists has prevailed among many; few receive Christ purely, if you compare them with the lost sects; now the minds of some of the leaders seem to waver.</p>
      <p>We are indeed losing heart as we see so many monsters arise as soon as the kingdom of Christ is established. There is almost despair about the discipline of the church in England. The churches of the Germans and the French are not succeeding. These are the things I thought should be written to you about English affairs. The rest, which I add, I do not want to affirm as certain as the previous ones. Therefore, I will insert the word "it is said." By this last legation, which was in Bruges, the minds of many pious people were terrified; for it is said that the English are seeking new alliances and especially a marriage with the daughter of Ferdinand; furthermore, Charles is said to have responded that he would agree if his new religion is accepted by the king, that is, the Interim. They say that Lord Legate Paget was greatly disturbed by this jest; he replied that he would refer the matter to the king. It is firmly affirmed that the English want to hand over Boulogne to the emperor, which I hope will turn out most happily.</p>
      <p>Lord John a Lasco waited for me for a long time, sent many letters to me, which have only now been delivered. Know that he has gone to Prussia; from there, if possible, he will gladly travel to Poland.</p>
      <p>I trust I will meet him in Prussia; I will inform you about everything. Indeed, I have also received letters from Poland; some of the leading men urge me to keep myself intact as much as I can, but they do not specify in what business. If they mean religion, they are greatly mistaken; therefore, these things should be disregarded. I am well aware of my own weakness; certainly, there is still great ignorance of divine matters in me, which I willingly acknowledge.</p>
      <p>By my zeal, labor, and duty, I will not fail the church as much as I can. Finally, I am of the mind that if my life is to be spent in this care and concern, I would consider it well spent. I have replied about the inscription of your third Decade; if someone more worthy offers themselves, I would like you to inscribe it to them; but if you are so eager for ours, know that nothing is more important to me than your friendship, nothing more ancient. I will never be ashamed of your name, and I will also arrange my way of life so that I do not seem unworthy of your friendship. Here I have made great expenses, and that scoundrel took the rest. I am very sorry that I have kept yours for so long; I will ensure that this does not happen any longer. I hardly have what is in hand for the expedition. It is incredible how much the foot disease has exhausted me.</p>
      <p>You will have the skins of our country from me immediately. The books I promised are ready; I wish everything would be taken care of faithfully! Since I regard you as a most esteemed father, I can conceal nothing. About John Brickman, who delivered yours to me, I had high hopes; certainly, he dealt with me less piously, selling his books to me at a most unfair price, twice as much as others. I discovered this in Antwerp in reality. I am indignant at these impostures, from which Christians ought to be far removed. I had already decided to send you the Lives of Jovius; you said you had bought them. I was very sorry. I beseech you, most holy father, to write to me about any books you need; if I have them in my library, I will gladly send them. You cannot be a burden to me; if I offer this service to others, I owe it to you above all. Contrary to my expectation, Hebrew books were brought to Antwerp from Venice for me; the transport cost me greatly. What remains, I beg and beseech you by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and by his glorious coming, strive for concord, unity, and peace. I have dealt with Bucer in many writings, and I have realized that he will easily descend to concord, which would have already happened if he had found Lord a Lasco in England. He speaks and thinks most honorably of you. I think we should abstain from all insults; let the detractions cease now; for some in England do not even refrain from the name of the most faithful Archbishop of Canterbury. How rashly and inconsiderately they do this, you yourselves judge. I offer my zeal, labor, and finally my life as dutifully as I can, if you judge that unity and concord can be built through me as an intermediary. These things are meant to show that you should not think anything so difficult for me that it would not be pleasant to undertake for the sake of this unity. You will do me a great favor if you diligently write about your affairs. I expect frequent and serious letters from you, which you will ensure are delivered as the previous ones.</p>
      <p>Forgive me; I could not write more; for I am consumed with grief because of these quarrels, which have almost prevailed in Poland. I pray to Christ, the best and greatest prince, that he may keep you safe for us for as long as possible. Greet the most excellent lords Pellican, Theodor, and Zwingli. Commend me to the prayer of the church. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>In Antwerp, on the 6th day before the ides of August 1549.</p>
      <p>Your servant Florian Susliga from Warsaw, a Pole, by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful teacher of the church of Christ among the people of Zurich, most esteemed teacher. To Zurich.</p>
