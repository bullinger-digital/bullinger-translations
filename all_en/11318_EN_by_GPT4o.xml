    <p xml:id="regest1">Must spend part of his salary of 24 guilders on meals, as these have been cut since the students of the Pädagogium fled from the plague; therefore, he was pleased to hear that he could possibly become Rhellikan's successor, and asks to be appointed to a position, as he is already heavily in debt and Froschauer no longer wants to wait [for the repayment]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>My situation in Basel was such, as I have already written, that I would have board and 24 guilders. But since all the students fled from the Pädagogium (school) because of the plague and none are returning, it is not unreasonable that the board is denied, which was previously given for no other reason than for me to lecture on the "Offices" and to repeat from the "Supper". Only the 24 guilders remain, for which I continue with Herodian; and because 24 guilders per year are not sufficient for me (for I cannot even buy board with it, let alone acquire other necessities), I was very pleased to recently receive your letters about me possibly taking Rhellikan's place. Although you did not affirm anything certain, in the meantime, I have not sought any other position here in Basel, thinking it would be improper to seek or offer a position that is about to be abandoned. Therefore, if it is not yet time to return home, I ask nothing else from you and the other college leaders than that a few years be granted, during which I may hold some office, so that I do not incur greater expenses. I have already offended my father enough with the magnitude of my debts, and rightly so, neither does he grant more, nor does Froschauer wish to wait any longer, and therefore I earnestly beg your kindness not to hesitate to inform your most obedient son through the next messenger what seems best.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest father, with your wife and children. Basel, May 23, 1539.</p>
      <p>Otho Werdmüller, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. Zurich.</p>
