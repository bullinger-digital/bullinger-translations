    <p xml:id="regest1">Visited Constance to discuss the unity of the Church against the schismatics. The great danger is shown by Bucer's reports No. 290 about the unrest in Münster caused by a student of Melchior Hoffman. In Schwenckfeld's actions and teachings, he sees the cause of the Anabaptist turmoil as well as the uncertainty of Leo Jud. The association with Schwenckfeld harms Jakob Ziegler, Johannes Sapidus, and Sebastian Franck. Dominik Zili could be at risk. Zurich supports the efforts of Jakob Meyer to unite Zurich, Bern, and Basel. Shares from letters of Berchtold Haller No. 307. 309 how the re-Catholicization of Solothurn is progressing and that Bernese envoys spoke there and Solothurn envoys in Bern because of this, and that Hans Franz Nägeli became treasurer in place of Bernhard Tillmann. The agreement between the French king and the Pope will lead to a war over Württemberg and thus enable the conquest of Milan by France. The king only fears that the Confederates will deploy troops against him, which the pension lords will try to exploit against Zurich's council by taking advantage of the economic misery. If so, then apparently God wants to destroy the Pope and the king through them. Berchtold Haller wanted to report little about the Bernese embassy to the French king. Requests news from Augsburg and encourages Vadian to continue working on his work Epitome.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I wrote a few days ago that we went to Constance to consult about the unity of the Church against the schismatics. There is a danger that a great fire will soon be kindled throughout the churches of Germany by certain schismatics, who, recalling the heresy of the Donatists and Novatians, will cause considerable harm to the already afflicted Church. This opinion was not mistaken. For in the previous month of last year, Bucer wrote that Münster in Westphalia, which had beautifully received the evangelical doctrine, is now miserably in turmoil. For all the city's churches are closed except one, in which a certain notable disciple of the Hoffmannite sect, relying on the support of the people, preaches against the consensus of the holy senate and all the pious, and the author of this disturbance is Schwenckfeld, who first secretly spread this poison to some, and now, pretending and dissembling, acts in Augsburg. I fear, however, that he is nurturing some monster there as well. Certainly, Blaurer is very much complaining. Perhaps you know the man's doctrines, that the gospel has not yet been truly preached, that no church has yet been gathered, that our church is nothing but tyranny, as it relies on the arms and edicts of the senators, that there is no sword in the church, that the church people are voluntary, that sects should not be extinguished. He does not entirely disapprove of Anabaptism and the Anabaptists. He was the first to invent Hoffmann's doctrine of the flesh of Christ being brought down from heaven, although he now dissimulates. I have seen letters written to our Leo, in which he asserts this. There are many impious and seditious doctrines of this man, which have so disturbed Leo - consider this said to you - that it was no small reason for my going to Constance. But thanks be to God, Leo has been restored. After a very sharp rebuke of Schwenckfeld, he finally added at the end of the letter: "Since I see that you are driven by the spirit of Satan, I now bid you a final farewell." I wonder how that cunning demon can insinuate himself into the friendships of great men. I do not know the man by face. I have read many of his letters to Leo and Carolstadt, whom I wish he did not have as such a familiar! He has often greeted me in letters. But I have always avoided the friendship of this man, whose character has always been most suspect to me, fearing that it would someday be fatal to good men. Nor do I see what he has contributed to either Ziegler or Johannes Sapidus. Certainly, if what I hear is true, I am indeed grieved that such great men are so shamefully and foully stained. Nor will Sebastian Franck leave this pitch without being thoroughly stained. I write this with the greatest sorrow. The church is otherwise miserably shaken by temptations, so that it would lack this dissension, if not driven by certain spirits of faction and pride. But the Lord recalls to us the old history of the church with living examples before our eyes, who will undoubtedly give a happy outcome to the temptation. You, most vigilant Vadian, should take care that our Dominik, born for factions and a most intricate head, is not completely ensnared by these tricks and impostures of impostors. I fear danger, I know nothing certain. Schwenckfeld is frequent and shameless in writing letters and seeking friendship, especially where he hopes to obtain something. O miserable and in this part pestiferous Strasbourg, to which such inauspicious birds fly to us! But enough has been indulged to grief so far.</p>
      <p>Now, in a few words, receive what has been done in mending the concord of the triad. The Basel consul at present requested nothing else than that the Zurichers forgive the Bernese if they have designated any fault or negligence. Then they should be accommodating if a proposal for Christian concord is offered. It was answered with the unanimous consent of the deacons: We love Bern, and we have no hatred towards them. If they have acted negligently in anything, we easily forgive and do not refuse to listen if any advice is offered to us, etc. We therefore hope that minds will easily unite. We have also urged the consul not to let the cause happily begun lack Basel's support. We have written to Bern, imploring them by all that is sacred. In short, all the pious are most auspiciously predicting. I therefore pray to the Lord to lend a helping hand to the weary affairs and to assist them maturely.</p>
      <p>On December 23, Berchtold wrote about the people of Solothurn: "We sent 4 envoys to advocate for the cause of 8 exiles and for the freedom of the word of God, as the Solothurners themselves had promised to the Swiss envoys. But as far as the free preaching of the word of God was concerned, they did not even deign to hear a word from us. Hence our envoys returned with the matter unresolved. Meanwhile, we were warned that on December 14, the Solothurners were about to appoint a priest to the parish of Kriegstetten for nefarious rites. But since the ears of those from Bern are sharp, and the Solothurners themselves hold the matter of faith maliciously, the Solothurners were immediately warned by the Bernese senate not to do so; and 300 men were organized in the Bernese territory to resist with armed force any rash attempts, if it could not be otherwise. When the Solothurners learned of this, they sent an envoy to Lucerne. What he obtained, I do not know. I only know that on December 18, the Solothurners sent 4 envoys to Bern, who appeared before the senate with the most flattering words. Those who previously disdained to hear the Bernese envoys now offered themselves to allow the cause of the exiles to be settled. Meanwhile, they made no mention of the word of God. Our people responded that they did not want to do anything in the cause of the exiles unless the matter of faith was also involved. If this could not be done, they would do nothing, especially since the exiles themselves, pious and steadfast men, demanded it. The senate added that they would openly complain at the next Baden assembly that they violate faith and rescind agreements." On December 28, he wrote the same: "Our senate has now again sent a delegation to the Solothurners concerning the exiles and the freedom of the word. You would not believe nor can it be described or said the madness and impious fury of this people. They have dismissed 25 pastors and preachers of the word. From Alsace and Breisgau, priests flock in droves. There is no regard for either equity or truth among them. I will write shortly what has been done. 57 citizens have already migrated from Solothurn. Now they begin to forbid it in the city, and if anyone wants to leave, they are told to become a citizen and are taxed. If he estimates it too highly, the next one can take it from him for the pledged amount. But if he wants to leave, he must pay 10 guilders. I report it as it has been reported to me. They are fortifying heavily in their city." So far Berchtold. He also added: "Tilmann has been removed from the office of treasurer, and Francis Nägeli has been appointed in his place."</p>
      <p>What you divine about the intentions of the King of France and the agreements with the Pope is so true that nothing truer has ever been said, namely that he covets Milan. For this reason, he arms the German princes against Ferdinand for the Württemberg prince, so that the German soldier, hindered by a German war, may freely yield Milan to the French to be plundered and captured. He has no greater concern for the Swiss, unless they bear arms against him. It is enough for him that we are divided among ourselves. Although I do not doubt that the pensioners will try everything. Perhaps they will exploit the opportunity of famine and the miserable and ill-advised poverty of the people. Nevertheless, we will not cease to exhort our people, nor will our senate cease. If an army is indeed led out, perhaps it is in the fates that the most just God wishes to overthrow and utterly destroy the impious Pope and the king, ruined by pride and luxury, along with their most avaricious and wicked satellites. The Lord will not leave unavenged the innocent blood shed for so many years.</p>
      <p>But listen to what you will marvel at: The Bernese sent a delegation to the King of France, the consul von Wattenwyl and Wingarter. About this delegation, Berchtold wrote: "The consul returned from the king. We did not seek help from the Assyrian king, but we want the peace long agreed upon to be maintained. Our faith is accused of treachery and sedition, especially now by the example of the Solothurners. Therefore, lest we feel enemies whom we believed to be friends, a delegation was sent. I will keep silent about the occasion of the delegation. You have the cause, and I hear that what was sought has been obtained. I am not allowed to say more. But I have written this only to you." So far Berchtold. Nor could I say more now.</p>
      <p>If you have anything from Augsburg, let me know. Work on your ongoing project and keep me in your thoughts.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>January 3, 10 o'clock at night, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Joachim Vadian, a particularly dear and sincere friend.</p>
