      <p>Greetings. I received your book on the Anabaptists, my dear Bullinger, some time ago and thought I had already thanked you for it; since I have not done so, I hope you attribute it to forgetfulness, not ingratitude. I acknowledge that the gift, which is very welcome, came through your kindness; I will repay it with any service I can. Regarding your son in Pforzheim, I acted immediately after the Easter festival at the court; however, I could not accomplish anything again because the steward, the hofmeister, who is responsible for the distribution of duties at the court, was absent. But Mr. Rissenzan, the court preacher, a pious and learned man, promised to take care of the matter, from whom I expect a response at any moment and am surprised I have not yet received anything, knowing that the usual deadline of the St. John's festival is approaching. We responded to the envoy of the Polish churches the same as you did there.</p>
      <p>We unanimously detest Stancari's doctrine and will write our opinion in these days. Philip's death is very mournful for the churches, as I understand, and not unjustly so, given the many virtues of one person lost by his passing. May the Lord restore others in his place and mercifully preserve the survivors.</p>
      <p>Many attempts were made with our Hospinianus; however, since he defends his own views in all things, nothing could be settled with him; perhaps time will bring him to wiser thoughts. We offered reasons and means by which he could easily return to full favor.</p>
      <p>We have cleared our ministry of accusations before the church, but moderately and without mentioning his name; we have not reported anything to the magistrate, as we wish to spare both him and Oporinus; we consider the pamphlet to be ephemeral and therefore less likely to cause harm.</p>
      <p>We receive no news from Germany, nor anything certain from France; if you have anything, please inform me and... Farewell with all your family.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 18, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
