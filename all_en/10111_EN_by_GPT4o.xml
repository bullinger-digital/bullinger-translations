    <p xml:id="regest1">Showed Bullinger's letter to some trusted individuals. Jakob von Wattenwyl will be Bern's representative at the meeting in Aarau; Haller hopes that Zurich will send Diethelm Röist. He gives advice for Bullinger's relationships with leading figures in Bern and reports on the steps taken by Bern regarding Salat's "Tanngrotz"; Bullinger should respond to Salat without revealing the printer. Haller is worried about the anti-reformation forces in Bern. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Dear brother Heinrich.</p>
      <p>I have understood your diligent and earnest letter and have given it to those whom I trust. And we find that over time we have also become entangled. One must scratch the bear until it becomes tame and gentle, and its fierceness is subdued. On the appointed day, Junker Jakob von Wattenwyl, whose Christian heart is well known to you, is sent to Aarau with a reasonable mandate, as I understood. Would to God that Herr Röist were an envoy; among our people, I know of no one more agreeable at this time. However, even if nothing is achieved, it will undoubtedly be a means to a lasting concord, namely that those from Schaffhausen and Basel are inclined towards us, seeking some concord, and if they are granted what they desire, then they will put aside and dismiss all discord between the two cities. They have also suffered for our sake; thus, they are more gentle and agreeable and respected by both cities.</p>
      <p>I write this to you as a precaution; note that Imm Hag will inform you further, as he is more zealous and earnest in this matter than anyone else, and also more trustworthy than anyone else. Erario not so much; but Wagner, Trempen, the builder Augsburger, Vischer, Petro Cirono the city clerk are all trustworthy. I write this so that if you have time to write, you know to whom. In the meantime, Erarius should not be neglected, for I sense that the man relies so much on his own prudence that whatever is not conducted either by his counsel or with his knowledge, he opposes with all his might.</p>
      <p>Regarding the little book, our lords have written to Lucerne. Their response: they know nothing about it; we should inquire with the printer. It has also been written to all 5 places and each individually concerning those from Bremgarten. A poor response was given again, as if they had the power and authority; yet they intend to finally give an answer after the holy time (Easter). Be aware, decisions will be made in these assemblies.</p>
      <p>Regarding the response to the "Tanngrotz," do not ask much, although some among us think it should be called "Kressich" (garden cress), which is what the one who calls himself Salat wants. There are bears of the same kind among us. If you wish to handle this, ensure that the printer is not known, for you well remember what happened to Adamo Petro from the people of Lucerne. We can endure a response, and it is also necessary. But you will not receive much honor from our writing, as we have become evangelical and free from such things.</p>
      <p>I ask you to respond soon to Sepiano, that is, Imm Hag, as he rejoices in your writing and is capable. Your friendly writing has moved many; the reasons for our displeasure you will understand from the enclosed letter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter of the godly people, we cannot proceed, as we must await the opportunity. They are determined to manage the four places. However, if a resolution of peace is desired, it is not possible; it must be brought to an end. I fear the Immotani will not allow it, as we also did not in the previous peace concerning the article of God's word. This from Erario and Sepiano. In summary: old envoys, senators, cobblers, papists are sent to the assemblies. Therefore, we are always left in the dark, which is also the case in the assemblies; for they are so concealed that we receive nothing unless other assemblies are already to be requested. Oh, that God would have mercy on this war: how many hearts he has turned. Now I know nothing further. May the Lord direct your ways, to the glory of His name, the advancement of the gospel, and the salvation of the fatherland.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>The last of March.</p>
      <p>Your senate has written a long letter to Megander concerning the mass. I fear the French mass will be worse than the papal one. The noise and clamor always break me. Today my feet have again performed their duty. The rest from Rellicanus. Kolbius and others greet you. Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>Year 32.</p>
      <p>Greet Pellican, Leo, Carolstadt, and others.</p>
      <p>Your least coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
