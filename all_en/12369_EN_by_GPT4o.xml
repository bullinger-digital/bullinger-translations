    <p xml:id="regest1">Birck was very pleased with Bullinger's greetings in his letter to [Johannes] Haller [HBBW XV, No. 2302] and is grateful for Bullinger's affection.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Birck writes to Bullinger at Haller's request, not out of ambition, but because he has already received some letters from Bullinger and does not want to let Haller travel [to Zurich] without a response, even though the [Zurichers] would probably expect [letters] from preachers rather than from schoolteachers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Haller will report on the state of the Augsburg church. Information about Haller himself is not necessary, as he is known to the Zurichers. However, it should be emphasized here that the young Haller has fulfilled the difficult task entrusted to him so well that even an older person could not have done it better. Through his example, one can now better understand why Paul did not want his young Timothy to be despised. The [Augsburgers] are amazed that such a young person can be so mature, theologically knowledgeable, and eloquent. It was rumored that he was the son of Zwingli; perhaps because his arrival was indeed reported; others said he was the son of Blarer, because he has much in common with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- In the factional dispute of the [Augsburg] church, Haller has conducted himself in such a way that not even his detractors can criticize anything other than his doctrine. Haller will certainly describe more vividly than Apelles what his opponents have to criticize about the Zurich faith. He will still experience many things that will test his virtue and steadfastness. Birck suspects that Haller will steadfastly withstand all assaults, even if the [Augsburg] church has to go through some things because of his presence.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Bullinger should take Birck's private opinion about Haller well.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Not long ago, venerable father, our Haller conveyed your greetings to me from a letter addressed to him, which, as was fitting, delighted me greatly. For such acts of greeting are indeed certain signs of sincere affection. Therefore, I congratulate myself on your affection. The love with which I have embraced you since the time your name became known to me, and the veneration with which I have pursued you, is known well enough to the knower of hearts.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Our Haller urged me to write to you; which I was going to do anyway, not out of ambition, although it is a kind of ambition when inferiors rashly send letters to superiors. But since you have deemed me worthy of your letters once and again, I thought it would not be inappropriate to send my little letters to you, as circumstances demand. For it might seem a kind of inhumanity if I were to send Haller off without letters, although this duty was rather to be expected from others, namely preachers, than from schoolteachers, who are held in no regard.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Nor should you expect me to write anything about the state of our church; Haller himself will clearly declare that. Nor is there any necessity to write anything about Haller, who is more known and familiar to you than to us, but because he is young and has been sent by you into a province that, due to the wickedness of most people, does not require a young man, but rather an old ox, who is accustomed to setting his foot firmly; yet by his example, we observe that Paul did not want his Timothy to be despised because of his youth. For whether you consider solid learning, he is to be compared with any well-practiced elder; if we consider the gravity of his character, his modesty, his humanity, his sanctity, he lacks nothing, even if he were to count many years; to one judging his modesty, he might seem a virgin. Our people have admired that in such a young man there is such maturity, such progress in solid theology, such clarity and grace in speaking, so that he might rightly regret that he so negligently cares for his youth. From the beginning, a rumor had spread that he was the son of Zwingli, perhaps because the news of his arrival had already been spread. Others said he was the son of Blarer, because he has much in common with Blarer. And for this reason, he was more pleasing to many, especially to those who think rightly and truly about piety.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But what shall I say about this, that in the factions by which our church is miserably torn, he has conducted himself in such a way that even his rivals have nothing to criticize in him except his doctrines? Moreover, what his rivals have plotted against not so much him as against the Zurich confession, he will undoubtedly depict so vividly that not even Apelles could do it more graphically. He will have much to exercise himself with and to let the virtue divinely instilled in him shine forth more. You are sending him into that school where his virtue and constancy will be tested. In short, I predict for our church that, although it may suffer some disturbances because of him, he himself will stand like a steadfast wall, yielding to no importunity.</p>

      <p>This is my private opinion as a schoolteacher about Haller. Take it well. Augsburg, January 4, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, X. Betul.</p>
