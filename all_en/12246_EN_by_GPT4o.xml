      <p>Greetings. I have been relieved of great concern, most learned Erb and dearest brother to me. The person to whom I had entrusted your chapters on the Resurrection, along with the dedicatory letter, has finally reached me, or rather returned, and has returned the letters entrusted to him along with the chapters, so that now everything is safe with me. He was bedridden for a while, and because he feared that sending them later might cause inconvenience, he returned and humbly gave them back. Therefore, since Christoph [Froschauer] will soon print our dissertation on the priest and king Christ reigning in the church, he will add the booklet on the Resurrection. It will be printed before the feast of St. Michael. I therefore pray that you continue to devote yourself to me and do not take anything amiss.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matter (which you know) in Augsburg, about which I gave you some information in previous letters, I anxiously await a response. For the best people are also urging me. Therefore, see to it that you do not remain silent any longer.</p>
      <p>We are all well here, except that Mr. Georg Binder, a learned and pious man, formerly a schoolmaster, has passed away, indeed the day before I wrote this.</p>
      <p>Please respond to us. If you send it to Basel to Gast or Myconius, they will ensure it is delivered to me.</p>
      <p>May your scribe, a sincere and good man, be safe, along with our Gerold. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 19, 1545.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Matthias Erb, preaching Christ in Reichenweier, dearest brother. To the preacher in Reichenweier.</p>
