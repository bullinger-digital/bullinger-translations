    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's report on the Zurich church and for the greetings from his family. [The English students] heard upon their return that the authority [of the Zurichers] had suffered due to the unfortunate retraction [of Bucer]; they immediately turned to [Arch-]Bishop [Thomas Cranmer], who received Bullinger's work ["De scripturae sanctae authoritate... libri duo"] kindly, as did [Thomas] Cromwell, and forwarded the copy intended for King [Henry VIII.], upon which the King is said to have wished for its translation into English; Cranmer and others will write to Bullinger at the next [Frankfurt] fair. Eliott, in his letter to Bullinger [No. 1159], probably wrote about Cromwell, Maltravers, and the Polsteds; Bishop [Hugh] Latimer, who was extremely grateful for Bullinger's gift, wanted to write to him himself, and Edward Wotton, who received the book with great pleasure, offers him his services. In all parts of England, by the King's command, the Gospel is being preached, the Virgin of Walsingham and other images have been destroyed, the flames of purgatory are being extinguished, and there is a struggle over private masses; Bullinger will learn more about the promising negotiations of the Saxon and Hessian envoys [Franz Burchart, Georg von Boyneburg, and Friedrich Myconius] at Cranmer's palace in Lambeth from John Butler. He has sent British fabric for making trousers, along with gloves for Butler, for Bullinger's wife [Anna], for his mother [Anna], his brother [Johannes], and his brother's wife [Margaretha], and sends greetings to the whole family. Sends a Roman coin from Michael Drome, who has written to Bullinger [No. 1153], and asks to write to him and Richard Tracy, the [foster] father of [Bartholomew] Traheron; encloses six booklets. Wishes for a transcript of Bullinger's sermons on the Gospel of John. In England, pewter dishes are polished with Flemish chalk.</p>

      <p>S. D. P. Your report, honorable teacher, about the state of your church and the greetings sent from your excellent wife, mother, and sweetest children, were very welcome. I sincerely pray to the Almighty God that He may keep you safe and preserve the church in this pure and holy religion.</p>
      <p>Now, let me briefly inform you about what happened with your book dedicated to the king and the copies sent as a gift. When we reached our homeland, we diligently inquired about the state of the kingdom; and here we learned from trustworthy people that your authority had been greatly diminished due to that unfortunate retraction, whatever it may have been. Therefore, we first approached the Archbishop of Canterbury, who received the book sent to him very kindly: we also offered him the king's book as a courtesy, and to make it more commendable. At first, he refused and thought it would be much more useful if it were handed over to Mr. Cromwell, and he would recommend it to the king. However, after dinner, he himself requested the king's book and promised to give it into the king's hands, with us present, in case the king wanted to inquire anything from us. He prepared himself for a continuous reading of the book, so that he would not seem to recommend something unknown to the king. He ordered us to return after two days: soon we approached Mr. Cromwell; Eliott handed him your book along with the letters; he received them very kindly and read the letters, although he was overwhelmed with a flood of business: that night he was going to the court, having some business with the king, to whom he undoubtedly showed the book he had received that day. When the Archbishop of Canterbury learned of this, he immediately sent his book to the king, as we could not be present; but we gather that the gift was pleasing to the king from the fact that the king said to those present that he wanted it to be translated into English. The Archbishop of Canterbury had promised to inform you of all this at this fair. However, five days before I was about to leave, I approached him: I asked if he wanted anything to be conveyed to you through me; he replied that he did not have your letter at hand; for he had left it at his residence, fifty British miles from London, where he now resides. You will expect letters from everyone at the next fair.</p>
      <p>Regarding Mr. Cromwell, Matreface, and Polscedis, I believe our Eliott mentioned them in his letters to you: certainly, Bishop Latimer asked us two or three times if we wanted to return to these parts; for he would very gladly write back: believe me, nothing in life has pleased him more than what you sent him. At that time, I could promise nothing certain: but whether he wrote back to you, I certainly do not know; for when I sailed from England, he was more than two hundred miles from London, from where we sailed. Mr. Edward Wotton received your book with the greatest joy and is diligently engaged with it; and he ordered me to inform you, since he cannot write himself, that he is entirely yours, if he can gratify you in any way. Religion is progressing beautifully among us. By the king's command, people have been sent to all parts of England to preach sincerely. I suppose you have already heard about the destruction of the Virgin of Walsingham and other idols. The burning fire of purgatory is now being extinguished among us: there is a great controversy over private masses; for the envoys of the Duke of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse, who are almost daily present at the religious discussions at the Archbishop of Canterbury's palace in Lambeth, are still negotiating in London. They promise us the best, and we cannot help but hope for the best. You will learn the rest from Mr. John Butler: forgive me for not writing more now.</p>
      <p>I sent you British fabric, from which you can make two pairs of stockings, one white, the other black: also 6 pairs of Oxford gloves; you will give one pair to Mr. John Butler, one to your wife, mother, brother, and his wife, and one pair to yourself. I wish I could gratify you with greater gifts. In the meantime, I know you will take these in good part. Please greet your wife, mother, children, brother, Mr. John, briefly the whole family, most dutifully in my name. You will also receive a Roman coin from Froschauer, which Michael Drome gave me as a gift, who has also written to you now. I wish you would write back to him at the next fair, and send a letter to Mr. Richard Tracey, the father of our Traheron; for he greatly favors you: I hope you can benefit our Traheron with this. Here we send you six booklets, not that I wish to respond to your books sent as a gift, but to testify that I am mindful of you with some small token. Farewell happily. Frankfurt, 17th of September.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, NICHOLAS PARTRIDGE</p>
      <p>I wish someone would transcribe for me what you preached on the Gospel of John: I would reward him well and faithfully.</p>
      <p>I think pewter dishes are usually polished in England with Flemish chalk. To the distinguished both learned and pious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed teacher.</p>
