      <p>S. Although I wrote to you more extensively about individual matters last Friday, venerable father, I did not want to send our Lord Jodocus's wife to you without a letter. I am now expecting your response and when you might send some of the pilgrim brothers to us; I will certainly make every effort to ensure that as many as you send will be received and supported for a while until they can be of use. I commend Musculus to you again and ask for him; what I should do for him again, I am eagerly awaiting your advice.</p>
      <p>Indeed, he is a good, pious, and learned man. Because of his pursuit of peace, he has fallen into such weakness that he writes less openly, but in the meantime, I would not blame him for the error, which was due to weakness.</p>
      <p>The state of the church, which he served, must also be considered. Although I do not defend it entirely in this regard, I would like some judgments to be moderated by charity and consideration given to the spirit in which someone has done something. If Musculus did not think correctly, he certainly would not have fled to us, would not have used me so familiarly in Augsburg, and if I could have tolerated him, neither Laurentius Agricola nor Svitzerus would have ever tolerated him. But in this matter, we all certainly agreed with him. He would indeed wish that his writings had been pressed for the ninth year. Therefore, let us receive and support him as he returns to us.</p>
      <p>If there is joy in heaven over a sinner repenting, let there be, I beseech you, also among us over a brother so pious and learned, who thinks with us and flees to us. Who is there anywhere who has not erred in individual matters? We preach and extol the fathers with praises, although no one is unaware of how many errors they themselves were sometimes entangled in, and would we condemn and reject such brothers who have deserved so well of the entire Christian republic? Wolves must indeed be kept away from the churches, but care must also be taken that we do not become wolves and exclude the returning sheep. Poison must be avoided; but not everything that has the color of poison is poison. A more discerning judgment is needed. If Musculus felt against our open truth, he would indeed not have me as a whole friend, but rather a significant enemy. These are my thoughts on him.</p>
      <p>I will add a few things about the scholastic matter. We ask, 1., that there be a fixed number of stipendiaries (scholarship holders) everywhere, both in the countryside and in the city, so that a fixed order can be maintained. 2. It has been granted by the lords that examinations and censures be held at each angaria (compulsory service). 3. We ask that in the countryside, namely in Brugg, Thun, and Zofingen, where the schools are more renowned and stipendiaries are also supported, examinations and visitations be held at least annually. 4. Classes should also be organized in a fixed order in the countryside, and those who have reached such a level of education that they can attend public lectures should be transferred to the city with certain stipends. 5. In the city, the classes of the lower school should also be reformed. No one should read anything other than what seems most fruitful by our common counsel. 6. Public lectures should be instituted: 1. theological, 2. Hebrew, 3. Greek, 4. logical, 5. mathematical, physical, or ethical. 7. The more learned should be sent abroad, and certain stipends of 40 florins should be established for them, so that unnecessary expenses are not incurred. 8. There should be three public professors, each of whom should have two lectures besides the theologian. 9. As for morals, certain laws should be established for the students. 10. Those who attend public lectures should listen to sermons daily.</p>
      <p>And other such things. In the meantime, I have obtained 12 1/2 florins, which are to be spent annually on those declaiming both in German and Latin; for I heard that Sultzer once distributed something like this; but it has been discontinued for some time. I have restored it so that there is no lack of encouragement for the students. I will also ensure that something is contributed to the library annually.</p>
      <p>I wanted to write these things now, so as not to give nothing. I wrote hastily; it will be your task (as with everything) to consider these things well.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man, with your wife, children, and entire family. Greet all my most esteemed lords and brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 16, 1548.</p>
      <p>Always ready for all your services, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Bullinger, his dearest lord and compatriot. M. Heinrich Bullinger in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
