    <p xml:id="regest1">Johannes Stumpf comes with [the] 13 books [of his "Swiss Chronicle"] to Vadian, to explain to him the content of each of these books, to seek Vadian's opinion on them, and to be able to produce the works of both without contradictory statements. Vadian should take time for Stumpf and receive him kindly.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Johannes Stumpf (Ioannes Stumppffius) comes to you, most distinguished man, bringing with him the books, which he has numbered 13, to show you what he has, and to compare what each one has individually, in which you agree, and in which you do not agree, so that the work may come out on both sides entirely consistent and similar. Your Humanity will not deny him a little time; indeed, I beg it to receive and treat the most pious and excellent man kindly. Farewell and always love me, most esteemed lord. Zurich (Tiguri), June 3, in the year 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger (H(einricus) Bullingerus tuus).</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Joachim Vadian (Ioachimo Vadiano), his always esteemed lord. St. Gallen (Sangallen).</p>
