      <p>My willing service, etc. Dear lord and brother. I have well received your last letter, in which you report that you have good hope that the lords of the Confederates will not send any soldiers to the murderous king, which they are also quite right to do. And I can truthfully tell you that my gracious lords of Zürich, as well as Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, have unanimously and most strongly forbidden the journey with explicit words, that no one should go to the king in France, but rather everyone should be prepared to wait for my lords, in view of the fact that all sorts of evil (these are the words of the edict) practices and counsels for the preparation and suppression of our Christian religion are said to be present, as has then unfortunately been shown in some places in a very miserable and cruel manner, etc. These are the words to you verbatim, upon which everyone in the city and country has prepared themselves, and thus waits to see how it will go and how God will arrange it.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, people say differently: some want to go to France, others do not want to go. But I believe it will happen, ut impleant mensuram suam (so that they may fill up their measure). From France, we otherwise hear nothing but lamentation and distress. May God be gracious to them and to us!</p>
      <p>What news I have received this week, I send to you here. From Geneva, they write to me nothing else, the rumor is, though uncertain, that Bergen has been taken by the Albanians. I cannot know which is true. It is true that the Albanians have become so strong; sed si dominus nobis adesse voluerit, facile difflabitur omnis impiorum potentia (but if the Lord wishes to be with us, all the power of the wicked will easily be blown away), etc.</p>
      <p>Tell Dr. Johann Baptist Müller that his letter has reached me, and I would like it to be true with Dieppe and Montmorency. Greet him for me and apologize that I do not write. Dr. Simler will write to him about some condition with the Prince of Hesse. Also, share this news with him. If you have any specifics about the so-called appearance in the sky, let me know and especially inquire where the new Spaniards, who have arrived, are landing or heading, and if they intend to approach us, let me know in time, etc.</p>
      <p>The Lord be with you. Greet all of ours.</p>
      <p>In great haste, October 10, 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
