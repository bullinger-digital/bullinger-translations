      <p>The Elector Duke of Saxony, instigated by our Lutheran enemies Selnecker and Schmidelin from TÃ¼bingen and other gross consumers of the body of Christ, is completely furious about our books, which he has banned throughout Saxony. He is also furious with those who share our confession, and has imprisoned almost all professors and preachers of the Wittenberg school. He forces all his followers to subscribe to a confession, than which you have seen nothing more absurd and complicated. But these are the judgments of God; God will find the guilty in His own time. Nothing certain is reported from the Netherlands. In France, King Heinrich is expected, who has left Poland and taken leave behind the door, making a great mockery of Poland. May God grant that he has learned so much on his journey in Poland and in the Polish school that he will bring peace to France; for if he does not and continues in murder, God will deal with him as He did with his brothers. May God forgive him and grant him grace.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, a day of the Confederates (Swiss Confederation) will be held in Baden, which my lords have described, to see if it might be possible to negotiate peace in France, etc. I cannot know if anything might be achieved, especially since some are leaving the country with sincere intentions (though miserable things).</p>
      <p>May the Lord guide them also on the path of peace or scatter the nation that desires war.</p>
