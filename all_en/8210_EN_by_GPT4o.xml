      <p>S. I rightly love you, most illustrious man, and likewise honorable lord and dearest brother in Christ, whom I find to retain and cultivate the friendship once begun with the utmost diligence and faithfulness.</p>
      <p>What you narrate to me happened many years ago, and yet they still cling very firmly to your mind. For which reason and for the unique and most desired Irenaeus now also sent to me by you, I give the greatest thanks to your kindness. For a long time, I have wished that among so many learned and pious men, someone would arise who would begin to attempt this, which I now see you have accomplished in Irenaeus, the most holy doctor of the church, not only with joy but, as is right, I praise you as much as possible. May the Lord reward you for this your holy and useful labor on that day and increase your strength, so that you may also give us other ancient writers illuminated in the same manner as Irenaeus and especially Justin the Martyr translated by you into the Latin language with the Greek set alongside, who preceded Irenaeus by some time and seems to be the oldest of all those who exist today. To whom I would also like to add the epistles of Ignatius, (a. R. epistles?) which are also printed here in Greek, together with the epistle of S.</p>
      <p>Polycarp, which I have only seen in Latin, if they did not seem to have many things inserted by reckless men, which the very reason of the times refutes as false; but this evil could be remedied by you with added annotations or scholia. In Tertullian, a writer far most learned and useful, the blessed memory of Beatus Rhenanus, a man equally learned and diligent, worked successfully; but after his death, several books were found in England and other places and printed in Basel together with those he gave us, which seem to need much more censorship and scholia than those earlier ones; for among these are those which St. Jerome reports were written against the church. In which matter I gather that you can do not a little from the annotations of Irenaeus. Hence I would wish you to also devote your effort to Tertullian, yet in such a way that Rhenanus's works are not omitted, but joined with yours. Either I do not understand Clement of Alexandria, or his reading seems to be of little use to students of theology. In those times, in which he wrote, he was not useless, nor would I think him to be overlooked either because of his antiquity and varied learning. Eusebius valued his works greatly, nor indeed should either Arnobius or Lactantius be neglected. Johannes Ludovicus Vives worked successfully in explaining the books of St. Augustine's "City of God," whose diligence could be useful in explaining Arnobius with scholia, and Arnobius and Lactantius would seem to be joined into one volume just as Ignatius and Justin. But you have long since conceived far superior things with you. May the Lord grant you the most successful progress. But why do you seek my judgment on your labors in Irenaeus from me, you indeed promise yourself more from me than I can provide. I am not one who ought to assume the censor's rod over your holy and learned lucubrations; meanwhile, however, I frankly confess that your work is approved by me. The preface is learned and useful; indeed, the whole work is beautifully illustrated with prefixed arguments of each chapter, so that a diligent reader can obtain as much fruit from these alone as from the most verbose commentaries elsewhere... The annotations make many otherwise obscure things clear, and those which were less considered harmful have been made harmless through them, if only one does not despise their own plans and easy explanations. However, at the end of the annotations fol. ult. face 2. I do not think you agree with the Brentians, who deny and utterly deny heaven, the seat of the blessed, to be a certain place, which the Lord himself affirmed in John 16 and the orthodox church has hitherto believed and the ancient fathers have attested. You undoubtedly know what my dispute with Brentius on this matter was, even published in letters, etc.</p>
      <p>But forgive me, lord and brother, for having disturbed your holy studies thus far with this lengthy letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell well and continue to love me. Greet our Mr. Beza, Mr. Portus, and other fellow ministers. I have written once and again to Mr. Beza, I await his response, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 11, 1570.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger the elder, minister of the church of Zurich, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Nicolas Des Gallars, minister of the church of Geneva, faithful, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
