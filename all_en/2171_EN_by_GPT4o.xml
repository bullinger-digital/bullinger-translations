      <p>S. Regarding your relative, I strongly believe you would act wisely if you were to write to our councilors, Mr. Bernhard Meyer and Theodor Brand, and indeed separately to each of them, in such a way that I receive the letters from you and deliver them. On this occasion, I can also personally address them about this matter, as I mentioned before, and inform you of the response I receive. Regarding your agreement with the church in Geneva, I trust you, as you write; concerning the money intended for your students, I learned through their letters to me from Jakob von Brunnen that the entire sum has been paid there, and I was informed that the promissory note is to be presented by the same Jakob to Isengrin, which I did today, intending to send you the testimony of both Jakob and Isengrin, as Jakob did not come. I have no special news, except that Junker Klaus von Hattstatt came from Nancy in Lorraine within 8 days; however, what he negotiated or for what reason is unknown, but it is widely suspected that the Roman king has a secret understanding with France. It is certainly true that some French lords are supposed to come to Spinal and Remelsberg shortly to inspect the places and passes there, and they are expected there every day; what will come of it, time will tell. May God turn it for the best. This is what some have written to me from Alsace, which I did not want to hide from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all your family. Basel, January 27, 1554. Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
