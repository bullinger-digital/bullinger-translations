      <p>Greetings. Since various and false rumors are being spread about our army, I wanted to inform you of what I have certainly learned from letters written to me on August 26th. The camp of Philipp was set up three miles beyond the city of Doullens, and there they fortified themselves with high ramparts to be secure from our forces, who occupy the river Somme, where the king was also supposed to be present on August 28th. There was a battle between the Spaniards and the Germans of Philipp, and about three thousand Spaniards fell. I do not think that anyone from those armies is sleeping soundly.</p>
      <p>From this, the lords can achieve something good, which would be more difficult in times of peace. If I had had anything greater and more certain, I would have written to the most honorable council.</p>
      <p>You will greet him with my words and, if these seem worthy, share them with friends. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, September 4th.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>In Heidelberg, the Palatine wrote to me with another elector and some princes that they are in the process of negotiating peace. The emperor has not yet replied... the Diet of Augsburg, however, urges contributions against the Turk. It is conjectured to be against the king, as he has the most severe edicts published against those who neglect the oaths of the Augsburg Confession. Philipp is still expecting some Germans, who are coming from the ecclesiastics. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich.</p>
