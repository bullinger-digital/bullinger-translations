    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to two letters from Bucer [No. 517 and 531], he once again presents the doctrine of the Lord's Supper contained in the [ZÃ¼rich Lord's Supper] Confession [No. 482]: The biblical expressions must be interpreted in such a way that the spiritual presence of the body of Christ, mediated solely by faith, cannot be misunderstood as physical; Bucer and Oecolampadius have not gone beyond this in earlier writings. The minister only presents the sign - this view has not been changed by his reading of the Church Fathers and Aquinas; it corresponds to the statements of Zwingli and Oecolampadius about the body of Christ. Bucer thinks too highly of Bullinger; his commentaries on Paul are only the fruit of the gifts given to him by God. He did not find it necessary to mention the writings of the Wittenbergers, which he only glanced through, in his commentaries, but he did explicitly name Melanchthon's "Dispositio" and [Justus] Jonas' ["Annotationes"]. Scholasticism is sufficiently familiar to him through Melanchthon's "Loci" and through Catholic writings. Since a council under the given circumstances can only harm the Gospel, no special preparation is required. The French king justifies the cruel persecutions by referring to the opinions of German theologians; on one hand, he defends himself in a writing probably authored by Guillaume du Bellay against the Germans, and on the other hand, he tries to please the Pope with a decree against the Lutherans. The opinions are pernicious; especially that of Melanchthon contradicts his "Antiplacentinus" and gives the opponents cause for triumph, but Bucer also concedes too much to the papacy, whose tyrannical character is immutable. Greetings to the brothers in Augsburg.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received two letters from you, dear brother Bucer, one of which was quite lengthy, in which you write about the sacramental cause and our confession, stating that, as far as the matter itself is concerned, we agree, although there are some things in our writings that you wish were clearer. But why are the same things repeated so often in this matter? The issue seems to hinge on the manner of presence and the mode of exhibition. What need is there for more words here? We do not recognize any other presence of the body of Christ in the supper than that which is of faith and sacramental. This can indeed be proven by the scriptures. A physical or carnal presence cannot. We acknowledge these expressions: The bread is the body of Christ. The wine is the blood of Christ. Here, however, so that the simple do not err and venerate the signs instead of the things themselves, we explain the expressions, so that we neither nullify nor profane the signs. Scripture has its own manner of speaking about the sacraments. The same spirit said: "This is my body" [Mt 26, 26 par] and "the sacrifice is the Passover" [Ex 12, 27], "circumcision is the covenant" [Acts 7, 8], "arise, be baptized and wash away your sins" [Acts 22, 16] etc. These are understood only by the faithful. Unbelievers interpret the signs uselessly. But concerning this matter, after that confession of ours, I wrote an apology in place of a preface to the articles of Zwingli for Zwingli. For as far as the word of exhibition is concerned, we do not see the minister exhibiting anything other than the sacrament of the body of Christ. The faithful eat the body of Christ not by the benefit of the ministry, but by faith. The impious participate in the sign, not in the thing itself. If the unbeliever also ate the body of Christ, he would eat it by the power of the ministry. And thus, the body of the Lord would not be eaten by faith alone. Yet the minister is said to wash away sins, to forgive sins, and so also to exhibit the body of the Lord, but in his own manner. Therefore, we accept such expressions, as we have testified in our confession; but because they are symbolic, we will not allow the ability to explain them sacredly and with the fear of God to be taken from us. The holy fathers themselves have explained this saying of Christ: "This is my body" by this: "This signifies my body." And it is safer to walk in simplicity than to involve the matter in such a way that the church does not know whether we assert a spiritual or a corporal presence. I do not say this to shame you or to believe that you are the one through whom the ability to explain symbolic expressions is taken away, but to encourage you to read our confession more diligently. For although we may agree a hundred times, we will not give more than we have given, unless we are convinced by the clearest scriptures. Indeed, you yourself in your Expositions on the sacred four gospels have given us no more. Oecolampadius gave no more in his last little book to Melanchthon's letter. In short: Christ is present. The mode of presence is spiritual. This mode is understood by faith. Likewise, the flesh of Christ is eaten in the supper. It is eaten spiritually. Only faith knows how to eat spiritually. Therefore, the impious do not partake of the flesh of Christ, but they partake of the sign. Therefore, the minister exhibits nothing other than the sign. To the good, he exhibits the body of Christ, which is eaten by the power not of words, not of the ministry, but of faith.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it would be safest if we speak in the manner of the ancients that ministers administer the sacraments of the body and blood of the Lord. This is my simplicity, from which, to speak freely to you and not to seem to flatter you with vain hope any longer, I will not depart; I do not think you will demand anything else from me nor will you dare or be able to hope for anything else. For when I read Augustine, Ambrose, Chrysostom, and even Aquinas himself, certainly the most thorny mind, I find nothing on which I can safely rely, except what I have just confessed. I see that the disputes of Zwingli and Oecolampadius about the true body of Christ, which cannot be glorified except in one place, which is of no benefit if eaten carnally, are not entirely vain. But enough about these things.</p>
      <p>As for what you mentioned about my commentaries on Paul, and that you have written your judgment about me quite freely, you have not offended me at all, but have served me greatly, except that you seem to attribute too much to me. Indeed, I am not of such great hope, as you think, in talent. However, divine goodness has granted me this, that I embrace Christ from the heart as the only sacrifice of the world, wisdom, and supreme good, that I ardently commend his grace and glory to the people with all my strength, that I walk simply in his sight. He observes the hearts of all. He knows with what mind I am towards him or with what mind I began the commentaries on the sacred letters. He sees my affections as well. For if I were to say that I am purified, I would be most contaminated, but he is merciful, who does not reject the one who humbly asks for pardon and daily purifies, so that I may bring forth more abundant fruit. You will pray to the Lord for me, that he may have mercy on me, that he may both increase and confirm his gifts in me for his glory.</p>
      <p>You wonder how it happens that I do not mention the Wittenbergers, when I write the same things on the Romans that they did before me. But why is it necessary to mention the names of all with whom we feel and write the same? I read the writings of the Wittenbergers from the beginning (to speak freely, which is true) in a perfunctory manner. When the battles heated up and they, especially Luther, strove to surpass themselves with a certain abundance of harsh words, I, not without nausea, cast them aside, as I devoted myself entirely to the reading of the ancients, languages, and good letters. Thus it happened that for a decade I read nothing of the Wittenbergers except skimming the pages with my eyes, observing the headings and the main arguments, what they said in general, in what manner they said it, etc. When I was somewhat advanced in writing on the epistle to the Romans, Melanchthon's "Dispositio" came into my hands. Therefore, because it did not displease me, I made honorable mention of it, etc. You are not unaware of what Jonas annotated in the Acts, yet I made mention of him. I read nothing of the Wittenbergers on the two epistles to the Corinthians, nothing on the epistles of Peter and John. But I wrote only on these.</p>
      <p>Now I do not know if anyone has more criticized the scholastics than Melanchthon himself in the "Loci Communes." And I have read more writings of the papists than I care to read further, as there is scarcely time to read what is useful.</p>
      <p>If a council comes together with the emperor, the French, the English, and Ferdinand, the pope, bishops, and prelates presiding, you will see that it is poorly advised for the gospel. If you do not allow them to conduct everything at their discretion, no council will come together. If it does come together, it will come together to the detriment of the gospel. Nor is it necessary to prepare so anxiously. The truth will not prevail with them. An occasion will be sought to suppress the truth. Therefore, prudent simplicity, fervent prayer, and constant faith will be the best preparation for such a council.</p>
      <p>What the French king does to those who profess the truth of the gospel in his kingdom, heaven and earth cry out, and the innocent blood shed from the earth cries out. I have always feared miserably that what, alas, is happening would happen. This king has deceived the princes of Germany and has also urged you, Bucer, to write advice to the traitor, which he now seizes upon to defend his tyranny, as if those whom he subjects to capital punishment think differently about religion than the learned Germans with certain introductory booklets written to mend concord. You are not unaware of what the king wrote to the princes of Germany. Guillaume du Bellay is believed to be the author of his apology. But with shameless mouth and most perverse and depraved mind, unworthy of royal majesty, on one side, and in favor of Paul, he issued a decree in the French language, in which he specifically proscribed all Lutherans. A booklet was sent to our senate to see how shamelessly he contradicted himself. He sends the Latin apology to the Germans. The French edict is published among the enemies of our religion. Thus he sits on two stools.</p>
      <p>As for those counsels, which were not given by you, I would redeem them at the greatest cost if I could, which are also the seeds of great discord, they did not displease you as much as Melanchthon's. They contradict what he wrote here about the monarchy of the Roman pontiffs with what he once said in a laudable institution for Luther against Thomas of Placentia. He recalls the confession as a useless and pernicious institution. But how coldly he disputes about the mass and the intercession of the saints? Those who have hitherto resisted the gospel among us, having seen these counsels, have raised their crests more fiercely. Those who almost despaired, raised to great hope, shout: "God's wounds! That will be right; what our priests have never wanted to accept, they let go and give as good. It will soon be better!" Before, we all shouted that the pope (as he truly is) is the antichrist, the bishops are wolves; now they must inspect the doctrine - indeed, the wolf in the sheepfold! But what if they change? As if the leopard could change its spots and the Ethiopian his skin! Why do we dispute about possibilities when we see it is impossible for these scoundrels to lay aside luxury and humble themselves at the feet of Christ? What do you think the French say, who first read Melanchthon's writings, now see him asserting differently? They will accuse him and all of us of the greatest inconstancy. And it is certain that he did not follow pure simplicity. I know there will be no lack of words to defend his counsel. However, I would prefer solidity and simplicity, brevity and purity in the principal men of our religion rather than well-arranged and lengthy words. I write freely what I feel. I know you will take this rusticity of mine in good part. The cause is common. It is in everyone's interest to warn about it. In short: The French are slippery in nature. Therefore, such counsels are dangerous, by which we not only achieve nothing with them, but also alienate the minds of many of our Germans from us. Certainly, nothing has been done by you so far that has aroused the envy of many against you as much as this counsel. Not so many things are lacking in yours, but it cannot displease me that you approve of Melanchthon's counsel, which seems to attribute too much to the monarchy of the pope. For it is always in vain to object: What if they changed their mind? What if the wolf laid aside its wolfish nature? Among all the tyrants of the whole world, none have been more ferocious, impious, cruel, and more numerous than those who have held that sacred Roman seat. Why do we still dispute about Plato's republic? Forgive, I beg you, for writing freely. I wish these matters were handled more simply and briefly, and also more circumspectly. He holds an eel who deals with the French.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me as you do.</p>
      <p>Zurich, Easter Day 1535.</p>
      <p>The brothers wish you well along with the brothers in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
