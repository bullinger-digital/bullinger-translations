    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for [not received] letter with information about the Diet of Regensburg and a request for further news on this matter. Has no precise information from Italy; the Pope is at war with the Counts of Colonna; intends to learn more about the situation in Italy on the next market day. Request to support a pastor and fellow countryman of Zwingli [Jakob Hewer? see also No. 1547], who wishes to send his son to Zurich to continue his studies after three school years in Chur; the approximately fifteen-year-old boy has acquired a good foundation in Latin and Greek and gives hope that he will later prove useful for the cause of the Gospel; the father will come with him from Baden (Canton Aargau) to Zurich and will address Bullinger directly. Greetings, also from Jörg Vögeli [the younger?] from Constance, who is now practicing his [medical?] art in Chur.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocent life from the Lord. I received your kind letter fifteen days ago, most esteemed Bullinger, in which you informed us of the matters being conducted in Regensburg, and we read them most eagerly. May the best God ensure that what has been started in good order is completed with the best outcome. We again request that if you have received any more recent information up to our market days, you would not hesitate to share it with us. We have no certain news from Italy. The Roman bishop is waging war against the Counts of Colonna, but we do not know by what means. At the upcoming market, I will diligently inquire from the Italians so that I may write something certain to you. Furthermore, I was asked by a certain brother to write to you on his behalf; please do not take offense at my presumption. He himself will come to Zurich in a few days, a pious man, a faithful minister of the word of God, well-deserving of the Gospel, a fellow countryman of our Zwingli, having a son of about fifteen years. He has supported him here in Chur for three years for the sake of study at great expense, indeed greater than his small benefice can bear, so much so that if he had to spend twenty or 24 gold coins for one year, it would take away half of his benefice. We therefore ask and pray that through your intervention with the other lords, he may be relieved of some of the heavier expenses, and he himself will contribute as much as he can, so that the boy may be able to pursue good studies in Zurich. He has quite good foundations in both Greek and Latin literature, so there is hope that he will someday be useful to the Gospel. The father, along with the young man, will come from the baths of Baden to Zurich, intending to discuss these matters with you. Therefore, do as you usually do, excellent man, so that the boy, who has been initiated into the muses with good auspices, is not forced to leave them due to poverty, and you will always have me most ready for any command. Farewell. From the court of Rhaetia, on the seventh day before the Ides of June, 1541. We wish all the brothers well. Lord Jörg Vögeli from Constance, who is now practicing his art in Chur, also sends you many greetings. Yours most devoted, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his lord and brother, with utmost respect.</p>
