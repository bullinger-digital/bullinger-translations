    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The envoy [Heinrich Thomann] sent by the Zurich Council to the chancellery of the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] at the beginning of the war has left the procession of princes [Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philipp] heading to Franconia and returned home on December 8. He reports nothing other than what Bullinger has already written [with No. 2708].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Postal services have been suspended. The resulting costs for Zurich are much higher than one might believe, and the war is nowhere near its end! If only things were going well!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Upon their departure, the princes left [Duke Ulrich] of Württemberg with several cavalrymen and foot soldiers, who had already equipped 5000 compatriots for the counter-defense.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Augsburg is equipping itself with about 2000 to 3000 foot soldiers and 200 or 300 cavalrymen. May God grant that things are also going well in Ulm!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Emperor [Charles V] is attempting to divide the cities and the princes, as well as the latter among themselves. He promises, for example, Württemberg free choice of religion. All just deceit!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Much is being said and wagered about the alleged and strange death of the Emperor. Bullinger has received news from Augsburg about this. However, he does not believe it. It is certainly a typical Spanish intrigue, indeed a diversionary tactic!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] For when the princes departed, [Maximilian of Egmont, Count] of Buren, and other captains set out with the imperial army and followed the princes, occupying towns and villages. A battle is likely to ensue. The [Schmalkaldic League] still counts about 30,000 men, after they and the southern German cities have dismissed their mercenaries (apart from the soldiers retained for garrison). They will likely plunder the bishoprics of Würzburg and Bamberg and set up their winter camp in the bishopric of Mainz, from where they can better defend their territory.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Due to the early departure of the Landgrave to Heidelberg, some suspect that he has gone to France or Denmark or to [Duke] Maurice [of Saxony] to negotiate peace. We shall see. There are other strange news, but Bullinger must close.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] In the evening, the Zurich envoys [Johannes Haab and Itelhans Thumysen] return from [the Diet in] Baden.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Blessing wish. Greetings to [Francisco de] Enzinas and to [Johannes] Gast, for whom the news conveyed here is also intended.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Enclosed is an eyewitness report on the unfortunate Saxon war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Bullinger must stop.</p>

      <p>The one whom my lords have kept in the chancellery of the Landgrave since the beginning of the war has returned home on December 8 and left the procession of princes in Franconia a few days ago. He reports nothing special, other than what I have already written to you these days.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Thus, the postal service and everything else have now been suspended. Much greater costs have been incurred than you might believe. The war, although it is not yet over, has cost my lords something! But it is not worth calculating if things were now right.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Upon their departure, the princes left several cavalrymen and foot soldiers with the Duke of Württemberg, who otherwise had already equipped 5000 of his own for the counter-defense.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Augsburg is equipping itself with about 2000 to 3000 foot soldiers and 200 or 300 cavalrymen to garrison their city. How things stand in Ulm, I do not know: May God grant it to be truly brave and well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Emperor is attempting to separate the cities from the princes and the princes themselves from each other. He promises much; also to let Württemberg be free in faith. He will then lie in ambush. It is all nothing but deceit, lies, and falsehood!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>There is a great rumor that the Emperor is said to have died wonderfully in recent days. It is written back and forth as true and much is wagered on it. The manner of his death is also said to be so wonderful that it is astonishing. Thus, they write to me from Augsburg, but I do not believe it at all; I give it no credence. I suspect it is a Spanish intrigue, so that everyone hopes carelessly for the death (of the Emperor), does not foresee, and then the fox washes out of the hole over the careless chickens.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>For when the Emperor saw that the princes were moving down into Franconia, the Count of Buren and other captains set out with the imperial army. They have occupied the towns and cities here and there and are following the princes with the whole army. And it is thought that it might still come to battle. Ours are still about thirty thousand strong. The empire and the cities here above have let their mercenaries go, except those retained for garrison. It is thought that ours will raid the bishoprics of Würzburg and Bamberg, and camp in the bishopric of Mainz, where they are better positioned to defend their lands and have reinforcements from their lands.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>That the Landgrave departed early to Heidelberg, as I have previously reported to you, some suspect he is in France, some in Denmark, some with Maurice, to make peace, etc. Time will reveal it. Many other strange things are present, of which it is a wonder to write. I must break off.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Tonight our envoys return home from Baden.</p>

      <p>God be with you eternally! Salvi sint Dr. Dryander, Dr. Gastius, to whom you will communicate this.</p>

    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Here you have a description of the unfortunate beginning of the Saxon war, written by one who was present and saw most of it.</p>

      <p>I cannot write more. Zurich, December 11, 1546. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my friendly, dear lord and brother Mr. Oswald Myconius, preacher at the castle in Basel.</p>
