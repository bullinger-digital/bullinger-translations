      <p>Most Reverend Father, I give immortal thanks for your kindness and benevolence, which is so great and incredible towards me that, despite being occupied with almost the entire world's affairs, you do not hesitate to send me very full letters. If only it were given to me to affect your distinguished excellence with equal and due service; I would certainly spare no expense or labor to abundantly prove my service to your reverence. We have carefully sent letters to Mr. Karl through his relatives; for now, he is staying in Jenins and, if I am not mistaken, will also be elected as the governor of Maienfeld by the Confederates.</p>
      <p>I have endured the bookseller for a long time, hoping for better from him. Meanwhile, however, like a wolf, he has considerably disturbed our fold and has become so extremely shameless that he has not blushed to openly call us all Arians, indeed, he has not hesitated to inflict this insult even in his letters and has taken pleasure in provoking us. But since what is long-lasting is not perpetual, tomorrow will bring an end to his depravity. If only he would abandon in exile what he has never ceased to foster and spread in his homeland with all his might. A German pamphlet has come out, titled [Fasnachtküchle oder Vermanungsbüchle], by an author named Herxheimer, some seditious man. He has long since acquired several copies of its type and has adorned it as if it were a Delphic oracle, selling it at a very high price, filling not only our city but also the Rhaetian Valley.</p>
      <p>This seditious pamphlet contains nothing but Schwenckfeldianism and Anabaptism, and thanks to it, the wretched man has made several disciples for himself. When we reproached him more than once, asking why he did not buy and sell your books and the contradictory pamphlets of Vadian with similar desire, he received our admonitions with a turned-up nose and heretical jibes. I have dealt with many since I have been here, with my colleague and Mr. Pontisella, that this man should not be supported by our church; but with his hypocrisy, he has so far deceived them that I too had to refrain and remain silent for a while. However, the good Pontisella was recently put to shame in the senate; for when that impious man heard that I could no longer bear him without compromising my function, he immediately approached Mr. Pontisella and promised to show all obedience. He deceived Pontisella so much that he did not hesitate to defend him when called to the senate. However, when asked what he thought about paedobaptism, he dared to openly say it was diabolical and not at all Christian. Then one of the elders openly criticized Pontisella's defense as false and inconsistent with the bookseller's profession. Moved by this, the good man is now moving every stone to finally expel him, who has long deserved expulsion. I often had the mind and the command of the lords to confront him; but, as I recently wrote, I lacked social support. But enough of this for now. Tomorrow I will hear what will become of him; unless God gives him a better mind tonight, he will be forced to leave tomorrow. But he has a wife far more impious than himself, an Epicurean, with three children; what should be done about her, I do not yet know. I wrote at length about this fanatical man because he has much commerce with our Mr. Froschauer, whom I would like to be warned, if perhaps he might more cautiously avoid his snares. Those French news you wrote to us are approved and confirmed even by our leaders. Mr. Rhaetian has shown himself very kind to Mr. Anton Viscara of Trun, who, with Mr. Morald, his relative, obtained from those few Julian what he wanted. They have been asked not to take it badly; thus they fear that clandestine conspiracies may be revealed.</p>
      <p>Something will be done about these internal persecutions at the next synod. Nothing from Italy now. I know many complain about the inhumanity and treachery of the sailors; meanwhile, however, there is no one to repair our losses, and my barrel has not yet been brought to me. May Lord Jesus deign to preserve you, our common patron and the singular pillar and bulwark of his church, safe for as long as possible. Amen.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, and others greet you.</p>
      <p>Most quickly from Chur, May 8, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
