      <p>God with us. Beloved son, last night I wrote this enclosed letter; today the weather is such that I did not want to let Susanna leave; for it would be a disgrace and a harm. However, if it becomes possible to travel due to wind and other conditions, she will set out on the way to Wülflingen tomorrow or on Sunday. Send the horse there on Monday. But if the weather does not improve, you must be patient; for it is not a path for women. Susanna is also not the strongest, so there is concern that she might fall ill in such weather. If it does not get better, she will, when she arrives in Wülflingen, ask you for the horse. She sends her regards to you and Lisenbethli, as do I and all the people. There is talk of some news, which came last night, but I cannot find out what it is; when I know, I will tell you.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Friday morning at 8 before noon 1568.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
