    <p xml:id="regest1">The short notice makes it impossible for the Swiss to participate in the conference convened [to Eisenach], but they neither disdain the Concord nor Luther; rather, they love him as a brother and hope to be freed from the suspicion of discord. Capito and Bucer are aware of the merits of the Swiss churches and know their doctrine, about which they recently disputed together in Basel. Therefore, Bullinger asks the two to bear witness to the truth and to recommend these churches to Luther and his followers; meanwhile, they themselves will pray for unity. Sends greetings to Luther and his colleagues.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. That we did not come when called, Capito and Bucer, venerable and most beloved brothers in the Lord, you will attribute to yourselves, not to us. You are not unaware of how far and wide our churches extend and how many hundreds of bishops we have in the most populous cities and the most extensive and inhabited fields. You are not ignorant of the custom and method of consulting our churches in such matters. You know how well-prepared one must be for such a convention. Meanwhile, you order us to accomplish so much within the span of a few days. Your letters are delivered around the end of April, and you prescribe the 14th of May, a very short and indeed most unfair period of time for us. Even if there were ample time, it does not seem that we should hasten in such a matter, although we recognize the danger in delay. Therefore, the fact that we did not come, you will attribute to necessity and the injustice of time, not to contempt, or because we disdain concord with Doctor Luther and his followers or aspire to it more slowly. For we love Luther sincerely as a most beloved brother in the Lord. We venerate him as a most select minister of Christ, through whose ministry the Lord has accomplished great things in the world. We regard him as a most holy, most learned, and truly great man in the restoration of true religion, who has deserved excellently of piety and letters. Hence, we desire nothing more ardently than holy concord with him and the most esteemed men. We are not so stupid as not to understand that the suspicion of our discord is pleasing to the enemies of the Gospel and most powerfully hinders its course. Again, we are not so impious and warlike as not to prefer peace to war and to wish that such a scandal be removed from the church of Christ. Therefore, since we understand that your holy assembly has gathered for this purpose, that the suspicion of discord may be removed and that all may understand that we all feel and speak the same, this holy and salutary institution of the church of God could not but be approved by us, and since we know that the Lord is perpetually present with His own by His Spirit, we hoped that our brothers, though absent in body, present in spirit, would embrace us with sincere love as members of one body. I am not unaware that suspicions or the minds of good men have greatly alienated them from us, but we trust in their fairness, especially in your sincerity and faith. You know us as brothers. You know our churches, and how great is their faith, concord, constancy, and zeal for piety, what proof, what progress, and finally how much of our blood we have shed for the name of Christ, how much we have been afflicted by pressures, insults, and injuries, also tempted by the most cunning snares, from all of which the Lord has delivered us. You know what the doctrine is. For we have copiously disputed about this in the recent convention in Basel. It is very clear that we abhor certain doctrines, which we are nevertheless believed to teach. Therefore, we beseech you, brothers, by Jesus Christ, the true Son of God, the eternal sacrifice and the only priest, the judge of the living and the dead, to bear witness to us and to the truth in that holy assembly, and then to sincerely commend us and our churches to Doctor Luther, the most beloved brother and a man who has deserved well of the church of Christ, and to all his collaborators in the Gospel of Christ. Meanwhile, we will indefatigably pray to the Lord that if any discord has arisen among us, He who is the searcher of hearts may erase it entirely from our hearts and bind us with the holy and indissoluble bond of love, so that we may, with great courage and the most successful outcome, rout the remnants of the Antichristian army and extend the kingdom of Christ as widely as possible. So be it, so be it!</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, and you will bid Luther, the most illustrious man, and his colleagues, our most beloved brothers, farewell in our name, to whom we have written nothing at present, believing that you will act in place of letters.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 30th of April in the year of our Lord 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the Lords Wolfgang Capito and Martin Bucer, the most vigilant pastors of the church of Strasbourg, most beloved brothers in the Lord.</p>
