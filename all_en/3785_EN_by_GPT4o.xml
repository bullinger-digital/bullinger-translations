      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you through Mr. Fabricius that I have received all your letters. You will see what is being reported about Hungary.</p>
      <p>I have received news that many ships full of gold and silver have arrived for Philipp from India and New Spain. This matter perhaps makes him more arrogant and averse to an honorable peace.</p>
      <p>We will enjoy these things when the Lord wills.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Walter and Martyr, and farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, December 2nd.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>It is certain that the Queen of England has died, as well as the Queen of Hungary.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand, elected emperor, is on the brink of death or has passed away.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church.</p>
