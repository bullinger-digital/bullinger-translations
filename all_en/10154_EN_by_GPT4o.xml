      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor and teacher of the church in Zurich, Heinrich Strübi wishes grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Knowing that empty talk is unpleasant to you, I have followed brevity, my teacher, most learned Heinrich. Therefore, briefly understand that the state of the evangelical cause is turbulent in the Rhine Valley. For all of us ministers of the gospel have been forced (as you are not unaware) to suspend our harps, with which Christ should be sung, just as we read was done by the Israelites taken to Babylon. I have taken care that these letters given to me by the Zurich council be delivered to our president. After he quickly read them, he responded with disgust, and as if he said loftily that he would carry out what was entrusted to him by the envoys of the Five Cantons and Glarus, as well as the messengers of the Abbot's Cell, until something else is commanded to him. Therefore, our people are deprived of the nourishment of souls, while others here and there boast that they have the true and undoubted faith, but not us. For if our faith were valid and founded on evangelical writings, we would not be as mute as fish. But such are the manners of impious boasters and thus they are accustomed to speak. Therefore, most excellent brother, if you have any good advice (if you can amidst your affairs), write to me. For it will be a great honor for you that we poor souls are saved by your benefit. Why say much? Everything is full of all those vices, about which Isaiah chapter 1 speaks, as it happens where God is absent. You would think they are conspired in all wickedness. Everything is so fervent with blasphemies, conspiracies, murders, perverse and corrupt judgments, that I believe the Sodomites will have it easier at the last judgment. Therefore, nothing remains for our church in this world except "Christ and him crucified" [1 Cor 2:2], although we are nourished by some hope (whether true or vain, I am in doubt) that your Zurichers have taken up our cause. You, I would like you to consider and persuade yourself that all refuge of the good among us is placed in you and in those like you in our great calamities, which press upon us. Therefore, have as much courage as is necessary to recover the entire evangelical cause. For you can, for I know you to be a modest man, prudent and most distant from all greed, furthermore of great labor and utmost industry. At this time, I wish that the light of your true piety, virtue, and faith, as well as your candor, may shine forth. If they understand that their benefits are of concern to you, they will think they owe you everything. There are, however, very many things that will need to be remedied. Therefore, if my judgment about you deceives me, and you are not sufficient to bear the burden, you will find some Theseus, namely Christ himself. Finally, for your goodwill towards me, I give you immense thanks and for this, I will diligently and carefully take care of everything I know you wish. If you wish to reply, the one who brought you these sheets will bring them back to me.</p>
      <p>Take care to be well. Greet your most pious wife and your entire family for me.</p>
      <p>1532, on the 15th day of August.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Strübi, unworthy minister of the gospel in Marbach among the Rhine Valley people, your lowest and subordinate brother, and this from a pious heart.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Master Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the holy church of Zurich, his dearest in Christ.</p>
