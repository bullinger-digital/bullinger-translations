      <p>My friendly greetings, dear Mr. Heinrich.</p>
      <p>I am truly pleased to hear about your happiness and well-being, just as I am about my own. I thank you greatly for your commentary on the Epistle to the Romans. I have not yet received the one on the Epistle of James, as mentioned in your letter. However, I have received all the other books you previously sent, as indicated in your letter. The armorer, who was with you on May Day, has conveyed many greetings from you to me.</p>
      <p>I am glad that there is unity again between you and the Five Cantons.</p>
      <p>As for the New Testament, according to your request, it is not yet available.</p>
      <p>Our bishop does not pay much attention to papal excommunication. The pope excommunicates, and our bishop absolves again. The Westphalian cities remain as they were before. With these few words, I wish you and your household much happiness and health.</p>
      <p>Given in Cologne, on Tuesday before Pentecost.</p>
      <p>Dietrich Bitter, your faithful friend from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my particularly dear friend and benefactor, in Zurich.</p>
