      <p>I wrote these days through the courier of your city, but whether it has reached you, I do not know, because even after my letters were received, he was seen here for several days. Meanwhile, nothing new has happened that I should write about greatly. In Augsburg, the main discussion is about assembling an army against the Turk or rather extracting money from the orders of the empire, and the princes are said to return there, perhaps because a particular necessity urges them, either due to the Saxon movements or the Turk's endeavors, so that mature consultation is needed, in which it is to be hoped that the orders will first and foremost demand and follow the wisdom of true counselors, lest they bring about the usual confusion instead of success to the ruin of the common fatherland; it certainly leans on a crumbling wall, while it relies on its own counsels or forces.</p>
      <p>A recent scandal has arisen in Rappoltsweiler by some foreigner, who is said to have once performed the ministry of the word, because when he recently came there to visit his sick brother, he secretly began to collude with the former steward of the court of the lords of Rappoltstein, as far as the grain supply was concerned, entering into a marriage pact with her.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, he began to profess this so imprudently that, when challenged and corrected with words, he most stubbornly affirmed that it was permissible for him by the authority of scripture and the fathers. But fearing danger, he arranged to be carried away with his married woman in a carriage towards Breisach, and thus he escaped indeed through some hiding places, into which he retreated upon seeing the baron's horsemen, whom he had sent. However, the woman was captured and thrown into chains. The baron himself informed me of this matter, asking for my opinion. I responded, and with the advice of my fellow ministers, about the atrocity of the crime committed, and how it could not be covered by any appearance of divine or human law; but above all, I urged that he should not, tempted by Satan's artifice by such a grave offense, fall away from or at least become more languid in the pursuit of promoting true religion, as we have long been striving for the freedom of evangelical profession with him.</p>
      <p>As for the tragedy stirred up against Calvin by Zebedee and a certain Angelus, it is likely that he will labor all the more, because I hear he has some from the Bernese senate who are not very favorable. But he will stand firm nonetheless, relying on the truth of the Lord.</p>
      <p>I give thanks for your homilies; I have read them and approve of your most pious thoughts.</p>
      <p>Regarding the money owed to our Frobenius, I know you will ensure he receives it promptly; for he reminded me of this matter today. Farewell and live in Christ Jesus, a man always to be honored by me in the Lord. Convey my respectful greetings to all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 12, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and fellow minister.</p>
