      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, know that I, praise be to God, have arrived well. The pious Mr. Johannes Kessler is so pleased with the book; I have asked a carrier, known to you, to take them, those belonging to Augsburg and Nuremberg. I would also like to have 2 at first with yours. My lord and friend Marx Stapfer will pay for them. I have no special news, except that it is believed that those from Saxony are united, it is a pretense to keep the people in the country. Herewith a letter at this hour, as this messenger wants to depart, and we are all entrusted to God's protection along with yours. In haste.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>I know the honor, love, and goodness towards you, my lord, who have helped me so undeservedly. I will ask the Lord of all lords; may He graciously acknowledge it and, with prayer, show my small service to both my lords, the mayors, along with all the others.</p>
