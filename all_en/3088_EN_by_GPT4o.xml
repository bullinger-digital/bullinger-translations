      <p>Greetings. I am hindered by business and the unexpected departure of the courier, preventing me from writing more extensively. Those who are working towards the union of the Genevans and the Bernese, illustrious republics, are acting most piously and beneficially, and yesterday, when I approached some of our people, they promised quite extensively; however, what was concluded in the senate today is not yet known, but I hope for the best.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, as is fitting, let us persist in prayers to the Lord, that He may mercifully unite those who most ought to be united. From Germany, we receive no significant news. The assemblies are proceeding, although not all the envoys of the princes have yet gathered. The matter of fuller religious freedom will be addressed, which some are confident will be more easily obtained, as Ferdinand hopes that the succession in the empire will now be confirmed by the consent of the estates. If I receive any news, I will not keep it from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 3, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
