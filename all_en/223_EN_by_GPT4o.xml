      <p>Our people are writing to the common Confederates and desiring that they want to be mediators between the Imperial Majesty and us. Therefore, do the best you can; for I am very worried, as many minds are being stirred up, that (may God graciously prevent it) a peace might be accepted, where unrest would be much more honorable and serious for us.</p>
      <p>The fear is exceedingly great, as people are so embittered. The Lord God of Hosts lift up all the slain hearts, strengthen all the weak, sustain the wavering, and those who still stand upright, of whom there are many, as I hope. Praying from the heart and with all loyalty for our community and (for?) strength, that the dear God may show His great loyalty and goodness to us.</p>
      <p>My dear brother and Konrad Zwick send you all good wishes, are deeply troubled, as they see all sorts of things and then also worry greatly, more than ever before. Dying would be easy and light for us, for we must worry about too great a weakness. We are indeed, speaking humanly, very inadequate for this matter; yet there are many who do not want to trust solely in the one God and to assess the matters thoroughly.</p>
      <p>Bucer wrote to me yesterday from Strasbourg; note well, that he is very, very worried, one might perhaps not lift. May God have fatherly mercy on so many pious hearts, of which there are still so many everywhere.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours. Commend us to your whole church, as diligently as you can. Greet Musculus and Gervasius from ours to yours very lovingly.</p>
      <p>I send the Pope's crown, which I received yesterday; you will send it back with the next messenger. 10th of August.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, etc.</p>
