      <p>S. I recently wrote something about the Duke of Florence and the unfortunate case that occurred with his children, but I could hardly believe it. Now, today, a captain from Milan comes from the court and reports the same to Lord Marchioness Pascieren; others coming from Italy also say it is certainly true. The two sons stabbed each other; at the same time, Count Ursyn, who had the Duke of Florence's daughter as his wife, found her with a Spaniard, chained them together, and sent them to her father, the Duke. The father then had his own daughter executed with the sword and the lover quartered. The mother, the Duke's wife, is said to have taken her own life and died of grief. The Duke is also said to be very ill; for when he sent for the remaining son, who is with the King of Spain, he is said to have raised some claims, which he believes he has against the Florentine High Council and other cities. This is written and said strongly and for certain. The monks and inquisitors in Milan have received all power from King Philip, exercising all tyranny against the believers. The margrave does not dare to burden himself with the matter, has answered our envoy, who has now dealt with the Pellizari case many times, that he has no power at all, cannot and does not know what to do; he asks my lords of the Three Leagues not to be angry with him. And as Philip has suffered great damage through the loss of his galleys, which have perished, no more criminals (among whom the believers are also counted) are executed in the Duchy of Milan, but all are sent to the galleys. It is said that rarely a day goes by without one or ten people being taken away, etc. This, as told so far, is said to be certain. Now it is further written and said (I give it as I bought it) that Philip is taking on the new coronation of Maximilian with great effort, indicating that if Ferdinand dies, he wants to share the crown with Maximilian. He has also written to the Venetians and urged them, if Ferdinand were to travel to Rome to receive the crown there, not to allow it to him. Further, some adversaries say that the one from Adreß is said to have defected from the Condé, as the king is said to have sent him his order. Also, how the Brysac is said to have killed 6000 of the English. Therefore, we request a thorough report from your reverence.</p>
      <p>Farewell. On the same day as the other, on the calends of February in the year 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>The two sons quarreled while hunting over a hare. The third, the cardinal, died under suspicion of poison. The daughter was executed for adultery. The third son is held almost captive. Thus God visits the oppressors of the freedom of republics. Just as the Fuggers in Augsburg, so once were the Medici in Florence.</p>
