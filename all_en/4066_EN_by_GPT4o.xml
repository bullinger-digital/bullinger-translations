      <p>To the most illustrious and esteemed man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, a lord and greatly respected father, François Hotman sends greetings. What you wrote about France is very true, most revered father, and the King of Navarre has most miserably disappointed the hopes of all mortals. If you knew how sharply he has been admonished, what conditions have been offered to him, what great support has been extended, and yet how he has scorned everything with such inertia, you would be greatly amazed. I have not rested at all these past two months; but I see that we labor in vain.</p>
      <p>However, I console myself in that from which all my hopes have always depended and which cannot be deceitful. Regarding your Wilhelm, there is no need for you to give thanks.</p>
      <p>I beg you to excuse me to the most esteemed man, your father, if I do not write back to him, because I cannot write in German and I hope to fulfill his expectations through his son. He needs several books if we want him to become learned, and he also needs clothing with winter approaching, and you know I have written before how limited my resources are. Therefore, I ask you to arrange for some money to be sent to me through those who come to the fair. Most illustrious man and most revered father, farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>From Straßburg, September 2, 1559.</p>
