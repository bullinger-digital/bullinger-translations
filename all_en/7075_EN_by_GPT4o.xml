      <p>Greetings and prosperity from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, the sole eternal author of our salvation, I wish to your revered piety and commend my friendly services.</p>
      <p>I have received two letters from you, a man of proven piety and excelling in sincere friendship, filled with uncommon kindness and love towards me. From these, I have lovingly understood that your piety, along with the other colleagues, not only received my grandsons, Peter and Nicholas Myszkowski, who were sent to you in the Z체rich gymnasium last year, with all due kindness for your innate benevolence, and during the time they stayed with you, provided them with the due services, for which benevolence I give the thanks I can, but also, having been recalled to their homeland, continued to pursue them with no less zeal and favor. The truth of this matter is evident from the fact that your pieties, with the prudence you possess, did not hesitate to attach a servant equipped with public authority to my grandsons, who were undertaking a less safe journey, so that they might reach their native soil with less danger, in which matter your reverence not only did not offend me, but also did me a great favor. Since this is so, as I have the most certain evidence of your inclination towards me and mine from so many most evident arguments, I deemed it fair to again offer my studies and services to your excellencies, which may at some time proceed from me, and I promise to give my effort, so that you may not regret the benevolence shown to me, provided that you do not cease to pursue with the same piety and kindness those whom we send back and whom our Christopher Tretius will bring to you from Basel. For we have judged it fair to send them back to you because of your sincere piety, the gravity of your manners, and your skill in teaching the arts. For this reason, I earnestly ask you, my dearest Bullinger, and the other most distinguished men, that you accommodate my grandsons, and especially that brother whom Tretius will bring to you, in all matters that you can do without inconvenience, and consider them among your sons, and ensure that we may understand at some time that this journey of our grandsons to you will not be unprofitable for them and not unpleasant for the republic and you. This will be most gratifying to us and salutary for the Church of Christ. What remains, Christopher Tretius will report, and whatever he decides about our grandsons will be ratified and confirmed by us.</p>
      <p>With these, I wish your excellencies to be commended to the eternal God Jesus Christ, and I pray that He may keep you safe for a long time with His Holy Spirit, and I commend myself to your prayers. Given at Krak처w on the Ides of April 1567.</p>
      <p>Your friend from the heart, entirely Stanislaus Myszkowski of Mirow, Palatine and General Captain of Krak처w, Rathnenn, and Slomniki, etc. etc.</p>
      <p>In my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend and most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Z체rich church, etc., most dear and esteemed friend.</p>
