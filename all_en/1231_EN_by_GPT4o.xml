      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father, etc. Your letters contain nothing to which I should respond, except to send back these of Blaurer, which you have here. Then, concerning Musculus, you should know that we now have in our hands the opportunity we have long awaited, namely the dedication of his commentaries on the Psalter, so that now, with the work completed, it may be presented to the council, on which occasion I fully hope that the matter will succeed according to our wishes. I have already spoken with some of the councilors, who give me good hope. The copy is ready, but it cannot be offered this week due to many public affairs in the election of the new magistrate; however, it will be done next week; you will pray with us for its success. As for what you write about calling him to England, I fear that less than the call from Basel; he will hardly go to England, since, as we hear, the state of affairs there is still very uncertain. For in these days, Antonius Schorus of Antwerp, a very learned man and an exile from his homeland for the sake of the gospel, formerly a professor at Heidelberg, now residing in Lausanne, has reported to us for certain that our Mr. Hooper has been captured because he refused to conform to the other bishops in dress and certain ceremonies, and he says this was conveyed by a reliable messenger from England to Lausanne to Hooper's sister-in-law, who resides there. If this is true, I grieve not only for him but for the common misfortune. It is also written from Basel for certain that Bucer has died, not without suspicion of poison, and Fagius has also passed away. These things make it so that Musculus can hardly be persuaded to go there. But, as Gastius writes to him, Myconius is on the verge of death, and the people of Basel are considering Musculus as his successor. This is what I fear more than England, and I fear that if he were called, he might accept, even if his stipend here were increased; for it will never be increased to match that of Basel; moreover, there he has his Hervagius and other printers, and the city seems more suited to his constitution, customs, and family than ours. For he is affected by the barbarism of our people, and also by the odious meddling and innovation of our French, especially since he sees himself as little appreciated by Mr. Jodocus, who not only shows him no signs of kindness but also frequently criticizes him in sermons, not obscurely disparaging the writings of new doctors and all learned men. We have admonished him about this several times, but in vain; he persists and lives for himself, and hardly has any communion with all of us. We attribute much to his old age; Musculus, however, can hardly conceal his feelings. These are the things I fear. Furthermore, if anything else draws him away from here, his wife will be very troublesome.</p>
      <p>We will nevertheless retain him by all means. I also ask you to join your efforts with ours here; for much depends on this man, both pious and learned. We will also secure a stipend for his son in Lausanne, to bind him more closely to us; we will also think about a husband for his daughter, both of which can greatly help in retaining him. This about him.</p>
      <p>These are the new things with us, which certainly seem to be of the greatest importance and by which means the whole action of that council will vanish:</p>
      <p>First, Schertlin writes these days from Solothurn, how he has spoken much there with Mr. Morlet, the king's legate, who credibly reports, among other things, that France does not intend to attend the council or send anyone to it; he should be sure of that.</p>
      <p>Then there has been a rumor with us, but yesterday people from Augsburg came here, bringing us letters, in which we are also informed orally by the people of Augsburg themselves, that it is so, that Octavian, the prince of Parma, who had the emperor's illegitimate child and was the nephew of Paul III, has handed over the city of Parma to the French, for which the French have promised to give him 40,000 crowns. If this is so, as they credibly assert, then they will reconcile with spears and guns. It is certain that in France the king has summoned all his nobility to provide themselves with horses according to their station; for if there is no war, he remits the number of horses they must otherwise have.</p>
      <p>Now he wants the full number; therefore the French are buying up all the horses they can find here.</p>
      <p>Schertlin also rides personally to France, certainly not without great cause.</p>
      <p>It is certain that the king of France has sent a great legation to the Turks; they have ridden through my lords' land.</p>
      <p>Mr. Morlet has also further informed Schertlin that the pope not only does not permit the king to send anyone to the council but has commanded him not to; for the emperor seeks his advantage in it, so that it will be destroyed; that is called doing the work of scoundrels.</p>
      <p>The emperor is still in Augsburg, wanting to grant some lands to his son on behalf of the empire; the bridge is already erected, and all preparations are made; but the electors have not wanted to consent to it, and have ridden away; the bridge had to be closed again in disgrace.</p>
      <p>The emperor wanted to send Maximilian, Ferdinand's son, back to Spain; but he did not want to do it; he is to become king of Bohemia. Ferdinand's other son also does not want to go there, therefore it is written from Augsburg that 10 days after Easter the prince will be sent back from Augsburg to Spain, whether he wants to or not. The emperor prefers him at home; he also needs him there.</p>
      <p>It is also written of a treaty between the emperor and his brother concerning Spain; for their mother is still alive, and if she were to die, Ferdinand would also have his claim; the emperor gives him 200,000 florins annually and has thus bought off all his claims to Spain.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand is in Vienna, and is to be in Augsburg again on St. John the Baptist's day.</p>
      <p>These are the new things I have; if Musculus has more, he will give more. I will add this: It is also written from Augsburg how Pomeranus and Philippus have turned and are writing and acting more vehemently against the papacy than ever before. Perhaps what happened to Peter has happened to them.</p>
      <p>Schorus says that Philippus uses the example of Jerusalem under Zedekiah against the Magdeburgers, who set themselves against Nebuchadnezzar...; God grant that what Jeremiah preached, they should rise up. These are spiritual subtleties in heavenly matters. These temptations weaken good men more than open force; but I hope the Lord will give them the spirit to overcome these temptations as well. For how different their situation is from that of the people of Jerusalem is clear even to a child.</p>
      <p>Nebuchadnezzar... would have allowed them to keep their religion, which Charles wants to extinguish, and this is the only matter of controversy.</p>
      <p>Duke Christoph of Württemberg is in Augsburg with 600 horses.</p>
      <p>Schertlin has not yet found a place in my lords' land. He is advised to go to Neuchâtel or Biel; he has inspected them.</p>
      <p>Biel pleases him better; but nothing has been done there yet, until he returns.</p>
      <p>Dear friend, what has Mr. Michel of Biel done in Zurich? I fear great misfortune there. Funckli is said to be quite proud; and Mr. Michel is quarrelsome, wanting to act the big man.</p>
      <p>Nothing special is happening here, except that Mr. Niklaus von Wattenwyl, the old provost, has died, after lying ill for almost a whole year. So I think they will soon visit the chapter. They are printing the catechism in French here.</p>
      <p>The French churches have hitherto used Calvin's catechism, in which there are some rather obscure expressions, which will, however, be explained by that Consensus. I fear only this, that henceforth other such expressions may also be veiled under the pretext of this Consensus. For I have always believed that they do not think differently from us; but I would also like them to speak the same. For the copy you sent me, I give you great thanks. This for the present. I wrote in haste; therefore forgive me. Farewell with all yours, whom you will greet from me and mine. May all the brothers be safe. Bern, on the calends of April 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and most esteemed compatriot. In Zurich.</p>
