      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, dearest brother; I also heard Mr. Franz discussing various matters, and I find that we are in dire straits. Those things indeed torment you, and the same and other things also afflict me and others.</p>
      <p>From experience, I tell you, wherever you go, you will find things you do not want, and finally, things you did not expect. The more someone is a lover of fairness and justice, the more they grieve over the unjust things committed with such great license.</p>
      <p>But we are in the world; when we are in heaven, we will finally be free from troubles. Therefore, we must pray to God, while we live here, that He may govern us, grant us wisdom and tolerance, etc. I have barely tasted your book; for I am so distracted by so many tasks that I can hardly complete those in which I have been engaged for several years now.</p>
      <p>I am writing on Isaiah and Daniel, not to mention other things. Old age and a certain slowness are setting in, so that I can no longer do what I once could; there is also the constant coming and going of people throughout the day; there is the weakness of the body's strength and some lingering effects of the illness from which I am not entirely free.</p>
      <p>However, I will read it at the first opportunity and will hand it over to your father-in-law and my Ludwig to read. Besides what I recently wrote to you, I have nothing new; nothing certain has been brought from Bern.</p>
      <p>Unless you are unaware, I inform you that a meeting is to be held in Lucerne on the 29th of this month. It has been convened by those seven Catholic Cantons.</p>
      <p>The Pope will deal with them about forming an alliance. Lussius and Rollius, both known to you by reputation, are handling the Pope's business.</p>
      <p>I hear the Frenchman is opposing.</p>
      <p>I do not know what it is; there are many reasons to suspect something bad, and there are those who affirm that an alliance has been struck between the Pope, the Frenchman, the Venetians, the Duke of Ferrara, and the Florentine.</p>
      <p>You would therefore greatly oblige me if you could inquire from Mr. Legate what it is, or at least have him explain to you what is being decided at that meeting; for he will not be ignorant of this. - But you did not send the title from which I might learn how to write to the bishop; for I have decided to write, even for your sake.</p>
      <p>[...] although I grieve that such a good man is being so harassed.</p>
      <p>I will write at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 26, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Johannes Fabricius, the most faithful minister of the church in Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
