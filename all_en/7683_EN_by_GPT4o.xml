      <p>Greetings. I have nothing certain to affirm. Indeed, I have some news from the Netherlands and France, but these are again overturned and rendered uncertain by opposing writings. Therefore, I await other news, whether it be fortunate or unfortunate. I will write again, if I live, about what seems important and what friends provide. Now I send some things that have been sent here by a certain famous man, yet I would not dare to affirm them as certain; they have been sent here as most certain. Use them wisely. Your letters have been delivered to me. Since there is nothing in them that requires a response, and as I am otherwise occupied with many things, you will forgive the brevity of my letters. Farewell. May the Lord bless you and your family. Do not be anxious about your affairs; the Lord will provide. Be faithful; the Lord will not forsake you.</p>
      <p>Greet all the friends you know. This week, the excellent man Bernhard Spr√ºngli has died; thus, the good are daily diminished, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 3, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
