      <p>S. D. Eight days ago I wrote nothing, dear brother, because I was somewhat weaker, and even now I am not in stronger health. For I am weakened by sorrows, cares, and constant labors. My times are in the hands of our God and most merciful Father, to whom I have long since wholly dedicated myself. Now I pray that He may have mercy on me and especially on the church. I was writing then to Glarus and asked the most illustrious man, Mr. Beldio, to send my letters to you, that is, to you and Karl, which I hope he has done; now I receive yours. Meanwhile, our merchants come from Lyon. They report that the Condé has not suffered as great a disaster, nor the king, as has been written on both sides. For scarcely more than 200 of the Condé's men have fallen, and not even more than 500 of the king's.</p>
      <p>I would not wish to assert what is certain. I never believed that 1000 of the Condé's and 2000 to 4000 of the king's men perished, since no proper battle was fought, and night interrupted it, and the Condé's were not stripped of their camp. Mâcon is certainly relieved from siege. For the Italians, a ragged crowd, hastened into Burgundy.</p>
      <p>There were no Swiss at Mâcon; but they themselves are said to have set out into Burgundy. I do not know how successfully they will reach the king. It is certain, unless the Lord prevents it, that the most well-equipped German cavalry and the choicest infantry will join the prince on the 14th of this month. The king had sent several envoys to the princes to prevent the departure of this German army. They moved every stone; when they saw them hastening, they began to complain miserably and offer peace. The Palatine is said to have sent a nobleman with a trumpet to the king, to offer and request peace, if he does not wish to impose the Council of Trent on the kingdom and agrees to the fair demands of the Condé; otherwise, he does not wish to hinder the army, and in the meantime, the army nevertheless advances. This is affirmed as true.</p>
      <p>Since I have no writing, I leave it in the middle and wish you well with all your people and our friends, the consuls, Karl, Pontisella, Ganthner, and others, etc.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, December 12, that is, on the day of the winter solstice, 1567. Yours, as always, B[ullinger].</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
