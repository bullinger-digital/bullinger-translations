      <p>Greetings. On the past Sunday, delegates from the Five Cantons appeared among us, and two of the most distinguished from each Canton; they requested a meeting, and their wishes were fulfilled. After the meeting was held, they accused our people of treachery for not faithfully fulfilling the promises made during the meeting in the year 1532. This is how you should understand the promise made at that time. Immediately after the defeat at Kappel, when everything among us was full of threats, fear, and seditions, and our people were divided into factions, the delegates of the Cantons came to us to resolve this controversy. They attempted to do so in this way: first, they proposed conditions of peace, affirming that no better way of reconciliation could be found than to reintroduce the mass in all parishes. These conditions of peace did not please our people. After this, they prescribed other conditions of peace, namely that the parish named Linthal should have only a priest, while the others, namely Schwanden and Glarus, should have both a priest and a preacher of the word. Our people, considering these conditions of peace quite unjust due to the injury of the times, as everything was already desperate, were reluctantly forced to accept and sign them. And since these promises have not been fulfilled to this day (because in the aforementioned two parishes, Linthal and Schwanden, the papacy has long been completely eradicated), the delegates came to us, who not only reminded our people of the promises but also urged them to fulfill them without any delay. Indeed, with their threats, they achieved so much that our people renewed, confirmed, and signed the promises made in 1532 with the Cantons again, and promised to faithfully fulfill them until a universal council. You see, good man, that this stipulation has been sinned against in two ways: first, because it is impossible to fulfill it, I fear it will be the source of all disturbances and evils; second, whatever may be built in the future by the ministers of the word, the Cantons perpetually urged the stipulation, and thus the seed of the word of God will not be able to rise and prosper.</p>
      <p>The delegates also protested with fearful severity in the aforementioned meeting, that whoever speaks or insults against their religion will be punished with utmost cruelty.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they accused Matthias Bodmer in many ways, especially of violating the peace, and menacingly ordered that he be proscribed as soon as possible. These are the fruits of the delegates' arrival, by which our enemies are revived and raise their crests again. Therefore, my dear Bullinger, we are weary of our futile labor and miserable fate, and we are disgusted with living under the tyranny of the Cantons. I also do not think that the gospel can be preached with a clear conscience when we must connive at papal errors and live according to the prescribed laws of the Cantons.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I had decided in my mind, unless you advise otherwise, to resign and lay down my office.</p>
      <p>Dated the 26th day of August.</p>
      <p>These are the news with us, which I wished to share with you.</p>
      <p>Fridolin Brunner, pastor of the church in Glarus. Greet Johann Wolf on my behalf and inform him of what the delegates of the Cantons have executed among us.</p>
      <p>I will await your advice, and to ensure your letters safely reach my hands, I will entrust the matter to a merchant from among us, who is about to depart for the Zurzach fair and will request letters from you.</p>
      <p>Thus, the letters will safely reach my hands through a faithful messenger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord.</p>
