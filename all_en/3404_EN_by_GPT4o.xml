      <p>Greetings. Three days ago, I sent you through Froschauer the Younger several gatherings of your Decades, from which two leaves, namely E and E2, were left here, which I now send together with gathering 10. I am now very busy due to sermons and other matters; otherwise, I would write to you about the preface and even the title of the work. I now ask you this: 1. Who was that Mascelzer, whom you mention among the pious princes in Dec. 2. ser. 97. fol 74, for I do not recall reading anything about him in these histories nor can I find anything about him; however, I retained his name in the translation. 2. In Dec. 3. ser. 5. fol. 115b you mention ten boards of the holy tabernacle on the western side, while the text only has eight. Therefore, I translated only eight, as in Hebrew it is also placed as keraschim; however, you correctly write a few lines later: "The tabernacle had in length thirty cubits, in width ten, with the width of each board being one and a half cubits." Fol. 116a, where you write about the golden table, it seems that instead of southern, it should be read as northern; for Josephus also has it this way in Ant. book 3. chapter 9. See line 18. Fol 158a line 21. after "believing" it seems "trusting" should be placed. Fol. 163 penultimate line instead of "ecclesiastical" it should be "ecclesiasticus." In the same, col. b. line 26. instead of "who does the will of God" it should be read "who does evil."</p>
      <p>There are other things of this kind, which do not offend me, but could be noted if the Decades were to be printed again in Latin. I ask you to bear with me patiently as I remain modest before you.</p>
      <p>We have no news of new things.</p>
      <p>The alliance with the Genevans has almost been reformed again, but it is not yet fully concluded. I hope it will be completely settled; they have yielded on some articles, and ours have also yielded. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>May all yours be safe; ours diligently greet you. Bern, 13th of November 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>For your sermons on Jeremiah, I give you great thanks; I ask that you continue to explain the rest of that prophet as well. This will benefit me greatly and many others; for after the history of the kings, which I now expound on non-festival days, I intend to present this prophet to the church.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed and dearest lord and compatriot.</p>
