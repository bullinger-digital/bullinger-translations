    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks Bullinger, albeit belatedly, for the gifted book [“De origine erroris”?] and praises his abilities, for which all of Europe can be grateful; sees him as a prophet and preserver of the legacy of Zwingli and Oecolampadius and admires him even more than such distinguished men as Vadian and others. Regarding the establishment of the school, Johannes Blasius, who is bringing back Nikolaus [Pfister, known as] Baling, will report orally.</p>

      <p>Philipp Gallicius to his Heinrich, Greetings.</p>
      <p>What I should have done long ago, if I had not been away from home for several days: I give you the greatest thanks for your book, which you have given me, a man in every way most excellent, and I no less congratulate myself that I am known by you and deemed worthy, I think, to receive even this gift from you, whom I have never before provoked by any service. But this is undoubtedly the liberality, humanity, and that special dexterity of your noble and great and lively spirit, as I hear, by which you strive to draw everyone to you, as if we were not otherwise already most devoted to you, all of us who admire virtue. Let our Switzerland, indeed all of Germany and even all of Europe, and why not the entire continent, be congratulated, for it is better understood than said, that it has been gifted with such a man, you indeed being present and listening. I wept for the death of the three greatest men, Oecolampadius and Zwingli, also for this reason, that we seemed to be deprived, we the Confederates, I mean the Rhaetians and the Swiss, of our greatest glory and henceforth lying inglorious and neglected by more learned men. But behold, you appear to us as the avenger and defender of the glory well-earned through them: after Gaius Julius Caesar, Octavian; after Philip of Macedon, Alexander; after Cyrus, Darius, yet with no intermediary; after Judas Maccabeus, Jonathan; after Moses, Joshua; after Samuel, David. For you, what they began beautifully and bravely, you carry on and complete with a great and invincible spirit, with far greater glory, and you will lead the matter, we hope, where they, hindered by the violence of fate, could not. Let us now recognize this and give pious thanks to the best and greatest God, who has not left us without prophets, especially of our nation. For we still have that old polymath Joachim Vadian and many others there, especially solid and learned and pious. But among these, we especially respect and admire you, inquiring and handling the Word of God; we set you against foreigners, we glory in you and boastfully show what we can do. Let hypocrites fade away from me, if there are any, Stoics, who are stirred by no praise, rejoice in no glory, are touched by no affection of human affairs, not men, but trunks, certainly pretenders and preposterously holy! For, not to speak of the eternal life and glory we hope for, do we not meanwhile seek the praise and glory of good testimony from others? Do we not rightly call such a person dissolute or foolish? What, when we praise virtue or something beautiful, do we not praise God, who is this very virtue and beauty? Indeed, I consider envious and malevolent or plainly foolish the one who knows no praises or glories; for either he does not know what glory is or he remains silent out of envy, of which one is foolish, the other unjust and detestable. But lest I seem to speak not from the heart but only with a declamatory tongue, I will end, but I will return: I wish nothing else at present than to have given thanks, until there is an opportunity to repay. Farewell, most esteemed by all learned and pious men. From Malans, on the third Ides of July, in the year 1539.</p>
      <p>Your same.</p>
      <p>There is nothing notable among us, except this greatest thing: the establishment of the school has been confirmed not without your help, who wrote to our Travers. But you will hear about this in person from Johannes Blasius, our brother, a man of prudent heart, who has summoned Nikolaus Baling and will return from there.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, etc.</p>
