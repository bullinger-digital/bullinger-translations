      <p>Greetings. As often as I write, I receive nothing in return. What could be the reason? I ask you to respond regarding those matters about which you know how eagerly I wish to be informed, especially about your situation. For every day we receive some bad news and because of this, we are quite disturbed. Therefore, let us take some consolation, or if there is none, let us be more troubled, so that we may call upon the Lord more fervently, that His name may be sanctified.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the brothers, especially Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, in the year 33.</p>
