      <p>God with us. From Constance, I have written today, dated yesterday at 11 before noon, and the city is in danger and misery for the pious people; may God have mercy on them and us. Now, for eight days, the community has begun to rise up fiercely and speak of peace, reasons: they have endured much until now, and have now found an opportunity to speak. As some said about our war: "Now an honest man may also speak," and there are not a few who act wildly against the council, the preachers, and the doctrine. Consequently, some have suffered great harm to themselves and their goods; furthermore, they have been exposed and put under ban. Also, many of the righteous have been slain; also, little help is available. The governor has acted slowly; the 70 are rebellious and dismissing the servants who gladly did their best. Also, some have left the city. Also, they see no end to their misery; also, they must expect it to become more burdensome the longer it lasts, and they are embittered by the assault. Although some places of the Confederates would gladly help them, the others are opposed, and no one goes there. For these and similar reasons, the community has come to discontent and simply wants peace and no longer to stand in danger, etc. Therefore, the councils have urged the Confederates to take Constance under their protection, so that the community does not send envoys to the emperor and completely surrender. Some places of the Confederates have come together and told those of Constance freely that if they do not accept the Interim, bishop, and clergy, and also expel all the Confederates' servants from the city, they will not take their interests to heart. Zurich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen did not want to be involved in this, that such a thing was proposed to them; yet they have proceeded. Constance then held a meeting on Saturday and Sunday, decided to let the Interim be read and agreed to accept the Interim and the priests. Many pious people are against it, but in vain against the raging populace. Thereupon, the Confederates resolved to separate from them as much as possible towards the emperor, also the 4 places, provided that they do not help with the Interim and priests. Consequently, the neighbors by the lake, Ãœberlingen, Tzell, etc., have been written to by 13 places to remain quiet until the Confederates receive an answer from the emperor; for they have also written to the emperor to allow the Confederates as mediators. Meanwhile, the poor people stand in danger and fear, partly fearing an assault, partly fearing the uprising of the unruly citizens. Most of the Confederates have been brought out by admonition, yet some of my lord's people and mercenaries remain. The answer from the emperor is awaited; it should come soon, and then my lords will immediately set a new day, either agreeing or rejecting the audience.</p>
      <p>God is faithfully to be prayed to, that He may take the pious people under His care and protect and shield His church. What do you think those Seven Dynasties will do, I pray, if Caesar proceeds to impose the Interim and the bishop with the clergy in Basel?</p>
      <p>It is therefore a wonder to live among ours and yours, who almost place all hope in that flesh, when they are not even sufficient to protect themselves, let alone defend others. Therefore, it would be best to place all trust in God and, for the sake of these men, to conceal nothing in the matter of religion, but to proceed steadfastly.</p>
      <p>It is not difficult for God to provide salvation in few as in many. The people of Constance were few, they managed the matter very negligently; yet God defended them wonderfully, and although more than a hundred citizens were missed, more than 400 Spaniards were slain, as they now understand more correctly and gather from signs. Some perished in the fire, some of them in the Rhine, and if only they had remained steadfast, surely the Lord would not have failed them. Let us pray for them and for ourselves.</p>
      <p>Today I receive a letter from Ulm, that the emperor entered there on August 14. On the 15th, the bishop of Arras sang the first mass (in the desecrated temple of the Virgin); the preachers were forbidden to preach, indeed they were urged to swear the Interim by God and all saints. And when they steadfastly refused on August 16, the emperor had the preachers arrested, but soon released them all again, except he is said to have kept Dr. Martin Frecht, and it is said that he will not be released soon. May God have mercy on him and strengthen him against the tyrant. Thereafter, he dismissed the council, which had been 70 daily, completely changed the government as in Augsburg, and placed 30 oligarchs over them, 20 of whom are from the nobility, 10 from the community. He appointed Nitthart, the great papist, as his governor. Is that not tyrannical? See how it goes. The cities would not suffer anything for God's sake, deceived by the smooth talk of the emperor's flatterers, they hoped to remain in freedom and religion. Look, into what burdens they have plunged themselves, and there is still no end. So it will also go with us if we listen to the deceitful emperor. We will pray to God earnestly for something better.</p>
      <p>Now there is a rumor that the emperor wants to move from Speyer over to Burgundy and into Savoy, to seize Geneva, so that he holds the pass, preventing any German mercenaries from coming to the French or the French from helping the Confederates. Caesar is a sophist, he gladly dwells in the place of division.</p>
      <p>All his actions are tears, and may God also cut them off; God forgive me, it is a sin to me.</p>
      <p>I fear he will also divide Strasbourg and cunningly deceive it. May God protect them.</p>
      <p>What, I beg, do you write about Strasbourg, England, and Lower Germany? You see that I am busy with many matters, so that you may understand everything correctly and clearly; therefore, see that you prove your love to me with equal diligence.</p>
      <p>Greet Gastius; communicate this to him and tell him to send me the missing page in Cicero's Offices, folio c is 17, the end in b "ante constituimus", the beginning d Consuetudo, the first folio d 33. In the last letter, I requested the same missing page; but he has not yet responded. May the remaining brothers be safe, especially Dr. Coelius. Farewell with your household. Zurich, August 24, 1548. In great haste; I have not reread.</p>
      <p>H[einrich] B[ullinger]</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Dr. Oswald Myconius, and in his absence, Dr. Johann Gastius, dearest brothers. Basel.</p>
