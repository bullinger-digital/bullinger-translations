    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Kröttlin is unknown to Bullinger. Nevertheless, he writes because he can recognize from Bullinger's writings that he is a Christian, even if only a minor one. Of the two bearers of this letter, Johannes Willing and [Sebastian Nabholz, the son of] clockmaker Paulus [Nabholz], he was asked for a letter of recommendation. They were, at the behest of their parents, for a time in the monastery Waldsee near Ravensburg. Then they came to the pure knowledge of the Word of God, left the monastery, and now want to be trained as evangelical preachers and serve the Church of Christ. Bullinger should support the two young men for the increase of God's glory, the building of his church, and their soul's salvation. Recommendation and request for prayer.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the heavenly Father through Jesus Christ, his beloved Son, our Lord. Amen. Highly learned and venerable lord and brother in Christ Jesus, the reason I (though unknown to your person, yet through your Christian writings I recognize myself as a simple member in Christ by God's grace) write to you, is driven solely by God's zeal and brotherly love. Moreover, I have been requested by these two bearers of this letter, citizens' children of this city of Ravensburg, Johannes Willing and Paulus the clockmaker, to recommend them to your honor and have sought your support. For a time, not far from Ravensburg in a small town (called Waldsee), they agreed, at the instigation and encouragement of some of their temporal benefactors, to enter a monastery (and have conducted themselves honorably and piously during this time - no one can truthfully say otherwise about them; I am also not aware of anything else about them). By the special grace of God, they have been enlightened in that monastery by the grace of the Holy Spirit and have come to such a recognition of the pure Word of God that they realized that their calling in the monastery (more a carnal than a spiritual life) did not come from God, but from human concern for the belly. Therefore, they separated from that monastery, came here, and desire to dedicate themselves to another and more Christian state and service to God, namely to learn the pure, clear, pure, and true Word of God, to proclaim it, to serve the Church of Christ, and to be entirely used in the service of God; therefore, I appeal to your honor for a recommendation. Therefore, I ask for the glory and honor of God, also out of brotherly faithfulness, that your honor may support these two good-hearted young men in their Christian endeavor for the increase of God's glory, the building of his church, and their rightly created Christian zeal and blessed salvation, and help them in this. I request this (moreover, as brotherly love requires it from all of us and it is also God's work) quite amicably and willingly to earn your honor with my humble prayer to God Almighty, etc. I have thus entrusted myself quite amicably to your honor's diligent prayer to God the Lord, etc. Dated Ravensburg, on the 16th of October in the 46th year.</p>
      <p>Your honor's fellow brother and member in Christ Jesus, Gabriel Kröttlin, city scribe of Ravensburg.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly learned lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic and preacher of the city of Zurich, my gracious, pious, dear lord and brother in Christ.</p>
