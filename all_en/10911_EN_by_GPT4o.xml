    <p xml:id="regest1">Secretly sends the response from Strasbourg [to the concerns presented by Grynaeus and Karlstadt regarding the Wittenberg Concord]; tomorrow the pastors will deliberate on their position, but nothing should happen without the other Swiss churches. Karlstadt and Grynaeus recommend acceptance; Myconius disapproves of the talk of "substantial" [presence of Christ in the Eucharist], but on the other hand, he wonders whether Luther can even accommodate the Swiss as much as the people of Strasbourg claim. The fact that they refer to Oecolampadius has an effect on the council. Writes urgently, as he received Bullinger's letters [No. 864. 869] today. Cannot send Utinger the epistles [of Oecolampadius and Zwingli] due to the lack of a messenger now.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am sending the response from Strasbourg secretly, except to Marcus. Therefore, read it with the brothers - I mean Pellican, Leo, Theodor - if it seems right to you, so that no one knows it was sent by me. Tomorrow we will meet here to prepare a response to the senate. I have testified before those sent to us that we will do nothing without the Zurichers and the other Swiss churches. They agreed, and the senate has also decided this way. Karlstadt and Grynaeus commend Bucer's plan with full support. As I judge, our opinion is expressed in the declaration, but with deceptive words. Indeed, I have taught so far, thus I have partaken of Christ. One thing, I wish they would omit, namely "substantial," and be content with the word "truly"; for this is Christ's, that is Aristotle's. I wonder if Luther thinks this way. If he does, he has come to us, not we to him. And he will indeed have trouble with his followers. You will read these words not once, but again and again, and you will see why they so boldly say that Zwingli and Oecolampadius thought this way. Here they press us wonderfully. I beg you, do not delay your response to me, if possible. Concord, where truth stands, is entirely approved by our senate. However, it thinks that because Oecolampadius is so often mentioned, it is not done rashly. Your letters were delivered to me today, which is why I write to you more hastily. We will pray to the Lord to support the truth.</p>
      <p>I have a letter at home, which I would gladly send to Utinger; but there is no one to carry it.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, the last day of July, year 36.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his esteemed in the Lord.</p>
