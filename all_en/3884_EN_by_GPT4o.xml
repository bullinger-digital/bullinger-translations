      <p>Greetings. I owe you more each day, honorable man; for recently you wrote diligently and carefully to Augsburg for my sake, and now you are anxious with me about the delayed letters of the most distinguished man, Dr. Hyperius.</p>
      <p>Oh, that both the opportunity and the place to declare my prompt gratitude towards you might be given to me someday; in the meantime, the only thing I can do is to express to you my eternal thanks for your kindness towards me, and I ask that I may be perpetually commended to and protected by your charity. I had written to Dr. Hyperius early in the morning of the day on which your letters were returned to me around evening, and I had written only this: that I am amazed nothing has yet been answered to my requests. I later wrote another letter in the deep of night and showed what I had received in the meantime, yet nothing can be done until the lords' envoys, who will meet on March 3rd in Morges and inspect the cause of the Lausanne school, have returned; at the same time, I asked that he persist in that purpose, assuring that once the envoys return, we will ensure that our lords call him with a generous stipend. I return your letters to you and at the same time thank you for sharing them; I also wish that you read the letters he wrote to me and see his promptness, and later assist us in this cause, so that we may bring the man to us. I am exceedingly grateful for the book you gifted; everything is pleasing and will be pleasing to others, indeed it will benefit many who are in danger in this matter, and perhaps it will show many the way to escape dangers. May the Lord Jesus Christ keep you safe with us for a long time. Amen. March 4, 1559, in Bern.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Benedikt Marti.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant minister of the Church of Christ, his piously esteemed lord. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
