    <p xml:id="regest1">Borrhaus recommends the bearer of this letter [Francisco de Enzinas], a learned Spaniard who is enthusiastic about the Gospel and now wishes to become acquainted with the Zurichers and some other churches.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In these troubled times, such people are a great comfort, for through them one feels the power of the Gospel. While the enemies vainly try to eradicate the Gospel in Germany, it can be observed how it takes root and thrives in other countries. The [New Covenant established by Christ], through which we became new creatures by the power of the Spirit, is wonderful and invincible!</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord. The bearer of this letter, the most illustrious Bullinger, is a Spaniard, a man burning with love for Christ and eager to know His Gospel, which has led him to journey to your church to consider its state, having already visited some other churches. Therefore, although I understand there is no need to urge you, the integrity of this good and learned man has compelled me to write this letter to you, so that he may be introduced into your friendship and I might rekindle the sparks of our old goodwill.</p>

      <p>However, as nothing comes to mind about the current state of affairs to inform you of, in these very difficult times, this Spaniard of ours and those like him can greatly console us; through them, we may understand the great power of the heavenly Gospel. For while the enemies in Germany attempt with all their might, zeal, and diligence, though in vain, to undermine it, we understand that it is being awakened and strengthened among foreign nations. What glory, dignity, and greatness of the invincible New Covenant this is! In this covenant, indeed, as all things are accomplished by the Spirit and not by the letter, there is no regard for sex or nation, but new creatures (that is, a heavenly work not formed from the fleeting elements of this world, but generated from the eternal Spirit of God in Christ, which no opposing force or power can diminish). But enough of this - especially to you!</p>
      <p>Farewell, with all the good people who are with you. Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed lord and brother.</p>
