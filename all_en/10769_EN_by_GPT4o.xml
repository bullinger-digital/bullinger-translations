    <p xml:id="regest1">Ends the discussion about a letter that was issued in the name of Zurich, but without its consent. Intends to procure the records of the Diet of Schmalkalden from Constance and sends the treaty between [King] Ferdinand and [Elector Johann Friedrich of] Saxony. The invitation to the meeting [in Basel] should remain restricted to the evangelical places, but war events could question the gathering. The agenda will be set by the inviting authority, which is under the influence of the Strasbourg [Bucer and Capito]. He has already expressed his concerns in this regard to [Hans Rudolf] Frey and [Jakob Meyer], but does not want to decide on the admission of the Strasbourg people. It seems sensible to him that, with regard to a general council, a confession should be formulated in line with the Basel Confession of [1534]. [Konrad] Zwick has criticized Bucer's proposal for a concord and recommended a delegation to Luther to preempt a meeting in Saxony, from which the establishment of a new papacy is to be feared. The war in Savoy worries Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I thank you, my esteemed and most venerable Myconius, for responding so diligently to each point. From these and countless other benefits, I understand how well you wish me. Now, to respond somewhat to your letters, there is no need to fear that I will show your letters to anyone, causing you any disturbance. What I wrote more freely, I did not do for your sake, but for those to whom you would show our letters. For I wrote more to them than to you. As for your response that you have the notes, our people cannot deny it, but they add that the name of others was added by the impropriety of others, not by their own assent. I only wanted to mention this, not to argue with you, but to put an end to this matter. For henceforth, you will not hear another word about it.</p>
      <p>I will do my utmost to ensure that you receive the records of the Schmalkalden Diet from the people of Constance. Accept the articles or chapters of Ferdinand and Saxony.</p>
      <p>Regarding the calling of the Swiss churches, I do not know what you have understood from my rather confused and barbaric letters. For after the evangelical ones were called, I would want no others to be called. If only the warlike tumult would not also prevent us from the convened meeting!</p>
      <p>You ask me for a catalog of chapters and about which I think should be addressed. I truly believe that effort would be useless. For we will not prescribe the chapters of matters to be discussed to those who called us, but rather they will prescribe to you and us the reasons for the meeting and what they ask of us or what we should do; I mean the magistrate. But if we are called for the sake of the people of Strasbourg, they will propose articles to us, which I would not want, to tell the truth, and I have testified to many before Phrigius. I have no doubt that we, who preach Christ through the Swiss churches, agree in all things. Therefore, it seemed more novel to me when your envoy said that the meeting was to be celebrated because of doctrines and rites, so that they may be the same and identical among all. I replied that the doctrines are the same for all, and there is no discord in the rites, although we do not all observe the same ones in the same way; but freedom in these should be maintained, etc. What else, then, was left here but that this meeting was called for the sake of the people of Strasbourg? For they seem to follow something different, I do not know what. Hence I was grieved; hence I sent letters to you and certain mandates to that father. Now, therefore, if it is decided to hear them, they will prescribe to us I do not know what modes of speaking, so that we may seem to agree with Luther. They will dispute much about the power and dignity of the ministry of the word, about the scrutiny of consciences, that is, how the consciences of men are to be investigated and explored by the minister of the word before they approach the supper; what can be forgiven to the papists, what can be overlooked, etc. Before we respond to these, we will burden the minds of the listeners with quarrels, nausea, scandal, and I do not know what other evils. This is my suspicion; I wish I were wrong! Meanwhile, I do not want to be the author who prevents them from being called or prohibits them from coming. Perhaps you and I are vexed by vain suspicions.</p>
      <p>It certainly seems to me that the matter would not turn out badly if your people, who wrote the synod, generally proposed to the legates of the Swiss churches that various plans are being circulated throughout Germany, and also uncertain rumors are being spread about a general council being celebrated. Now, since it cannot benefit religion to wait unprepared for the last moment of time, they have called the churches for this reason, so that in a few writings and as if in propositions, what we have in common in doctrines and rites may be collected, and this writing may later be presented to all who demand an account of our faith or doubt our concord. The directory of this business and conference could be what your city published under the title of confession a year ago. Once this was written, each would refer it to their own, we would present the same to Bucer and the others, and we would then be relieved of the day's running, writing, and sending back and forth, and everyone would know what they have in us and find. This is the brazen wall, etc. The opposing party has the Saxon confession. You know how sacredly and religiously it is adored by all. If anyone were to exclude us, who think catholicly and orthodoxly about religion and truth, we would have God as our judge and defender. This is my opinion expressed in the fewest words.</p>
      <p>Now, to briefly note and touch upon the main points that Senator Zwick discussed with us, he first warned that the plan for concord proposed by Bucer is quite entangled and contrary to simple truth. For if the second chapter of the articles you had at Aroia is well considered, it offers a fivefold exposition, of which, however, the last is always the most obscure of all. Therefore, it would be convenient for us to explain in writing and by sending legates what we think about the Eucharist and other principal articles to Luther. He believed we would obtain more from Luther than from Bucer and that the meeting would dissolve the Saxon one. He added that a meeting would be held in Saxony, in which judgments would be made about the Eucharist, about ecclesiastical censure, about the dignity of priests, and I do not know what other prescribed matters, to which it would later be fatal and capital to contradict, and thus a new kind of papism would be established. Furthermore, he thought that in that synod a way would be discussed by which our religion and that of the papists could be joined. This is precisely what you also write about, that they will raise the question of what can be given to the papists, what cannot, what can be overlooked. But what I write to you here, I write to you alone. For he did not want us to believe anyone that he had discussed these things with us. For Bucer, otherwise irritable, would conceive more anger and envy against the people of Constance. And yet, he advised that we should never enter the Saxon synod, which would propose much more from Bucer than from Luther. And if it were to be passed and decided, then all those who did not speak according to their way would be persecuted and expelled. And they want to impose their ecclesiastical censure with the ban (excommunication) not without the contempt of the holy magistrate and the danger of the whole church. I can no longer write more.</p>
      <p>The war in Savoy disturbs more than can be believed. Pray to the Lord to save His church and destroy the counsel of Ahithophel.</p>
      <p>January 20.</p>
