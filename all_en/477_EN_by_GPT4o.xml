      <p>Greetings. Safe and sound by the mercy of God, most esteemed sir and godfather, we arrived in Basel on the 27th of March around the tenth hour, and tomorrow morning, if it is permissible to trust the sailors, we will set sail from here. Therefore, to save on expenses, I am sending back the coachman with the carriage and horses.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow evening, your fellow citizen will, I hope, receive all his belongings safe and unharmed once again. The fact that we have delayed longer on our journey than he had anticipated, to his inconvenience and my great expense, should be attributed to the harshness of the journey and not to our sluggishness or the fatigue of the horses. Please convey my greatest thanks to this excellent citizen on my behalf, I ask, or entrust this duty of courtesy in my name and at my request to your and my most beloved Mr. Gualter (Walter); for he, if I am not mistaken, is related either by marriage or blood to the owner of the horses. Nothing new has been reported to us here yet, except that those who have just come from Strasbourg assert for certain that the mass has not yet been admitted by the citizens. For this reason, the bishop of the city is not angry, but rages with a certain madness and fury and has arranged a colloquy in his city two miles from Strasbourg, and all who have met me here for the sake of friendship say that he is about to give birth to some horrendous monster; but I hope he will miscarry. You will also receive from this man one piece of linen, one cloth, and one cushion with the greatest thanks; furthermore, we are returning everything we borrowed for our journey to Basel. Hastily from Basel.</p>
      <p>Within three days you will receive more, God willing. We are returning a bottle; to whom it belongs, we do not know. Please ask our host and do not hesitate (I boldly place all burdens on your shoulders) to undertake this for our sake.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, John Hooper.</p>
      <p>We send our most dutiful greetings to your dear wife with your entire family, Mr. Theodor (Theodore), Mr. Pellican (Pellicanus), Mr. Gualter (Walter), Mr. Butler, and all others.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most pious and vigilant bishop of the church in Zürich, his lord and godfather, most deserving in every respect. In Zürich.</p>
