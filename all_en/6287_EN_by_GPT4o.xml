      <p>First of all, my father, although I am deeply affected by the feeling of your domestic sorrow, I nonetheless give thanks to our Lord and God for your restoration to us, as if life had been restored to me a hundred times over. May He also grant that I soon learn that not even the slightest remnants of your old or new troubles remain, as far as the condition of this miserable and calamitous life allows. By the grace of God, in Lyon, that plague has now mostly ceased, and the church is gathering again quite frequently. The plague had seized the second daughter and granddaughter of our Viret; but by God's mercy, both are safe. He himself has been miraculously preserved until now. The rumor of your death had also reached there, so much so that he was greatly disturbed by that news. But last week I wrote both to him and to many others everywhere, so that they may join me in giving thanks for your safety, which I know will be as pleasing to them as it is sad and unpleasant to our, that is, Christ's, adversaries. Again, therefore, my father, behold, I embrace you and ask you to take care to be completely well. I wrote before about us, that the plague was dealing with us very mildly; now, unless something worse happens henceforth, it seems to have decided to depart from us entirely. Fifteen days ago, when sixteen were suffering together, fourteen have now recovered, and now in the whole city, we count only two afflicted by that disease, and no one has been touched except for some maidservants and a few from the lowest class. Thus, we hope the Lord will gradually look upon us. However, the evil still rages in Dauphiné. The court is now heading towards Marseille, then plans to come to Toulouse and Bordeaux and winter there, where all the nobles of our parts will meet the king. Condé publicly did penance before the whole assembly of the church with tears, established discipline in his home, and finally, as it is written to me, has become a completely different man since the death of his wife. I also saw his letters to the queen, very serious against that last declaration of the edict, for which it is certain there will be no place among us. Would that peace may hold firm enough, which I would hope much more certainly if that alliance, about which I wrote to you, could be made with the king, with the added express promise of preserving the edict. For otherwise, let it never be thought of by you or by any pious ones. Therefore, when many brothers from France wrote to me again about this matter, our senate decided to appeal to our allies about it, for which reason I came to Bern with Mr. Roset, our syndic, as I think you have heard. There I heard that our envoys were somewhat difficult and almost showed themselves to be different than they had initially done both here and with you. I did not conceal this from them in letters written to them, urging them to act candidly and sincerely, otherwise to seek others to manage that alliance. And I hope they will act openly. Would that the Lord suggest those plans which may contribute to His glory and the salvation of the churches. Would that I had been allowed to run to you. If that had happened, I would certainly have had no reason to restrain myself from penetrating to you and satisfying my soul by embracing you, my father. Regarding our ubiquity, I truly hope that our adversary Satan will bear this, whatever it is of our work, very poorly; so many obstacles have been placed before me as I write. For it was not enough that the journey to Bern hindered the work, which would now be completed, but also in the printing house of our Crispin, a fever seized two of the workers, of whom there is now a remarkable scarcity here, so that the whole matter had to be interrupted. Tomorrow, however, as he promised me today, they will return to work, which will be completed in a few days with God's favor. I have, however, in Germany, someone who will receive and sell the copies sent at any time, which I will diligently take care of. Meanwhile, I send to you two copies of the printed sheets, which I will complete later. But to what end is this? I do not want you to be everywhere now, but rather to be entirely focused on strengthening your health. Therefore, farewell, my father, along with all the remaining brothers and colleagues, whom I wish our most merciful Lord may kindly look upon and preserve and bless more and more with you.</p>
      <p>Geneva, October 17, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>All the colleagues, with whom, as the sorrow was common, so now the joy is also common to me, bid you the greatest greetings and wish you to be completely well. Two hours ago, it was reported to us that four of our exiles, who do not cease to plot against us here in the vicinity, for some unknown reason fought so successfully among themselves that two were killed, one pierced by two gunshots barely clings to life, and the fourth is quite seriously wounded. Certainly a great judgment of God and very...</p>
