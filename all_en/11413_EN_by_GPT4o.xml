    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's ["The Christian Marriage"]. Otherwise, there is nothing to write; he hopes for good news from the Bundestag [in Schmalkalden]. His wife [Anna] also thanks for the book; they intend to heed its teachings. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>I give you as many thanks as I can for your little book; such gifts from such friends are most welcome to me. If only I could repay your many services to me. I await an opportunity, which, when presented, I will not be ungrateful.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write. Everything is now silent concerning the business of the Gospel. If only we could hear good news from our assembly!</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother, and always pray for us. March 10, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>My wife also thanks you for the gift; we will read it together and strive, aided by your exhortations, to become better.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household most diligently. I send my regards to Leo, Pellican, and all the brothers.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zurich, his dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
