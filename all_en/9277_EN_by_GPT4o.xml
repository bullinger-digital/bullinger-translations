      <p>Venerable, well-learned and spiritual lord, my unwaveringly inclined and willing service is always ready for you, especially gracious, dear lord. To hear of your and your family's well-being is always very pleasant to me, hoping also that it remains in good condition. May the faithful God continue to keep us in His grace. Therefore, gracious, honorable, dear lord, I am entirely inclined and willing to show myself grateful to you at all times for your many demonstrated and still daily friendship, yet I recognize that I am far too insignificant. However, you should accept my good will for the deeds before God from me, and I hereby send you this little gift as a grateful greeting; I believe it should be fat and good. I would have liked to send it to you for Easter, but it was not possible before the thaw. Therefore, please accept it from me in the best way possible, as it happens, and continue to keep me in friendly favor as before. I have nothing new worth writing to you, except that the ambassador from Solothurn wants to pay the pension; I do not know what it will bring with it.</p>
      <p>May the almighty faithful God graciously support His afflicted church and protect His own from violence and tyranny in a fatherly manner, and may He graciously allow us all to follow Him, and may He protect a pious Confederation from false practices. Amen.</p>
      <p>All of mine send you very friendly greetings and much honor, love, and good wishes.</p>
      <p>Given in Glarus on the 7th of April in the year of Christ 1573. Your always willing servant Michael Bäldi signed by his own hand.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned and spiritual lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher in Zürich, my gracious, dear lord.</p>
