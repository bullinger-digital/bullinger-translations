      <p>God be with us! Late at night, I received your letter, concerning a preacher who has come to the Abbess of Münsterlingen, etc. I have nothing to write to you about, writing now today on Sunday, November 16th, in case a message comes to hand that I would include in this letter. In it, I inform you that I would gladly serve the good lady and also our friendly, dear brother-in-law, the bailiff at Rhynow. However, this year we have sent away so many preachers that there are no more than 3 candidates available: Steyner, Wydler, Tobler; they have recently been examined.</p>
      <p>Be assured, those in Steckborn will request another at St. Maurice's, and if not, we cannot avoid it. There are indeed 4 sent home from the universities: Master Rudolf Wirt, Rudolf Leeman, Adam Wecker, Johannes Därer, etc.; but they have just arrived and have not yet been examined in the arts and philosophy. Be aware, they will not be examined in theology before the appropriate time. Therefore, at this time, I do not know anyone who could serve my lady abbess. I have also consulted with our Josia, who unfortunately suffers from gout, and we thought it best for the lady, if she were to see in Thurgau, whether she might find someone; the one at Burg, Studer, might perhaps be won over or another; I do not know them all in Thurgau. Brother-in-law Herter would know better who and how to proceed in this matter, etc. I write this to inform you, so that you can inform our friendly brother-in-law; greet him faithfully for me. God be with you all.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
