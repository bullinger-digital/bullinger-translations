      <p>S. D. I give you the greatest thanks I can, reverend man and most esteemed lord and dearest brother, for that most fortunate gospel.</p>
      <p>For you have combined many joyful things in one letter about the lifting of the siege (which tormented us in a remarkable way because of the example of Rouen) of Orléans through the unexpected return of the Admiral, about the young King of Navarre and the queen mother herself.</p>
      <p>We pray to the Lord to strengthen them, and if Orléans is not yet liberated, to liberate it soon and grant stable peace.</p>
      <p>If that wolf were to break into this fold of Christ, good God, with what great evils would he afflict us.</p>
      <p>Some soldiers have returned from the Guise camp, and among them one or two leaders.</p>
      <p>They ask for fresh soldiers from those villages, or from the villages and two towns, which they call reinforcements for the banners in France.</p>
      <p>We hear that they lie prodigiously, and among other things, that perhaps 300 were lost in battle, others perished by plague.</p>
      <p>Hence they now ask for 1500 or 2000 to be granted to them. And indeed others think that 14 new banners should be sent, lest if those few are sent, they be intercepted on the way.</p>
      <p>For they know that new soldiers or fresh German cavalry are coming to Lyon.</p>
      <p>There are others who advise that none should be sent.</p>
      <p>However, all whom I have heard think that at least 2000 should be sent.</p>
      <p>If the Admiral has lifted the siege of Orléans, they consult in vain about sending reinforcements.</p>
      <p>If he has returned from Normandy, he will easily prevent the armies from joining.</p>
      <p>I earnestly ask you that, if you have received any certain news about Orléans and the forces of the Admiral and the English, you ensure it is written to us through Jonvill.</p>
      <p>We pray for the Lord's blessing on Beza as he crosses to England, and we ask that, if you ever write to him, you greet him most kindly in our name.</p>
      <p>I am sending here the Sacramentarian History signed by my son-in-law Lavater, and the Oration of my other son-in-law Josias Simler on the death of the Martyr.</p>
      <p>You will keep one for yourself, and give the other (whichever you wish) to our Jonvill, along with those 10 batz.</p>
      <p>I give him the greatest thanks and in return offer him my service.</p>
      <p>As soon as my response to Brentius and Josias's response to Stancarus has been printed, I will send it to you by the first messenger.</p>
      <p>My German work is now printed, etc.</p>
      <p>Others write from Italy that Lorraine has sought aid from the princes of Italy against the Huguenots.</p>
      <p>Others say that a certain sum of money has been promised to him.</p>
      <p>Others deny it, fearing the Turkish fleet. Others write that a treaty was struck at Brussels not far from Bologna, where they met, and that the commander of the treaty is the Prince of Savoy, who has been ordered in the common name to attack with a just army, uncertain whether Geneva or Lyon first.</p>
      <p>And all these things are done under the auspices of Lorraine.</p>
      <p>However, I do not report these things to you as certain, brother, but only what I have understood from letters of friends sent from Rhaetia.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I write these things to you as rumors spread.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, together with all the fellow ministers. All the fellow ministers greet you most kindly with all yours.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe from all evil.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 8, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I beg you most earnestly to ensure that these two copies do not fall into the hands of anyone who would reprint them and thus cause damage.</p>
      <p>Recent works have now come out of the printing press. I send you my copies: give them to no one else.</p>
      <p>I hurried, I did not reread.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, the most faithful minister of the Church of Geneva, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
