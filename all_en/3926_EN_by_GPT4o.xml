      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I have no doubt, most illustrious and esteemed Bullinger, that with your exceptional wisdom, you understand how much joy your letters have brought me. Besides the fact that they commend the patience of my dearest mother in enduring so many severe and prolonged bodily afflictions (for which I humbly pray that God may further grant her His kindness), they also affirm that your longstanding goodwill towards me is still preserved in your mind. Therefore, I extend my utmost gratitude for your kindness and also ask that you continue to hold me in your affection. If there is any way I can be of service to all of you, I will gladly do so.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow I will depart from here to Vilnius, to practice the art of medicine there. I have often been offered a medical position with the most illustrious Prince Palatine of Vilnius, but until now I have neither accepted nor declined it.</p>
      <p>There are friends who advise me to accept, and there are also those who advise against it, each providing not insignificant reasons for their counsel. As a result, my mind remains distracted and still uncertain.</p>
      <p>However, I am unlikely to accept, considering it more honorable to live freely with a free spirit than to serve even in wealth. The physician who previously served the prince is my betrothed's uncle, and he says the position is indeed substantial, yet he somehow advises against it. Court life brings with it many and great troubles: I have nothing new to write, except that the Master of the Teutonic Order in Livonia is here, and, as they say, he will submit to the King of Poland in the same way as the Prussian did. But you will learn more about this from others soon.</p>
      <p>I commend my mother and all my family to your favor and goodwill. I would greatly mourn the passing of my old uncle, if I did not consider that he had lived enough according to nature. I received your letters on the 15th of this month.</p>
      <p>If you wish to send any gift to Master Andreas, it can be most conveniently done through Nuremberg. He himself wrote to you and instructed me to commend him to you as diligently as possible.</p>
      <p>Even though you do not know him, love the man, for he is worthy of being loved by all. Greet in my name your wife and all your children, my dearest teacher Mr. Frisius, and all the rest of your household. Farewell, and continue to love me as you do, and if ever your duties allow, write to me.</p>
      <p>However, send the letters to the widow of Dr. Antoninus, my betrothed's mother, residing in the district of St. John in Krakow, from where I can easily receive them. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given in Krakow on the 20th of April in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, Anton Schneeberger of Zurich, physician.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, my most esteemed lord and as if my own parent. In Zurich.</p>
