      <p>God be with you, along with the offering of my services, etc.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, I have been credibly informed that you are in a considerable displeasure regarding your preaching, and that the Confederates in Baden have given orders to investigate. Since you are well aware of how things go when one comes into such a situation, and that, when it comes to the right, there are more places that are harsh than kind, and the matter might become too burdensome for you, I warn you in good time that you, without any delay, quietly arrange your affairs, without informing the governor, the mayor, or anyone else, but rather prudently remove yourself from the county. However, if you wish, when you are ready to depart, to inform your blood relatives, let them know that you understand there is some displeasure concerning you; therefore, you are in the best position, so that no one else may come into further trouble concerning you, and you leave.</p>
      <p>Thanking everyone who has done you good. They may also find other ways, where you pray that God be with them. However, I would not want this to be announced by your relatives until you are safely away; for I always fear that you and yours may be detained. Understand all this from me in the best way and do not underestimate the matter. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Saturday, August 3, in the year 1560. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his dear sir and brother Tobias Egli, preacher in Frauenfeld.</p>
