    <p xml:id="regest1">At the request of Philipp of Hesse, Heinrich Bullinger supported the envoy Johannes Lening in carrying out his mission. Except for the article about a possible threat to the Sundgau, which was unnecessary for Zurich, everything was faithfully presented. Lening will provide a detailed report.</p>

      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince and lord, my dutiful, willing service is readily offered to your princely grace.</p>
      <p>Since your princely grace desires that Lenignus, your princely grace's envoy, be assisted, I have applied my utmost diligence so that he might fulfill his mission most faithfully. He has also diligently done so, except for one article concerning the threat in the form of rebellion against the Sundgau. For various reasons, it was not at all appropriate or beneficial for your princely grace, as it could not have advanced anything at this time. What was otherwise beneficial for us and your princely grace and your endeavors has been diligently presented, as Lenignus, our dear brother and faithful one, can recount to your princely grace in detail. May God Almighty grant your princely grace His strength and grace, so that you may call upon Him in pure fear, entrust yourself to Him confidently, and in Him, according to all wishes, achieve good and the expansion of the holy gospel. For this, we also pray to Him from the heart.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, the 29th day of April in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's most willing servant H. B., servant of the word of the church of Zurich.</p>
