    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer will have learned from the Baselers about the position [of the Zurichers] on the Wittenberg Concord; Vadian's ["Aphorisms"] will also convince Luther that nothing stands in the way of a Eucharistic concord. Bullinger asks Bucer to prevent Erhard Schnepf from further polemics against the "Sacramentarians." The Zurich pastors have not taken sides against [King Francis I] but are successfully fighting against mercenary service in agreement with the authorities. Bullinger reports on the arrival of the Englishmen Nicholas [Partridge], John [Butler], and William [Woodroffe] [recommended by Bucer]. Greetings. Rejects the criticism of Theodor [Bibliander].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You have probably heard from our dearest brothers in Basel what we have responded to their faithful exposition of the Wittenberg Articles. Indeed, our Vadian's books will openly testify what we hold and teach about this sacred mystery, so that Doctor Luther can no longer doubt or suspect our position. You will, I believe, praise the Lord's grace and find nothing lacking in these books. For if Doctor Luther's opinion is as you and Zwingli claim, this book will not disrupt but confirm concord. Our Leo and Pellicanus, during our discussions, said: If Doctor Luther and his followers accept this book and do not condemn it, it will beautifully unite both sides; but if they reject it, we will feel that concord cannot be restored in any way. However, I have the greatest hope that Doctor Luther and his followers will find nothing displeasing, but will indeed understand how religiously we feel about this sacred mystery of Christ, and that we do not deny Christ's presence. This will indeed remove all remaining suspicions. I promise nothing else but that an indissoluble concord has now been established between us. Praise and glory be to God.</p>
      <p>Only one thing seems to remain: We hear that Erhard Schnepf in Stuttgart is vehemently railing against the Sacramentarians in public sermons. This kind of insult would be less offensive if he did not reveal whom he means by adding circumstances. For we are well aware of how religiously we feel about the sacraments. However, it pains us that he attacks the undeserving with slander. Therefore, if concord is dear to you, ensure that he does not disrupt it with untimely loquacity. Let him rather inveigh against the despisers of the divine and sacred things, against crimes and criminals. There will be no lack of material for speaking if he wishes to act as a good shepherd. It seems to be the act of a sick man, not a prudent bishop, to attack, oppose, and persecute friends, brothers, and servants of the same Lord, soldiers of the same emperor. But if he continues to say what he wants, he will eventually hear what he does not want.</p>
      <p>They lie who reported to you that the Zurich preachers publicly disapprove of the French institution and praise the emperor. Although there would be no lack of arguments against the French, whose ministers incite the citizens and people of Zurich to slaughter against the treaties. However, we only dissuade from mercenary service, advising our people to live from the work of their hands, not from bloodstained rewards, and to obey their magistrate, whose decree ensures that none of ours follow mercenary service for the French or the emperor, etc. You know, however, that we have a perpetual war with the Caric customs, with pensioners and pensions. For if this plague had not seized our people, the whole of Switzerland would have long since received the gospel of Christ. We do nothing rashly here, nothing inconsiderately in this matter. We have learned what is useful and necessary for our churches. Therefore, we direct all the strength of our bodies and the gifts of our minds to this, so that through our people, it may be possible for other nations to be at peace, so that our people, once accustomed to wars, may now become unaccustomed to them and take care of their own affairs, strive for tranquility and peace. And we are making no small progress with this effort. Glory to the Lord. For it is beautifully agreed between the magistrate and the people among us. Few of ours follow military service after taking the sacrament, and those who do are mostly such that it would be better if they had gone, but never returned, unless God grants them to return differently than they left.</p>
      <p>The Englishmen who have come to us are very pious and of great promise. Nicholas is staying with me and is my companion. John and William are with Pellicanus. All of them, especially Nicholas, wish you well along with the other good men, whose kindness and humanity they wonderfully praise. Continue to do good to strangers.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell, my Bucer, most venerable to me in the Lord. May my Capito also fare well.</p>
      <p>If you knew Theodor's pious and learned mind as I do, you would interpret the man's writings much more civilly.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 1, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger from the heart and in all things.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Martin Bucer, bishop of the most illustrious city of Strasbourg, most esteemed lord.</p>
