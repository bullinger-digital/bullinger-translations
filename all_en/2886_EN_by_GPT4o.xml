      <p>Strasbourg, April 6.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, most esteemed man, in which you indicate that you have received a bundle of letters from me. I am glad that those letters were delivered so faithfully; furthermore, I distributed the greetings you sent to the English, especially to our bishop.</p>
      <p>Moryson was already dead; Mr. Cheke has left here. I wanted to inform you of this as part of my duty towards you. Mr. Cranmer was burned on March 21 in Oxford. A certain absurd recantation, fabricated by the papists, began to spread while he was alive, as if he had sung that palinode; but the authors themselves retracted it while he was alive, and he strongly protested and denied it while living. The haters of God are plotting dire and harsh things against England; may the best and greatest God avert His wrath from us! Mary says she will crown her Philip even against everyone's will; she dares to say this even to the counselors who dissuade her. She is making a great preparation of money and arms. You see where this is heading; therefore, pray to the Lord.</p>
      <p>As for what I wrote in previous letters about the Antichrist to Mr. Gualter, it is now as follows: while I was preparing to translate it into our language, I received word that another Englishman not only undertook the same work but also completed it; I think it is now either in the press or printed. Satan is plotting many things here to disturb the peace of the churches, and he not only stirs up the Westphalians and others like them to be turbulent, but he also sows his seeds among us exiles. The church of the French in Frankfurt is now suffering from this disease; there is indeed a great contention between the pastor and some of the sheep (if they are true sheep). You, best father, who are not unaware of such schemes of Satan, oppose his snares with your prayers. Would that we might perform this as earnestly as the matter demands!</p>
      <p>There is only one other thing I wish. When I was in Zürich, it was allowed to me (for such was your singular kindness towards me) to hear and learn from you by acting and conversing with you, in matters where I needed advice and instruction. If I may do and experience the same through letters while absent, you will do me a most pleasing favor.</p>
      <p>I promise neither to be too troublesome to you, nor to expect responses so hastily that I would not always submit myself with the greatest patience to the greatest crowd of your affairs. However, before I have a clear understanding of your will, I do not dare to attempt this, lest I seem to be an impediment to one so diligently laboring in the Lord's vineyard. May the Lord Himself, to whom you belong and whose affairs you handle, preserve you living and healthy for a long time for His church. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Yours, Thomas Sampson.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zürich.</p>
