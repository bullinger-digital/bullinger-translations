    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Simler has hardly anything noteworthy to share, but writes nonetheless, so as not to let the current reliable bearer [Isaak Keller] go to Zurich without a letter, especially since he very much wishes to be recommended to Bullinger in writing. He is a good friend, who is Simon Grynaeus’ stepson and is quite diligently devoted to his studies, as Bullinger will likely learn from his companions [Francisco de Enzinas and Johannes Oporin].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Josias has received well the money and the enclosed letter sent by Bullinger and thanks him for it. He still does not know how his studies will proceed. However, Bullinger and Josias’ father [Peter Simler] will certainly consult about it and make a good decision.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In Basel, Celio Secondo Curione is now teaching, an excellent rhetoric teacher and speaker. Simler is impressed by his lectures. There is also a good lecture in the field of mathematics, whose absence in the curriculum of Zurich, in his opinion, represents a gap. Josias loves the subject very much. Therefore, it would not bother him if he had to stay in Basel and could not continue his studies elsewhere. Bullinger should communicate his decision at his convenience.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings to Anna [née Adlischwyler] and to the whole family. Greetings from Simler’s host [Konrad Wolfhart] as well as from Huldrych Zwingli the Younger.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Christ Jesus. Although I had nothing particularly necessary to write, dearest father Bullinger, since I had someone to whom I could rightly give a letter, this young man who is very closely connected to me, I could not let him go empty-handed, especially since he greatly desired to have some letters from me. He is the stepson of Grynaeus, a good young man and quite devoted to his studies (as you will no doubt learn from his companions). He is also very closely connected to me.</p>

      <p>I received the money along with the letters that you took care to send to me, for which I am very grateful to you. Although I still have nothing certain about my own affairs, I do not doubt that you will consult with my father about what is most beneficial for me.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We now have an excellent rhetorician and, as it seems, an outstanding orator, Celio Secondo, whose lectures I cannot express how much they please and captivate me. There is also a good lecture on mathematics here, which, in my opinion, you lack, since the studies attract and affect me in a wonderful way, so it would not be unpleasant if I had to stay in Basel if I could not go elsewhere. I ask you to inform me of your opinion when you have the time.</p>

      <p>May the Lord preserve you and your entire family in safety for as long as possible! Also, convey my many greetings to your wife and the whole family in my name. My lord and Zwingli send you many greetings. Given in Basel, January 23. Ever devoted to you, Josias Simler.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and father.</p>
