      <p>Grace and peace from God, the Father, through His Christ Jesus, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Honorable, well-learned, especially dear lords and brothers, regarding your letter concerning our dear lord and brother Leo Jud, we have understood all its contents. And although we have heard with heartfelt joy the love and willing inclination you have, as far as you could with a good conscience, to advise and help us, for which we thank you brotherly and faithfully, with the offer that we also wish to be found of such a will at all times. However, we could not be satisfied with the refusal you mentioned to us about letting Leo Jud go. For (Because) even the high-born prince, our gracious lord, Count Georg of Württemberg, etc., has written earnestly to your and our gracious lords, the mayor and council of Zurich, as well as to Leo, about this matter. Therefore, we have once again sent our beloved brother Nikolaus König, pastor in Hunawihr, to you, with the letters of our gracious lord of Württemberg, etc., to deliver to the council and him (Leo), also our responses to you, and to insist earnestly that Leo be released to us; for you unreasonably refuse him to us, for reasons that since the word of God has freely and unerringly reached you, you should not hide the light under the bushel, but place it on the lampstand, so that it shines for all people in the house of God, indeed even more, you as the stronger should help us, the weaker, and send him, Leo, and his fellow reapers, even if they did not want to, into the Lord's great harvest, and what you have received freely, give freely. Therefore, our brotherly and faithful request to you is that you, for the increase of the honor of God and the building of His body, the church, especially in view of the aforementioned writing of our gracious lord of Württemberg, etc., promote the matter among the council and among yourselves in such a way that our beloved brother Leo will be released to us, in whom you will undoubtedly promote the honor of the divine name and increase His praise and glory, which we also always brotherly and faithfully desire to earn from you.</p>
      <p>Dated in Riquewihr, Thursday, the 16th day of September in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>The pastors and preachers in Riquewihr and other places of the dominion of Württemberg.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned, and faithful preachers and readers, servants of the church in Zurich, our dear lords and brothers.</p>
