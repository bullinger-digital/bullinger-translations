      <p>Greetings. Recently, Mr. Hieronymus Zanchi, a man renowned for his outstanding learning and piety, came to us. He faithfully reported to us that the controversy, which you are aware of, has been entrusted to the upcoming Chur synod to be discussed and resolved by the common vote of his church. Therefore, he has come before the time of the synod so that he can discuss everything necessary with us. However, when plans were being made, he was informed by his friends that the opposing party would not be present. According to the custom of that place, we have summoned the adversary in writing and also urged the church not to neglect its duty but to send its representatives, whose presence and work would help to discuss and settle this matter. We will hear what response we will receive. Meanwhile, since it is well known and sufficiently evident that the opposing party is seeking to hide, causing delays, and prefers anything but coming to a discussion, lest they be seen to have erred so disgracefully and be proven wrong, we humbly come to you, most kind father, asking that with your wisdom, which is peculiar to you, you resolve this issue for us: namely, what should we do if the other party does not appear, not only what is permissible for us but also what is expedient. And since you know the saying "Justice delayed is justice denied," how and whether we should proceed, so that while the adversary avoids the light and devises all sorts of ways to escape the order, such malicious evasion does not harm the other party. I am greatly troubled when I think about the sea of troubles I am plunged into, in which I can never satisfy myself, let alone the church, which I serve against my conscience.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask that you remedy my ignorance in this matter and restore harmony between Mr. Zanchi and the brothers with your advice. And if the situation compels us to transfer this entire dispute to the most honorable Senate of the Three Leagues, so that the innocent party may be defended by their authority, since these men will try to win by cunning and deceit, indeed by a certain tyranny, not without benefit (provided it is done without troubling you), our most honorable councilors should be advised by you on this matter. Thus, I believe the ambiguity of the case and the clouds of discord can be more quickly dispelled, and the healthy light of concord can shine forth. Farewell, incomparable ornament of the Christian world, and consider us, though unworthy, as your entrusted brothers. Chur, 1567. [I...] Your most observant Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most renowned pastor of the Zurich church, always to be revered as a father. Zurich.</p>
