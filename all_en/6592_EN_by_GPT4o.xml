      <p>To the honorable lord and father, your letters have reached me faithfully, and as it was Saturday and I was burdened with many other tasks, I could only briefly respond to you.</p>
      <p>Firstly, you should truly believe me that your and your family's troubles deeply sadden me, and that my wife and I speak more of you than you might believe yourself.</p>
      <p>Since I have learned the same comfort that I might have in a similar situation from the scriptures and your own books, it is not necessary to overwhelm you with unnecessary speeches. May God, the Father of all comfort, strengthen and console you and your family and protect you from further sorrow and trouble.</p>
      <p>As for us, I have written sufficiently before to our bookseller, considering that my letters have now reached you.</p>
      <p>And since it is important that you understand all matters thoroughly and as needed, you should know this: Initially, after the death of the previous bishop, I advised our people: since the bishop's oath, which is made to the Pope, would equally strongly compel us, who are of the evangelical religion, to make a confession of our faith and to clarify it, that as much as it depends on us, we are inclined to bring the bishopric into another and better state; however, if we had no success, we could not complain to anyone about it, but if we succeeded, etc. Thereupon, it was discussed in the guilds, and this has become more, as I have mentioned before.</p>
      <p>But it lasted only a few days and very briefly, that one was not seen in the election. Then some from the city, against their own knowledge, sided with the party and over 70 men sided with [Lord] Batten, also forcibly brought him back to the altar against the church, as the canons themselves wrote to Rome, etc.</p>
      <p>Moreover, more than 30 citizens participated in the papal rites. What do you think was in my heart as a minister? Is that being impartial and acting according to the community's knowledge? I have discussed it with all seriousness, and when they saw the Salian enemy, my speech was like poison to the right leaders, and when the entire French faction initially opposed the Salians, no true advice took place.</p>
      <p>When some of our people rode to the Five Places, some went to Innsbruck, some went to Rome against the common church, I and many honest men saw where the game was going, and in time warned enough in truth, for which [Lord] Batten and many of the pensioners secretly resented me.</p>
      <p>And when they could not go further with the common man, they accused me of becoming a Salian, whom I had previously opposed, just as if I were as miserable as they, that I adapted my actions to the persons. Finally, when I sensed their stubbornness and also sensed that they would gladly attack my honor, I protested before God and the community from the pulpit and took my last stand, that I did not speak out of temptation, for my own benefit, but as a true servant of Christ, to warn them alone, etc. And when I spoke in such a way that it touched many honest men to the heart and thereby the Batten faction came somewhat into suspicion, the devil showed himself cunningly, and what followed, as you have heard.</p>
      <p>If I had acted otherwise, I would have been a fool and not a true shepherd. Whatever may follow, I cannot help them; I have spoken as I am obliged to do, for which an honorable council of the city of Chur and many pious people bear witness. But since it is likely that the devil will regret it, and many comforting words are spoken daily, my urgent request to you is that you report to my gracious [lords] the mayor and some good council friends on behalf of the whole matter; for my adversaries will regret it. I would have written to my gracious lords myself, but I would have had to reveal much that might be better kept silent for now until its time. So that I am not shortened, please do your best for God's sake, and also inform Dr. Wolfius and Dr. Gualterus accordingly.</p>
      <p>For, as I have written to you, so it is, and my gracious lords of the city of Chur have sharply bound the matter against the two who accused me and clearly stated that if they do not like my preaching, they can move elsewhere.</p>
      <p>They grumble in front of me, but in the meantime, they gnash their teeth. But now Gregory Carlinus reveals who he is.</p>
      <p>Initially, before the bishop was buried, he ran to my house, admonishing me to work towards not appointing another bishop; then he admonished some of the canons in my presence to handle the church with advice and not to undertake anything for themselves. This was in public.</p>
      <p>In secret, he and [councilor] Tscharner did everything to the contrary.</p>
      <p>They wanted to deceive me with flattering words; now, when they see that I have perceived it and persisted in the duty of a pious minister, they persecute me mortally. For those who have so far used the gospel for profit, they have done this, they themselves are the authors of everything; for Battus is their friend. This is our gospel.</p>
      <p>You ask if they attack me in person.</p>
      <p>Not at all; they are flattering; but from many arguments, it is clear to me, and many good people affirm to me that they speak most insultingly of me in my absence, who flatter in person. May God grant them to recognize it, etc.</p>
      <p>They judge others.</p>
      <p>You give thanks for the wine and other things, as if I could achieve even a six-hundredth part of your merits towards me. I had progressed this far, reverend father in Christ, when behold, your letters full of duty and paternal goodwill, as always, were returned to me; for Helbling had given the previous ones.</p>
      <p>So, in short, know this: my adversaries show themselves somewhat milder; for Satan transforms himself into all forms. Yesterday, summoned by the lictor by the consuls to dine together in the episcopal castle, where the bishop received the senate at a banquet after taking the oath, since I was repeatedly invited, I also went. [Councilor] Tscharner spoke with me about many things after the meal; but among other things, he admitted that they had done too much in the matter. The children of this world are cunning.</p>
      <p>You will not name anyone in Zurich.</p>
      <p>They will soon come back themselves when they can no longer go further. What Dr. Beza writes about the French, I read with horror; but our help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>
      <p>Your money will certainly be given to you, and indeed the full amount and soon, do not doubt; for the consul sent to that widow yesterday. She had wine to open, but it did not go.</p>
      <p>The consul urges the matter, and yesterday both promised all their efforts and ordered me not to doubt anything; the full amount will be given. I would have liked to send it today; but it could not be.</p>
      <p>Do not thank me for such small things, as you continually serve me in far greater matters. The composing stick had luck to say; it would not have become a penny.</p>
      <p>The plague has invaded a citizen's house here and emptied it; if it spreads further, we will be pressed by a double evil. I send everything back with great thanks.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 3, 1565.</p>
      <p>Use my writings cautiously and share them only with trusted ones. To the most honorable man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zurich [to Mr.] Bullinger.</p>
