      <p>Ludwig Pfyffer, colonel, writes to his lords of Lucerne.</p>
      <p>Honorable, noble, steadfast and gracious lords and fathers, knowing that concerning me and the whole company, thank God, all is well and there are few sick servants. Since I do not know if my previous letter has reached you, I want to inform you, my gracious lords, in more detail, etc. When we left Meaux, the Prince of Condé, Admiral, Andelot, and Rochefoucauld had made their plans to capture the king, queen, and the king's brother and to eradicate the lineage. As we marched about two or three miles, the king was warned in battle formation about the enemy's presence, and they showed themselves with up to 1000 horses, and the king had no mercenaries or other troops with him, only us Swiss Confederates and nothing else but court people. Although the Constable, the Duke of Anjou, Marshal of France, and the young Lord of Guise were present and other lords, they were not equipped as there were no troops other than us. When the enemy followed us on foot, they did not dare to attack us, but they sent some mounted shooters who fired into our formation and injured two servants; otherwise, we suffered no harm from them. Thus, with God's help, we brought the king along with the queen and the king's brother to Paris, where we stayed quietly for 7 weeks, in great danger, until help arrived. And on the evening of St. Martin's Day, we moved with our forces, which the king could muster, out of Paris towards Saint-Denis with 12 cannons, standing in battle formation. Around three or four o'clock, our cavalry was attacked and held their ground well. It is reported that about 370 of the nobility, excluding others, were killed or injured. On our side, about 50 of the nobility remained, among them the Constable, who was cut and shot, dying on the third day. The Huguenots themselves killed a good number. I think about 1000 men remained there. If the day had been longer, we would have settled the matter with them; but they retreated disgracefully, moving away that night, thinking we would follow them, but it was night, etc. Thus, on the 24th of November, we moved out of Paris into the field. The king had 9000 horses together and 16000 strong on foot along with 18 cannons on wheels. The Duke of Montmorency, the Duke of Guise, and the Lord of Tavannes held the pass against the cavalry with 15000 strong. The Duke of Nevers comes with 1200 horses, 4000 Piedmontese and Italians along with 4000 Swiss Confederates. When these forces come together, the king has up to 12000 horses and 30000 on foot, truly good soldiers, and fine people of the nobility, which the Huguenots did not expect, that he could bring together such a force. Among them are about 1500 Flemish and Burgundian horses and some Spanish mounted shooters; their leader is the Count of Horn, a fine lord, showing himself friendly, so if it comes to a battle; he wants to join us bravely; they are well equipped with good horses. I hope we will bring the king to peace.</p>
      <p>The Huguenots would now like peace; but I think the king will not do it; his nobility would also not be satisfied; for they have come to his majesty at great cost and have a good desire to fight.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the Duke of Anjou, the king's brother, who is our field commander, informed me that Mâcon has been conquered. Thus, the Huguenots have no luck anywhere, although they carried out their betrayal on St. Michael's evening, which began all over the kingdom. They thought the cities would all be on their side as before; but it failed. God did not will it. They have been lords in the field for a long time, disgracefully going out with burning and stealing like the Turks. But it has gotten better. When they stand, they will be fought with; for they will be pursued on foot. They still have some cities like Orléans and Sens; but the king will soon overcome them. I can imagine there is a great outcry among you, my gracious lords, as they have moved around and burned and taken the small towns; the king could not prevent it until his forces came to us. Now I hope he will uproot the evil roots.</p>
      <p>Our field commander is very friendly with us and shows much goodness. The king and queen are in Paris, truly fond of us, and we are well paid. In Paris, it was expensive; but now in the camp, it is plentiful. I would have written longer; but the road was not safe. But in 10 days, if there is no peace, I will inform you, my gracious lords, further about what happens here. We are no more than 4 small miles from the enemy.</p>
      <p>With a request, you, my gracious lords, would have me and the whole company recommended.</p>
      <p>Given on the 13th of December 1567.</p>
