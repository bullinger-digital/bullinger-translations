      <p>S. D. As far as can be inferred from what the people of Augsburg write to me, dearest godfather in the Lord, Germany will soon be involved in the most serious upheavals, hopefully not also in disasters. Ferdinand has gradually gathered forces in various places, meanwhile deceiving Maurice with words; this is how the foolish Germans are to be dealt with. The armies of the princes are descending on Regensburg, where Ferdinand has 12 cohorts; 16,000 have been gathered in Carinthia and Styria. The elector, who was previously captive, is now free, and the elder son is said to have become Ferdinand's son-in-law; Johann Friedrich himself, if what is written is true, is returning to Saxony through the Bohemians and is going to deal with Maurice with the help of the Bohemian troops, and will repay like with like; however, Count of Oldenburg is said to be ready to resist. Then, an army supposedly under the name of the Emperor, but in reality of the bishops of Mainz, Bamberg, and Würzburg, is advancing from Aschaffenburg to liberate the Nurembergers. Bavaria and Württemberg are being filled with selected soldiers, so they seem to be preparing to resist the princes. The people of Augsburg, understanding these things, are in a state of fear. As I read this, I think it is very true what he said: "Remove delays; it has always been harmful to postpone for those who are ready."</p>
      <p>It would have been better to descend to Linz and Passau with an army ready to fight rather than to negotiate.</p>
      <p>The church in Augsburg still endures the Interimists, those in-between chameleons, while it has its former preachers, once expelled by the Emperor, ready at hand; for they are all now in Augsburg except for the one who is here with us. However, the senate refuses to grant them ministry until they are released from the bond of the oath they have taken. The city and the church themselves have embraced freedom, rejecting the tyranny of the Emperor; only the ministers are still considered bound and sworn, even though they are also citizens of this republic. If you have any news from Italy, please share it. Nothing certain about the Emperor. Ferdinand is involved everywhere.</p>
      <p>Farewell very well, dearest godfather. Greetings to your entire household, as well as to the brothers, lords, and friends.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 12.</p>
      <p>W[olfgang] Mus[culus], yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
