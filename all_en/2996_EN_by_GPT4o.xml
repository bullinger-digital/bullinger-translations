      <p>Greetings. It pains me, my dear Bullinger, that you are tormented by headaches, and they have become all too familiar to me as well, often interrupting the course of my duties; thus the Lord God exercises and tests us, whose hand we must patiently endure, for He will once deliver us from the difficulties of life and bring us to the harbor of relief.</p>
      <p>I will not cease to pray that He may preserve you for the church for a long time. The delegates from Geneva were here. But since they touched upon nothing in any matter except the established defense against the exiles' slanders, our people did not engage with them, who, as they are (for I conversed with them familiarly and extensively), are entirely of the same opinion as yours, and both republics, unless they unite in a solid alliance, predict certain ruin: thus they await what your council, which now knows all matters, will decide should be attempted in this business: therefore I wish for something to be done promptly. I have already written to some in Bern and have dealt here with some from the greater council, intending to act with more Bernese friends. However, it seems that the brothers should also be encouraged, which I wish you to do, so that they may seriously and both publicly and privately apply themselves here, to make their minds more prepared for all kinds of reconciliation.</p>
      <p>The printer recommended by you seems to me exactly as you described, and I am all the more pleased that he has obtained a position with the margrave. Farewell in Christ Jesus, and I ask that you inform this very person, who carries this letter, of the way by which he can certainly and safely transmit my letters to the consul of Glarus and Mr. Fridolin Brunner. Also, write, as soon as you can, about the state of affairs in Glarus.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 25, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
