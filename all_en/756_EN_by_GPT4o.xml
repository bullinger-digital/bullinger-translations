      <p>Greetings. I am very grateful to you and to our excellent brothers who sent the librarian's review to you. I wish I had been warned sooner. However, it is better late than never. I will do as you advise. But I have postponed that writing, because it was brief, until the time of the fairs. It will be more troublesome than laborious for me, because I will have to argue with my household.</p>
      <p>I would prefer to contend with declared enemies. Although these are also our exercises. This will be the reason why I will conclude more briefly.</p>
      <p>All my brothers have gladly embraced the formula of agreement. If you wish, you will have it signed by all hands as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Since there is no hope that the book on avoiding superstitions will be reprinted soon, as the printer still claims to have many copies, I have taken care to append the supplement you sent. Thus, the book will be more marketable. And it is better that it was enriched with this adornment before it was spread further.</p>
      <p>I wish to commend to you the cause of the brothers in Lausanne. Recently, by a decree of the senate, they were forbidden to meet as usual to discuss the scripture. The reason was that each one in turn would expound a passage of scripture, then each would bring what was given by the Lord. This communication has been very fruitful so far and has kept many in their duty. For the one whose turn it was to expound the passage was privately admonished if he had said anything ignorantly, less skillfully, or out of place. Since that troublesome brawler Zebedee has sometimes disturbed with his contentions, it is very unjust that this excellent institution is abolished for his sake.</p>
      <p>Indeed, at the request of Viret, the senate has somewhat mitigated this rigor. However, the edict remains by which they are ordered to meet only every third month. Meanwhile, the Bernese brothers, as I hear, behave more imperiously than fraternally towards them, so that nothing counts except the name of the ministry itself. However, this is not an ecclesiastical way. But if the Bernese despise that college, I say nothing else except that they and those to whom they are so injurious know themselves poorly. It is more than clear that they are despised and treated contemptuously. So that nothing is more serious, they constantly hear masterly threats. Nor do they see, when they seek dominion over the brothers, how much more harshly they bring upon themselves the yoke of servitude. This depravity does not reign in all.</p>
      <p>However, the worse part prevails. I allow myself to freely lay these complaints in your bosom. It is neither necessary nor expedient for them to spread further. You, with your prudence and fairness, will strive to interpose some remedy for these evils. Especially, it will be necessary to ensure that those whom you know forget their Zebedee and similar delights.</p>
      <p>Recently, when a certain learned and sharp brother was elected to the office of deacon, the one who translated my booklet on judicial astrology, who voluntarily deserted his father, a royal counselor in the Parisian court, with the hope of a rich inheritance to serve Christ, it happened by their efforts that the senate rejected him. I know these things cannot be approved by you. If you cannot completely cure this pest of malevolence, you will have to work to some extent to restrain it.</p>
      <p>Bucer, in the last letters he wrote to me, complained that he was being misrepresented by Hopper as if he asserted the ubiquity of the body of Christ.</p>
      <p>I am the best witness of how far he is from that delirium. If you ever write to the man, you will remind him to consider that Bucer was one of the foremost servants of Christ in this age, well-deserving of the church, having endured many labors, and now being an exile for Christ, so that he does not inhumanely burden the old man in his extreme age.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man and brother to be respected by me in the Lord. Many greetings from me to your colleagues, and privately to your family.</p>
      <p>All my brothers send you many greetings. I also wish to greet Heinrich in my name.</p>
      <p>Geneva, December 7, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, esteemed and dearest colleague and brother.</p>
