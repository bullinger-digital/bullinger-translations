    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The matter depends entirely on the Lord, in whom we must trust in all things.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer will heed Bullinger's admonitions [in a letter not preserved] regarding an acceptable peace [with Emperor Charles V], especially since deceitful practices are to be feared. He also does not think that the people of Konstanz would abandon their friendship with the [four Protestant cantons], especially with Bullinger, whom Blarer loves more than himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He fully shares Bullinger's viewpoint. He is very pleased with Bullinger's "[Brevis] institutio" and hopes for its wide dissemination [through printing]. He returns it with thanks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It would not have been necessary to give money to the messenger [...] since Blarer had already paid him 1/2 florin!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer has heard nothing from [Georg] Frölich and [Johannes] Haller; writing letters would likely expose them to danger. Blarer hopes that Bullinger is not waiting in vain for better news [about the Zurich pastors Lorenz Meyer and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder sent to Augsburg].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] It is unknown from which place [of the Confederation] the recently mentioned envoys originate. Today, the people of Konstanz have sent a messenger to Ulm to find out more. Bullinger should pray with his entire church that Christ shows His people a way out of the evil without causing even worse. In the face of impending danger, many prove to be weak and fearful. For many others, however, nothing is more important than the glory of Christ and the welfare of the fatherland. Hopefully, the latter sentiment will prevail in this dangerous time. Bullinger should pray unceasingly for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The imperial riders led by [Burkhard] von Kaltenthal, who recently moved towards Augsburg and back again, captured Pankraz Mötteli [of Rappenstein] along the way and took him to Ulm. They also confiscated a wagon with goods from Augsburg (including four bales of fustian from [the merchant family] Bimmel). However, in Ulm, they were ordered to return this cargo. Two Spanish riders, who rode on Mötteli's horses, dined in Konstanz on their way to Ulm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] A friend [...] from Ulm wrote that the Emperor intends to let about 7000 Spanish soldiers winter in the Oberland. By the way, the [imperial] riders said that they could not capture Sebastian Schertlin because of [the arrest of] Mötteli.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The Bishop of Augsburg [Otto Truchsess von Waldburg] has ordered the Carthusians in Buxheim to resume their old religion with masses, singing, and ceremonies, to wear their habit again, and no longer participate in the forbidden [evangelical sermons] in Memmingen. Two monks [Johannes Chrysostomus Haug and Hugo Schellang] want to comply, while two others [Petrus Blomen of Aachen and Andreas...] do not. This was reported the day before by the Memmingen city clerk [Georg Maurer].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Greetings and a call to prayer. Greetings also from K[onrad] Z[wick] and Thomas Blarer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] [P.S.:] Bullinger should convey the enclosed letter with greetings to Hans Schöner from Augsburg. Blarer cannot write to him. He also cannot imagine how his matter could turn out well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] [Enclosure:] In haste. Erhard Schnepf has [just] arrived in Konstanz with his household members and other women from Tübingen because similar atrocities as in Marbach am Neckar are feared from the imperial side.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] The Emperor is said to have conquered Frankfurt.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] The day before, the chief bailiff in Balingen, [Hans Kaspar] von Anwyl, sent a servant [...] to Bischofszell to have his wife [Katharina, née von Neuneck] and child, whom he had brought to safety with his mother [...], brought back, with the reasoning that the Emperor is showing mercy, peace has been made, and all soldiers have already withdrawn. This is to be believed!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Konstanz is eager to learn more about the peace with Württemberg and is surprised that the messenger [...], whom the council has now sent to Hohentwiel for the third time, has still not returned. He was dispatched on January 3, and Blarer had given him a letter for [Johannes] Knoder. Some believe that the Emperor has offered Württemberg a peace that contains several clauses that Duke Ulrich of Württemberg does not want to accept. Others, however, claim that the Duke has accepted the peace and that it is more favorable [regarding the practice of faith] than that of the people of Ulm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Everyone who submits to the imperial peace (even Esslingen and Reutlingen are said to have concluded such a peace) must renounce the [Schmalkaldic League]. Consequently, Blarer does not understand how Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Elector Johann Frederick of Saxony can be abandoned so easily! How can one be so faint-hearted!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] As soon as the envoy expected at any time from Hohentwiel is back in Konstanz, Blarer will report.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] Bullinger should pray that the people of Konstanz do not allow themselves to be intimidated and agree to a godless peace. Blarer is ready to support [his congregation] and take any risk. However, a rotten peace will not be forced upon him.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It is truly so, my venerable Bullinger, dearest and best brother in Christ, this matter entirely depends on the Lord, from whom I wish that all our plans, all our efforts, and indeed we ourselves, however small we may be, may perpetually depend!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding the conditions of peace you mentioned, which we should accept, as far as I am concerned, I will take the utmost care. For I see how much treachery we must rightfully fear, even if faith is given in the most sacred appearance. As for our neighbors (you understand what I mean), I do not think they will allow themselves, as far as it is entirely possible, not to retain them steadfastly in friendship, especially you, towards whom my love will be placed before my own life (believe me).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am grateful for the judgment you have briefly expressed to me and I fully subscribe to it. Your "Institution" is greatly approved by me, and it will be even more approved when I see it disseminated in countless copies. I now return it to you, giving greater thanks for what you have sent.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It was not necessary to give anything or certainly not so much to the messenger, especially since I had already given him 1/2 florin for travel expenses.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I have not heard a word from Leto and Haller. I think it is no longer safe for them to write to anyone about their affairs. What you hope will happen, that we will soon hear better news about yours, I earnestly pray to the Lord that you do not hope in vain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We are completely ignorant of which district the envoys we recently informed you about are from. However, today a messenger from our people is being sent to Ulm to find out for sure (if possible). Ah, my brother, my soul and my heart in the Lord, make with your whole church pious and perpetual prayers to Christ for us, that He may show a worthy way to those who profess Him, by which we may be delivered from these evils, so that we do not unhappily accumulate evils upon evils! I see the faint hearts of many in bearing the cross and facing the dangers for the cause of religion, many also completely overcome by fear, although in the meantime some hope holds the mind that the better part will prevail over the weaker. We indeed have many excellently and solidly pious people, for whom nothing is more ancient than the glory of Christ and the salvation of the fatherland. We hope that their opinion will prevail in these doubtful and most dangerous matters. Hope with us, and do not let us fall from this hope, but pray fervently to the heavenly Father through His Son Jesus Christ, our Savior, perpetually.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The imperial riders, who recently went down to Augsburg and came back, led by the one from Kaltental, have captured Pancratz Möttlin along the way and taken him over the bridge near our city down to Ulm. The one from Kalthenthal and the other Spanish lords of the riders have brought in a wagon with goods from Augsburg (among which Bimmel had four bales of fustian) and arrested it here. He must release it in Ulm. The Spanish lords also rode two of Möttlin's horses, dined here at noon, and then went down to Ulm.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>It is also written here by a good friend from Ulm that the Emperor intends to station his Spanish troops in the upper towns, which are said to be up to 7000, to winter them. The riders say they were hindered by Pancratz Möttlin; otherwise, they would have captured Captain Schertlin.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The Bishop of Augsburg has ordered our Carthusians in Buxheim, as their bishop and ordinary, to immediately resume their old religion with mass reading, singing, and ceremonies according to their order, to wear their habit, and to refrain from the forbidden teachings in Memmingen. Two of them want to do this, the other two not at all and would rather go into misery. All this was reported to me yesterday by the chief scribe of Memmingen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>You, my Bullinger, fare well in Christ with your whole household and your ministers in Christ, whom you will lovingly greet individually with my words, and you will diligently exhort them to commend our church to the Lord. All of ours send you greetings, especially C[onradus] Z[viccius] and my brother. January 7, 1547. A. Bl.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Deliver the enclosed letter to Hans Schöner from Augsburg and tell him much love and good from me. I truly have no time to write. I cannot imagine how the matter of the good man will turn out.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>In utmost haste. Schnepffius has come here with all his household and several more Tübingen women out of fear of the cruel actions that the enemy has practiced in the small town of Marbach in Württemberg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The Emperor is said to have now also conquered Frankfurt.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Yesterday, the chief bailiff in Balingen (one of Anwyl) sent his servant up to Bischofszell to help escort his wife and child, whom he had then brought up to the mother for safety, back down, with the assertion that we have a gracious Emperor and peace. All the troops have also withdrawn from the land. We must now believe this! For here is a vanity to be concerned about with this man and his servant.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>We are also extremely curious about the conditions (the peace terms) and my lords are surprised how it comes that their last messenger, whom they have now sent to Hohentwiel for the third time, has not yet returned, who was dispatched on Monday evening, by whom I also wrote again to Doctor Knoder. Some say the Emperor has promised peace to the land at their urgent request with several conditions that the Duke does not want to accept. Some say the Duke has accepted it; it is, however, somewhat more favorable than the dealings of those from Ulm.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>In summary, since everyone must renounce the alliance that the Emperor accepts (as Esslingen and Reutlingen have already done), I cannot understand how one can so easily abandon the Landgrave and Saxony. Oh God, how miserable and faint-hearted it is among these people!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>We are waiting every moment for the envoy to return from Hohentwiel. Then I will write to you further with the first messenger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>Praying earnestly, earnestly with firm faith for us, that my lords may not allow themselves to be persuaded by threats or smooth words to a reconciliation that cannot be with God. I will gladly help to withstand all danger for the sake of truth and justice. But I do not know how to bear peace and rest with injustice, do to me as you will. Given January 7, 1547. Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
