    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich received Bullinger's letters from August 3 and 7 [not preserved] intact, along with the writing [of the Zurichers] concerning the rejection of the Council of Trent. The people of Augsburg greatly appreciate the affection shown to them by Bullinger and the other Helvetians. [Ambrosius] Blarer gave Frölich hope for their unity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The small town of Rain, which the Emperor [Charles V] had protected by 500 Bavarian soldiers and 200 horsemen, was taken through surrender and without bloodshed. Now the army is moving to Ingolstadt. It is still uncertain whether the [Schmalkaldic League] will besiege this strong Bavarian fortress.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The Emperor, who had hidden with his troops in Landshut for some time, is back in Regensburg. He commands 12,000 sodomites and child molesters. [Maximilian of Egmont] Count [of Buren], Governor of Friesland, will join him with his large army. Hopefully, he will be either stopped or fought at the Rhine! The messenger is in a hurry, so just this for now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Abbot of St. Gallen [Diethelm Blarer von Wartensee] has been giving money to the Emperor for some time for the campaign against the Protestants. Frölich, who learned this by letter, does not know to whom and when the Abbot gave the money, nor does he know the amount. Should he find out, he will inform.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The young but mentally mature [Johannes] Haller is entirely devoted to the people of Augsburg. May the Lord preserve him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings to the mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater], to the parish colleagues, to all scholars, and especially to [Rudolf] Gwalther, whose "Mare of Einsiedeln" Frölich wants to publish.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- P.S.: The [Schmalkaldic] army is very well equipped and very large. It challenges the enemy. However, the latter seeks to delay the battle.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your exceedingly welcome letters, most honorable brother, dated the 3rd and 7th of this month, along with the rejection of the Council of Trent by the malicious ones, in their entirety. I give you immortal thanks for your care and fervent devotion towards us. Your and the other Helvetians' favorable disposition towards us greatly aids all of Augsburg. May the Lord also keep you prosperous and united, as our Blaurer has given me good hope of your unanimity.</p>

      <p>Our forces have occupied the town of Rain without bloodshed. For although it was guarded by the Emperor's garrison, namely 500 soldiers and 200 Bavarian horsemen, it surrendered to us voluntarily. Now our army is advancing towards Ingolstadt, which is fortified with a strong garrison of the Emperor. Whether our forces will besiege this city, which is the most fortified in all of Bavaria, is still unknown.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Emperor, who had hidden with his troops in Landshut for a while, is now returning to Regensburg. He has 12,000 sodomites and child molesters, in whom he places all his strength. A certain count, the governor of Friesland, is hastening to join the Emperor with a large army. However, I hope our forces, who are waiting for him at the Rhine, will either delay him or engage him in battle. May the Lord grant us not according to our merit, but for His glory! I could not write more due to the messenger's haste.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Abbot of St. Gallen has long been contributing money against us, and even this year he has given to the Emperor. This has been written to me for certain, but to whom, how much, or when he gave it, I have not yet been able to ascertain. If it can be done, I will find out and inform you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Haller is entirely ours, a man young in age but mature in mind. May the Lord preserve him for this common Christian republic!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell. Greet the mayors, the parish colleagues, and all the scholars, especially Gwalther, whose "Mare of Einsiedeln," or rather the monks' disgrace, I will publish. August 17, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Yours sincerely, Georgius Laetus, etc.</p>
      <p>We have a very well-equipped and very large army. We challenge the enemy to battle, but he seeks delay.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, former (Antistes) of the Church of Zurich, my dear lord and brother, to be delivered.</p>
