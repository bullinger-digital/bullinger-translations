    <p xml:id="regest1">Returns letters and Philipp [Melanchthon's] writing [„Responsio Philippi Melanthonis ad scriptum quorundam delectorum a clero secundario Coloniae Agrippinae“] with thanks. Bucer recently described the events in Bonn in a letter [No. 1763]; may his mission be successful! Nothing can hinder this more than the wars with which France and Germany despise the divine word and shed innocent blood; it is time for repentance. Sends further parts of the John [Commentary] and requests open criticism as well as frequent reporting. The Confederates have promised [King Francis I.] [on the day in Baden] 10,000 soldiers, which was received with dismay in Zurich; the Great Council sent a letter warning against the recruitment of Zurich citizens; there is unity in the city in rejecting the war. Again requests news. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings, my dearest and most esteemed Ambrosius.</p>
      <p>I am returning all the letters entrusted to me along with Philipp's pious and learned response, and I extend my greatest thanks. Recently, Mr. Bucer wrote from Bonn and diligently described the entire matter as it currently stands. We must earnestly pray to the Lord that the efforts of good men may succeed.</p>
      <p>But unfortunate wars, which now involve France and Germany, and other nations as well, do not allow anything to succeed. The times of vengeance are upon us, I fear; both Germany and France will pay for their contempt of the word of God, and the innocent blood that has been shed like water for many years will be atoned for with fire and sword, and we have fallen into those most calamitous times. Everything is certainly in utter confusion and cannot be resolved by any human counsel. What then will happen?</p>
      <p>We will cry out: "We have sinned, Lord, we have sinned, both we and our fathers" etc.; Daniel 9 [3-19]. "Lord, do not rebuke us in your anger" etc. We will urge everyone to repentance and faith; who knows, perhaps the rigid but just decree of God against us may be moved? I am certain that the pious and God-fearing will never be abandoned in such tumultuous times. Let us therefore pray and be vigilant.</p>
      <p>I am also sending other parts that have been printed on John, and I ask, as I have repeatedly done before, that you freely express your opinion and advise if anything seems less carefully placed. I eagerly always expect and read your letters. You do a most welcome thing when you write frequently and share what the best and most trustworthy people communicate about common matters and what they call new matters.</p>
      <p>Our distress and great concern and labor begin anew, God have mercy. Our Confederates have once again promised the Frenchman, our Egyptian, 10,000 soldiers; they will set out within 12 days, and another 12,000 are preparing. Our lords are very troubled; for all their effort, labor, warnings, and admonitions are in vain with these people. Yet they have been told that they will not take away their own. For they stubbornly want to stick to their statutes, waging war among their own etc. We are concerned that some of ours will also run away; yet there is good care with cost, unrest, and labor. Today, 200 were held and unanimously wrote to the Confederates in Baden, where a day is set, not to recruit ours, and thank God, there is such unity among the citizens and all the authorities, that the king's money and war must go, stay at home, and offend no one, that not one among the 200 was found who advised or wanted otherwise. Praying to God that he may help us faithfully. The shameful devil overwhelms everything with whole heaps of crowns etc.</p>
      <p>I ask you once again, that you will be faithful to us and act as a good friend, if you hear anything, as I have written and asked you before.</p>
      <p>Mr. Röist, Mr. Lavater, the brothers of the symmistae, etc., greet you. Greet yours and mine.</p>
      <p>August 11, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, my dearest.</p>
