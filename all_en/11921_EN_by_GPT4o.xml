    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's commendable writing ["Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio"] and hopes that its gentle manner will be emulated by those whose impudent manner harms the truth more than it benefits. Thanks Bullinger for his generosity, may God reward him manifold; wonders why Bullinger did not mention Blarer's German letter [No. 1867] in the letter with which he sent Cochläus' refutation [No. 1869], causing Blarer to doubt the reliability of the Ulm messenger. There is nothing to report from the Diet [at Speyer] except what is mentioned below; Konstanz sent a messenger on March 6, and upon his return, Blarer will report immediately. Greetings. [Enclosure:] The merchants have returned from Frankfurt and partly from Speyer and reported some things, but of an imprecise nature. The Fugger in Augsburg was informed that the Turks are besieging the castle Plintenburg [in Hungary], which only has provisions for 14 more days. In Augsburg, it was also learned from Constantinople that the Turks are not in armor and do not plan a campaign this year. Count Christoph of Württemberg has traveled with his bride [Anna Maria of Brandenburg-Ansbach] to Mömpelgard, where he will reside. The imperial cities have approved the Turkish aid at Speyer with the condition that the Emperor [Charles V] promises peace and the reformation of the Chamber Court.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received with open arms and a welcoming face your commendable, truly learned, and pious response, where you have, in my judgment, sufficiently restrained your teeth and claws. I have no doubt that all who are devoted to sincere doctrine will read this with great benefit. There is nothing in it that offends me in the slightest; rather, everything is such that I give thanks to the Lord with all my heart, who increasingly reveals the power of His spirit in you, His most chosen instrument. May He complete what He has begun in you until the day of Christ.</p>
      <p>Would that those who today, with such insolence, buffoonery, and petulance, rather defile and make the truth more odious than defend it, would imitate your example! But these people intend to imitate no one, but rather to lead and be the archetypes of all. I give you the greatest thanks for that excellent little book. You often put me to shame with your constant generosity, so that I almost envy you this happiness, which always gives and never receives.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Himself bless you most kindly from the fullness of His horn of gifts and return the greatest thanks on my behalf.</p>
      <p>But hey, my venerable Bullinger, why not a single word about the German letters, which I recently sent to you through that very messenger from Ulm, who brought yours with the little book to me? Your overwhelming business makes me more at ease; otherwise, I would be very concerned about the messenger's reliability.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Diet, apart from what you receive here, we have not heard a single word. Our people sent a messenger on March 6; when he returns with letters, we will ensure that you receive what he brings as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my soul in the Lord, to whom I diligently and perpetually commend myself and mine. Commend us to all your brothers and ministers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially my brother and Zwick with his fellow ministers and my wife, who, together with me, sends loving greetings to your wife and the whole household. March 18, 1544.</p>
      <p>Our merchants have returned from Frankfurt, having been partly in Speyer, and report various news; however, since we have no thorough writings or information, I will not trouble you with it; you will have heard various things from your own people about it.</p>
      <p>This was written to the Fugger in Augsburg by post, that the Turks, ten thousand strong, are besieging the castle Plintenburg and have almost starved it out, as they have no more than 14 days of provisions left.</p>
      <p>Also, letters from Constantinople dated February 7 have reached Augsburg, stating that the Turks are not in armor and will not undertake a major campaign on land this year.</p>
      <p>The young Duke Christoph of Württemberg has already returned with his new bride from the land of Württemberg to Mömpelgard; there he must constantly hold court.</p>
      <p>Regarding the imperial cities, it is said from Speyer that they have approved aid against the Turks, but with the condition that the Emperor promises and swears to maintain peace for his lifetime and also to reform the Chamber Court without delay. But I have nothing certain about this, except what some merchants who were in Speyer report.</p>
