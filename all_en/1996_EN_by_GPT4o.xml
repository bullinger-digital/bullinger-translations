      <p>Most illustrious man. Now, as I was sealing the letters for Mr. Nikolaus Morae (whom I again commend to you from the heart), those letters were delivered to me, which you wrote that you had written to me the day before. I will respond to them in person, regarding Brentius and the duke. Consider it kindly if I have delayed so long; I did not do so without reason. About the booklet and the crown - indeed it may have been lost - there is no need for you to be distressed; just write to Gratarolus, indicating the time when that messenger received the booklet and the crown from you. I ask my Josiah to send the writings from my belongings, among which there is another copy of the same booklet, and to send the small vessel, if any has reached him from Basel. Farewell and be well with the whole family, school, and church. Pray for me.</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, September 3, 1553.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Zürich church, brother and honorable lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
