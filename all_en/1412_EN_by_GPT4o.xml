      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have taken great care to send letters to Blorer, although I could hardly find a trustworthy person, and fishermen cannot be trusted due to the drunkenness they perpetually suffer from.</p>
      <p>However, I wrote to Blaurer about this matter, who might perhaps speak with some fisherman, so that he willingly accepts, if anything is sent either by you or by others. Two preachers from Augsburg are staying with us. It was written to them that the Nurembergers gave 150 thalers to three of the brothers from Augsburg for travel expenses; a generosity not to be despised, and this indicates that Christian hearts still thrive among them, who are willing to show some kindness to the brothers who remain steadfast in asserting the gospel of Christ. The Emperor rages with his followers; schools have been abolished in Augsburg, teachers expelled, and they are forbidden to teach the doctrine of the gospel to anyone henceforth; I shudder to say it. Many are proscribed daily.</p>
      <p>These are the fruits of the Council of Trent. What do you think our Swiss will do in these assemblies? I fear our faint-heartedness, as we do not dare to oppose or contradict their frivolous counsels, even though we have the truth. The consuls, senators, and common people must be admonished not to be easily frightened by the threats of the Emperor's men. They have devised a most deceitful practice; but if we remain steadfast, they will achieve nothing, and the Lord will scatter their plans. They will impose the prescriptions of the council on us; what do you think they are? May the Lord have mercy on us and grant us true knowledge of Himself in our hearts, so that we do not waver like some. All the preachers from Augsburg have responded to the adversaries undauntedly, they are so uplifted; some schoolmasters have returned to their old ways.</p>
      <p>Our Sixtus has conceded to the papists, but recanted the next day; what they will do with him, we still do not know. Times of tribulation and temptation are at hand. Arise, therefore, Lord, and let our enemies be scattered, so that they may see that you alone are God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. Amen. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 22nd of September, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>I thank you for the booklet sent, and there is no need for you to be anxious about the booklets sent; I will account well if I send others, namely Polyaenus, with the rest. If you can conveniently, send the homily of Zeno the martyr on the epistle to the Corinthians; otherwise, do not buy it.</p>
      <p>I am expecting letters from the people of Strasbourg about Saxon affairs from Lord Marbach.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich. Zurich.</p>
