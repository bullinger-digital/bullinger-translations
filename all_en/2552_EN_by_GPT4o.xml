      <p>My entire willing service and friendly greetings with the offering of all honor, love, and goods beforehand; honorable, well-learned sir, especially gracious, dear, trusted, good friend, because I have not heard from you for a long time, I could not refrain from writing to you through this messenger about the news present here.</p>
      <p>Firstly, it has been written from the emperor's court by someone who should know well about it, that the emperor intends to sail to Spain in the coming spring and spend all his remaining life there, as God may grant him, and to hand over all matters to his son, the King of England (who is on his way to him in the Netherlands). If this is arranged and he turns his back on Germany, there is a fear of great unrest, discord, and war among princes, lords, and cities. Furthermore, there is also a rumor, which I do not hold much to, that the Bishop of Arras and the Constable of France, along with other princes, are supposed to come together in Calais and negotiate a peace with conditions that I consider intolerable for the King of France, namely that he should return Piedmont to the Duke, which has cost him great effort and many people to maintain until now.</p>
      <p>The king has a large army against the mountain, to which the Pope and Venice are also supposed to hold their part; it is expected that he will soon besiege Siena.</p>
      <p>The Queen of England is said to have been pregnant for several months already. Lastly, those in the Saanen region have not yet submitted, practicing much back and forth, and there are people who lend them an ear, which is unreasonable. However, I think everything will come to light. A messenger has been sent to them for an answer; he has not yet returned. As soon as he comes, I think the matter will soon find a resolution.</p>
      <p>A messenger from Schwyz, namely bailiff Dietrich an der Halden, and one from Solothurn are in Valais; I think they are negotiating about the Augst border. They are very stubborn, riding through here silently.</p>
      <p>It is a great concern to me, the great unfriendliness and disunity that I sense in general in all the Confederation and especially in certain places. I fear it will lead to a disruption and separation of a praiseworthy alliance of a Confederation. For the contempt and disregard is so great in every place, that everyone is so self-reliant, thinking they can and may well manage for themselves. Therefore, it will be necessary for us to pray to God the Lord without ceasing for His divine grace and blessing, that He may keep us in peace and unity and that your preachers and leaders may admonish the people faithfully to this end, as I have no doubt you will faithfully do.</p>
      <p>Gracious sir, these days a ghost has arisen in my brother-in-law Albrecht von Erlach's house; it comes after midnight, pulls the covers off the boys, has pulled them over the bed one night up to the head; another night it has dragged a large walnut bedstead with bed and canopy in front of the door into the corner; another night it has placed plates from another room into the boys' bed and pushed them under the armpits, thrown an old thick wooden brick at them in many pieces, whistles and dances and has a wild life, with a request, please write to me your opinion on this matter in the next message.</p>
      <p>My wife sends you and your honorable wife very friendly greetings and many good wishes. Please convey many good wishes and friendly greetings to Mr. Walther and your son-in-law and Master Hans Friessen. I think Mr. Haller, our preacher, has informed you of his affairs, how it has gone with him; I am truly sorry for the good honorable man. Herewith I commend you faithfully to God the Lord. Dated from Bern on the 13th of February in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your entirely trusted friend and willing servant Niclaus von Diesbach.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, distinguished, and wise, also well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my especially gracious, dear sir and good friend.</p>
