Complains that he can no longer catch poultry. Was with the mayor of Bremgarten. New contracts are to be concluded with the farmers of Arni.</p>

      <p>Greetings from Christ. Know, dear brother, that I could not come on Tuesday, because the bailiff was still gathering evidence, which has told me much more than I have done there. So it seems to me that it is not in my favor, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, God has delivered me from my need on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Also, my request is, if you cannot preach for me - as it would be my greatest request and for the farmers, since it will be a great church consecration -, that you would write to me, as you have done before, for the church consecration «the reason for our faith from the ancient fathers to us», as I will do myself. Know that I can no longer catch chickens, geese, or birds; I am entirely in misfortune.</p>
      <p>I was also with the mayor again on Wednesday; if they send the farmers from Arni and deliver other letters, it will be in our favor, as some properties have been sold from it.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell. Greet the family.</p>
      <p>To Heini Meister.</p>
