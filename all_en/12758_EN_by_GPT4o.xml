    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haab received Bullinger's letter [not received] with the attached document [about the stay of Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, in Lucerne] the day before and communicated its contents without mentioning Bullinger to the messengers from Bern [Peter Im Haag and Hans Pastor] and Basel [Bernhard Meyer zum Pfeil] [present at the Diet in Baden]. However, no one could believe that Granvelle had been in Lucerne. Instead, it is said that he urged the King [Francis I] in France to marry his daughter [Margaret of France] to the Emperor [Charles V]. What the devil can accomplish among the princes! The King then rode straight to Paris, where he summoned his privy councilors in writing. This was told by merchants, who also reported that at Granvelle's instigation, the intended payment from Francis I [via Piero Strozzi] to the [Schmalkaldic League] was initially suspended, but not yet canceled. There is no more news. Whether what has been communicated is true remains to be seen.</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings, etc., venerable, highly learned, especially gracious, dear sir. Yesterday I received your friendly letter along with the attached document, and communicated its contents to the trusted messengers from Bern and Basel, without mentioning your name. Upon hearing this, none of us could believe or imagine that Granvelle had been in Lucerne at this time. It is said with certainty that the aforementioned Granvelle is in France, urging the king to marry the king's daughter to the emperor. Thus much can Satan accomplish among the princes! For the aforementioned Granvelle is dealing so earnestly with the king that the king is riding straight to Paris, where he has summoned all his privy councilors in writing. We have heard this from merchants, who further reported that the money, which was to be paid by the king to the Protestants, has been temporarily suspended at Granvelle's instigation, but not yet canceled. This is all the news we have at the moment. Whether this is true or not, time will tell.</p>

      <p>With this, I commend you to the Lord and, if it pleases you, you may share this with Mayor Lavater, etc. In haste from Baden, December 8, 1546. Your always good friend and supporter, Johann Haab, Mayor of Zurich. To the venerable, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Grossm√ºnster in the city of Zurich, my dear sir and good friend, etc.</p>
