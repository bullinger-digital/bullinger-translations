    <p xml:id="regest1">Is pleased about Bullinger's letter, as he thinks of him despite numerous other engagements; is aware of his mistakes and wants to improve in the future. Rudolf [Gwalther] has traveled with Johannes Draconites [to the Imperial Diet] to Regensburg, so he could not attend the mass [in Frankfurt]; the letter to him will therefore be forwarded. Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] set out on March 15 with two hundred armed horsemen to Regensburg; reference to Philipp's enmity with [Duke] Heinrich of Brunswick. Noviomagus [Geldenhauer] is seriously ill. Wick hopes for Bullinger's continued goodwill. Sends the Landgrave's response to Heinrich of Brunswick. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To the venerable man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Johann Jakob Wick wishes well-being.</p>
      <p>Having received your letter at this fair (Bullinger, my esteemed father), I can hardly express how much it delighted my spirit, and for two main reasons it pleased me greatly: partly because I knew your mind was benevolent towards me and not at all agitated, and partly because, despite being occupied with greater matters, you did not disdain to send us a letter. Therefore, I have deemed it better to acknowledge my fault than to bring forth cold and bald excuses; henceforth, to avoid repeating the committed fault, I will be diligent. I rejoice and see your benevolent mind towards me; for this reason, I have always strived and now more and more endeavor to appear to you as the most obedient son in all things. If, therefore, any fault has been committed so far, if any wrong has been done, I faithfully promise to amend it with diligent zeal, so that I may return to my homeland both wiser and better, as you have greatly deserved from me and mine. Wherever I can, in the course of time, satisfy the benefits you have bestowed upon me, I will not delay; for I pray to the most good and great God for nothing else than that I may fulfill my calling, also that I may be able to contribute to the divine glory and the republic, and also be of great use to my parents and relatives.</p>
      <p>Our Rudolf has set out with Dr. Johannes Draconites to Regensburg and did not attend the fair. We will ensure that he receives the letter shortly, within eight days.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave departed from Marburg on March 15 and set out for Regensburg with two hundred armed horsemen. I pray to the most good and great God that this journey may be fortunate and successful for the evangelical doctrine. Surely, you have long perceived what enmities are restrained between the Landgrave and Duke Heinrich of Brunswick; they are more known to you, I suppose, than for me to mention here.</p>
      <p>Dr. Noviomagus, a pious and learned theologian, has been seized by such adverse health that, if we return home, we do not know whether we will find him alive or dead.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more to write at present; therefore, I wish and earnestly ask again and again that, as you have shown yourself towards me thus far, you will continue to do so in the future. You will see and feel the most obedient son; wherever I can repay you or your descendants in kind, I will not hesitate.</p>
      <p>Farewell and keep me in your commendation.</p>
      <p>Given in Frankfurt, April 9.</p>
      <p>Johann Jakob Wick, your most obedient son. I send you here the Apology of the Landgrave against Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, not unworthy of reading.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife, mother, and the whole family most diligently.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most venerable father.</p>
