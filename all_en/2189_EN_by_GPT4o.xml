      <p>S. P. Even if the bearer of this letter is in a hurry, you will have this letter written by me in such haste, so that you know my son has arrived with God's help. If you want any news, you will understand from the letters I write to your lords and from the enclosed memorandum, from which you will also learn about the events that occurred in England at the beginning of this month. I wish to know how you are doing. Farewell. From Solothurn, February 16th.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bass. To the excellent man and friend, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
