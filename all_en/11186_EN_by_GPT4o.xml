    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the expression of friendship in his letter and in the dedication of his valuable book on the authority of the Holy Scripture. He is shocked by the rumor that a document is being prepared in Zurich, which allegedly proves the victory of the people of Zurich over the people of Bern at the Zurich meeting; in Bern, no one speaks like this, as it is gratefully acknowledged that God has preserved both the Lutheran and the Zwinglian churches in His truth; he does not want to believe the rumor but asks for clarification. Greetings.</p>

      <p> Greetings. Never have I received anything more delightful than your recent letter, most learned Bullinger, and nothing could indeed have been more pleasing than to announce that I have found a new friend, and such a one, I say, whose friendship I value more highly than the envy and attacks of many enemies. You send a booklet to your Peter Kunz (Conzenus) "as a token of perpetual friendship," which I again interpret as a very favorable omen. It is truly a title worthy of much honor, as it speaks of the authority of the Holy Scripture; for it elevates the authority of the Scripture and illustrates it with such august beauty that I do not doubt it will provoke and excite the minds of all the pious to sacred reading, so that I am convinced that such your vigils are gathered into the treasury of the Lord with great profit. The brothers of the Allobroges diligently acquire all your works, whatever they know has been published by your grace. Therefore, I accept your gift, Bullinger, kissing it as a notable monument of your most friendly heart, not doubting at all, given the candor of your genius, that you will be a perpetual friend, nor, I know, will you depart from our friendship, because you are so much more learned than I and more fortunate in the experience of almost all things in many ways. </p>
      <p> The rest is that I now complain to you somewhat sadly. A certain common man came, departing from Zurich, having his domicile otherwise in Bern, who spread such words: "Hey," he said, "Bernese, who think your opinion prevailed at the Zurich meeting, know that the Zurichers, on the contrary, boast of a triumph over you. Ah, wait a little while, Bernese; for soon a booklet will be published in Zurich, which, when read carefully, will easily show who indeed led the others in triumph in that matter." Therefore, upon hearing this voice, my spirit could be quite vehemently disturbed, dearest Bullinger, scarcely knowing enough whether there was safe faith all around among the brothers. As for us, I would dare to swear most sacredly, even at the altars, that no mention of victory was ever made by us (for we heard no one contending about victory there), but rather we exhorted the brothers to the most humble thanksgiving before the Lord, that they might rejoice happily in the Lord, who had so mercifully preserved their churches thus far, that they all remained on the target of holy and immaculate truth, and that neither the Lutheran nor the Zwinglian, as they are called, would be allowed to be shamed by such gross error anywhere; for it is not right for a Christian heart to wish either Luther or any other brother to be found in error. Are we not members of Christ with one another? Among us, none of these things are heard, Bullinger; for such mice of this kind would not have a place among the Bernese. Furthermore, although I do not doubt that this rumor is the most vain, dearest Bullinger, yet at first glance I could be somewhat distressed by this sorrow; for I see that hostile and perpetual enemy, the devil, threatening us, against whom we must always stand ready and never fall asleep in security in the meantime. Write, I pray, my Bullinger, how the matter stands, so that you may relieve me of these worries. </p>
      <p> Farewell well and happily. Greet Pellicanus and all the others diligently. Doctor Sebastian, our venerable old man, who is indeed not a little devoted to you, greets you. </p>
      <p> Bern, July 8, 1538, now at the approach of the highest twilight. Your Peter Kunz (Conzenus) in the Lord. </p>
      <p> I greet you, most excellent and learned man. Simon Sulzer. </p>
      <p> To the distinguished man in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant ecclesiast of the Zurichers, his dearest brother in the Lord. Zurich. </p>
