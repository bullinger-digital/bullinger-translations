      <p>On the Confession of the Waldensians. Greetings. Although you have sent me many letters, as you write, Lismanini, dearest brother in the Lord, I have received only one besides the last one, which you sent through your Stanislaus, during all the time you have been in Poland. But we must bear this injustice of our times, where letters are either opened or not delivered at all. When your Stanislaus passed through here, I was not at home, indeed not even in the city, but in the countryside. Therefore, I have not yet received anything from him about the state of the churches in the Kingdom of Poland.</p>
      <p>I am writing this before he returns to us from Geneva, so that he may not be compelled to delay here when he returns; for I think that as soon as he begins to retrace his journey, he will hasten to you. I have reread the Apology of the Waldensians, which you sent; it was not long ago that I read it, when it was published in Augsburg in 1533, first in Zürich, then in Wittenberg, at which time I marveled at how the same booklet could be so approved by these two churches, which differed so much in their opinion on the Lord's Supper, that they thought it should be multiplied and spread by printing. But, when I reread it, I perceive what statements in it moved the brothers of Zürich and what moved Luther of blessed memory to approve or at least could have moved them to approve it. [fol. 72] I think the Zürichers were moved by the fact that they say the whole matter of the Lord's Supper is a matter of spirits and human minds and that the Spirit of God thus transfers His spiritual gifts into our spirits, [fol. 89] then that they call those false prophets who teach that Christ is here or there on earth, also that they describe a threefold presence of Christ in the church: first in the hearts of the faithful through the efficacy of His knowledge and operation acting in them, second in the ministers, so that they may work effectively through His Spirit, third in the administration of both the word and the sacraments, making it so that the faithful receive them usefully through faith. [fol. 90] Furthermore, they explicitly feel and write that Christ is in the sacrament neither personally nor corporally, but only sacramentally and spiritually, indeed that He does not wish to be with us corporally. [fol. 92] To this, they add that He is offered to our bodies through the sacrament no differently than through the word of the gospel. Also, that we need the presence of Christ's humanity in heaven, and that this sacrament is worthy only because He deigned to institute it. These and other similar things in this confession were approved, I think, by the Zürichers, because they seemed to be entirely free from any gross and carnal sense, unworthy of the mysteries of Christ, which that church and ours still rightly reject. Luther, however, thinking that these things could be corrected by the Waldensians in time, [fol. 30.] seemed to approve in this confession that they say Christ deigned to establish bread and wine as His body and blood. [fol. 64] And wherever in a Christian congregation bread and wine are instituted according to Christ's intention and this title is invoked to God under the name of Jesus Christ, then the words of Christ are spoken or remembered by Christ, that immediately according to the institution and intention of Christ, the bread and wine are most present as the body and blood of Christ. [fol. 81] Then, that they say the bread in the supper is the new body of Christ, also (86) that they reject the exposition of Karlstadt and the Zürichers and condemn those who say the body of Christ is in the bread no differently (87) than in a sign and call them symbolists, sign-bearers, and breadists and gather the presence of the body of Christ from those words. These seemed to Luther as if they were substantial in this cause to be rightly felt and done by them, and therefore he gave them to be printed. The Zürichers, however, interpreted these according to those things which are annexed as if in the place of an exposition, of which we made mention above. Now what the opinion of this our church is on these matters cannot be unknown to you.</p>
      <p>Others should know that it is no different from the opinion of the Zürich, Geneva, and Savoyard churches, to whose judgment in this whole cause we willingly subscribe. For what does it matter to repeatedly bring forth the same judgment of the Lord's Supper from those who are unanimous in doctrine and opinion with the other articles of our faith? But if anyone separately asks me what I think of this confession of the Waldensian brothers, I will explain it briefly and candidly. What they deliver concerning the articles of Christian doctrine is so arranged that while reading, I did not see anything in them that disagrees with the word of God. Only concerning justification, in my judgment, they do not sufficiently approach apostolic doctrine, while they establish only a substantial one, which is first in God outside of man, then in man through regeneration, and meanwhile, they do not touch upon the imputation of righteousness, which is acquired solely by faith in Christ.</p>
      <p>What is lacking here, however, can easily be repaired, especially since they offer themselves at the end of the book ready for correction, if they are admonished by the word of the Lord. Thus, where they speak of the sacrament, I would like some things to be more circumspectly stated, such as when they say the sacraments confer salvation and when they state certain things about the Lord's Supper in such a way that it would have been better to have been said more purely, so as not to seem to support the carnal sense of carnal men, which they themselves do not wish to seem to approve, especially their elders, who in the confession sent to King Vladislaus in Hungary fight with many and clear words against the corporal presence of Christ in the bread, which today some brothers urge most importunately, so that they even bring forth that saying of Augustine: Until the end of the world, the Lord is above, etc. Nor was it advisable to call those who themselves reject this gross sense symbolists, sign-bearers, and breadists. Secondly, what they state about the administration of the word and sacraments, I think, has nothing inconvenient.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, the ecclesiastical discipline they have is such that it would be desirable for all the churches of Christ to have it in common with them, which can be done with the edification of souls. But their condition of the churches is different and more suitable for such discipline than that of those which consist of entire regions, cities, and villages, and have magistrates and Christian republics.
