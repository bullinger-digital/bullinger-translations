      <p>Alas, my father, what did our Linerus announce to me the day before yesterday! May the Lord grant that I may soon hear more joyful news, as not only I alone nor my colleagues alone, but this entire church earnestly implores from the most good and great God. But if the time has come when you are to be taken from us, there is indeed no reason for me to strengthen and console you, from whom we are rather accustomed to be strengthened; but there is a great reason why we should rightly seek the Spirit of God to be doubled for us in these so miserable and calamitous times, as if deprived of a helmsman. And how I fear that your departure will be followed by those things that will compel us to consider those thrice happy who have been timely taken away. This consoles me, that the Lord our God, as I hope, will not allow the minds of brothers or churches to ever be separated from that fraternal union. Indeed, with God's favor, I would rather lose my life. I would not want you to be concerned at this time about the insults of that impure one, but apart from prayers, with which these monsters are especially to be fought by us, I now indeed leave this whole care to the brothers. I had written about the Torgau assembly, whose document if I had, I would think about a response, in which I would conduct our cause in such a way that the prince could not rightly be offended, nor would I publish the document without your consent and advice. But I ask and beseech you to now omit these things and, since it seems so to the Lord to deal with you and with us, to take care of more necessary things. Moreover, here with us is a doctor of excellent piety and learning, to whom when I had indicated what d. Lavaterus in his letters, which I only received yesterday, indicated about this your illness, he immediately prepared a remedy, which he affirms to have a certain singular power against all those evils. Therefore, I send it to you with the prescribed method of use, and indeed how happy I will consider myself if it has come to you in time and the Lord has blessed it. He did not tell me himself from what it was made; but he is one whose learning and piety are not to be doubted.</p>
      <p>Know that your letters, in which you respond to those I sent to you from Basel, have been delivered to me. The king still lingers in Lyon, living in his usual manner and indeed speaking of peace, but in reality becoming more and more enraged, although he has few even among the nobles who advise war. Our people have abandoned Puzinum across the Rhône and the fortress of Gromi in Dauphiné without loss of men, driven solely by the force of the cannons. In Poitou, Montpensier has achieved nothing against us so far, except for the capture of the small town of Fontenay. The king's forces are weak and furthermore dispersed in various places. Our people hold firm positions, remaining steadfast to the end, as I hope, until he finally collapses, his strength now exhausted in every way. May the Lord our God fight for us.</p>
      <p>Your pains are mine, my father. May the Lord Jesus hear our groans and soon cheer us with more joyful news!</p>
      <p>Geneva, November 10, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>The doctor himself, if you wish, will travel there at no cost to you, to confer with yours.</p>
      <p>Danvillanus has now finally openly joined our side. Belleurius did wrong by breaking off the Swiss legation with his cunning. To the excellent servant of Christ, d. Heinrich Bullinger, my especially revered father, the truly faithful pastor of the Zurich church.</p>
