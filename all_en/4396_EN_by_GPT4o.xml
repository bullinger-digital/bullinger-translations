      <p>My willing service is always ready for your reverence.</p>
      <p>Revered lord and father, I cannot withhold from you that the envoys from the community of FÃ¼rstenau in Tumlesch, who have presented several articles against the bishop, as I have previously informed you, have appeared here again last Friday. They have quietly and secretly shared with us their response and decision, which they received from the communities. It would take long to recount the content; however, they have received a fairly good decision from seven high courts (there are 11 high courts in the Gotteshausbund). They intend to adhere to the sworn articles and not to give the bishop's advocates any seat or place in the league or assembly days. But it is to be feared that many contrary practices will come in between; for in the Engadin, the bishop's influence is strong and great, and although the majority is evangelical, the envoys have not yet been able to achieve anything with them. For the bishop has prepared the field beforehand, has been there personally, held great feasts, and, to my great sorrow, I have heard that some preachers of those places have turned to the bishop and attended his feasts; but in what pot this is cooking, it is good to sense. I cannot write much about the old lord Travers; yet it grieves me that he does not consider the churches of Christ more in his old age. God have mercy on us wretched, poor people, who remain human until the grave.</p>
      <p>If your reverence would be so kind as to take the trouble to write to him as soon as possible, even from afar, it would be a very good work; if it could happen in the most appropriate way, that you send him new news from Germany, Poland, and England, letting him know how the bishops, creatures of the pope, are so vigorously active, what the queen of England has undertaken with her people, how he should conduct himself so that in his old age he brings our Rhaetian church to more peace and does not leave the wolf behind him in the next; these or similar things.</p>
      <p>Yet I leave all this to your manifold wisdom, which I do not wish to prescribe herewith. It is certain that in our lands, regarding these matters, it is worse than 20 years ago, and if the bishop regains this authority (for from ancient times a bishop has sat in the days and councils), then they may again push through all their practices. God have mercy on his church! May he keep your reverence in his fatherly protection. Amen.</p>
      <p>I have no further news, except that our bishop has been almost released within 14 days. Given on the 19th day of the month of August in the year of our Lord 1560.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
