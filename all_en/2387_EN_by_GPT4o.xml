      <p>To the most illustrious Bullinger. This Mr. Antonius, who will deliver this letter, has been with me for a month; now he returns to Italy on account of certain business of his own. He will visit you, so that he may recognize Bullinger by face, whom he has known for a long time. I commend him to you, if you can assist him in any way. He is a pious and prudent man.</p>
      <p>In other letters, which another person who is with him will deliver to you separately, I write more extensively and indeed about many things. Farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, September 6, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother. Zürich.</p>
