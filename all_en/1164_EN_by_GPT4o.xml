      <p>Greetings. On the 9th day before the calends of February, we buried our only and most beloved little daughter, about whom I recently wrote, whom Christ has taken to heaven (for I have no doubt). The mother and I, although we have not yet buried the flesh, which is affected in its own way, nevertheless, we kiss the will of the Lord and the best Father with reverence, giving thanks to Him through Christ Jesus, that she so happily persevered in the confession of His name until she breathed her last breath, emerging from all these most tempestuous dangers of the sea and bravely reached the harbor of eternal tranquility, where she will no longer be subject to any evils. Would that we might also die the same death and have the same end as she did!</p>
      <p>I am very grateful for your brief, yet pious and solid exhortation. I pray with all my heart to Christ, the most faithful, for that health for you, which will suffice for many more years for your endeavors worthy of you, that is, a most Christian and learned man.</p>
      <p>I have no certain news, but I am waiting at all times. However, I am sending you a letter; a good, dear friend from Lindau sent it to me, who has much experience from all sides and various acquaintances. The news does not completely match the previous ones, but it does not seem unlikely; it is said to be certain and true with Duke Eric.</p>
      <p>Regarding the emperor's fall, I have heard nothing from anyone except now in the letters, which I am sending back to you herewith; if it is true, then one can indeed notice something if one opens their eyes.</p>
      <p>I am also sending you another letter from Herr Erhart Lubhart, a canon in Bischofszell, who is a very pious, Christian man and especially dear to me. He writes to me about his parish in Sulga, which Herr Wolf, the preacher in Bischofszell, also recently discussed with you. I ask you for God's and our love's sake, please read this letter and write me a response on a separate note, just so that the pious man sees that I have truly advocated for the matter with you; if it were also possible for the good, pious pastor to be helped, I would most highly ask you to do your best.</p>
      <p>Our Theodor recently sent me letters about these visions of my cousin's son, which I showed to Conrad Zwick, who was with me the day before yesterday, to read. When he read among other things about his son, he was at first amazed in a remarkable way, then also complained vehemently and remonstrated with me, as if I had informed Theodor, who is a young man, by letter, something he wanted no mortal to know outside of me and my brother. When I steadfastly denied it as much as I could, he also vehemently and repeatedly implored me to find out by any means possible from Theodor who had informed him that his son was an enthusiast, which I solemnly promised to do. Now, I have told no one this except you recently when I was present, to whom I have been accustomed to entrust whatever secrets there are, just as to my own heart, for many years, so it seems likely to me that Theodor was also informed of this by you. Although there is no danger here, as far as the matter itself is concerned, I would not want even the slightest risk to the trust of my brother or myself with my cousin. Therefore, I ask you greatly to also carefully remind Theodor not to spread this further, and to write to me in three words that he has completely forgotten this or something else, so that my brother is also freed from that suspicion...</p>
      <p>Oh, may the true God make true what you wish at the end of your letter! I also know that God will still let His wonders and strong hand be seen if we do a little so that He does not have to be ashamed of our faith.</p>
      <p>But truly, with this miserable, arrogant, unrepentant, shameful life of the whole world, I can make no account. What I hope, I hope against hope, and where there is nothing to hope for; I hope to soon leave the dust and escape all evil along with all the found. Amen.</p>
      <p>Praying heartily and with all faithfulness for me along with your honorable, Christian wife and dear children; tell them from me and mine all love and good. May the Lord be your eternal protection and shield, etc. January 29.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
