      <p>Greetings, esteemed father. If it had been possible through him who is going to you and, if I am not mistaken, will deliver my letters, I would have written to you more diligently.</p>
      <p>I came here from Heidelberg, to be closer to my homeland. However, I am thinking of visiting you in the early spring or autumn, with the Lord's favor, when I make my journey to France. Until that time, my dearest and most esteemed, farewell, as much as heartfelt prayers can achieve. In recent days, I traveled to Greater Poland, where I learned that the Lutherans of Poznań were somewhat displeased with our Cracovians, to the extent that they considered breaking the recently established concord. The Bohemian brothers promptly addressed this issue by advising the Cracovians to satisfy the wishes of the Lutheran brothers. The reason for this matter is unknown to me, but perhaps T[h]retius will write to you about it sometime, who is undoubtedly mourning the death of his voivode of Kraków, especially now that he sees Stanisław Barzi, a former sympathizer of ours, succeeding him in this dignity. My lord, the voivode of Władysław, Johann of Krotoszyn, brought us a three-year truce from the formidable Muscovite, who, because he wanted it to be so brief, was treated rather inhumanely by the tyrant and his colleagues, to the extent that this was a just cause for breaking the peace and attacking the tyrant, against whom our people are now remarkably hostile. But our king wishes to be one of those about whom Christ said: "Blessed are the peacemakers," and indeed, he has long preserved the vast kingdom in peace.</p>
      <p>As for those two kings who have been fighting without cause for a long time, the Dane and the Swede, it was reported here yesterday from the court of Prince August in Dresden that they have finally reconciled. What one had taken from the other, they now return: the Dane to the Swede two fortresses, which he had already built on his land, and the Swede to the Dane Norway, some captured ships, and one hundred and fifty thousand thalers. In Poland, some are now being rebaptized in rivers, which I can easily believe, since just three days ago I learned from my fellow citizen of Danzig that in the year of our Lord 1568, two ships of Anabaptists descended into our Poland against the current of the Vistula, who, being excluded from Danzig, were received by one of our castellans. I have nothing more to write, for what is commonly reported about Friesland and all of Lower Germany, Zeeland, Holland, how much damage they received from the raging Ocean at the beginning of November, I believe has also been reported to you. Here it is said that 4000 people were drowned by the waters in the dead of night, besides three towns that were completely swallowed by the waters, etc. Here too, in Upper Germany and in our Poland, there were very frequent floods in the autumn. Why is this? Because charity grows cold in us, God pours cold upon cold hearts, so that they may grow even colder. I greet brothers Simler and Wolf fraternally, with whom you may share this, if you wish. I do not know if the rumor of Brentius's death is true; if he has died, where is he, is he everywhere? I would indeed believe that he is only in that heaven, which Stephen, looking up, saw opened. Farewell for as long and as happily as possible, our Methuselah, and write to me sometime, while you are in this tabernacle, which we will soon have to lay down and seek another in heaven, which may it be granted to us according to our faith.</p>
      <p>In Wittenberg, from the house of Master Menius, December 11, 1570, with a great snow having fallen from the sky, which perhaps teaches us that we ought to be pure.</p>
      <p>If you ever write to the brothers in Geneva, I would like you to convey my greetings to them.</p>
      <p>Your most loving and respectful, Johannes a Lasco, Pole.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zurich, as to a most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
