      <p> G. P. C. et S. P. Most Reverend Lord Father, it cannot be expressed how much joy I received from your letters, as I noticed that you are stronger in undertaking your most holy duties. We must pray to the best and greatest God to strengthen your health above all. From Chiavenna, it is written that a very sad rumor is brought from Milan that the Duke of Alba has been defeated. But our interpreter, who recently filled the ears of the lord consul, asserts differently, claiming that 5000 men from Uri have been destroyed. Andelot is also said to have been slaughtered by the royal forces with a huge army; the people of Schaffhausen confirm the previous reports and additionally grant one more sign anew. He tries to confirm all these things among those whom he sees as slower to believe him in all matters. - Here, minor assemblies are now being held, and a general assembly has been called for the day of the Three Kings in Ilanz, in which the matter of the lord Cellarius and the monks, which has almost cooled down, will be discussed. This very matter has now been reported to the communities, and the greater part of the Three Leagues is inclined to avenge the audacious act of the monks by overturning their hiding places; however, the Upper League strongly resists, but will be forced to agree with the other two, as they are more powerful. Thus, in the end, the traitors to the fatherland will be afflicted with some disgrace; I fear, however, that a monetary penalty will suffice for the greedy. </p>
      <p> There is also deliberation here about the penalty to be imposed on Captain Sebastian, who the day before yesterday led out his troops, disregarding the orders of the lords and against everyone's will. Our envoy excused himself, saying it was not done at his instigation. They say he was hired by the people of Solothurn; but the same reasoning, the same duty, and the same will apply to him as to our own. However, it is certain that apart from this troop, which that leader Sebastian led out from the Upper League against the will of the lords, no one else will depart. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most illustrious man, and live happily with yours. Chur, October 6, 1568. </p>
      <p> Your most devoted servant, Tobias Iconius. </p>
      <p> I am sending the letters of Lord Campell, whose book I could not send earlier except through Lucius, who recently went there; reliable messengers are rarely available. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious and distinguished man in all kinds of virtue and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, supreme pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most faithful and venerable father. </p>
      <p> Zurich </p>
      <p> Baptism in Wjach. </p>
