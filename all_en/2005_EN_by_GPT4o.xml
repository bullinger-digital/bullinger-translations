      <p>Greetings. Since there is nothing that can be added to my previous letters regarding the secret plans of the Emperor's men, and the matter itself (as I see) is already known to everyone, I will be brief, as the importunity of these people affects me so much that I can attend to nothing else. I am deeply grieved that the state of our kingdom is so unfortunate that every day there are those who fall into the punishments established by the king's counselors. From England, it has been reliably reported to me that the Duke of Northumberland has suffered the penalty of death for the crime of attempted witchcraft, which I believe to be false.</p>
      <p>Nothing has yet been decided about religion; but the queen performs sacred rites according to the old ritual and openly declares that they are of great concern to her.</p>
      <p>From Scotland, a rumor has been heard (but it is very slight and without an author) that the son of the King of Scotland, born of a concubine, has wished to stir up some trouble. Our people have taken Corsica and are diligently fortifying several castles and strongholds. I hear that a one-month truce has been agreed upon in Piedmont. Here, prompted by Mr. Vergerio and others, I have diligently acted to prevent the papal legate from being allowed to converse with the common people or to be here under public faith. For I fear that if the people are divided into two factions, a greater tumult may be stirred up. But what does it benefit me or anyone else to take on this burden, when nothing sincere can be found anywhere? "Faith," (he says) "and piety are private goods; let kings go where they please." The King of Tunis is besieging Goletta; however, I think it cannot be conquered.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Chur, the day before the Ides of September 1553. Yours, Johannes Fraxineus, Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, dearest friend.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
