      <p>Greetings. At this hour, your and Gesner's letters, along with books, are being delivered to me and others, so it is not possible, as I wished, to respond to everything. The courier, about to depart for Frankfurt, did not want to wait a moment. I will ensure that everything is properly taken care of, and that the books and letters, to which they are addressed, are delivered. I give thanks for the booklets.</p>
      <p>I ask that you send the teacher at the earliest possible time. We desire the French apothecary; he will have a position worthy of him not only among the secular people, but he will also serve the hospital... which provides medicines to the citizen suffering from gout; he will find him wealthy, generous, and supportive. The position will not be assigned to anyone else, but will be reserved for his arrival.</p>
      <p>Oh good God, with what eagerness I have awaited your thoughts against the impious impanation; I will read them most diligently.</p>
      <p>The Bavarians, glory to God, have shaken off the papal yoke; communion under both kinds has been granted to the pressing nobles and subjects, freedom of food, and pious sermons not only by indulgence; but the Duke must write in the land book, and if the ordinary bishops of Salzburg, Eichstätt, Augsburg, Freising, etc., to whom the prince will write for consent, refuse, nevertheless the prince wishes to have the grants ratified. But it is not permitted to say more. I will soon send the acts of those Bavarian assemblies. Tell the same to our Gesner.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, March 29, in the year 56.</p>
      <p>Your Geryon.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of Zürich, most esteemed lord and brother. Zürich in Switzerland.</p>
