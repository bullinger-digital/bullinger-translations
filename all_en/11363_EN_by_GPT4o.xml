    <p xml:id="regest1">Sebastian [Meyer] and Peter [Kunz] have preached the substantial eating of the body of Christ to the point of excess - at least this is how Rümlang understands their talk of the true eating of the true body and Meyer's assertion of a threefold manner of Christ's presence. It disturbs the Bernese Lutherans that, according to the Bernese Agenda, the bread "signifies" the body, therefore they want to eliminate this formulation in the necessary new edition; however, Rümlang and others will not allow this. The Lutherans deny that their doctrine deviates from the [Bernese] Disputation, yet even if their figurative manner of speaking corresponds to the scripture, the interpretation of the figures is lacking. A delegation from the Zurich council should point out in Bern, in Bullinger's presence, that at least [the Swiss] should be united, if an agreement with Luther seems only possible at the expense of the truth, and demand a clear yes or no to their previous doctrine; why should the Zurichers not claim the same rights as the people of Strasbourg? Calvin teaches correctly in his "Institutio" [about the Lord's Supper], assuming a metonymy and seeming to criticize Luther; the Bernese Lutherans reproach him for this and consider Capito and Bucer to be insufficiently vigilant; Bullinger should maintain contact with Calvin. Greetings. Apologizes for his long and careless writing.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I would gladly, and even more gladly, wish to write to you, most learned man, things that are more pleasing and agreeable to you. However, I cannot refrain from informing you about what our local Lutherans are contemplating.</p>
      <p>In recent sermons, Sebastian [Meyer] and Peter [Kunz] have pushed us to the point of nausea with their talk of the substantial eating of the Lord's body (as I understood it: for they call this very eating the true eating of the true body of the Lord: they assert that the Lord is truly present, true God and man. And Sebastian posited a threefold presence of Christ: the operative presence of divinity in all things, visible and invisible, as it is in the supper). They still have something that seems to oppose their opinion, and therefore they want it corrected, I almost said corrupted, namely the booklet we call the Agenda, which is used in the solemnization of marriages, the baptism of children, and the celebration of the Lord's Supper. For this booklet contains in our language that the bread signifies the Lord's body, etc. Since they now teach things that disagree with this booklet, there are those who say that their doctrine does not agree much with the booklet they read in the communication of the Lord's body, and thus it is openly discovered that they deviate from the usual and customary way. When they understand this, they want the book renewed, and that word "signifies" removed. And since there is a great scarcity of these booklets in many parishes, there are those who demand that it be printed again. Which I also wish to be urged, and I will make an effort to have this booklet sought after, so that we may more quickly detect the cunning of our local Lutherans. You will see many good people interpose themselves so that they never obtain any change in the said booklet, and in the meantime, it will become clear that they have deviated from the disputation held here, which they always deny and almost consider us deaf, as if we do not understand their words and meaning, so that there is no need to argue with them about the words spoken in sermons. For they speak figuratively like the scripture, but they do not resolve the figure, and they assert that they speak in this way according to the scriptures, which is the safest way of teaching. Unless they desist from corrupting the booklet, you will see new disturbances arise among us. But I would finally wish for a delegation from your council to be sent to us, and that you would come with it, and propose that since you have taught thus and thus about the Lord's Supper, as the learned men who have fallen asleep in the Lord have maintained in the disputation, and we have always been unanimous in the responses to be given to Luther in the concluded assemblies, and that the business of concord, after many wasted expenses, does not seem to be brought to a healthy effect without offense and with truth preserved, and therefore we, who have received the cradles of evangelical freedom together and from the same teachers, should be united. And at the same time, if it were explained what your doctrine is in this matter, and then, since various rumors about the doctrine of this matter may perhaps be spread here and elsewhere, it would be fitting for us to think and speak the same: and therefore you would ask if there is anyone among us who would want to oppose this. If they said they would oppose, then it would become clear what they have hitherto concealed.</p>
      <p>If they did not want to oppose, then you would receive the opinion of the council, and in this way, the mouths of those malevolent people would be silenced. Why should you not have the same rights in our church as the people of Strasbourg, etc.?</p>
      <p>You deliberate on what seems beneficial, and consider my words kindly. Furthermore, know that Calvin has written excellently in his book on the Institution of the Christian Man, where he has now openly posited a metonymy.</p>
      <p>In the same place, he seems to criticize Luther, although not by name, which our local Lutherans find very hard to bear, and while they accuse Calvin, they also slander Capito and Bucer for having been asleep and not paying enough attention. But things are well. If you can, at any time, confirm Calvin with your writings: for he is not to be neglected. Farewell most happily. Please greet Leo, Theodor, and all the learned, and enroll me in the company of your friends. Excuse the prolixity and the careless writing, for as you see, I write negligently. In Bern, hastily, on the 20th day of October in the year 1539.</p>
      <p>Your Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
