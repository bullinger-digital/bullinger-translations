      <p>Response of the servants of the churches in Hesse regarding the Interim: The reason we cannot and will not accept the Interim is not due to any presumption or special affection, but solely because of the powerful sayings of Christ in Matthew 10: "Whoever acknowledges me before the world, I will also acknowledge before my heavenly Father;"</p>
      <p>Paul in Galatians: "Even if an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse;" John in his last epistle: "If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them, so that you do not share in their wicked work." If we must leave the land because of this confession, we have this comfort, as Psalm 23 says: "The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it." But if we must leave the world and lose our lives, we have this comfort from Christ, who says: "In my Father’s house are many mansions." If we remain steadfast, we will have to face men and devils; men die, devils will be condemned. If we fall away and deny the gospel, we will have God, all angels, and saints as eternal adversaries, from which may God graciously protect Your Princely Grace and all of us." This confession has been presented to the young Landgrave. May the Lord grant grace, heart, and courage to remain steadfast!</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, electors, princes, and their envoys have departed; but due to the illness of His Imperial Majesty, as is reported, he is still there, which is why His Royal Majesty, who was ready for all things, must also remain.</p>
