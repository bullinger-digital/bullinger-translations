      <p>Greetings. I am brief, because our Lord Lysman here will be in place of a very long letter. Nor is there a need for me to commend him to you, whom I understand to be very dear to you otherwise. He is of sound judgment: confirm him in sound doctrine and encourage him to offer his efforts to his fellow Poles. He will report more and certain things about Polish affairs.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most esteemed lord and brother, and never allow yourself to think that I love Calvin any less. ZÃ¼rich, December 4, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Johannes Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my most esteemed brother.</p>
