      <p>Greetings. Your letter about this Satanic Interim has caused me great sorrow, a sorrow that has grown daily with new rumors and reports. I know no more suitable remedy for these great evils that we see threatening our necks than true and sincere repentance and prayers that are not cold or feigned, but most fervent and genuine, to implore the mercy of God. And He, being most merciful, will by no means disregard the groans and tears of His people, but will turn all the evils that our enemy, who is also His enemy, threatens against us. I do not doubt that you, my dear Bullinger, are doing this and encouraging others to do so as part of your duty, but I write these things to you to kindle myself; for what else could I write at this time? But let us set these things aside. Augustinus Maynardus, a man not only learned but also holy, is now returning to you, so that you may commend his teaching to his church with your authority and testimony. For the people of Basel, as you will see, have subscribed, and I do not doubt that you will do the same. Nevertheless, I commend to you this holy old man, who has been known to me not only for many years but also as a friend, brother, and in the Lord, my father and fellow countryman, who does not hesitate to endure these labors for the safety and concord of his church at his age. There is one thing I did not want to keep from you, lest you wonder if you find one or two words in his confession that are not found in the one he left with you; for while we were reading it together, I advised him to add the words: "not, however, to confer the grace of God or the remission of sins," etc., where he speaks about the sacraments in general. I did this so that by this antithesis he might exclude those who hold contrary opinions. But he himself will explain this to you better.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and pray to God for us, and greet your holy family and all the brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>Basel, 17th of June, 1548.</p>
      <p>Coelius, yours from the heart, wrote this.</p>
      <p>To the most holy and illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed brother in the Lord. In Zürich.</p>
