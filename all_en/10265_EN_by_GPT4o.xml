    <p xml:id="regest1">According to Bullinger's wish, Myconius negotiated with the people of Basel and Bern. His proposals on the marriage issue: 1. More caution in marriages, 2. closer alignment with the Old Testament law on adultery, 3. the law on marriages contracted without trustworthy witnesses should be protected. Bartolomeo Fonzio in life-threatening danger. Pellican's illness, inquiry about his condition. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have diligently pursued what you recently entrusted to me, both with our people and with those in Bern. May God grant that we may someday live in more peaceful times.</p>
      <p>In the matter of marriage, I consider these two points not to be overlooked: First, because the bond of marriage is indissoluble, care must be taken not to enter into this bond too easily. You see, the reasons for marriages are almost never what they should be. One person looks to the flesh, another to wealth, someone else to something else, but no one considers the propagation of offspring and a life worthy of God. If this were the case, do you think disputes and adulteries would easily arise? Secondly, if we were closer to God's punishment in punishing adultery. He was altogether more prudent than to establish something here that is harsher than necessary. I will add one more thing: to prevent girls from being too wanton, the law on marriage entered into without proven witnesses should be more diligently defended. Indeed, I see that there are many good laws, but those who should enforce them are slower. I do not say this to teach, but to indicate what seems to me personally.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, letters have arrived these days from Strasbourg informing us that the Venetian is suffering greatly from a rupture and is in life-threatening danger. Therefore, we must pray to God to extend his life for His praise. This I share with you and yours, so that you may also mention him in your prayers for a pious and learned man. We have also heard about Pellican's illness, which is more serious than enough. For God's sake, please let us know how he is doing. I am indeed greatly distressed about the health of such a great man.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and may Utinger, Leo, Theodor, and all others fare well.</p>
      <p>Basel, the eighth of June in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed brother in the Lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
