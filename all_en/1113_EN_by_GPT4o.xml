      <p>Greetings. Your letters have been delivered to us, dearest and most revered lord and godfather, and we give you great thanks for your pious concern for us, especially also for those little gifts and presents sent to our children; may the Lord repay you and yours for everything!</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us now that I can write about, except that by the grace of the Lord, that plague which has been afflicting us has somewhat been lifted; for among many days no one has died except Mr. Georg zum Stein, but not from the plague. It is now right that we give thanks to the Lord and prepare ourselves to bear heavier burdens; for those whom the Lord wishes to be supplicants gain nothing but crosses, pains, and labors, which, as you rightly judge, if anything else, the council will bring upon us.</p>
      <p>However, we will try to dissipate it with prayer and supplications, since we have no more effective means against it. I am pleased with the steadfastness of the Archbishop of Cologne; may the Lord strengthen him! I am also pleased to hear that the mandates have been renewed in Z端rich and printed; it was not possible to have them published here.</p>
      <p>We are nevertheless pleased that this has been done in writing. I not only wish to see a copy of your mandates but also to have it; therefore, I ask you again and again to obtain it for me with my money and send it.</p>
      <p>Daniel Fl端eler, a learned young man of quite composed manners, is being sent in place of Salomon; I commend him to you. We hope that you will send yours to us in the future, after you have learned that the plague has subsided; for besides the fact that Musculus alone is worthy to be heard by many, I see that the youthful friendship contracted between the ministers of both churches will bring us much peace and convenience from both sides in the future. Farewell. December 17, 1550. All of mine greet you, and especially Elizabeth gives you and yours great thanks. Also, greet all the brothers from me, Mr. Pellican, Gwalther, Theodor, and both sons-in-law, to whom I write less often as I write to you more frequently. In Bern. I sent the letters directed to Calvin to him two days ago.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Z端rich church, his lord and revered godfather.</p>
      <p>In Z端rich.</p>
