      <p>Caelius S[ecundus] C[urio]. Sends greetings through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>You excuse yourself, most excellent and dearest Bullinger, for not being able to write to me for a long time due to your occupations; but I neither accused nor do I accuse you, knowing how many cares of the mind and how many troubles and labors you are involved in during these most perilous times. This was also the reason why I myself have not dared to send you letters for a long time, fearing, of course, that I might be an importunate and untimely interrupter in this tempest, which otherwise I would have done most willingly. But you have compensated for your silence with a golden gift, as is your loving nature, and you wanted the pretext of your love to be a New Year's gift, for which I thank you, both in my name and in the name of my wife and our children, and I shall give thanks as long as I live, since you daily heap gifts upon gifts, so that a bond is added to a bond in my accounts. But what can I do in return for you? Indeed, I have nothing equal to your merits towards us that I can send as a gift to you and your family. Therefore, I send what I have learned from your letters pleases you, which I would have sent before, had not a certain shame prevented me, as if I wanted to teach Minerva, as it is said. Now, however, almost invited and admonished by you to do so, I send it more freely. But if it seems an improper and shameless act, you are the cause, who praised it, who sent a friend's gift.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I send it so that, if you judge it to be in their interest, your most delightful sons may enjoy this little gift along with mine; if not, whatever you judge with your wisdom, I will consider it valid and pleasing. But enough of this.</p>
      <p>The young men you commend to me are and will be most dear to me, and as you wish, I will diligently inquire about the progress of their studies with paternal care and benevolence.</p>
      <p>Regarding new matters, I would have wished that you, who sit at the helm, from where you can see and hear much, had written something to me, especially about that council you write about and the response of both your and the Bernese delegation to it; if you do so, it will be greatly pleasing to me. I have nothing new. We pray to the heavenly Father to illuminate His Son and protect us from wolves and dogs and bring about the true concord of the church. Greet your wife, a most holy woman, and your most delightful children in the name of my wife, my children, and myself, for whom we pray for all good things. Greet those friends and my most upright brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>M. Cellarius sends you greetings in his name. Farewell, my most esteemed and sweetest Bullinger, and if you can, write more often.</p>
      <p>Basel, the 20th of January, 1549.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, most holy, most learned, and most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, a singular and most esteemed friend. In Zürich.</p>
