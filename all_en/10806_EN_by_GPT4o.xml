    <p xml:id="regest1">As agreed, they [with the Zurich pastors] have deliberated on [the First Helvetic Confession]; they agree with it in principle but propose some clarifications, specifically on the articles concerning the teachings of men, the purpose of the Holy Scripture, God, redemption, the Church, the ministers of the Word, the sacraments, the Lord's Supper, and the adiaphora. Furthermore, it should be noted that these articles are not intended as a binding rule of faith, but that the Bible must be the sole guideline, although other expressions are gladly tolerated; the rejection of distorting interpretations remains reserved. Grynaeus and Myconius are to align the Latin version of the confession with the German translation [by Leo Jud].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Since we, beloved brothers, parted from one another with the agreement that each minister of the Word should confer and deliberate with the other brothers at home about the established articles, whether anything should be added or removed from them, we have discussed this thoroughly with our own and find it necessary that we cannot currently remove or add anything to the established articles; however, we have wanted the following articles to be better elucidated and improved in this manner:</p>
      <p>1. On human teachings: Whatever other human teachings and ordinances there are, no matter how beautiful, charming, and respectable (noteworthy) and long used they may be, if they lead us away from God and true faith or hinder us, we consider them vain, harmful, etc.</p>
      <p>2. What the purpose of the Holy Scripture is, etc.: The entire biblical scripture aims solely at making the human race understand that God is gracious to them and well-disposed, and that He has publicly demonstrated and proven this goodwill through Christ, His Son, to the entire human race, which, however, is received only through faith, which is practiced through love towards one's neighbor and demonstrated and proven through an innocent life.</p>
      <p>3. About God: We hold that there is one true, living, and almighty God, one in essence, triune in persons, who created all things through His Word, that is, through His Son, out of nothing and sustains all things through His Spirit, who governs and administers everything justly, truly, and wisely (wisely) through His providence.</p>
      <p>4. How God, through His eternal counsel, etc.: Although man, through his own fault and transgression, is subject to eternal damnation and has fallen into the righteous wrath of God, God, the gracious Father, has never ceased to care for him, which we learn from the first promises and from the entire law (which, as it is holy and good, teaches us the will, righteousness, and truth of God, thus it awakens our sin and works wrath, but does not abolish it, not out of its own impotence, but out of our own fault) and from the Lord Christ, who is appointed for this, etc.</p>
      <p>5. About the Church: And although this assembly and church of Christ is only open and known to the eyes of God, it is nevertheless seen and recognized through external signs, customs, and order, which are instituted and ordained by Christ Himself, and through the Word of God as through a common (general), open, and orderly discipline, not only seen and recognized, but also gathered and built in such a way that in this church no one, to speak properly, as far as our judgment is concerned, and without special arrangement (order) or order and freedom, opened and practiced by God, is counted without these things.</p>
      <p>6. About the ministers of the Word of God and etc.: Yet with this addition and understanding, that we attribute all effect and power to the Lord God alone, but the service to the minister. For it is certain that this power and effect should never be attributed to any creature, but to God, who distributes it according to His free will, as and to whom He wills. For "neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but God who gives the growth" [1 Cor 3:7].</p>
      <p>7. About the power, strength, and effect, etc.: The signs, which are called sacraments in the holy Christian church, are two, namely baptism and the Lord's Supper. These sacraments are significant, holy signs of high and secret, that is, divine and spiritual things, whose names they also bear; but they are not mere and empty signs, but they consist in signs, etc.</p>
      <p>8. About the Lord's Supper or thanksgiving, etc.: We hold about the holy supper that the Lord in the holy supper truly offers His body and blood, that is, Himself, to His own and gives them to partake of such fruit, that He may live more and more in them and they in Him; not that the body and blood of the Lord are naturally united with bread and wine or spatially enclosed therein, or that a bodily, fleshly, or miraculous presence is set here, but that the body and blood of Christ are truly eaten and drunk in faith by the believing soul and that bread and wine, by the institution of the Lord, are highly significant, holy signs, etc.</p>
      <p>9. The article on indifferent things can be more appropriately placed at the beginning as follows: All things that are called indifferent and are also truly indifferent, a pious believer may, etc.</p>
      <p>At the end of all articles, which have been well discussed, though not written down, we desire that it now be added henceforth in the following or similar form:</p>
      <p>10. These articles of the written confession are not established by us with the intention that they should be a sole (only, single) and general Christian form and rule of faith for all other churches, or that we wish to compel anyone in words and to force them into a particular way of speaking about matters of faith, but we confess before us and acknowledge the holy biblical scripture as the sole and general standard of all churches. So we can also well tolerate if anyone, in accordance with the holy scripture, writes or teaches about all these matters with other words, than those we have used here, more understandably and more usefully for the churches. As long as such a one holds with us in the substance and written truth, we are well content with him.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if anyone were to falsify our confession through misunderstanding of the words and draw them to an erroneous, false opinion against their ability and sound understanding, we always reserve the right to clarify and present the sound understanding, so that God and His truth may always prevail in everything.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is our earnest request and desire that Dr. Simon Grynaeus and Dr. Oswald Myconius complete and compare the Latin articles with the German ones, so that they are entirely alike.</p>
      <p>May God protect you always.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, March 22, in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>Leo Jud and Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious, faithful, and well-learned Oswald Myconius and Simon Grynaeus, our dear lords and brothers in Basel.</p>
      <p>Please send this copy back to us, if it is convenient, or let us now copy the first draft that lies before these articles.</p>
