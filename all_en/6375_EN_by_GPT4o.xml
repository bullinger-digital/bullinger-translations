      <p>I instructed our interpreter to visit you, most learned Bullinger, and to convey my warmest greetings in my words. I also entrusted him to share with you, as he was always present, the full details of what was done in Lucerne in the name of the bishop with the Seven Cantons, who were convened to strike some alliance. Regarding the Swabian and Danish war, I had learned shortly before receiving your letters what had been done by both armies, though not as precisely as you write. There is nothing new with us; everything is calm and quiet.</p>
      <p>If anything happens that you judge worthy for me to know, I ask you to write, and I will compensate the effort of a most worthy man, as you are, with some honest reward.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Solothurn, on the eighth day of the month of February, 1565.</p>
      <p>Most devotedly yours forever, Cruxceus. To the most distinguished and learned man, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Z...? (Nicolas de la Croix, Sr. de Nogent, Abbot of Orbais.)</p>
