      <p>The calamity of the people of Lucerne afflicts me beyond measure, not only on account of the most pious brothers themselves, whom I see being subjected to torture, but also because of the cooling zeal for the house of the Lord in others, for I see even the best of them so disposed that they consider it better to risk anything rather than the glory of Christ, while the adversaries, incited by their own zeal, decide to endure the utmost rather than to yield even a hair's breadth from their customary assault against true religion. Since these things are so, I see no counsel except that the present hand of the Lord should shine forth from the machine, by which His servants may be sustained and strengthened. Therefore, let us sigh incessantly to Him with pious groans together with our churches. I greatly regret that Caelius (Caelium) has followed his own counsel rather than yours, ours, and that of other good men, and I wonder where he published that book, since it was not permitted to be published here. Would that they would rather apply their talents to edification than to destruction.</p>
      <p>The brothers in Strasbourg (Argentinenses) have not yet received a response from the senate, but they are likely to have one soon, which Marbach (Marpachius) indeed hopes (as he indicates to me) will be such that, even if they do not obtain all they wish, yet the most important points will be granted, which will have some weight in the demolition of the papacy.</p>
      <p>However the whole matter turns out, they will act in such a way that they do not seem to have harmed the church more through imprudent and untimely zeal than they have brought benefit. These few things for the present, because I could not write more. Therefore, farewell, most distinguished man. Basel, October 30, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
