    <p xml:id="regest1">Advocated with Luther and his followers for a good reception of their letter, both in writing with the Strasbourg preachers and orally at the meeting in Schmalkalden. Since Luther was occupied with the council issue and also fell ill, he could not yet deal with it in detail. Following the order of the Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony, Bucer followed Luther to Gotha with Bonifacius Wolfhart, where, due to his ailment, Luther could not negotiate but could speak to them. He assured them of his willingness for a concord based on the Word of God and referred to his letter to [Jakob Meyer]; he also urged them not to burden the people with unnecessary disputes and promised to contribute if God kept him alive. He was only concerned with the presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, not with its manner; he himself could tolerate different expressions but did not have control over the opinions of others. The doctrine that only bread and wine are present in the Lord's Supper excludes a concord; even if it is difficult to move away from it, the impression should not arise that he had agreed to it or taught wrongly before. If it is acknowledged that the body and blood of the Lord are truly received, he is willing to remain silent in the future; they no longer speak of "enthusiasts," although the Upper Germans have reopened wounds through publications. Otherwise, he can only commend the desired concord to God. While Luther spoke, Friedrich Myconius and at the end also [Bugenhagen] were present. Bucer replied that the Upper Germans and [Confederates] taught the true reception of the body and blood of Christ but wanted to exclude that Christ is made into a stomach food and the reception of the sacrament is separated from faith. Due to Luther's condition, they were content with the agreement to inform them of this discussion, and Luther promised to write himself later if possible; the Elector commissioned Philipp [Melanchthon] to draft the enclosed letter, which explains the delay. Since the Strasbourg people feel particularly obliged to the unity of the churches, Bucer once again sets out the requirements for a lasting concord. Firstly, the doctrine that nothing but bread and wine is received must be explicitly condemned; instead, it must be taught with Paul that the communion of the body and blood of Christ is received in the sacrament. Secondly, the distinction from false opinions must not be made in such a way that Luther's doctrine is brought into suspicion. Thirdly, the past must be left to rest instead of justifying oneself with unnecessary books. Although Luther has not yet commented on their letter, the princes and estates are suspicious because of the reservations made therein, which should have been resolved with the explanation of the concord given by Capito and Bucer. Both parties still suspect each other, with the concerns of the Wittenbergers being limited to the doctrine of the Lord's Supper. Since an Upper German synod - despite the example of the ancient church and the wish of Oecolampadius and Zwingli - has not yet come about, the other side desires a concise, clear agreement without wanting to restrict the freedom of proclamation. Bucer urges, also on behalf of the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse], to do everything to remedy the offensive division. He asks to receive all this in the spirit of the unity of Christ.</p>

      <p>To the pious, noble, strict, steadfast, honorable, wise, dignified, highly and well-learned, faithful lords and co-workers in the holy Gospel, mayors, bailiffs, and councils, teachers, preachers, and pastors of the cities and churches of Zurich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, Mulhouse, and BÃ¼lach, my gracious lords and dear brothers.</p>
      <p>Noble, strict, honorable, prudent, respectable, wise, also dignified, highly and well-learned, gracious dear lords, brothers, and fellow servants in the holy Gospel.</p>
      <p>I wish your magnificence and love an increase of divine grace, offering my humble services and prayers beforehand.</p>
      <p>As I promised your magnificence and love on the last day in Basel, held for the sake of Christian concord, at your request, and because I am inclined to do so from the heart, that I, together with my dear brothers and fellow servants in the word in Strasbourg, would diligently strive in writings and otherwise, as the Lord would always provide the opportunity, to send your report on the service of God's word and the two holy sacraments, which was set on that same day, to the worthy and highly learned Dr. Luther, so that it would be best understood and received by him, Dr. Luther, and all preachers and superiors who hold with Dr. Luther, and that the concord of the churches would once be established and endure. We, the preachers here, have done this in writings from here, and I also orally in Schmalkalden with many faithful. But when your and our writings were first handed over to Dr. Luther in Schmalkalden (for when your and our lords' messenger came to Wittenberg, he had already traveled to Schmalkalden), and Dr. Luther was initially burdened with the common affairs of the council and was so severely attacked by the stone in those same affairs that he had to be taken away from there, it was not possible for him to thoroughly consider either your report or our writings, nor to receive any further oral report from me, as he would otherwise have been quite willing to do, and had also promised to do so to the noble, steadfast, and prudent, your worships, Mr. Jacob Sturm and Mr. Matthias, pastor, my gracious lords' envoys, who had also urged him to do so and had promised me quite amicably more than once to do so.</p>
      <p>However, as the Christian princes and estates would all very much like to see the concord of the churches well established everywhere and a true understanding of the divine word fully exist, I, by order of my most gracious lord, the Elector of Saxony, followed Dr. Luther when he had him taken from Schmalkalden to Gotha; for the Lord had granted him that the urine, which had been blocked for ten days, flowed again the first night after he was taken from Schmalkalden. Therefore, the Elector and we all had hope that he would be so capable that he could hear, consider, and finally give an answer to all matters. But when I came to him in Gotha, he had a severe relapse that same night, and the urine was blocked again, for the stones had not yet passed. It was only over three days later that he was relieved of them. Therefore, he had to let me go without any final negotiation, which he greatly regretted. However, he did speak to Master Bonifacius Wolfhart, preacher in Augsburg, who had ridden with me, and to me in a very fatherly Christian speech and exhortation, in summary, approximately as follows: First, he said, I ask you to believe me that I sincerely desire the concord that truly exists in the word of God and am willing to do and suffer everything to promote it that I can do and suffer with God. But now, that it is not possible for me to thoroughly and finally handle these so great and important matters this time, you see for yourselves. Therefore, I ask my dear lords in the Upper German churches, the superiors and preachers, to faithfully show them my goodwill and friendly disposition towards them, along with this my inability, as you see it, and to say my humble Our Father, for I see well that they also mean well. If God helps me up again, I will write to them myself in a friendly manner, as I have done to the mayor in Basel. Then he began again and said, I ask you to ask and exhort the preachers on my behalf, and you yourselves also be exhorted and asked, that you all consider well what great and heavy burden the Lord has laid upon you, whom he has set as servants over so many and great churches, so that you do not burden the poor, simple people with any high or subtle, much less with vain disputations, for they cannot grasp it, and it goes, as they say, when they sometimes praise the preachers highly, saying: "Oh, how well the preacher has preached," and when they are asked, "What did he say," they then answer: "I do not know." One must truly teach the poor people always and in the simplest way, so that they rightly recognize our Lord Jesus Christ and hold firmly to him with true faith. It is over with me, for even if God helps me up this time, I have no strength left. Yet, if the Lord wants to use me longer, I will faithfully render my service to you all. If God then gives me rest, you all let yourselves be commended to his dear churches with all earnestness. Satan will not cease, you will always have many offenses and hindrances.</p>
      <p>Regarding the holy sacrament, you have long enough known what my faith and position is. It has never been about the manner and measure of the presence and reception of the body and blood of Christ, our Lord, in the holy supper, but about the presence and reception in itself. And although I would be willing to be at peace with many expressions that can be used on your part, as I can then have more good than some others, yes, I can endure more than many, as you know, yet I do not have the others in my hand, who also have great churches, whom God has also gloriously used for his kingdom. If it were to be the opinion that one has only bread and wine present in the supper and the mind is only reminded of Christ, who is perhaps far away in heaven at one place, then it is no concord, for we hold it differently, as I have told you in Wittenberg and also said enough before, and also testified abundantly in my writings. But I can well see, where the matter is driven so hard, that one receives only bread and wine in the holy supper and the true giving, receiving, and communion of the body and blood of Christ with the sign of bread and wine is not laid, that it cannot be turned so soon and easily. One must deal with the people gently. Yet we cannot suffer that it should be said that one is of such an opinion, who holds that in the holy supper nothing but bread and wine is given and received, with us as one. For that would give us as if we had also fallen into such an opinion. Nor can we suffer that it should be imputed to us as if we had contended for such a fleshly and spatial presence of Christ in the holy supper, which even the papists do not want to set. From which it would follow that the Lord should be drawn from his heavenly glory back into this worldly and earthly doing in any way, or that something should be denied him in his true human nature or also in the office of redemption, from which he works our salvation in all and completely. If it is recognized that in the holy supper the body and blood of the Lord are truly received, then let it be taught simply and faithfully and let it be as it is. One has been sharp enough on both sides, and I especially. But one no longer thinks of this in our churches. And although some books have come out from the Upper Germans that serve ill for concord and reopen old wounds, yet we keep quiet on our part, and one no longer hears the word "enthusiast" or the like with us. So it would be good that one also on your part neither with writings nor otherwise, what has passed, reopens and refreshes old wounds. But if it should still be the opinion that one receives only bread and wine in the holy supper and not also truly the body and blood of the Lord, then let the matters stand as they are until God improves it, and do not take on any concord, which is not there. It is not to be trifled with in these divine matters. How I would die with such great joy if I could see the churches truly united, and especially at this time, when the wretched Antichrist is so bursting and so shamelessly defying our Lord and his dear word. But it is the Lord's doing, to whom we must commend it with faithful prayer, that I do and will do with all faithfulness; I hope you will do it too. This is approximately the content of the speech that Dr. Luther made to us two, Master Bonifacius of Augsburg and me, in the presence of his Master Friedrich Myconius, pastor in Gotha, at the end Dr. Pomer was also there. He also made this speech truly with great earnestness and great effort, for he was very weak, as he then also expected more to die than to recover at that time.</p>
      <p>To such a speech I answered that not only we two, but also all good-hearted among us did not doubt that he sincerely desired the true concord. But we could also truly perceive nothing else in the minds of the superiors and preachers in the Upper German churches in general than that they also sought such concord with all earnestness. The preachers with whom we dealt in Basel on the two days also let it be known as those who truly hold that in the holy supper not only bread and wine, but also truly the body and blood of Christ are received. And what they say about the eating of the mind and through faith, also about that Christ the Lord remains in heaven and does not dwell in this world and the like in their writings, that they do not at all want to separate the true presence and enjoyment of Christ from the holy supper and the holy signs, so that the holy signs should not be specially ordained and serve for this, and there the true communion of the body and blood of Christ is truly given and received, but only intended to prevent that no one from the simple or also maliciously accuses them as if they wanted to draw Christ, our Lord, who holds himself eternally in heavenly glory and incorruptibility, back into this corruptible being and make him into a stomach food in that they unite him with bread and wine in such a way, enclose or attach him, that people could reach, grasp, or perceive him, the Lord of glory himself, otherwise than with the believing mind. Also, they wanted to prevent that no one would consider the reception of the holy sacrament without the right faith as salutary, as the people in the papacy publicly do. In this, the man was so weak that we could not trouble him any longer, yet we waited that night and the next morning until noon to see if it would get better. But the time was not yet, so he made the farewell the next day with us, that we should faithfully show his previous exhortation and request along with his prayer to the superiors and preachers in the Upper German churches. If the Lord helps him up again, he would also write to them himself, as he promised the day before. And whatever he could help to promote true concord, he would not let it be lacking by him. Thus we, Master Bonifacius and I, parted from Dr. Luther in Gotha and came back to Schmalkalden, where the daily service in Schmalkalden came to an end. But since the Elector, together with other Christian princes and estates, would always like the goodwill and concord begun to be maintained and brought forward, and there was no hope anymore that Dr. Luther could give a final answer at this time, the Elector commissioned Master Philipp to write to your magnificence and love and to show you briefly what the matter had brought about this time, of which I hereby send your magnificence and love the letter.</p>
      <p>In this way, it has happened and still stands with your writings to Dr. Luther and the matter of concord.</p>
      <p>Now, pious, Christian, dear lords and brothers, since you have found us preachers in Strasbourg so far in this matter as those who would have gladly worked so much that the Lord would have used our work to unite the other churches that have the holy Gospel with us completely with yours, and you have desired of us that we, according to your understanding, also your consideration, what may be taught to yours with improvement or without offense in these matters, well understood, should negotiate faithfully to a true, lasting agreement and peace, we have also truly done this with utmost faithfulness, wherever it was possible for us to do so, I cannot refrain from showing your magnificence and love here once again, what the matter stands on and will depend on, if a complete and lasting concord of the churches is to be and remain on both sides, as we have sufficiently heard and experienced before and now. And indeed, in Basel on the two days, we have shown and testified to your envoys very clearly and faithfully several times. From this, your magnificence and love will all the better see and understand what you will further undertake and do to promote concord. But there are three points on which (as far as we can see) the concord will finally stand, and without which we cannot hope that it will ever be rightly established or stand. The first will be that your preachers, our dear brothers, once simply and clearly condemn as an error that in the holy supper nothing but bread and wine is received, as the Anabaptists almost all and otherwise also people hold, and instead faithfully teach that in the holy supper, as one holds it according to the Lord's institution, with the signs of bread and wine, one also truly receives the body and blood of the Lord. As for the words "essentially," "bodily," and the like, it will not be necessary, if only it is held in truth and taught faithfully, that when the sacrament is held according to the Lord's institution and believed in him, that there the bread we break is a true communion of the body of Christ, and the cup by which we give thanks is a true communion of the blood of Christ, as the holy Paul says from the Lord's words. That is, that a whole sacrament is held, recognized, and taught, and not only the signs of bread and wine, by which one only remembers the absent Christ in heaven as one does not receive or have him there. And this is indeed the main point in this matter, on which the concord entirely depends. If we believe and hold that we truly receive, have, and enjoy Christ here in the holy supper with the holy signs, and he is with and in us, that we also confess the same purely and teach it faithfully and do not separate the communion of the body and blood from the sacrament, although we also receive and have the communion of Christ not only in the holy supper, but also in other ways, such as through the word and baptism.</p>
      <p>Secondly, it will be necessary for true and full concord that your preachers, our dear brothers, exclude and prevent among their own, as well as they can or think it better, all these abominations, that Christ should be drawn from his heavenly, eternal glorious being back into the earthly, perishable and made into a stomach food with bread and wine naturally mixed or enclosed in it, or that the true nature of the human body in him is in any way injured or diminished, or that the holy sacraments are held as salutary without true faith, yet in such a way that they do not in any way, neither with words nor writings, cast suspicion on Dr. Luther and the churches that are of his part, as if they had taught or still teach such blasphemous presence and reception of Christ in the holy supper, from which such abominations would follow, that the Lord should be deprived of his human nature, his heavenly glory, and his office and work, for his office and work is that he alone and completely works and accomplishes our salvation and that which he truly gives us to believe in him, although he uses the words and signs and their dispensers against us for this. Dr. Luther and the others in these churches say that one finds in their books that they have also fought against such abominations before us most vehemently and still fight against them. Therefore, it is quite unfair to them that we would make them suspect of it, it would also not be tolerable for them because of their service in the word of God. But they are drawn into such heavy suspicion when we against them and against the presence of Christ, which they set, want to exclude and prevent such abominations so manifoldly and anxiously, as they mean, in your report to Dr. Luther.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, it will also be required that one completely on both sides let go of what is past, think as little as possible of the held dispute, nor of all that has happened in the dispute, whether it be words or writings. For however one does it, if one reopens the dispute and what has been spoken or written in it, as has happened so far, and especially with unnecessary printing of some books, it will be too close to the other side or both sides, diminish the doctrine of Christ and the reputation and injure many people. Dr. Luther and indeed the sensible preachers and lords all thought, if one let go of what is past and did not always embellish and defend each side much, but taught faithfully on both sides what is God's in these and other points of Christian doctrine, then all offenses along with the quarrel would eat themselves up and the concord would strengthen itself in such a way that no one would desire much further defense. On these three points, the concord will stand, as far as not only I, but all who can see, who would like to see the concord promoted and also know how it stands afterwards. Your report, since it has not yet been able to be thoroughly considered by Dr. Luther, and yet on this one sees much among the princes and estates, that your magnificence and love also, if you recognize this man rightly, would not consider it so unjustly, I cannot finally inform your magnificence and love after the time, how your writing pleases everyone of this part. Yet if I should write to you what has been said about it by some princes and learned men, some of this part are still offended by the fact that, as often as something is set in your report about the true presence of Christ in the holy supper, it is always immediately attached that the body of Christ is not essentially received, remains in heaven, is enjoyed only by the mind, and the like. For from such an attachment, it is thought and spoken of this part. What need is there against us of this so much and so often repeated exclusion and prevention? Either they still shy away from simply confessing that we truly receive the body and blood of Christ in the holy supper, or they attribute to us that we set such a blasphemous presence that does not allow our Lord Jesus to be a true man or in heaven or Christ the only savior. For if they were only concerned that these godless consequences should not be introduced, and they did not attribute them to us, they would not need this anxious prevention of such consequences against us. Namely, if not only we in our writings, but also Capito and Bucer in the explanation of the Wittenberg Articles, which they have done with them and sent to us themselves, have sufficiently testified to them that we do not set such a blasphemous presence from which these abominations might follow. As then Capito and Bucer have also abundantly excluded these terrible consequences in the same their explanation, that it would not need further exclusion against anyone, not only against us.</p>
      <p>For, gracious dear lords and brothers, as we have not been able to maintain this in your churches so far with very many, that on Dr. Luther's part a whole simple presence of Christ is set, as the words of the Lord and the holy Paul actually and completely have power and also express, which leaves Christ his true body, his heavenly glory, and his work of salvation completely and unshaken, and everywhere introduces nothing inappropriate. And what they have written or said or still write and say about the bodily and oral reception and eating of Christ in the sacrament, that they understand it no differently than the understanding is, as the scripture says, that John saw the holy spirit in the form of a dove or the other holy fathers saw the angels in the form of flames of fire, which yet bodily could not have seen more than the visible forms. As also to Christ, our Lord, in the holy supper, neither our senses nor reason reach, although from all holy fathers, with whom Dr. Oecolampadius liked to hold and speak, also Master Ulrich blessed never condemned, it is given to the body of the Lord, that happens to the bread for the sake of the sacramental unity. Just so it will not be so soon recognized by all of this part that one recognizes a true presence of Christ in the holy supper with you, but suspect, as one would not want to let the supper be anything more than a remembrance of the absence of Christ. They also consider that they have such suspicion against yours from previous writings and speeches, partly also from speeches and writings that have been practiced and issued since the concord was negotiated with you, no less cause than yours against them, to attribute to them such a coarse unseemly presence and enjoyment of Christ, which even the school teachers have not wanted to set. As for the other points, of which you make mention in your report, such as the service of God's word and baptism, I have not noticed that anyone had any particular lack, only of the holy supper, of which then also the greatest dispute has been, your report has not wanted to satisfy everyone, as I then had to take care beforehand, that I also expressly testified to your envoys in Basel on the last day.</p>
      <p>But since, pious, Christian dear lords and brothers, the matters stand as they do, that unfortunately from the long-lasting dispute the understanding on both sides has come so far apart, and the Lord has not yet given that we preachers in these Upper German churches have properly and in whole synods sought, considered, and discussed this matter, as the old holy fathers and church servants used to lay aside such disputes, hold their synods and therein with good time and earnestly negotiate (which diligence indeed our dear Lord and Father blessed Dr. Oecolampadius would have gladly brought back into practice among the Upper German churches, which Master Ulrich Zwingli blessed would have gladly helped him with, of which Dr. Capito and I have reminded your magnificence and love several times. So the eminent of the truly God-fearing and understanding princes and preachers consider it very useful that one, if at all possible, with a short, clear report, understand each other of the same understanding and do not repeat everything so far, nor seek, as the learned and understanding negotiate against each other and it is always free for everyone to give all the truth of Christ to their own in the most appropriate way, so that it is prevented for the best on all sides that no error or offense is introduced or moved. Yet as I have mentioned before, the foundation of concord will always be what I have mentioned before in the three points.</p>
      <p>So now your magnificence and love, as they are Christians and know the nature of Christianity, recognize how highly it should concern us all that we, who the Lord has endowed with his holy Gospel, are once all of one mind and speak in all things. Also, what unspeakable offense it brings not only among other nations, but also among ourselves, that we have not been able to come to any place with our disunity in so many years, which we nevertheless give ourselves to all parts as those who adhere to and follow the only clear word of God alone, so can also freely either part of the other agree to unity and agreement without heavy contempt of Christ or despise. Since indeed this your magnificence and love undoubtedly recognize and consider well, it is the hope of all good-hearted and also the request of the eminent princes and other superiors together with the preachers who were together in Schmalkalden, Christian request. And in particular, the illustrious Christian prince, my gracious lord, the Landgrave, has commanded me with special earnestness to faithfully show your magnificence and love in this sense, your magnificence and love would faithfully commend all this so great and important matter of the concord of the churches, which the Lord has now brought so far out of special grace, to them and be concerned about it and all that is in this matter, hangs on it and can follow from it, with true Christian patience and true zeal, as a matter of God, and in which the congregations of Christ are highly concerned, think about it, and if it should not yet be possible to bring the concord further at this time, that you nevertheless take to heart the goodwill and faithfulness of the Christian princes and estates towards you, which you nevertheless feel well, so much to heart and meet them so friendly that everyone among you would like to refrain from everything that might awaken the old dispute again, whether it be words or writings. And if Dr. Luther writes to your magnificence and love, that you interpret it in the kindest way and, whatever the Lord would then give, that you could further negotiate and undertake this so holy and necessary work of the Lord, the concord, that you would conduct yourselves in it as much as possible, so that all God-fearing people might see how the need and improvement of the churches of Christ, which without that suffer so many offenses and scandals, truly concerns and is important to you. May the dear God then also grant us in this article of the sacrament to agree completely together, as he has otherwise given us unity in his doctrine (to him be eternal praise), we could indeed serve the Lord not only among us, but also among other nations, whether there would be a council or not, and if there would be a council, let the Antichrists do what they please, very fruitfully for the expansion of his kingdom, for which we daily pray above all things and therefore should direct, do, and suffer everything for it that we can ever do and suffer, in which our names and what concerns us are not considered at all. The Lord has bought us for himself through his holy blood, therefore we should live and die for him alone, do and leave everything. I ask through our Lord Jesus Christ, your magnificence and love would receive all this negotiation for the concord of the pious Christian princes, estates, preachers, and also my humble small service to serve and report to you in a Christian manner and accept, as in all this truly only that is seen, to which we should all faithfully see and work, that we all, who call upon the name of Christ and boast of his spirit, are one in him in all things and act in highest unity to his praise. May the Lord give us all to work fruitfully towards this and to attain true unity in him, also preserve your magnificence and love in all things to eternal salvation, in which they want to let me be commended to them. Given in Strasbourg on the 1st day of April in the year 1537. Your magnificence and love's willing servant Martin Bucer serves the church in Strasbourg.</p>
