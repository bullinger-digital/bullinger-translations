      <p>After I concluded the letter, it comes to me that the evangelicals have also conquered the citadel or fortress at Metz by force.</p>
      <p>Also, that the one from Moëns has a large force at Vienna, both cavalry and infantry. There are supposed to be about 9000 Gascons with him; they intend to attack the Confederates, who are now marching there.</p>
      <p>Those in Lyon dare not come out more than the others, and the situation in Dauphiné, Provence, and Languedoc... the whole of Narbonensian Gaul is going very well.</p>
